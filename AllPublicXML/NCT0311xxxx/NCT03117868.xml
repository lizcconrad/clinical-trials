  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the upper femur (EFSF) represent a major public health problem in the elderly.
      Approximately 1.6 million patients are victims each year of an EFSF and this number is
      increasing as a result of the aging of the population.

      In a recent Amiens retrospective study the mortality was estimated to be 22.5% at 1 year of
      the fracture. In surviving patients, the impact on loss of autonomy and degradation of
      quality of life is considerable.

      The reduction of the incidence of post-operative complications includes the identification of
      risk factors.

      No prospective study in Amiens has investigated the mortality and the study of the variables
      involved in the prognosis and long-term mortality of these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All the patients operated from a fracture of traumatic origin of the ESF to the
             emergency block at the CHU of Amiens

          -  Patients transferred to the CHU after being cared for in another structure will be
             included.

          -  If a patient successively presents a fracture of each upper extremity of the femur
             outside of a surgical resumption, two inclusions will be realized

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Do not include non-traumatic fractures of the upper end of the femur (pathological
             fractures: cancer, for example)

          -  Fractures of the upper end of the femur associated with polytrauma will not be
             included.
