  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autonomic disfunction present in metabolic syndrome subjects is related by a greater
      vulnerability of the heart and risk of cardiovascular events. In this context, aerobic
      interval training has been highlighted by its easy applicability and benefits effects in
      autonomic modulation in different populations. Therefore the studies that use de aerobic
      interval training in this different populations didn't realize a periodization of training
      with preparatory periods with progressive increase of load, specific phases with less
      duration predominating the intensity and transition periods for recuperation. Additionally,
      there isn't studies that investigate the effects of aerobic interval training in autonomic
      modulation of individuals with metabolic syndrome. In this context, periodized aerobic
      interval training can arise like a new type of treatment that offering security and efficacy
      in subjects with metabolic syndrome. So, the aim of the study is evaluate the effect of
      periodized aerobic interval training in cardiac autonomic modulation and cardiovascular and
      anthropometric parameters of individuals with metabolic syndrome.
