  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobilisation following knee arthroplasty is an important aspect to achieve early and enhanced
      recovery after surgery and sufficient joint function. Analgesia is a crucial therapeutic
      element in this context. This RCT evaluates two analgetic regimens for patients undergoing
      primary total knee-replacement to assess impact on postoperative recovery.

      Mobilisation following knee arthroplasty is important for patients to achieve early and
      enhanced recovery after surgery and sufficient joint function. Analgesia is a crucial
      therapeutic element in this context. There is evidence that regional- anaesthesiological
      catheter techniques are very efficient to control pain postoperatively. On the other hand,
      motoric function may be reduced due to nerve blocks depending on location and concentration
      of drug used. Local infiltration of the knee during surgery is an alternative component in
      pain management that may reduce impaired motor function and allow early mobilisation of
      patients. However, currently it is not known which analgesia technique provides optimal pain
      control paralleled with sufficient motor function. Against this background, this RCT
      evaluates two analgesia regimens for patients undergoing primary total knee-replacement to
      assess impact on postoperative recovery.

    <masking_description>Investigator and treating physicians are different in this trial, that means, the assessor of primary study endpoint will be blinded regarding group allocation. Patients receive either regional-anaesthesiological catheters preoperatively or are treatet with local infiltration technique perioperatively. For the purpose of this trial is would not be feasable to perform sham regional-anaesthesiological procedures and blinding of the treating physisican will not be possible.</masking_description>
