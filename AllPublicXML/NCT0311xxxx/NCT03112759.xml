  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess cognitive behavioral therapy as an adjunct to conventional symptom
      control for patients with chronic pancreatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with chronic pancreatitis will be considered for participation in this study.
      Patients selected for participation will be evaluated 4 weeks prior to the first one-on-one
      therapy session. A baseline pain score will be assessed using the visual analog pain scale.
      Narcotic dosage and frequency as well as anti-emetic usage will be evaluated at this time. A
      pre-treatment quality of life score will be recorded using the SF-12® Patient Questionnaire.
      Patients will also be queried about the presence of nausea and reflux.

      After the pre-intervention evaluations are complete, patients will be randomized into one of
      two arms: treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy and narcotics as needed or treatment
      with conventional narcotic analgesics alone. Patients undergoing CBT intervention will
      participate in eight weekly therapy sessions. Follow-up assessments will be conducted six
      months and nine months after the last therapy session is completed. The patients will be
      evaluated based on pain score, narcotic dosage and frequency, anti-emetic usage, quality of
      life assessment, and pain related hospitalizations.
