      To compare surgical outcomes from medial epicondyle fracture fixation with absorbable
      cartilage nails to those from traditional Kirschner wire fixation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From August 2007 to January 2012, 32 patients undergoing surgery for medial humeral
      epicondyle fractures in our hospital were randomized into group A (traditional Kirschner
      wire) or group B (absorbable cartilage nail). The same surgical team performed the
      operations, and patients were followed for over a year. Group A had open reduction with
      K-wire fixation, and group B was fixed with absorbable cartilage nails. The Bede scoring
      system was used to evaluate elbow function at follow-up.
