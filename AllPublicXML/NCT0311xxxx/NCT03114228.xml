    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather and evaluate additional safety data on the combination
      of midostaurin and standard of care for adult patients with newly diagnosed Fms-like tyrosine
      kinase receptor (FLT3) mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who are eligible for standard
      induction and consolidation chemotherapy and are without satisfactory treatment alternatives
      prior to the commercial availability* and reimbursement of midostaurin during the regulatory
      approval process

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures.

          2. Patients must have a documented unequivocal diagnosis of AML according to WHO 2008
             classification (≥20% blasts in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood), excluding M3
             (acute promyelocytic leukemia). Patients with secondary AML are eligible, e.g.
             patients with antecedent history of treatment for prior malignancy. AML patients with
             a history of antecedent treatment for myelodysplasia (MDS), e.g. azacitidine or
             decitabine, remain eligible for treatment on this study. These agents must have been
             discontinued for a period of at least 30 days or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever
             is greater) before midostaurin can be administered.

          3. Patients must have a documented FLT3 mutation (ITD or TKD)

          4. Patients must be 18 years of age or older; elderly patients must be fit to receive
             intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy

          5. Patients must enroll prior to completion of cycle 2 of the consolidation chemotherapy.

          6. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2

          7. Patients requiring intrathecal chemotherapy must have a minimum washout of 48 hours
             prior to the first dose of midostaurin

          8. Patients must have the following laboratory values:

               1. Total Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               2. Serum Creatinine ≤ 2.5 x ULN Exclusion Criteria

        1. Prior therapy for AML with the following exceptions:

          1. emergency leukapheresis

          2. emergency treatment for hyperleukocytosis with hydroxyurea for ≤ 7 days

          3. cranial RT for CNS leukostasis (one dose only)

          4. growth factor/cytokine support 2. Patients with LVEF less than 45% (by echocardiogram
             or MUGA) or symptomatic congestive heart failure, Class III or IV according to New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) classification 3. Patients with any pulmonary infiltrate
             including those suspected to be of infectious origin (unless resolved to &lt; Grade 1
             within screening timeframe) 4. Patients with any uncontrolled illness, including, but
             not limited to, acute or chronic pancreatitis or uncontrolled infection 5. QTc &gt;500
             msec on screening ECG. 6. History of hypersensitivity to any drugs or metabolites of
             similar chemical classes as the study treatment. 7. Participation in a prior
             investigational interventional (drug) study with administration of the investigational
             product within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is
             longer. 8. Pregnancy statements and contraception requirements: Women of child-bearing
             potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless
             they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 3
             months after stopping medication. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use
                  of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.
