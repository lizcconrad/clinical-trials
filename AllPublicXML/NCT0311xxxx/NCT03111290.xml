      Purpose: To investigate whether rhythmic direct electrical stimulation (DES) causes
      entrainment of endogenous neural oscillatory activity and whether such activity improve
      cognition.

      Participants: Drug-resistant epilepsy patients undergoing epilepsy surgery cortical mapping
      with continuous electrocorticography (ECoG) with intracranial electrodes.

      Procedures (methods): Rhythmic electrical stimulation will be delivered via intracranial
      electrodes during routine extra-operative cortical mapping. Long-term ECoG, Pre-stimulation
      ECoG, peri-stimulation ECoG, and post-stimulation ECoG data will be analyzed to assess for
      entrainment of neural oscillations.

      The aim of this study is to characterize the entrainment of endogenous neural oscillatory
      activity using direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the brain and understand the effects on
      cognition.

      In this study, the investigators will apply rhythmic DES to patients who are undergoing
      routine DES for cortical mapping as a part of their epilepsy surgery evaluation with the aim
      of entraining cortical neural oscillations at specific frequencies relevant to cognitive
      processing and neuropsychiatric disease. The investigators hypothesize that rhythmic DES
      within a naturally occurring oscillatory frequency will cause entrainment at that frequency
      (e.g. 10Hz rhythmic DES will entrain a 10 Hz alpha oscillation). Also, the investigators
      posit that rhythmic DES at the theta (5Hz), alpha(10Hz), and gamma (50Hz) frequencies will
      cause enhancement of neural oscillations in the gamma band.

      The study follows a within-participant crossover design. Participants will perform one of the
      tasks described below and each task consists of multiple trials of varying difficulty.
      Stimulation will be applied concurrently through electrodes implanted for clinical
      determination of seizure focus. Equal number of stimulation and sham trials will be
      pseudo-randomly interleaved to get a balanced design (balanced across trial difficulty and
      trial type).

      The investigators will apply electrical stimulation in the form of pulse trains. The applied
      electrical stimulation intensity, duration and frequency follow the parameters used for
      clinical assessments of language and seizure focus and fall below the clinically approved
      limits.

      The investigators will measure participants performance on a simple working memory task
      during the above-described cortical electrical stimulation protocol. Alternately,
      participants can perform a face recognition task.

    <time_frame>1 Hour</time_frame>
    <description>In this task, a sequence of items (alphabets or numerals) is presented followed by a delay. Following this, a single item which may or may not have been in the sequence is presented and the subject will be asked to indicate whether the item was in the previously presented sequence. A total of 150 trials will be performed with randomly interleaved sham trials where no stimulation is applied. Accuracy will be quantified in percentage correct.</description>

    <measure>Intracranial EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>Intracranial EEG will be collected simultaneously when the participants perform the task. 1 Hour</time_frame>
    <description>Spectral analysis and functional connectivity analysis of electrophysiology data will be performed using methods like multi-taper fft, wavelets, phase locking, Granger causality etc. The measures will be compared between sham and stimulation trials to identify if stimulation enhances neuronal entrainment. The correlation between the measures described above and the task performance will also be estimated.</description>

    <measure>Facial Recognition Task Performance - Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who consent will be administered this task. On a given trial, participants will be presented with images of two faces side-by-side. The faces will either match in terms of emotion category (e.g., 2 anger faces) or not (e.g., an anger face and a fear face). Faces presented together will always be of the same gender but different identities. Participants will be asked to determine whether the two faces presented depict the same emotion category. Participants will have 5 seconds to make the decision and indicate by pressing a key in the keyboard. Accuracy will be quantified in percent correct.</description>
