    <textblock>
      Cigarette smokers will be randomized to E-cigarette, Nicotine Gum or Lozenge, or Control
      Group. Participants will enter a 1 week sampling phase. Smokers interested in continuing with
      the study after the sampling phase will undergo a 2 week baseline assessment phase and will
      then enter an 8 week intervention. Tobacco use patterns, subjective responses to product, and
      nicotine and toxicant exposure will be assessed.

      Sampling period (1 week): Subjects will be randomized to an alternative nicotine product
      (E-cigarette, Nicotine Gum or Lozenge) or assigned to continue smoking their usual brand
      cigarettes. Subjects will complete screening assessments, asked to sample the assigned
      product and start recording their cigarette or other tobacco intake on a daily basis using an
      interactive voice response system (IVR). Smokers assigned to the control condition (smoking
      usual brand cigarettes) will be asked to choose the product that they would like to sample.

      Baseline smoking period: After sampling, subjects who meet specific criteria will continue
      with the experimental intervention phase. These subjects will be required to attend 2
      baseline clinic visits where baseline assessments will be captured. Records of their
      cigarette or other tobacco intake on a daily basis will continue using the interactive voice
      response system (IVR).

      Experimental Period: After the baseline assessment, subjects will be instructed to either
      partially or completely substitute their cigarette smoking with their assigned product. They
      will assigned to one of six experimental conditions:

        1. smoking usual brand cigarette controls, who after 8-weeks will be offered any of the
           other nicotine products to use as they choose for 8 weeks;

        2. complete substitution (i.e., no smoking) with an E-cigarette;

        3. partial substitution with an E-cigarette;

        4. complete substitution (i.e., no smoking) with nicotine gum or nicotine lozenge.

      The assigned product, E-cigarette, Nic Gum or Lozenge, but not usual brand cigarettes, will
      be provided to subjects at the clinic visits. Subjects will attend clinic visits over the
      next 8 weeks where tobacco use patterns and biomarker data will be collected.
