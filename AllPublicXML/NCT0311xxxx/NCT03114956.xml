  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis represents a major biological complication of implant dentistry with
      reported prevalence of up to 47% of implants. The disease is characterized by inflammatory
      response to the biofilm inhabiting the implant surface. To treat this inflammatory disease,
      surgical and non-surgical therapies have been proposed, all of which entail biofilm removal
      through implant surface decontamination. Systematic review of various surface decontamination
      protocols has failed to demonstrate superiority of any of the protocols. One possible
      explanation is that most studies have examined decontamination of implant surfaces following
      experimentally-induced peri-implantitis, where implant surfaces lack the tenacious
      mineralized biofilm often found in clinical peri-implantitis and are therefore easily
      decontaminated.

      The investigators have hypothesized that control of inflammation and repair of pathologically
      damaged peri-implant tissues requires a comprehensive mechanical plus chemical surface
      decontamination therapy. The aims of this study are to 1) determine the most effective
      surface decontamination protocol that can lead to control of peri-implant inflammation and 2)
      delineate the microbial and immunological mediators that are associated with the changes in
      peri-implant inflammation. The investigators propose to compare conventional implant surface
      contamination techniques to a comprehensive mechanical plus chemical protocol. This
      randomized controlled clinical trial seeks to enroll 68 participants with at least one
      implant diagnosed with moderate to severe peri-implantitis. Pre-op parameters to be assessed
      include: probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, suppuration, plaque index, marginal
      inflammation, recession, clinical attachment level, inflammatory biomarkers and microbial
      sampling, and digital intra-oral peri-apical radiograph. Subjects will be randomly assigned
      to one of the four surgical debridement intervention groups: (A) gauzes soaked in sterile
      saline and chlorhexidine; (B) Titanium brush; (C) Air power abrasion; (D) comprehensive
      surface decontamination, including titanium brush, air powder abrasion and surface etching
      with 9.6% hydrofluoric acid gel. At 3-months post-operative, the initial clinical assessment
      will be repeated. The clinical examination will be used to analyze the efficacy of each
      treatment in controlling peri-implant mucosal inflammation. The ultimate objective of this
      research is not only to identify an effective method for control of peri-implant
      inflammation, but also to lay the foundation to detect biomarkers of peri-implantitis that
      can potentially be helpful in future studies as risk factors of this disease.
