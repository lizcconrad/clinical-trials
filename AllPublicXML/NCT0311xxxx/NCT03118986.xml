  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are among the most bothersome symptoms during
      cancer treatment according to children and their parents. Most children receiving
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) conditioning experience CINV despite receiving
      antiemetic prophylaxis. Olanzapine improves CINV control in adult cancer patients, has a
      track record of safe use in children with psychiatric illness, does not interact with
      chemotherapy and is inexpensive. We hypothesize that the addition of olanzapine to standard
      antiemetics will improve chemotherapy-induced vomiting (CIV) control in children receiving
      high dose cyclophosphamide for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) conditioning.

        delayed phases. Methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone are permitted during the acute and
        delayed phases for prevention or treatment of reaction (e.g. thymoglobulin, alemtuzumab,
        blood products) and during delayed phase for GVHD prophylaxis. Administration of olanzapine
        other than ordered as per study procedures is not permitted. However, other antiemetics may
        be administered as needed (PRN) for treatment of breakthrough CINV. For patients receiving
        busulfan, scheduled administration of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam for seizure
        prophylaxis is permitted on the days that busulfan is given and for 24 hours after.

          -  Receipt of cranial boost radiation within 14 days of the first day of HSCT
             conditioning.

          -  Planned co-administration of citalopram, amifostine, medications known to alter the
             metabolism of olanzapine (e.g. ciprofloxacin, valproic acid)

          -  Previous participation in this study.

          -  Participants in the optional assessment of nausea severity must be free of cognitive,
             hearing or visual impairment that preclude completion of the PeNAT.
