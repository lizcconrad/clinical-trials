    <textblock>
      This is a study for a new mechanical transport device adapted to the hemiplegic patients.

      Healthy volunteers :

      After explaining the protocol and presenting the movement laboratory, the subjects are
      equipped with reflective markers on the 4 limbs, the trunk and the head. The subjects are
      installed on a seat positioned in front of 2 force platforms installed on the ground. The
      seat is equipped with a force platform.

      Phase 1 :

      After being seated, the subject realizes :

        -  3 seat to stand and stand to seat without assistance

        -  3 seat to stand and stand to seat using a handle located in front of it (handle equipped
           with a 6-axis force sensor)

        -  3 seat to stand and stand to seat using the experimental device This phase will last
           45minutes (mn) (30mn of equipment and 15mn of sitting passengers standing)

      Phase 2:

      After being seated, the subject performs a course comprising:

        -  A standing pass from sitting on a chair

        -  A straight line movement

        -  A succession of left and right turns

        -  An upward and downward travel of less than 1%.

        -  Standard doorway

        -  Standing on the toilet

        -  A sitting pass from the toilet

        -  One way to a bed

        -  A sitting pass on the bed

        -  A passenger seat sitting upright from the bed

        -  A return to the starting point

        -  A sitting pass on the starting chair Each stage is timed. A subjective analysis of each
           step is done by a lickert scale on the perceived comfort and safety.

      This phase 2 will last 30mn (15mn of course and 15mn of questions).

      Hemiplegic subjects :

      At each session, the subject is examined by a physician who evaluates the motor control (Fugl
      Meyer scale), the equilibrium (Berg scale) and the spatial hemineglect (Bergego scale).

      Phase 1 is performed except the 3 seat to stand and stand to seat without assistance which
      are impossible.

      Phase 2 is performed. An evaluation of the device over 4 hours is carried out for each
      subject in therapeutic apartment in simulated living conditions. The validation in living lab
      is carried out by an ergonomist and by a questionnaire on the comfort and safety of the
      various steps identified by the ergonomist.
