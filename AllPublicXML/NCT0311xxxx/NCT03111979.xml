  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The older population is the fastest growing age group worldwide, but it is also the most
      susceptible to chronic diseases and disabilities. One of the most common negative
      consequences of aging is the decline in muscle mass, strength and power. This is most notable
      in lower limb muscles. These muscles are required for the performance of daily activities
      including walking, stair climbing and standing up from sitting. Regular exercise is
      considered one of the most effective measures to slow, and even reverse the progression of
      muscle weakness. Nevertheless older adults may notice a decline in their capability to
      undertake regular exercises, this may be due to a decline in their muscle's ability to buffer
      pH. Carnosine (made by bonding β-alanine and histidine) has been suggested to contribute to
      the extension of physical performance, counteracting the decline the muscle's ability to
      buffer pH. Yet this pH buffering process it largely restricted by the amount of β-alanine
      available in the human body. β-alanine is already known to decline in older individuals due
      to a reduction in food products (meat, fish and poultry). Yet through either consumption of
      β-alanine rich food, or through short-term supplementation, β-alanine is raised, increasing
      carnosine concentrations. Improved β-alanine levels can potentially advance exercise
      performance, for example significant improvements in time to exhaustion on both a constant
      (37%) and incremental (12%) treadmill tests have been demonstrated. It is therefore proposed
      that via β-alanine supplementation, an individual's perception of their frailty, maintenance
      of health and independent living can be improved in older individuals.

      However, these findings are based on participants, both young and older, who are well-rested
      with no prior exercise or fatigue to the assessed muscles. It remains unclear if β-alanine
      supplementation will aid in the buffering of pH when the muscle has already been fatigued.
      Therefore this investigation hopes to examine the effects of 4 week β-alanine supplementation
      on lower limb contractile and force properties, pre and post muscle specific fatigue.

    <description>Participants will be supplemented with 4.8g·d-1 β-alanine (CarnoSyn™, NAI, USA). The β-alanine dosing regimen will consist of two 800 mg tablets three times per day at 3-4 hour intervals or the same regimen for placebo tablets. The use of multiple small doses throughout the day has been used in numerous studies using β-alanine in solutions or gelatine capsules (Hoffman et al., 2008; Sale et al., 2011; Saunders et al., 2012; Sale et al., 2012; Tobias et al., 2013) in order to circumvent potential symptoms of paraesthesia (see box xii for possible risks and discomforts). Overall increases have been shown to be between 40% and 80% depending upon dose (between 3.2 and 6.4 g·d-1) and duration of administration (between 4 and 10 weeks) (Sale et al., 2012).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants will be defined as 'medically stable' for exercise studies, as
             proposed by Grieg et al. (1994). This criteria was designed both for safety and to
             define degrees of freedom from diseases which might alter exercise performance (Greig
             et al., 1994).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded if they are vegetarian/vegan or have been using
             β-alanine or creatine supplements within the past 6 months. They will also be excluded
             if they have participated in a resistance training programme in the last 6 months.
             These criteria will apply throughout the whole study, with any participants
             immediately excluded from the study if any of these medical conditions should arise.
