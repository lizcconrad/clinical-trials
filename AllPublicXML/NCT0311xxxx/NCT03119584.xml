    <textblock>
      Study includes 5 visits, when all basic clinical information, vital signs, symptoms, and side
      effects are going to be assessed at each appointment.

      Patients are going to be assigned by the computer, to receive an active or non-active drug
      for 14 days in a first phase. The order will be change during the second phase. The 2 weeks
      break without our medication will separate these phases. A very close observation regarding
      safety of our subjects will be implemented by study personnel and clinical investigators.

    <textblock>
      The symptoms of chronic constipation are defined as infrequent bowel movements, hard stool,
      straining during defecation, bloating, abdominal discomfort, and sensation of incomplete
      evacuation.

      Constipation has been reported as a common complication of diabetic neuropathy. A new
      medication, called linaclotide, was studied on many patients, and it is approved to be on a
      market for constipated patients. Unfortunately diabetics were not included in these previous
      studies; hence we designed the project which is going to address the possible benefit of this
      drug in diabetic population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type II diabetics.

          -  Functional Constipation defined by Rome III criteria are as follows: a. At least a 6
             months history of constipation.

             b. Less than three spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week. c. At least 25% of

             e. Straining on at least 25% of defecations. f. Sensation of anorectal
             obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of defecations.

        Note: The above criteria are only applicable to spontaneous bowel movements. Patients who
        have no spontaneous bowel movements (bowel movements are preceded by laxative intake) are
        considered constipated and are eligible for this study.

             or double-contrast barium enema, performed within the previous 5 years, based on the
             American Gastroenterological Association guidelines.

          -  Patients with confirm diagnosis of Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy based on results of
             ANX 3.0, real-time ANS monitoring system will be included in this investigation.

          -  Patients diagnosed with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and/or symptoms of functional
             gastroduodenal disorders, such as GERD and functional dyspepsia may participate in a
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

             screening period by using Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS).

             vomiting), currently receiving parenteral feeding (N-G, J-G-Tubes), having history of
