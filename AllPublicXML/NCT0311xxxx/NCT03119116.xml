  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people who suffer from irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation) which might cause
      stroke, need to take blood thinners to prevent it. It is important to prescribe the correct
      dose of blood thinners to the right patients to ensure the treatment works however avoiding
      complications. In the recent years, new blood thinners have been available; they require less
      laboratory tests and fewer visits to a doctor compared to older therapies. This study will
      look at how the general practitioners in the UK prescribe blood thinners according to the
      instructions given by the product manufacturer. We will use primary care data that is
      routinely collected by the general practitioners about their patients but without any
      possibility to identify individual patients. The results will help us to understand the
      magnitude of deviation from instructions in order to ensure that the patients benefit from
      the treatment.
