  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) who are cared for in a Neonatal Intensive
      Care Unit (NICU) often display symptoms including hyperactivity, irritability, jitteriness,
      poor feeding, and poor sleep patterns. The recommended first line of treatment to relieve
      these symptoms involves nonpharmacological interventions. The purpose of the current pilot
      study is to provide preliminary data to assist in the design of a larger scale study to
      examine one nonpharmacological intervention, weighted blankets. The pilot study will assess
      the feasibility of a cross-over randomized controlled design to study the impact of a
      weighted blanket on infants' symptoms of NAS.

      The aims of the study are:

      Aim1: To determine the feasibility of recruiting patients for a study evaluating the use of
      weighted blankets in the care of infants with NAS Aim 2: To determine the feasibility and
      safety of the study procedures Aim 3: To examine whether there is clinical benefit to using
      weighted blankets for the treatment of symptoms in infants with NAS.

      After informed consent is obtained, infants will be randomized to have either a weighted
      blanket or a non-weighted blanket placed on them first. A cross-over design will be used so
      all infants will experience both the non-weighted and weighted blankets. Thirty minutes
      before each feeding, baseline vital signs and Finnegan score will be obtained. Then, a
      blanket (weighted or non-weighted) will be placed on the infant for 30 minutes. Infants will
      be directly monitored and on heart rate/respiratory rate monitors while the blanket is
      applied. Vital signs and Finnegan scores will be obtained at the end of 30 minutes of blanket
      placement, infants will be fed, and vital signs and Finnegan scores will be obtained again 30
      minutes after the blanket was removed. Descriptive statistics will be used to determine the
      enrollment rate and feasibility of the protocol. Nonparametric statistics will be used to
      compare total Finnegan scores for infants with the weighted blanket applied compared to
      infants with a non-weighted blanket applied. Changes in Finnegan scores will be examined to
      estimate an effect size to use in a power analysis for a future larger effectiveness study.
