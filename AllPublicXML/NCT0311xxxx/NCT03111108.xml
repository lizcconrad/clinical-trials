  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of each treatment arm using a fixed
      dose combination (FDC) of EBR/GZR as assessed by the percentage of participants achieving
      sustained virologic response, defined as HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;Lower Limit of
      Quantitation (LLOQ) 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy (SVR12). This study also
      evaluated the safety and tolerability of EBR/GZR.

    <description>HCV-RNA levels in plasma will be measured using the COBAS™AmpliPrep/COBAS™ TaqMan HCV Test, v2.0 (LLOQ = 15 IU/mL) on blood samples drawn from each participant. SVR12 is defined as HCV RNA &lt;LLOQ at 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days following last dose of treatment (up to Study Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

    <measure>Resistance-Associated Variants (RAVs) to EBR or GZR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for viral resistance assays are collected on all participants at Baseline (Day 1) and at virologic failure confirmation visits and all follow-up visits after virologic failure is confirmed. Samples will be tested for any participant meeting virologic failure criterion who has detectable virus &gt;1000 IU/mL. Analysis of RAVs will entail a variety of techniques including population sequencing and/or next generation sequencing.</description>
