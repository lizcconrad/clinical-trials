    <textblock>
      This is a registry study of the natural course of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). In
      addition, the investigators will analyze the risk factors for the rupture of the UIA and
      their joint effect. The investigators aim to use research data to create a China national
      database of UIA.

      This is a registry study of the natural course of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). In
      addition, the investigators will analyze the risk factors for the rupture of the UIA and
      their joint effect. The investigators aim to use research data to create a China national
      database of UIA.

      This study is supported by a research grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology of
      the People's Republic of China. The investigators will collaborate with the other 19 medical
      centers which locate in the different districts of China. During the study period, all the
      patients included in this study will observe and treat in the collaborating medical centers.
      Included patients will be followed-up for at least 1year.

      Research data will represent the real natural course of UIA in China.

      For this study, the investigators consulted and hired professional experts about data
      collection, data and methodology. An intact systematic project steering committee, including
      Data Monitoring Committee, Data Management Committee, Project Academic Committee, Executive
      Group, Project Manager, Project Statistician, and Technical Support Center has been built up.
      Scientific regulations have also been made.
