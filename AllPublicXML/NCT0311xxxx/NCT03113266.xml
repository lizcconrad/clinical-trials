      JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder urothelial
      carcinoma who have failed in routine systemic treatment.The implementation of study meet the
      GCP.370 patients will be enrolled in the study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      JS001.Patients are injected with JS001 with 3mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progresses or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs.Response assessment is conducted by every 8 weeks in first year,
      every 12 weeks in second year and every 16 weeks in third year and beyond.
