      The purpose of this study is to see if Honeywell Genesis Android Touch Bluetooth System
      (mobile health) can improve patient satisfaction and quality of care provided to women
      experiencing complications due to high blood pressure during pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For six weeks postpartum, patients will use Honeywell Genesis Android Touch Bluetooth System
      to record and submit their daily blood pressure and weight measurements to a mobile health
      nurse and research team. Subjects will be provided with the kit (Honeywell tablet, mobile hot
      spot, blood pressure cuff, and scale) at no cost. Subjects will participate in video
      telehealth visits at 48 hours and 7 days after discharge to help provide management for
      hypertension related issues.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Is remote patient monitoring program an effective model of care to improve patient satisfaction regarding management of postpartum hypertension?</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Conduct an initial phase study for postpartum women at risk for severe hypertension to estimate the rates of willingness to participate in and utilize remote mobile health applications to monitor home blood pressures and weights, medication adherence after hospital discharge, to inform a trial to decrease postpartum maternal morbidity and readmission.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost effective analysis on remote patient monitoring for postpartum hypertension.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perform a cost effectiveness modeling will be performed to determine whether it is costeffective to use remote patient modeling for women with postpartum hypertension in comparison to standard outpatient care in women with hypertension-related disorders of pregnancy. Primary outcomes examined will include cost and readmissions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal outcomes in remote patient monitoring vs standard surveillance.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the maternal outcomes in the cohort utilizing remote patient monitoring to the cohort of patients with hypertension related disorders discharged with routine care. Outcomes of interest: Incidence of severe hypertension (SBP &gt;150/DBP &gt;105), hospital readmission, initiation of antihypertensive medication, unexpected outpatient clinic/emergency room visit, compliance with medications, compliance with outpatient blood pressure surveillance or scheduled visits, death, stroke.</description>
