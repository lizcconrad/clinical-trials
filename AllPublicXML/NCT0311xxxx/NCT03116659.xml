      Cutaneous lymphomas are rare cancers of lymphocytes (white blood cells) that involve the
      skin. Mycosis Fungoides (MF) is the most common type of Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) that
      typically presents with red, scaly patches that often mimic eczema or chronic dermatitis. The
      incidence of MF is about 1/100,000. Skin lesions tend to appear before the diagnosis of CTCL
      is made by several years. Early skin lesions may look like any dermatitis, eczema, or
      psoriasis, leading to delays in the diagnosis.

      Inflammation secondary to bacterial infection is thought to contribute to the T-cell
      proliferation in this type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Antibiotic use for other purposes
      has shown to reduce the inflammation and size of lesions in CTCL patients. There has been
      limited studies with the use of antibiotics as direct treatment for this cancer.

      Host immunity is important in decreasing cancer development and progression. Imiquimod is a
      molecule that stimulates host immunity to reduce the progression of CTCL. There is strong
      evidence of clinical efficacy such that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
      guidelines recommend Imiquimod for CTCL. Imiquimod is available in generic form, making it
      unlikely to be registered specifically for CTCL, despite its efficacy.

      Additionally, imiquimod is considered a first line treatment according to National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the treatment of Mycosis Fungoides.

      There are currently no studies that have been published that address treating CTCL patients
      with a combined approach of 1) decreasing inflammation caused by bacterial with antibiotics,
      and 2) enhancing the host immune system to destroy cancer cells. Our theory is if we treat
      patient with 14days of antibiotics and 30 days of Imiquimod there will be significant
      reduction in skin lesions.
