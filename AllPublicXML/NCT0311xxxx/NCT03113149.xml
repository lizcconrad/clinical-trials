  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA) experience restricted physical function.
      Few previous studies have investigated comprehensive sets of constructs and tests to
      investigate physical function in these patients. Most single studies of knee OA patients show
      limited scope for explaining physical function in the perspective of WHO's International
      Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 3 levels: Body functions (the
      bodily level), Activities (individual level), and Participation (societal level). On the
      bodily level there is limited case-control knowledge on muscle strength beyond the knee and
      endurance-strength in general. On the activity level, there is similar limitation of
      biomechanical bodily features in stair climbing. On the participation level the situation is
      similar for objective performance. Measures are needed that inter-relate all three levels of
      ICF. These should also include well discriminating tests e.g. knee strength, walking, and
      activities of daily life (ADL), as well as both objective and subjective measures.

      The purpose of this study is to explore mechanisms that can explain physical function in
      patients with knee OA in primary care. The study's main and primary goal is to quantify which
      baseline factors and change scores are the strongest predictors of a positive treatment
      outcome in terms of patients' global perceived change after physiotherapy. Secondary research
      question is: which factors are the strongest predictors of a positive outcome of
      physiotherapy in knee OA, in terms of pain intensity, patient specific functional scale, and
      function in daily living?
