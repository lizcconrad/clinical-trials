    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the common cerebrovascular diseases. With the improvement of medical
      conditions and treatment technology, the death rate of stroke patients has declined, but the
      disability rate has increased. In China about 50%-70% of stroke patients have the residual
      sequelae such as paralysis, paralalia dysfunction and so on.

      Hemiplegic is the most frequent sequelae in post-stroke patients, finger movements recovery
      has already became the most difficult question in all the movement kinematics and dynamics
      rehabilitation,which affects the total movement function and ability of daily life in the
      patients.The finger recovery is tightly related to the neural plastic and brain function
      realignment.Furthermore, whether the special brain movement functional cortex area in
      bilateral hemispheres can be effectively activated is the crucial solved link. A number of
      recent literature have displayed the special brain motor area including the primary motor
      cortex(M1), the supplementary motor area(SMA), the premotor area(PMA), the primary
      sensorimotor area(SM1),the secondary area(SM2), the cingulate sulcus area(CMA) and the
      cerebellum hemispheres(CB). However，the study on the above-mentioned motor area synchronously
      activated when the patients after systematically rehabilitative treatment performed fingers
      grasping task was reported rarely.

      Bold-fMRI technology is a new brain functional imaging technology developed on the basis of
      MRI in 1990s, which not only retains the anatomical imaging characteristics of ordinary MRI,
      but also obtains the physiological information. The emergence of Bold-fMRI technology
      provides a new way to study the mechanism, evaluation and prognosis of stroke rehabilitation,
      and it shows a good research and clinical application value in the field of rehabilitation
      medicine.
