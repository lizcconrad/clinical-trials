  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of Tadekinig alfa in patients with
      monogenic, interleukin-18 (IL 18) driven autoinflammation due to Nucleotide-binding
      oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and caspase recruiting domain (CARD domain)
      containing 4 (NLRC4) - Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) mutation (NLRC4-MAS mutation) or
      X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency. Because of the likelihood for pathogenic
      IL-18 in certain monogenic diseases, patients known to harbor deleterious mutations in
      NLRC4-MAS or XIAP and who have a history of ongoing inflammation will be enrolled if they
      have ferritin ≥ 500 ng/mL or persistent C reactive protein (CRP) elevation &gt; 2 times the
      upper limit of normal (ULN) and the patients should have a Modified Autoinflammatory Disease
      Activity Index (mAIDAI) ≥ 4.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed with a Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled (RDBPC) 18-week
      treatment phase, followed by an 8-week Randomized Withdrawal (RW) period for further efficacy
      and safety evaluation, with no interruption between the two phases of treatment.
