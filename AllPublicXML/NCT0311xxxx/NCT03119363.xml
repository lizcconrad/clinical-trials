      Cancer related fatigue (CRF) is the most common cancer side effect and can severely interfere
      with activities of daily living long after completion of medical treatment. Pharmacologic
      agents to treat CRF have been studied but there is insufficient evidence to recommend their
      use. Non-pharmacological interventions for CRF have also been studied but are costly to
      implement and involve significant patient burden. This study investigates a novel low-cost/
      low-burden intervention: systematic light exposure to treat CRF. Two hundred survivors of
      multiple myeloma and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma between 1 month and 5 years
      post-autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) will be recruited from two medical centers. The
      light will be administered by a small, personal Litebox daily for 4 weeks. Outcomes will be
      assessed at five separate time points, including baseline and follow-up. The study will
      specifically address recommendations made for interventions for CRF from the NCI Clinical
      Trials Planning meeting (JNCI, 2013).The proposed study will: 1) be the first large multisite
      study with a carefully delineated comparison condition to investigate the effects of light on
      CRF among ASCT survivors; 2) focus on a distinct, homogenous patient population; 3) include
      only survivors who experience clinical levels of CRF; and 4) address possible psychological
      and biological mechanisms. This study will have major public health relevance as it will
      determine if an easy-to-deliver, inexpensive, and low patient burden intervention effectively
      reduces CRF.

      The proposed multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate a novel
      intervention, systematic light exposure (sLE), to treat cancer-related fatigue (CRF) among
      Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) following autologous stem
      cell transplantation (ASCT). Cancer related fatigue (CRF) is persistent exhaustion related to
      cancer and/or its treatment. CRF is the most common cancer side effect and can severely
      interfere with activities of daily living long after completion of all medical treatment.
      Pharmacologic agents to treat CRF have been studied but there is insufficient evidence to
      recommend their use. Non-pharmacological interventions for CRF (including yoga, cognitive
      behavior therapy, hypnosis, and exercise) have also been studied; however, such interventions
      are costly to implement and involve significant patient burden. sLE is a low-cost, low-
      burden intervention that we have found to have beneficial effects for patients post-ASCT. The
      investigators initial randomized trial for CRF found that certain light exposure was
      associated with clinically significant reductions in fatigue (effect size d=0.98) More
      relevant to the proposed research is the preliminary investigation with sLE to treat CRF in
      MM and DLBCL which found that patients receiving certain sLE reported significantly less
      fatigue ( p=0.052). The proposed RCT will test the efficacy of sLE on CRF. It will also
      assess the effect of sLE on sleep, depressive symptoms, and both activity and cortisol
      circadian rhythms as these related processes have been hypothesized as possible mechanisms of

      sLE's effects on CRF. Two hundred survivors of multiple myeloma and Diffuse Large B-cell
      Lymphoma between 1 month and 5 years post-autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) will be
      recruited from two medical centers.

      The light will be administered by a small, personal Litebox for 4 weeks. Outcomes will be
      assessed at five separate time points including baseline and follow-ups.

      . The researchers' preliminary research has established the feasibility of this proposal.
      Moreover, in the preliminary research, 75% of participants completed the preliminary trial
      and data from the light box compliance meters showed that participants used the light boxes
      80% of the days that treatment was scheduled. A large sample of fatigued MM and DLBCL ASCT
      survivors has been identified. The study will specifically address recommendations made for
      interventions for CRF from the NCI Clinical Trials Planning meeting (JNCI, 2013). It will: 1)
      be the first large multisite study with a carefully delineated comparison condition to
      investigate the effects of light on CRF among cancer survivors treated with ASCT; 2) focus on
      a distinct, homogenous patient population (MM and DLBCL ASCT survivors); 3) include only
      survivors who experience clinical levels of CRF; and 4) address possible mechanisms. This RCT
      will have major public health relevance as it will determine if an easy-to-deliver,
      inexpensive, and low patient burden intervention reduces CRF.

    <intervention_model_description>Potentially eligible ASCT survivors will be identified by HSCT physicians and nurses at each medical center. A research assistant (RA) will be introduced to survivors who express an interest in the research. An RA will explain the study and consent those who are eligible. Once informed consent is obtained, an RA will conduct the screening interview (including the FACIT-Fatigue scale and a psychiatric and sleep disorder screening). An RA will review a checklist of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This information will also be verified by a review of participants' medical charts before participation begins. Eligible study participants will be randomly assigned condition using a block randomization table prepared by our statistician. Participants who do not meet eligibility criteria or who decline participation will be informed that they have completed their participation.</intervention_model_description>
