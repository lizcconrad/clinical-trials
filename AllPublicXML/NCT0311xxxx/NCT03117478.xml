  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this project is to explore the neuro-anatomical and -physiological correlates
      of meditation on attention and emotion-regulation. By investigating this, our scientific goal
      is to more generally identify the mechanisms and biomarkers of health and mental well-being.
      Therefore, the investigators use non-invasive imaging like Magneto-EncephaloGraphy (MEG),
      ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), functional and anatomic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI;
      including Diffusion tensor - DTI). These brain measures will then be linked to behavioral
      measurements. Experimental methods (i.e., simple computer tasks) will be used to measure
      attention, conscious perception and regulation of pain and emotion.
