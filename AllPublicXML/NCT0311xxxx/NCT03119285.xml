  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test for non-BRCA1/2 mutations in new and existing families with
      hereditary ovarian cancer in order to better define penetrance and associated malignancies of
      rare ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. The hypothesis is at least one third of hereditary
      ovarian carcinoma families wildtype for BRCA1/2 can be solved using an updated version of
      BROCA (BROCA-HR) that targets 47 genes, including all known ovarian cancer genes and
      additional candidate genes in related pathways. The objective is to identify families with
      mutations in rare ovarian cancer susceptibility genes and test both affected and unaffected
      family members, thereby generating a rough estimate of penetrance for each mutated gene as
      well as identify new ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. The investigators also plan to
      enroll self identified African America women, who have been drastically under-represented in
      clinical cancer genetic testing programs and in OC susceptibility research.

      There is more to hereditary ovarian cancer than the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility
      genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2). Next generation sequencing techniques have made it possible
      to sequence multiple candidate ovarian carcinoma susceptibility genes simultaneously. The
      King Laboratory has developed a targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing test
      called BROCA to evaluate mutations in known or suspected breast and ovarian cancer genes. In
      a prospective series of 360 unselected women with ovarian carcinoma, the investigators found
      that nearly one fourth of women carried mutations in one of 13 genes, and mutations in genes
      other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 accounted for 26% of all inherited mutations. While BROCA and
      similar gene panels are already in clinical use, little is known about the relative risks of
      carrying these non-BRCA1/2 mutations, making it difficult to counsel unaffected family
      members and develop optimum prevention protocols.
