      Objective: To evaluate the safety of bioresorbable polymer-coated everolimus-eluting Synergy®
      stent followed by 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at high-bleeding risk.

      Study population: Real world high-bleeding risk (HBR) patients with coronary artery disease
      (stable as well as acute coronary syndromes) who qualify for percutaneous coronary
      interventions.

      Study size: A total of 1023 patients will be enrolled. Study design: Prospective, single-arm,
      multicentre trial, powered for non-inferiority with respect to objective performance criteria
      (OPC).

      Antiplatelet therapy: Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 100 mg od and a P2Y12 inhibitor
      for a duration of 1 month, after which single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin will be
      recommended indefinitely. In case of need for oral anticoagulation, patients will receive an
      oral anticoagulant in addition to a P2Y12 inhibitor without aspirin for 30 days.

      Primary endpoint: Composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or definite/probable
      stent thrombosis at 1-year follow-up.
