  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study Collabri Flex is to:

        -  Develop a Danish model for collaborative care for patients with depression in general
           practice, based on past experience gained in the Collabri Project.

        -  Examine the impact of this model compared with liaison-consultation for people with
           depression in a randomized controlled design from selected endpoints.

      The Collabri Flex model for Collaborative Care takes point of departure in the earlier study
      Collabri. It is changed according to gathered information under the first study of the
      Collabri model in order to achieve a Danish Collaborative Care model easier to implement.

      The aims of Project Collabri Flex are to:

        -  Develop a flexible model for collaborative care (the Collabri Flex model) for patients
           with depression.

        -  Study the effects of this Collabri Flex model against consultation liaison in a
           randomized design on selected outcomes.

      In Collabri the treatment is in line with a set of general treatment principles relevant for
      collaborative care interventions. The patients in the intervention group are offered
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation and medication according to a stepped
      care model by a care manager refering to the general practitioner.

      The Collabri Flex study is set up as a researcher-blinded individually randomized controlled
      trial with participation of an intervention group (treatment according to the Collabri Flex
      model) and a consultation liaison group.

      This study will contribute with new knowledge on collaborative care interventions in a
      Scandinavian context.
