  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the accelerating growth of older adults worldwide and the decline in cognitive function
      with aging, therapeutics that remediate age-related cognitive decline are needed more than
      ever. The proposed research seeks to better understand and enhance the detection of exercise
      effects on hippocampal network function and learning and memory, which decline with aging and
      Alzheimer's. Success would lead to new ways to detect benefits of exercise on cognitive aging
      and would lead to mechanistic insight on how such plasticity is possible while also informing
      prevention strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Animal models robustly support that exercise protects brain areas vulnerable to aging such as
      the hippocampus and that these benefits lead to better learning. In contrast, there are mixed
      findings from human studies on the cognitive benefits of exercise with healthy older adults.
      This contrast indicates there is still a lack of understanding for how exercise could change
      the course of cognitive decline in aging adults. However, no human studies have
      comprehensively tested exercise effects on cognition in older adults with learning tasks
      inspired from basic exercise neuroscience. The objective in the proposed research is to fill
      this translational gap by determining if different types of exercise improve the same kinds
      of learning in older adults that have been shown to improve in animal models by improving
      hippocampal function. This will bring the investigators closer to a long-term goal of
      determining how exercise protects the brain from adverse effects of aging in order to develop
      interventions that minimize age-related cognitive decline. The overall hypothesis is that
      exercise improves learning when it increases functional hippocampal-cortical communication
      that otherwise declines with aging. The investigators will test this in a sample of healthy
      older adults by determining if increases in functional hippocampal-cortical connectivity from
      exercise training improve learning on an array of tasks that require the hippocampus for
      acquisition of new relational memories compared to conditions of the same tasks that should
      not require the hippocampus for learning and memory.

    <description>Cardiorespiratory fitness training will be a 24-week supervised cycling program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, with supervision directly from the research team. All participants will first receive a one-on-one orientation with an exercise training specialist that has been trained by Dr. Gary Pierce in monitoring an exercise program for healthy older adults. Training will start with a 5 minute-warm-up, 20 minutes moderate intensity cycling and 30 minutes light intensity cycling, and 5 minute cool-down per session, for 3 sessions/week. In each additional week, 6 minutes of moderate intensity cycling per session will be added, until the total time for moderate intensity is 50 minutes per session by the start of week 5 (with additional 5 minute warm-up and 5 minute cool-down).</description>

    <description>Functional fitness training will be a 24-week supervised exercise program designed to focus on functional flexibility and mobility, with supervision directly from our research team. All participants will first receive a one-on-one orientation with an exercise training specialist that has been trained by Dr. Gary Pierce in monitoring an exercise program for healthy older adults. Training will start with a 5 minute-warm-up, 20 minutes of light intensity cycling and 20 minutes of dynamic stretching to increase range of motion and functional fitness, for 3 sessions/week. In each additional week, additional stretches will be added to maintain variety and improve flexibility of all major muscle groups.</description>
