  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to look at a comparison of liquid biopsy (blood sample) analysis compared
      with tissue biopsy in patients with advanced lung cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the concordance of Inivata liquid biopsy
      panel with standard tissue biopsy analysis for detecting genomic alterations in patients with
      advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
