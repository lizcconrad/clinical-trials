  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The European General Practitioners Research Network (EGPRN) designed and validated a
      comprehensive definition of multimorbidity using a systematic literature review and
      qualitative research throughout Europe. This definition was tested as a model to assess
      decompensation in multimorbid outpatients.

      The objective is to assess which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity could detect
      decompensating outpatients in a primary care cohort at a 6-month follow-up and to assess
      whether a large scale cohort with FPs would be feasible.

      Method: Family Physicians included a random sample of multimorbid patients who attended
      appointments in their offices from July to December 2014. Inclusion criteria were those of
      the EGPRN definition of Multimorbidity. Exclusion criteria were patients under legal
      protection and those unable to complete the 2-year follow-up. Decompensation was defined as
      the occurrence of death or hospitalization for more than seven days. Statistical analysis was
      undertaken with uni- and multivariate analysis at a 6-month follow-up using a combination of
      approaches including both automatic classification and expert decision making. A Multiple
      Correspondence Analysis (MCA) confirmed results consistency and completed the process with a
      projection of illustrative variables. A logistic regression was finally performed in order to
      identify and quantify risk factors for decompensation.

    <description>The study population included a random sample of multimorbid patients (according to the EGPRN definition of multimorbidity). Patients were selected by 19 FPs in their offices in the county of Finistere (in north-west France) from July 2014 to December 2014. Randomization was achieved by including the first four multimorbid patients (according to the inclusion criteria) encountered during their second working day of each week. As patients were booking their appointments with the practice without the FPs' clearance, the FPs were not able to select them</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria were patients meeting the criteria for the definition of
             multimorbidity according to the EGPRN definition: any combination of chronic disease
             with at least one other disease (acute or chronic) or a bio psychosocial factor
             (associated or not) or a somatic risk factor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria were patients not meeting the criteria of the definition of
             multimorbidity, the inability to follow the study over time (known to be leaving the
             practice in the following months), patients under legal protection, outpatients in
             palliative care for whom survival was estimated by the FPs at less than three months.
