  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (Tpo-RAs) have profoundly changed the management of ITP.
      However, today, there are no international recommendations concerning the long-term use of
      these costly, potentially pro-thrombotic agents, and that could induce bone marrow fibrosis
      in case of prolonged treatment. Tpo-RAs have been thought to play only a supporting role in
      ITP management. But our center along with many other research centers, have reported
      unexpected cases of durable remission after Tpo-RAs discontinuation in adult chronic ITP. In
      these retrospective studies, more than 20 % of patients were able to achieve prolonged
      remission.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a substantial proportion of ITP patients may
      achieve a prolonged response after Tpo-RA discontinuation.

      The investigators developed, in this study, a standardized procedure to discontinue
      Eltrombopag and Romiplostim, wherein the dose will be slowly tapered to limit the risk of
      bleeding. In case of relapse after Tpo-RA discontinuation, the decision to start a new
      therapy will be based on the clinician's judgment.

    <time_frame>week 24 (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>the criteria of response will be defined as the following:
Response (R) will be defined as sustained platelet count &gt;30x109/L in the absence of bleeding or use of any other ITP directed therapies between the week 0 (discontinuation) and week 24.
Complete response (CR) by a platelet count &gt; 100x 109/L in the absence use of any other ITP directed therapies between week 0 and week 24.
Patients will be considered as being non-responders (NR) if:
Their platelet count is &lt; 30 x 109/L between week 0 and week 24, but also, in the setting of this study if:
They need a rescue therapy (a new course of corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin) after inclusion.</description>
