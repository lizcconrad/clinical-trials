    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady-state concentrations of
      JNJ-56136379 on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of drospirenone and ethinylestradiol
      (oral contraceptive [OC]) in healthy female participants and to evaluate the effect of
      steady-state concentrations of JNJ-56136379 on the single-dose PK of midazolam (sensitive
      probe substrate for CYP3A4) in healthy female participants.

             permitted

          -  must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kg divided by the square of height in
             meters) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2), extremes included,
             and a body weight not less than 50.0 kilogram (kg)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  any evidence of heart block or bundle branch block

          -  history of liver or renal dysfunction (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;60 milliliters

             Disease [MDRD] formula12), significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal
             (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that in the
             investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability), endocrine,
             neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or metabolic
             disturbances

             history of long QT Syndrome)

             antibodies) at screening

          -  any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not limited to,
             dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, and urticaria
