    <measure>Change from Baseline in visual assessment of dryness</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 5 (3 hours post last wash procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Skin dryness will be assessed by a trained examiner according to following the scoring scale: 0 (No dryness); 1 (Patches of slight powederiness and occasional patches of small scales may be seen, distribution generalized.); 2 (Generalised slight powederiness, early cracking or occasional small lifting scales may be present); 3 (Generalised moderate powederiness and/or heavy cracking and lifting scales; 4 (Generalised heavy powederiness and/or heavy cracking and lifting scales); 5 (Generalised high cracking and lifting scales, eczematous change may be present, powederiness may be present but not prominent, may see bleeding crack); 6 (Generalised severe cracking, eczematous change may be present, bleeding cracks may be present, scale large may be beginning to disappear).</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in visual assessment of redness</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 5 (3 hours post llast wash procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Skin redness will be assessed by a trained examiner according to following the scoring scale: 0 (No redness); 1(Barely detectable redness); 2(Slight redness); 3 (Moderate redness); 4 (Heavy or substantial redness); 5 (Extreme redness); 6 (Severe Redness).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Transepidermal water loss (TEWL)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 5 (3 hours post last wash procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL will be measured using Tewameter. An increase in TEWL values will show damage to the skin barrier function. TEWL values will be expressed in gram/square metre/hour (g/m^2/hr).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in skin moisturisation</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 5 (3 hours post last wash procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of stratum corneum moisturisation will be performed by the electrical capacitance method with the Corneometer. Corneometer values lower than 30 instrumental units (i.u.) represents very dry skin, while values between 30 und 50 i.u are typically for dry skin on the forearm. An increase in Corneometer values corresponds to a skin-moisturising effect.</description>
