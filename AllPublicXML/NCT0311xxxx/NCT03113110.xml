      RELEVANCE:

      Up to 50% of patients without previously known disorders of glucose metabolism develop
      posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) after renal transplantation, which is associated
      with cardiovascular events. Although PTDM is triggered by immunosuppressive agents
      (calcineurin inhibitors, glucocorticoids), there is consensus against switching patients from
      potent tacrolimus to the less diabetogenic cyclosporin. Full-blown PTDM must therefore be
      treated aggressively. Empagliflozin inhibits sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the proximal
      tubule of the kidney and dramatically reduced cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetics in a
      recent randomized trial. Especially in diabetics with impaired renal function, empagliflozin
      was safe, well tolerated, and effective against hyperglycemia and against high blood
      pressure. Data on SGLT2 inhibition after transplantation are completely lacking. Therefore,
      the potential antidiabetic of choice is currently withheld from the vulnerable PTDM
      population.

      METHODS, STUDY DESIGN:

      Prospective, single-center, non-inferiority study. Inclusion criteria: PTDM (antidiabetic
      therapy ≥6 months, based on prior 2-h BG ≥200 mg/dL, fasting BG ≥125 mg/dL (2 times) or HbA1c
      ≥6.5%); stable renal allograft function &gt;6 months; eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2. Most important
      exclusion criteria: type 1 and 2 diabetes; insulin demand &gt;40 IU/day; HbA1c &gt;8.5%. After
      study inclusion, patients will record 4 weeks of 4-times daily BG measurements before
      undergoing an OGTT, lab work and urine analysis (including ketones, urinary culture).
      Empagliflozin (10 mg) will be started and insulin discontinued within 3 days. Patients will
      be asked to perform urinary dipstick tests at home (i.e. ketones), and to continue recording
      BG. Study visits at 2 and 4 weeks (second OGTT + lab work (as above)). If control over
      hyperglycemia is insufficient, insulin therapy will be added back, otherwise study patients
      remain on empagliflozin monotherapy for 1 year. Statistics will include the paired t-test.

      We have designed a clinical trial that plans to include 16 patients with stable renal
      allograft function, stable immunosuppressive therapy and PTDM, under standard antidiabetic
      therapy (exogenous insulin &lt;40 IU). The sample size is based on a calculation assuming
      non-inferiority of empagliflozin monotherapy in comparison to previous insulin therapy, with
      respect to the primary endpoint: 2-hour blood glucose (2-h BG) during an oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT) immediately prior and 1 month after the start of empagliflozin
      monotherapy. The null hypothesis will be accepted if the average change in 2-h BG from the
      first to the second OGTT exceeds 30 mg/dL (empagliflozin will be inferior). Secondary
      endpoints comprise the average change in insulin secretory capacity and insulin sensitivity,
      derived from the first to the second OGTT, the average change in HbA1c at 3 months and at 1
      year, compared to baseline, changes in body weight, fluid overload (determined by
      bioimpedance spectroscopy) and blood pressure. Safety endpoints include clinically concerning
      hyperglycemia after discontinuation of exogenous insulin, ketoacidosis, urinary tract
      infections and genital infections, worsening of renal function, hypoglycemia,
      hospitalizations, cardiovascular events and death. The effect of empagliflozin on the
      renin-angiotensin system is part of an OeNB-funded project in non-transplanted patients and
      will be included in the analyses of the present study.
