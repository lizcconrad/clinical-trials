  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balanced solutions with low chloride concentration could represent an alternative to high
      chloride concentration solutions. Such balanced solutions contain other acid as buffers (i.e.
      acetate and/or gluconate). However, acetate has been associated with alteration of cardiac
      function when used as buffer in dialysate when high acetate concentrations are used and could
      promote the development of metabolic acidosis if it accumulates. Therefore, the safety of
      such solutions remains poorly explored. Because critically ill patients receive large amount
      of fluid during the early phase of resuscitation, large amount of acetate are to be
      administrated if such solutions are used. While acetate-containing solutions have been
      suggested to be safe in this setting, studies are still lacking regarding clearance and
      accumulation in critically ill patients.

      It is expected to include 28 patients, the objective to analyze the data of 20 patients.

      The main objectives of the study is 1) to determine whether Plasmalyte® promote the
      development of metabolic acidosis in comparison with an acetate-free balanced solutions:
      Ringer lactate (chloride concentration of 111 mmol/L) and 2) to determine Acetate &amp; gluconate
      clearance during fluid resuscitation of severely burn patients Plasmalyte® (chloride
      concentration of 98 mmol/L) . Severely burn patients will be randomized to receive
      Plasmalyte® or Ringer Lactate for initial fluid resuscitation during the first 5 days
      following admission.

    <intervention_model_description>Plasmalyte® is a balanced solution containing a low chloride concentration (i.e. 98 mmol/L) which may overcome overwhelm the potential risks associated with hyperchloremic solutions. Plasmalyte® also contains acetate (27 mmol/L) and gluconate (23 mmol/L) as buffer solutions.
Ringer Lactate® is also a balanced solution containing a low chloride concentration (i.e. 111 mmol/L)</intervention_model_description>
