  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By utilizing fitness trackers, this study aims to demonstrate that a simple walking program
      improves patients' ability to tolerate curative concurrent chemoradiotherapy without
      treatment interruption.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will be given a commercially-available fitness tracker to wear continuously
      throughout the course of the study. Per this study's inclusion criteria, all patients will be
      treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for a malignancy of the brain, head and neck
      region, lung, gastrointestinal tract, or cervix. Patients will be randomized to one of two
      arms: an experimental arm, where they will be instructed to meet a daily, customized step
      count goal, or a control arm where they will wear activity trackers but be given no specific
      instructions to increase their activity levels. Patients in the experimental arm who fail to
      meet their step count goal for three consecutive days will be contacted by a study
      coordinator and reminded to try to meet the activity goals. If the patient reports that his
      or her activity is limited by treatment-related toxicities, the patient's treating physicians
      will be notified to ensure that supportive care needs are being met. With such a program,
      this study aims to demonstrate the potential to improve patients' ability to tolerate
      curative concurrent chemoradiotherapy without treatment interruption.

    <description>Patients will be instructed to meet the daily step count goal displayed on their fitness tracker. If goal is not being met, study team will intervene and reinforce the importance of meeting this goal. Intervention will include a conversation with the patient, led by a study coordinator, to identify any challenges present in meeting the prescribed goal. Solutions to such challenges may be offered by the coordinator or necessary provider, such as a dietitian, when applicable.</description>
