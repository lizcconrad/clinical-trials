  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study tests an investigational drug called DS-3201b. An investigational drug is
      a medication that is still being studied and has not yet been approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA allows DS-3201b to be used only in research. It
      is not known if DS-3201b will work or not.

      This study consists of two parts. The first part (Part 1) is a dose escalation that will
      enroll subjects with AML or ALL that did not respond or no longer respond to previous
      standard therapy. The purpose of Part 1 of this research study is to determine the highest
      dose a patient can tolerate or recommended dose of DS-3201b that can be given to subjects
      with AML or ALL. Once the highest tolerable dose is determined, additional subjects will be
      enrolled at that dose into Part 2 of the study.
