    <textblock>
      Heart failure affects not only the cardiovascular system with structural abnormalities of the
      heart, but also the musculoskeletal system, leading to exercise intolerance. Objective: To
      evaluate the effects of a short-term exercise protocol and phototherapy, on the functional
      capacity and inflammatory markers in patients with heart failure. In addition, the
      investigators will investigate pulmonary function, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength
      and quality of life. Methods: Heart failure patients (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;
      40%) will be selected from the outpatient clinic of the myocardium of the Department of
      Cardiology of Unifesp and randomized among two groups: patients who will be submitted to
      placebo phototherapy and cycle ergometer exercise; and patients who will be submitted to
      active phototherapy and cycle ergometer exercise. All groups will receive treatment twice a
      week for four weeks. Patients will be instructed to conduct home-based walking program at
      least twice a week. Patients will be evaluated before and after protocols regarding the
      pulmonary function, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, functionality, quality of
      life and evaluation of systemic inflammatory mediators.
