  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to perform a clinical and microbiological evaluation of teeth with
      incomplete apexogenesis and traumatic necrosis that were treated with a revascularization
      technique, evaluating the microbial reduction after the use a double antibiotic paste.
      Furthermore, the investigation also aims to identify the presence of Enterococcus faecalis
      and Porphyromomas gingivalis within the root canal system.

      This investigation is a longitudinal prospective interventional study of a series of cases.
      Patients who sought treatment at the Faculty of Dentistry from June 2011 to September 2015
      were selected. They should have one permanent tooth with traumatic necrosis.

    <description>They should have one permanent tooth with traumatic necrosis, which in turns should show color alteration, fistulae, periapical lesion, and/or internal or external root resorption, pain, or absence of pulp response to sensitivity tests at a clinical examination to be considered necrotic. Male and female patients who had not undergone antibiotic therapy 3 months before the treatment were included and clinical and radiographic examinations confirmed pulp necrosis. This study analyzed the clinical and microbiological results of the endodontic treatment performed on permanent teeth with necrosis caused by traumatic injury and treated using revascularization technique, double antibiotic paste, intra-canal medication, and an MTA cervical plug.</description>

    <description>Apexification forms a calcified barrier in teeth with open apexes and pulp necrosis. It is used to treat immature teeth, but it does not promote the continuity of root formation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  They should have one permanent tooth with traumatic necrosis, which in turns should
             show color alteration, fistulae, periapical lesion, and/or internal or external root
             resorption, pain, or absence of pulp response to sensitivity tests at a clinical
             examination to be considered necrotic. Male and female patients who had not undergone
             antibiotic therapy 3 months before the treatment were included and clinical and
             radiographic examinations confirmed pulp necrosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who did use antibiotics

          -  Patients who did loss of temporary coronary sealing between treatment sessions

          -  Patients who give up the research
