      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether combination of obinutuzumab, lenalidomide,
      and high dose methylprednisolone in the treatment of Richter's Syndrome. The study will
      evaluate whether this regimen can reduce the amount of cancerous cells in your body. All of
      these agents are approved by the FDA Obinutuzumab is a protein molecule manufactured from a
      single cell population, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of CLL of SLL. Lenalidomide is for the treatment of patients with other blood
      cancers. Methylprednisolone is a type of steroid, and it is used in a wide variety of medical
      conditions. These agents and the combination of these agents are not approved for the
      treatment of Richter's Syndrome and are considered experimental.

      This is a phase I trial to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of
      obinutuzumab, lenalidomide, and HDMP for patients with RS. There is not a standard of care
      for patients with Richter's Syndrome (RS). Ten patients will be enrolled with RS diagnosed by
      histology or flow cytometry and CLL, regardless of prior treatment for either condition.
