      This study is aiming at assessing the burnout syndrome amongst triage nurses working in the
      Emergency Departments in Cluj-Napoca. The study design is observational, prospective and
      multicentric.

      At this moment, there are 43 nurses covering triage shifts in the Emergency Clincial County
      Hospital Cluj and 18 more within Emergency Clinical Hospital for Children Cluj-Napoca. On
      average, these ED roughly attend 90.000 patients yearly.

      Questionnaires are based on Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, with additional clinical cases that
      require triage coding according to The Romanian National Triage Protocol of 2016. Each triage
      nurse will complete the questionnaire when beginning the triage shift and after a period of
      2, 4 or 6 hours.
