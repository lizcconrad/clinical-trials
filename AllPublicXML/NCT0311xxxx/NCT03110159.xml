  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, phase 2, prospective, comparative study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of the combination of Levulan® Kerastick® for Topical Solution and blue light illumination
      using the BLU-U® Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator (LevulanPDT).

      The study hypothesis is that post solid organ transplantation patients, highly susceptible to
      non-melanoma skin cancer, can be treated safely and effectively through clinical cyclic
      application of PDT, lessening morbidity and possible mortality for this immunosuppressed
      patient population.

Each subject will be randomized to undergo treatment to one side face and one dorsal forearm/hand treatment, while the other side will serve as untreated control. Treatments will be conducted at the beginning of study Day 1 (Initial Treatment), Day 30 after the initial treatment (+ 3 days), Day 180 after initial treatment (+ 30 days), 1 year after the initial treatment (+ 30 days), and every 6 months (+ 30 days) thereafter for 2 additional years.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Received solid organ transplant

          -  3-24 months post-transplant (any number of transplant)

          -  Time interval of at least 6 days duration where complications such as rejection
             episodes, viral infections, surgical interventions and therapies with mono or
             polyclonal antibodies are ruled out by the transplant team.

          -  No prior history of NMSC in the treatment fields

          -  No AK/Bowen's disease in the treatment fields within the last 3 months.

          -  Moderate to severe sun damage

          -  Be willing to forego other interventions in the treatment fields than the ones
             approved by the investigator that would interfere with the protocol or evaluation of
             the study medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Fitzpatrick's scale skin type IV-VI

          -  Cutaneous photosensitivity to wavelengths of 400-450 nm, porphyria or known allergies
             to porphyrins

          -  Known sensitivity to any of the components of the Levulan® Kerastick® for Topical
             Solution

          -  Prior use of topical or systemic therapies that might interfere with the evaluation of
             the study medication during the study, within a 3 month washout period from the time
             of the screening visit

          -  Unable to return for follow-up visits and tests

          -  Any condition or situation which in the Investigator's opinion may put the subject at
             significant risk, could confound the study results, or could interfere significantly
             with the subject's participation in the study
