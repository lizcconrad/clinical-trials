    <description>Safety will be assessed by adverse event reporting on all study days. Fisher's exact test will be used to compare adverse event rates between treatment groups for the following categories: 1) all adverse events; 2) treatment related adverse events; 3) severe adverse events; 4) serious adverse events; 5) discontinuation due to adverse event.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients ages 5 to 12 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of
             unilateral AOM, and with ear pain (current episode &lt;2 weeks duration). Baseline pain
             entry requires a minimum score of 4 on the FPS-R.

          -  Patients/guardians must provide Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved written
             assent, as appropriate, which must be accompanied by an IRB approved written informed
             consent form (ICF) from the patient's legally acceptable representative (i.e., parent
             or guardian), as applicable. In addition, all patients or their legally acceptable
             representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a Health Insurance Portability
             and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization, if applicable.

          -  Patients must be physically active and otherwise judged to be in good health on the
             basis of the medical history and a limited physical examination, as determined by the
             Investigator.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must also have a negative urine human chorionic
             gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test on the Study Day, Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable or refusing to independently and consistently complete the FPS-R pain
             measurements.

          -  Patients with bilateral AOM, perforated tympanic membrane, history of a perforated
             tympanic membrane in the last 6 months, or if a perforated tympanic membrane could not
             be ruled out by speculum examination, impedance testing tympanometry, pneumatic
             otoscopy, or a Valsalva maneuver.

          -  Patients who are subsequently diagnosed with a perforated membrane during treatment
             are to be discontinued immediately.

          -  Patients with indwelling tympanostomy tubes or draining otitis in the affected ear(s),
             bullous lesions, erythema of the tympanic membrane without other evidence of AOM, and
             patients with an anatomic defect of the ear or nasopharynx.

          -  Complications of treated/untreated ear disease other than qualifying AOM over the past
             2 weeks.

          -  Patients with comorbidity requiring antibiotic therapy, allergy to study medication,
             immunologic deficiency, and major medical condition(s).

          -  Patients presenting with methemoglobinemia or a history of methemoglobinemia, vertigo,
             inherited enzyme deficiencies (including G6PD), impaired cardiac or respiratory
             functions, epilepsy, heart diseases, hypersensitivity to benzocaine or any other

          -  Oral analgesics such as ibuprofen/acetaminophen within 6 hours prior to study entry.

          -  Use of drug products with potential interactions including sulfonamides,
             aminosalicylates, anti-cholinesterases, suxamethonium, antiarrhythmics, monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors, or tricyclic antidepressants within 14 days.

          -  Eating, drinking, chewing of gum, or use of mints/lozenges during the first hour after
             initial study dose.

          -  Children that use pacifiers and/or are still breastfed.

          -  Exposure to any investigational agent within the 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Previous enrollment in this study.

          -  Pregnant or lactating.

          -  Clinically significant mental or emotional illnesses (by history or as determined by

          -  The child has a condition or demonstrates a behavior that the Investigator or site
             personnel believe would interfere with the ability to provide assent (age appropriate)
             or comply with study instructions/tasks, or that might confound the interpretation of
             the study results, or put the child or others at risk.
