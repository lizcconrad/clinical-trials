  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date no study has determined prospectively which technique is superior to prevent
      recurrent Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) after vaginal hysterectomy- a major unmet clinical
      need. The aim of the study is to determine objective anatomical recurrent prolapse after
      Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation (SLF) vs McCall.

      The aim of the study is to determine objective anatomical recurrent prolapse after SLF vs
      McCall. The study is designed as a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Primary study endpoint
      will be at 12 months, secondary study endpoint at 24 months. The following parameters will be
      evaluated after one year: anatomical outcome, Quality of Life (QoL), sexual health,
      reoperations, and complications.
