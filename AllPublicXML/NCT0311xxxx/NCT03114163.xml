    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in adult patients in Germany diagnosed with SCCHN progressing
      on or after platinum-based therapy, who start a new systemic therapy with nivolumab for the
      first time, and are treated within the market authorization approval. Patients are to be
      enrolled into the study no earlier than the decision to initiate treatment with nivolumab and
      no later than the first dose of nivolumab treatment.

        The study will enroll adult patients in Germany who are at least 18 years of age at the
        time of the treatment decision, with the diagnosis of SCCHN.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients (at least 18 years of age at time of treatment decision)

               -  Diagnosis of SCCHN and patients are progressing on or after platinum-based
                  therapy

               -  Diagnosis of SCCHN has been confirmed by histology or cytology (either at initial
                  diagnosis or any time later during the course of the disease)

               -  Treatment decision to initiate a treatment with nivolumab for the first time for
                  the treatment of SCCHN (according to the label approved in Germany) has already
                  been taken

          2. Patients who provided informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a current primary diagnosis of a cancer other than SCCHN, ie, a cancer
             other than SCCHN that requires systemic or other treatment, or has not been treated
             curatively (as per discretion of the investigator)

          2. Patients previously treated with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, an anti-PD-1,
             anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways (applicable
             for any indication)

          3. Patients currently included in an interventional clinical trial for their SCCHN.
             Patients who have completed their participation in an interventional trial; or who are
             not receiving study drug anymore and who are only followed-up for OS can be enrolled
