      We aimed to evaluate chewing function (CF) in children with neuromuscular disorders, and
      investigate reliability of the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale (KCPS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chewing disorders (CD) can be seen due to muscle weakness in children with neuromuscular
      disorders neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Normal diet consists of all food consistencies
      including liquid, pudding and solid foods, and CD causes inability to intake solid food. This
      condition can affect development, nutritional behavior and child-parent interaction in
      children. Thus, it is important to determine CD in an early period with appropriate
      assessment methods and plan appropriate therapies in NMD. We aimed to evaluate chewing
      function (CF) in children with NMD, and investigate reliability of the Karaduman Chewing
      Performance Scale (KCPS).

    <description>Children with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) will be participated. Children will be asked to chew a standardized biscuit while video recording. Two physical therapists will assess all video recordings independently and score each video according to the KCPS. The correlation between the KCPS scores of two therapists will be used for interobserver reliability. One therapist will rescore the recordings after an interval of 2 weeks for intraobserver reliability.</description>
