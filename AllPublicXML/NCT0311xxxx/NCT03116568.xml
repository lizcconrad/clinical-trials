      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are
      caused by the loss of mucosal tolerance towards the commensal microbiota resulting in
      inflammatory responses.

      Identifying intestinal bacteria in mother and newborn of both IBD and Control groups allow us
      to understand the change of bacterial composition human microbiome in the gut during
      pregnancy and childhood development.

      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are
      caused by the loss of mucosal tolerance towards the commensal microbiota resulting in
      inflammatory responses.

      Human microbiome studies have demonstrated dynamic changes in bacterial composition in the
      gut during pregnancy and childhood development. Moreover, the presence of pathogenic species,
      or absence of beneficial species, in early childhood has been suggested to play a key role in
      the initiation of preterm birth, development of asthma or eczema, allergy, autism or other
      immunological deficiency. The goal of this study is to better understand the link between
      maternal and newborn microbiome. Specifically, we will investigate the microbial composition
      of the stool of newborn babies born to mothers with certain health issues as compared to
      healthy mothers. This information may help identify the factors that can help better
      understand the risk transmitted through the microbiome.

      By collecting the samples including stools, saliva and understanding the health history of
      pregnant women with or without Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we can compare the data of
      two groups pregnant women in order to find out the differences of microbiome in their guts.
      Another aim of our study is finding out the possibility of vertical bacteria transmission
      from mother to baby.

      Furthermore, our main focus is the meconium of newborn baby, we would like to know that the
      differences of microbiome in the gut between the newborns from two groups. Therefore, we will
      collect the umbilical cord blood, placenta, amniotic membrane, newborn cheek swab, and
      meconium. To investigate the disease transmission rate from mothers.
