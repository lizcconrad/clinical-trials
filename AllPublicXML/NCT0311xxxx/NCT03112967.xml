      The investigators will investigate the safety and efficacy of low-volume preparation (Oral
      Sulfate solution) compared to 4L PEG solution in bowel preparation before colonoscopy.

      One aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of low-volume preparation (Oral Sulfate
      solution) on bowel preparation before colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution, which requires ingestion of a large volume
      of liquid, has been used and now to a low-volume preparations because of its clear advantages
      in tolerability. The tolerability of bowel preparations is related to their volume, taste,
      and side effects, with this being a particular problem in the elderly. Meanwhile, a new oral
      sulfate solution (OSS, SUPREP, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass) formulation as an
      effective low-volume bowel cleansing agent, with a split-dose regimen was recently developed
      in 2009.

      Concerned about being able to better complete ingestion of bowel cleansing agent, OSS with
      lower volume and improved taste features, as long as it does not sacrifice safety, shuld be a
      better choice than PEG. Many studies have already looked at the efficacy and safety of OSS
      compared to PEG in average risk population, but there are no data available in solely at the
      elderly population. In this context, we hypothesized that OSS could be a good alternative to
      a standard 4L-PEG solution in elderly patients.

      In this report, we describe a multicenter, prospective, investigator-blind, randomized,
      controlled trial investigating OSS with 4L PEG for efficacy and safety in the elderly.

    <description>The boston bowel preparation scale The BBPS uses a 10-point (0-9) summation scale assessing bowel preparation quality, by a 3 point scoring system of 0 to 3 in 3 segments of the colon (right colon, transverse colon, and left colon), where 0 = ''unprepared colon with mucosa not seen because of solid stool,'' 1 = ''portion of colonic mucosa of the segment seen, but other areas not well seen due to staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid,'' 2 = ''minor amount of residual staining, stool, and/or opaque liquid, but colonic mucosa of the segment seen well,'' and 3 = ''entire colonic mucosa seen well with no residual staining, stool or opaque liquid.'' An adequate bowel preparation was defined by a total BBPS score ≥ 6 with all segment scores ≥ 2, and excellent cleansing was considered as a score of &gt; 7.</description>

    <description>Proportion of adverse events. Adverse events recorded on the questionnaires included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, sleep disturbance, numbness, weakness/faint feeling, fecal incontinence, and thirsty.
Blood samples were taken at the screening visit and the day of the procedure and were analysed for serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate and magnesium), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Incident kidney injury was defined as a 25% increase in serum creatinine levels or longitudinal significant change in estimated glomerular filtration rate.</description>

At approximately 6:00 a.m. on the following morning, the subjects took the second dose of OSS by same formulation protocol.</description>
