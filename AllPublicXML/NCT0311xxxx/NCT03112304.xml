  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to study the sustainability of MATCH-ADTC within
      community mental health clinics, to learn what is needed for evidence-based practices (EBPs)
      to take root and thrive within a public system.

      In this project, the investigators are randomizing children to Wave 1 (previously MATCH
      trained) or Wave 2 (newly MATCH trained) and using a clinical monitoring system (TRAC) to
      measure youth outcomes over time. Participating therapists receive weekly MATCH consultation
      provided by the Judge Baker Children's Center/Harvard University research team or by Maine
      clinic supervisors who are MATCH Associate Consultants. The investigators are also developing
      and testing new low-cost measures of MATCH treatment and consultation fidelity to explore the
      feasibility of more sustainable measures of MATCH adherence. Study data will be used to
      answer questions about the sustainability of MATCH in the public sector.

    <description>Wave 1 clinicians received MATCH training at the beginning of the project and used MATCH to treat participating children from their clinic for two years, with weekly case consultation from MATCH experts who were part of the study team, and then received consultation from their own clinic supervisors who had been trained as MATCH Associate Consultants (ACs), supported by the TRAC system.</description>

    <description>Wave 2 clinicians provided treatment as usual (e.g., usual care) with the children they treated during the initial two years of the project. Afterwards, they trained in MATCH and used it to treat children in their clinics with weekly case consultation from our study team of MATCH experts, supported by the TRAC system.</description>

    <description>MATCH - ADTC (Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems; Chorpita &amp; Weisz, 2009) is a psychosocial intervention designed to treat children with multiple disorders and problems encompassing anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and disruptive conduct, including the conduct problems associated with ADHD. It is recommended for children aged 6-15. MATCH is composed of 33 modulesâ€”i.e., specific treatment procedures derived from decades of research on EBTs. The various modules can be organized and sequenced flexibly to tailor treatment to each child's characteristics and needs.</description>

    <description>TRAC (Treatment Response Assessment for Children) is a web-based system that provides weekly monitoring of the MATCH modules used and the child's response to treatment. Child's response to treatment is based on caregiver and child reports of (a) changes in problem severity on the standardized Brief Problem Checklist, and (b) changes in severity of the top treatment concerns identified by youths and caregivers. At the end of treatment, TRAC provides a complete record of modules used, and child treatment response, across all the weeks of treatment, as illustrated in the &quot;client dashboard.&quot;</description>
