      WIN is a prospective, observational multinational post-marketing registry designed to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the XPOSITION S stent used in routine clinical
      practice. Subjects with coronary artery disease, including patients with chronic stable
      angina, silent ischemia and acute coronary syndrome, who qualify for elective percutaneous
      coronary interventions suitable for a self-expanding stent, can be included in the registry.

      This registry will allow collecting data, and provide substantial information in a real world
      setting on patients with indications like lesions in vessels with diameter variance, large
      vessels, left main coronary artery, bifurcations, ectatic vessels, ...

      WIN will enroll 750 patients from approximately 30 sites.
