    <textblock>
      Despite advances in medicine, secondary neonatal infection remains a continuing concern
      because of the associated high morbidity and mortality. The usual mechanism of infection
      responds to the transmission of germs by the equipment used for care (eg, catheters) and by
      the hands of caregivers. In preterm infants in particular, some infections can also have an
      endogenous source, by translocation of colonization germs present in the digestive tract.

      The first line of prevention of secondary infection corresponds to compliance with the rules
      of hand hygiene, work surfaces and equipment carried out, the effect of which on the control
      of the incidence of secondary infection is regularly demonstrated. When declared, bacterial
      infection should be treated as quickly as possible with appropriate and effective antibiotics
      to preserve the healing prognosis. Compared to the infant and the larger child, clinical
      signs of calling are atypical and discrete. In the absence of staff trained to monitor
      newborns specifically, there is a real risk of discovering the existence of the infection
      only at an advanced stage corresponding, among other things, to circulatory collapse. This
      risk is not completely excluded, even with experienced practitioners, because the positive
      signs are rude and may go unnoticed (eg, signs of calling such as fever are rare in the
      newborn). Support for early diagnosis of neonatal infection by automatic monitoring systems
      has reduced mortality by 30% in the units where it has been applied. This is probably due to
      the fact that early warning made it possible to start the antibiotic treatment earlier and to
      complete the bacteriological diagnosis in order to better orient the therapeutic attitude.
      The best criteria for early diagnosis by automated systems were provided by the statistical
      analysis of cardiac variability, the results of the research and correspond to the standard
      deviation, the asymmetry and the entropy of the series d Cardiac intervals. Since microbial
      aggression has an impact on many vegetative variables outside of the electrocardiogram, our
      current research aims to determine whether the analysis of the perfusion index (PI) Which are
      of interest for detecting disturbances in the early stages of infection in newborns. IP
      corresponds to the ratio of the amplitude of the oscillating phase to the intensity of the
      constant part of the opto-plethysmography wave; It is obtained from signals recorded in a
      non-invasive manner by the same infrared sensor for pulse oximetry.
