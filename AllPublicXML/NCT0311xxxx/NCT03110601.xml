        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Capable of giving written informed consent to participate in this clinical study based
             on voluntary agreement after a thorough explanation of the patient's participation is
             provided to them.

          2. Chronic intractable pain of the lower back equal to or greater than pain in lower
             limbs, and that has been refractory to conservative therapy for ≥ 3 months.

          3. Must be older than 18 years old.

          4. Average back pain intensity of ≥ 5 out of 10 on the numerical pain rating scale
             (NPRS).

          5. Appropriate candidate for spinal cord stimulation trial.

          6. Subjects must be on a stable dose of pain medication regimen for at least 1 month.

          7. Female patients who are not pregnant and do not plan to become pregnant during the

             must be using reliable contraception and must continue to use reliable contraception
             until study completion. Non-childbearing potential is defined as postmenopausal for at
             least 2 years or surgical sterilization or hysterectomy at least 3 months before study
             start. Patients who become pregnant or who have a spouse/significant other that
             becomes pregnant during the course of this study agree to report pregnancy to the
             study physician/staff.

          8. Must be able to comply with the requirement of study visits and follow-up and phone
             visits.

          9. Have cognitive ability of operate the remote control and follow therapy instructions
             and directions by clinicians.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Systemic infection.

          2. Any active implanted device.

          3. Previous experience with SCS therapy either during a trial or fully implanted

          4. Evidence of serious neurological, psychological or psychiatric disorders.

          5. Mechanical spinal instability.

          6. Patients with uncorrected coagulation disorders or who are on anticoagulation therapy
             and cannot interrupt the therapy.

          7. Patient who are pregnant, breast-feeding or women of childbearing potential with
             positive pregnancy tests.

          8. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or a clinically significant infection.

          9. Patients who are undergoing or will undergo therapies or diagnostics that involve
             electromagnetic fields such as: diathermy based therapies, electrocautery, magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI), radiofrequency (RF) or microwave ablation, bone growth
             stimulators, electrolysis, therapeutic ultrasound, ultrasound, lithotripsy,
             psychotherapeutic procedures, radiation therapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve
             stimulation.

         10. A clinically significant disorder such as cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary
             infarction, ischemic heart disease, cardiac dysrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or
             congestive heart failure or any other as determined by the investigator.

         11. Uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled pulmonary disease, or uncontrolled hypertension.

         12. Patients who have evidence of major psychiatric disease, mental disorder, drug
             dependency, alcohol dependency, or substance abuse disorders.

         13. Patients who have progressive neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis, chronic
             inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, rapidly progressive arachnoiditis, acute
             herniated disc, or any other as determined by investigator.

         14. Medical condition or pain in other body areas that could interfere with study
             procedures, accurate pain reporting, and/or confound evaluation of study end points.

         15. Concurrent participation in another clinical study.

         16. Involvement in an injury claim under current litigation or a pending or approved
             workers' compensation claim.
