    <textblock>
      10 ml of blood from each patient will be drawn. This blood specimen will be centrifuged in a
      specific way to get 1 ml of platelet rich plasma (PRP). PRP will be injected into the the
      skin under the eyes. The treatment course consists of three sessions of PRP injections with
      one-month intervals between the sessions.

      Background:

      Dark circles around the eyes is a common problem pretending with relatively dark eyelids
      concerns many patients, especially women, because of the inconvenience caused by esthetic and
      negative impact on the psyche and the patient's quality of life. There are several causing
      factors (such as sun exposure, smoking, alcohol, sleep deprivation, genetic and structural
      factors). variety of treatments have been used for this situation , but without clear
      results.

      The term 'Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)' is a general term used to describe hanging plasma that
      has been obtained from whole blood with concentration of platelets higher than normal
      concentration found in the circulating blood. PRP's work mechanism depends on the fact that
      platelets contain important substances called (growth factors), which have a known role in
      the process of reform and renewal of tissues.

      Aim of the research:

      This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of (PRP) injection in the treatment of
      dark circles under the eyes. This is an uncontrolled open therapeutic trial study which will
      be performed at the Hospital of Dermatology and Venereology of Damascus University in
      Damascus, Syria during the period from June 2016 to June 2017.

      The results will be assessed by standardized digital photography month after each injection
      and three months after the latest assessment with the assistant of skin colors scale. In
      addition, the patient's satisfaction with the results and any treatment-related side effects
      will be recorded.
