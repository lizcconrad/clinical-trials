  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide a certain type of exposure therapy, called prolonged exposure therapy
      (PE), to military Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). One hundred and
      seventy-five Veterans will participate in the study. The main study goal is to compare PE
      conducted in three different ways: (1) PE that is office-based (OB; Veterans come to a VA
      clinic and meet with a therapist via telehealth, using videoconferencing technology), (2) PE
      delivered via home-based telehealth (HBT; Veterans stay at home and meet with the therapist
      via telehealth, using videoconferencing technology), and (3) PE delivered in home, in person
      (IHIP; the therapist goes to the Veterans' homes to provide the psychotherapy). Symptoms of
      PTSD, depression, and anxiety will be examined at pre-treatment, post-treatment and at
      six-month follow up to determine if symptoms change over time. Study hypotheses state that
      the IHIP approach, compared to the other two approaches, will be more effective at reducing
      the PTSD symptoms experienced by these Veterans because it will help Veterans attend each
      session and complete the therapy &quot;homework&quot; assigned by the therapists (such as doing feared,
      but safe, activities around the house or the neighborhood). However, the delivery of IHIP may
      cost more than the delivery of PE via the other modalities.

    <measure>Change in Working Alliance Inventory - Short form (WAI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WAI measures therapeutic alliance between the therapist and patient. Both the patient and the therapist fill out the WAI.

    <description>PE is a manualized treatment developed by Dr. Edna Foa and her colleagues. In all three treatment modalities, 7-15 weekly, 90 minute individual sessions of PE will be provided. PE is based on emotional processing theory, which proposes that avoidance and negative thoughts about the self and the world maintain PTSD symptoms over time. According to emotional processing theory, effective treatment requires repeated activation of the trauma memory (as through memory and in vivo exposure) and incorporation of corrective information into the trauma fear structure. PE has several primary components: (1) psychoeducation about PTSD and avoidance; (2) imaginal exposure with processing, wherein the participant describes the traumatic memory aloud many times and discusses it with the therapist afterward; and (3) in-vivo exposure, wherein the participant engages in feared, but safe, activities that have been avoided since the traumatic event (e.g., crowded places, driving).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Military Veterans enrolled in a program at VASDHS;

          2. primary diagnosis of PTSD as a consequence of any index traumatic event. The diagnosis
             will include a clear memory of the traumatic event and the 17 other core symptoms of
             PTSD from the DSM-IV. Note that comorbid mood and anxiety disorders are expected and
             will be permitted (to maximize generalizability) if PTSD symptoms are judged to be
             predominant based on primacy and severity of symptoms. The proposed treatment often
             concurrently ameliorates depression and anxiety symptoms;

          3. age 18 or older; and

          4. Primary residence within 35 miles of the center point of La Jolla, CA center (to make
             therapist travel to home sites feasible for this project). This will include the major
             cities of San Diego, Chula Vista (23 miles Southeast; 30 minutes), La Mesa (19 miles
             East; 25 minutes), Coronado (18 miles South; 30 minutes), Oceanside (36 miles
             Southeast; 39 minutes), Escondido (27 miles northeast; 35 minutes) and San Ysidro (28
             miles South; 32 minutes).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. unmanaged dementia, psychosis or manic episodes in past year (assessed by phone
             screen, chart review, and clinician judgment);

          2. substance or alcohol dependence in past 60 days (as assessed by the Alcohol Use
             Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT]);

          3. concurrent psychotherapies targeting PTSD (Veterans who are engaged in treatment for
             non PTSD symptoms, such as 12-step programs for substance problems or couples therapy
             for relationship issues, will remain eligible); and

          4. severe physical disease or disorder (e.g., cardiovascular or respiratory disease;
             severe impairments in speech, vision, or hearing) that would make it difficult to
             ensure regular attendance at psychotherapy sessions or would significantly impede
             learning (as assessed during phone screen discussion with potential participants).
             Potential participants who have had changes in the type and dosage of psychotropic
             medications in the preceding 60 days will be asked to wait until their medication
             regimen has stabilized to minimize treatment confounds. Psychotropic medication use
             will also be monitored to determine whether random assignment to treatment conditions
             resulted in unequal rates of use. As recommended by Bradley and colleagues,
             individuals with suicidal ideation will not be excluded from the study a priori, but
             rather suicidal urges or plans will be assessed throughout the study and appropriately
             addressed (by intervention or referral). The depression measure (the BDI-II) assesses
             suicidality explicitly (item 9). Dr. Thorp has extensive experience working with
             suicidal individuals and teaching crisis management skills, and the other study
             therapists will be trained in these skills as well.
