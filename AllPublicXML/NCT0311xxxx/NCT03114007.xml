  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental health problems affect 10-20% of children and adolescents worldwide, with half of
      affected youth experiencing problems by the age of 14. Despite the early onset of mental
      health problems, evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs remain scarce. If
      left untreated, early-onset mental health problems can progress to become severe or chronic
      conditions, and incur significant medical and societal costs.

      The current project proposes an integrated screening and intervention model that was
      developed involving active youth, family and community engagement. This project, known as
      Inter-Venture, focuses on reducing barriers to youth mental health care and promoting early
      screening and intervention by fostering collaboration between school and community-based
      services providers. The Inter-Venture project is being conducted in the Montreal area
      (Canada), and consists of three intervention modalities. Namely, 1) systematic school-based
      screening and personality-targeted interventions for students most at risk of mental health
      problems and substance misuse (the Preventure program); 2) a parent program designed to
      strengthen parenting skills and to improve the management of child behavior problems
      (Cope/EQUIPE program); 3) integrated services provided by a multidisciplinary team of
      professionals (referred to as Inter-Action) for youth with significant symptoms of mental
      health problems, substance misuse and/or psychosocial difficulties. The intervention model
      involves knowledge transfer to boost capacity-building and improve the provision and
      sustainability of evidence-based interventions in community settings.

      The primary goal of the Inter-Venture trial is to assess the potential effect of the
      school-based targeted interventions and collaborative care in the prevention, early detection
      and reduction of mental health problems, substance misuse and psychosocial difficulties among
      young people. The secondary goal is to assess the effect of interventions on school
      performance and whether the interventions can protect cognitive functions that may be
      negatively affected by early-onset substance use and mental health problems, and promote
      cognitive development through the prevention of these difficulties.

    <textblock>
      The Inter-Venture Trial is a cluster-randomised controlled trial of three intervention
      modalities developed involving active youth, family and community engagement in the Montreal
      area: (i) Systematic school-based screening and early personality-targeted interventions for
      students most at risk of mental health problems and substance misuse (Preventure program);
      (ii) Community-based parent training program and (iii) Timely and integrated services
      provided by a multidisciplinary team of professionals (Inter-Action).

      The trial will assess the potential effects of some of the components of the intervention
      model in 45 secondary schools that will be randomly assigned to two intervention conditions
      (receiving Inter-Action services and the parent training program in addition to Preventure or
      receiving the Preventure program and the parent training program) and a control arm that will
      receive treatment as usual. Schools will be matched on their baseline socio-economic status.
      Approximately 4000 students in participating schools will be invited to complete annual
      assessments for 5 consecutive years from grade 7 to grade 11.

      Based on their scores on the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale, at-risk students will be
      identified and invited to participate in the Preventure program in the first year of the
      trial. Parents of grade 7 students reporting discord at home on the Alabama parenting
      questionnaire will be invited to participate to the parent program. Participating students
      with clinically significant internalizing and externalizing problems will be invited to
      receive Inter-Action services. Internalizing and externalizing problems will be assessed
      using self-report measures such as the Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents, the
      Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the screening tool for the detection of alcohol and
      drug problems in adolescents (DEP-ADO) and the development and well-being assessment (DAWBA).

      Primary outcomes will be the likelihood of reporting a significant level of mental health
      problems, behavioral problems, substance misuse and poor quality of life among participating
      youth.

      Secondary outcomes will include the severity of the symptoms of mental health and substance
      use problems, school performance, time to received treatment, time in treatment, quality of
      care, cognitive functioning and other psychosocial outcomes.

    <description>Personality-targeted interventions conducted using manuals which incorporate psycho-educational, motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive-behavioural components. They include real life 'scenarios' shared by local youth with similar personality profiles. In the first session, participants are guided in a goal-setting exercise, designed to enhance motivation to change behaviour. Psycho-educational strategies are then used to teach participants about the target personality variable and associated problematic coping behaviours like avoidance, interpersonal dependence, aggression, risky behaviours and substance misuse.</description>

    <description>Parent training program designed to be delivered in community settings accessible to large groups of parents of 13 to 18 year olds. It uses a coping modeling problem solving process in which parents are the key players in developing problem solving strategies.
Parents participate in group workshops with themes related to communication, conflict resolution, cooperative transitions, negotiating, house rules, monitoring, consequences for serious problems and problem solving. Parents are guides to establish solutions to common problems. Readings and videotapes are used in the workshops to guide parents in identifying common challenges in child management, parenting errors, discussing possible consequences and alternative strategies as well as rationales supporting these strategies.</description>
