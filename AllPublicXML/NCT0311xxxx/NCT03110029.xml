  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how well efinaconazole solution (Jublia) works to treat toenail fungal
      infections in patients who wear polish compared to those who do not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical efinaconazole 10% solution is known to be an efficacious and safe treatment modality
      for toenail onychomycosis. This study will examine the compatibility of topical efinaconazole
      and nail polish in patients with distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO). It is
      hypothesized that the treatment of DLSO with efinaconazole 10% solution will not be adversely
      affected by the application of nail polish.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female age 19-70, as 19 is the legal age in Alabama

          -  DLSO affecting at least 1 great toenail diagnosed with positive potassium hydroxide
             microscopy and culture of a dermatophyte

          -  Suitable for application of topical antifungal therapy, in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Target toenail thickness of 3 mm or less as measured by digital caliper, as thickness
             greater than 3 mm may allow inclusion of patient with severe onychomycosis, and this
             was the criteria used in the pivotal trial using topical efinaconazole for
             onychomycosis

          -  Women of childbearing potential will be required to use birth control and a negative
             urine pregnancy test must be documented prior to initiating treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of immunosuppression or concurrent use of immunosuppressant drugs

          -  History of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          -  History of psoriasis or any other condition that might interfere with the toenail
             evaluation

          -  Three or more dermatophytomas (streaks) on the target nail

          -  Severe DLSO of the target nail

          -  Patients who cannot refrain from wearing gel or plastic based polishes that are used
             in salons and that require curing
