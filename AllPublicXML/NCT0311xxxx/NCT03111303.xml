    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in patients in intensive care often requires the mechanical
      ventilation (MV). Management and weaning from MV are given by specificity of this type of
      pulmonary inflammation. Enrolled in the retrospective, observational study were all patients
      older than 18 years staying at the ICU of University Hospital in Olomouc, between 1 January
      2011 and 31 December 2016. The determination of the parameters of the MV, ICU length of stay,
      hospital length of stay and mortality in HAP group were compared with the control group of
      patients without HAP.

      Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) development influences the parameters of mechanical
      ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, hospital length of stay, need of
      tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, reconnection to MV and mortality. We respect HAP definition:
      acute inflammation of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar structures and pulmonary
      interstitium. Clinically it is defined as the presence of newly developed or progressive
      infiltrates on chest radiographs plus at least two other signs of respiratory tract
      infection: temperature &gt;38 Â°C, chest pain, purulent sputum, leukocytosis or leukopenia, signs
      of inflammation on auscultation, cough and/or respiratory insufficiency. HAP is defined as
      pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more after admission, which was not incubating at the time
      of admission. A retrospective, observational study processing data on all consecutive
      intensive care patients older than 18 years of age between 1 January 2011 and 31 December
      2015. The aim was to determine the incidence of potential risk factors and their impact on
      the development of HAP. The primary outcome was investigation of the relationship between
      mechanical ventilation parameters and the presence of early- and late-onset HAP. Enrolled in
      the study were patients staying at the ICU of the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive
      Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University
      Hospital Olomouc, between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2016. The participants were all
      patients older than 18 years of age consecutively admitted to the ICU.
