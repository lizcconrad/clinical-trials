      The primary aim of this study is to determine how inhibitory neurobiological and
      neurocognitive processes relate to binge eating treatment outcome.

    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by reoccurring binge eating episodes that
      consist of eating a subjectively or objectively large amount of food over a period of time
      accompanied by a sense of loss control over eating, in the absence of recurrent compensatory
      behaviors (e.g., purging). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the current gold-standard
      treatment for reducing binge eating episodes in BED patients. The first-line of recommended
      CBT treatment is a self-guided intervention called CBT-Guided Self-Help (CBT-GSH). However,
      for a substantial minority of patients, CBT-GSH fails to reduce binge episodes after
      treatment. Preliminary findings of the literature suggests that individuals with BED possess
      deficits in inhibitory control as it relates to food-stimuli. We are studying how inhibitory
      neurobiological and neurocognitive processes relate to binge eating treatment outcome.

      This study involves a brief phone screen and research assessment (approximately 5 hours) to
      determine eligibility. Eligible participants will receive CBT-GSH, which will include a
      one-hour clinical intake followed by 6 therapy sessions (approximately 30 minutes each).
      Participants will also complete research assessments at mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3
      month follow-up intervals. Research assessments include a battery of questionnaires,
      computerized tasks, interviews, and a task using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIR)
      imaging.

    <description>Participants will receive a clinical intake (1 hour) and 6-sessions (approximately 25 minutes each) over 12 weeks of individual guided self-help CBT for eating disorders based on the treatment approach developed by Dr. Christopher Fairburn to use his self-help book Overcoming Binge Eating with the therapeutic guidance of clinician. Participants will be provided with a copy of Overcoming Binge Eating. The treatment is a largely behavioral treatment that focuses on helping patients engage in more regular eating, reduce dieting behaviors, and eliminate behaviors that contribute to binge eating. All participants in the study will receive the same treatment.</description>
