  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 7th most common cancer in
      humans; 9th in women (figures from the Association for Research against Cancer ARC). This
      cancer is a major public health problem on a global scale. Patients, whose diagnosis is often
      late, are at advanced stages of the pathology, even those who benefit from locoregional
      treatments have a poor prognosis and suffer from a lack of curative therapeutic strategies.
      CHC is highly refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy and so far the response rates to
      conventional systemic chemotherapy has provided a clinical benefit where survival was
      prolonged by more than 25% in patients with advanced CHC. Further efforts are needed to
      effectively manage HCC. Knowledge of the mechanisms regulating proliferation and inhibiting
      the sensitivity of transformed cells to apoptosis is the key to the development of more
      effective therapeutic strategies.

      Several new therapies, called targeted therapies, are tested in clinical trials. Currently,
      the most effective molecular agent for targeting the Raf pathway is sorafenib capable of also
      inhibiting tyrosine kinases of VEGFR and PDGFR. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, decreases
      the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro that inhibit the activity of targets present in
      tumor cells (CRAF, BRAF, V600E BRAF, c-KIT, and FLT-3) and tumor vascularization VEGFR-2,
      VEGFR-3, and PDGFR-beta). Despite the real benefit of this treatment, its efficacy (three
      months of overall survival) and its indication remain limited to Child-Pugh A, WHO 0-2
      patients in whom curative treatment is contraindicated. In addition, several patients have
      resistance to Sorafenib and thus find themselves in therapeutic failure, thus limiting the
      therapeutic choice for these patients.

      Resistance to treatment with Sorafenib limits the therapeutic choice. The mechanisms
      responsible for this resistance remain to be elucidated. Drug resistance proteins, MDR
      Multi-Drug Resistance, is a family of molecules whose expression increases in the cancer cell
      and ensures the repression of chemotherapy molecules outside the target cancer cell. This
      family includes the proteins ABCG2, MDR and MRP1. Our in vitro studies show that treatment of
      CHC Huh-7 cells with Sorafenib (10 mM) induces the specific expression of the transcripts of
      the MRP-1 protein without any effect on the expression of the ABCG2 and MDR protein. In
      addition, sorafenib has an effect on the expression of hepatocyte SLAMF3 receptor
      transcripts, a receptor recently identified in hepatocyte tissue. Indeed, it has been shown
      that the expression of SLAMF3 is lowered in the cancerous tissue compared to the healthy
      tissue and that the reintroduction of a strong expression in the cancer cell inhibits its
      proliferation by inhibiting the MAPK Erk pathway, Cancer cells to apoptosis and inhibits the
      uptake of tumor masses in the Nude mouse (I. Marcq, et al., 2013).
