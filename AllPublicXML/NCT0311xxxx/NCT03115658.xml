  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about encouraging physical activity among first
      degree female relatives of women with breast cancer. Physical activity can decrease a woman's
      risk of developing breast cancer, on average, by 20%; however, physical activity
      interventions have not been developed specifically for first degree female relatives of
      cancer patients, so currently, it is unknown whether standard physical activity interventions
      are sufficient for these women or if first degree female relatives would benefit from an
      enhanced physical activity intervention that addresses information about breast cancer risk
      reduction. To obtain information about first degree female relatives preferences for a
      physical activity intervention, this study seeks to have first degree female relatives of
      breast cancer patients enroll in a standard physical activity intervention developed for
      healthy men and women. After completion of the three month intervention, the women will be
      asked to participate in two, one-hour long focus group with 5-7 other participants. The first
      focus group is to discuss aspects of the physical activity intervention that they liked and
      did not like, as well as things they think may have enhanced the intervention and made it
      more relevant to other first-degree relative of breast cancer patients. In the second focus
      group, participants will be shown enhancements that were developed based on information
      gathered from the first focus group. Participants will be asked for their feedback on the
      newly developed enhancements.

    <description>Participants met with a PhD level psychologist experienced with health behavior change, to set a personalized exercise goal and plan. Participants were told the studies' goal to engage in 150 minutes of moderate intensity or greater physical activity each week, based on the ACSM recommendations, but participants were allowed to set any personal goal. Participants were also instructed on how to self-monitor their physical activity.
After the initial meeting all other intervention components were sent through the mail. The intervention consists of three types of print material that were mailed: stage-matched manuals, tailored feedback report, and tip sheets.</description>
