    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 30 opioid-dependent participants into an open-label pilot outpatient
      study of methods to facilitate induction and stabilization onto XR-NTX. There will be three
      different methods of XR-NTX induction using increasing doses of oral naltrexone and
      buprenophine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Procedure 1: 5-day induction with increasing doses of oral naltrexone. Participants will
      receive XR-NTX on day five together with buprenorphine, and will continue receiving
      buprenorphine for 4 weeks until they receive 2nd XR-NTX dose.

      Procedure 2: 10-day induction with buprenorphine administered daily and increasing daily
      doses of oral naltrexone beginning on day 2 . On day 10 participants will receive XR-NTX
      dose, and another one 4 weeks later. No buprenorphine will be given beyond day 10.

      Procedure 3: 10-day induction with buprenorphine administered daily and increasing daily
      doses of oral naltrexone beginning on day 2 . On day 10 participants will receive XR-NTX
      dose, and another one 4 weeks later. Buprenorphine will continue for 4 weeks until the 2nd
      XR-NTX dose.

      All participants will receive weekly therapy with a study psychiatrist. All participants will
      receive open-label medication.
