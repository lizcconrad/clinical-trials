  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies suggest that bariatric surgery is the most effective intervention for
      weight loss. Comparative effectiveness of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve
      Gastrectomy (SG) demonstrate that RYGB is significantly superior to SG in terms of weight
      loss and glycemic control. Both RYGB and SG increase GLP-1 concentrations which directly
      affect B-cell function. Data has shown that the postprandial rise in GLP-1 might affect
      feeding behavior after RYGB and to a lesser extent SG, where the increase in GLP-1 is less
      marked. In this study the investigators propose to randomize subjects undergoing SG to
      receive either placebo or Liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, to compare weight loss and
      CV risk factors.

    <textblock>
      A total of 75, non diabetic adults, scheduled for bariatric surgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester,
      will be enrolled. Of these, 25 will be scheduled for Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery (RYGB),
      while the remainder (50) will be scheduled for Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG). The study team will
      play no role in assignment of the surgical procedure. Following surgery, at month 3, subjects
      undergoing SG will be randomized to either Saxenda or placebo, subcutaneously once daily.
      Subjects randomized to Saxenda or placebo will take for the duration of the study (33
      months). Follow up study visits for all subjects will be timed to coincide with the standard
      clinical follow up visits at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36.

    <description>Saxenda is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist indicated as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients. Subjects will be recruited and screened prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. Subjects undergoing SG will be randomized 1:1 at month 3 post surgery to Saxenda, 0.6mg SQ daily, with weekly titration of 0.6mg until maintenance dose of 3mg/daily reached. Subjects will remain on study drug for duration of study (33 months). After undergoing surgery, study visits will be timed to coincide with the standard clinical follow-up visits at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36.</description>
