  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric condition that is associated with significant distress
      and disability. In addition to cognitive difficulties in domains such as attention, memory,
      and problem-solving, individuals with schizophrenia can experience visual-processing
      abnormalities, including impairments in visual acuity, low-contrast stimulus detection, and
      perceptual organization (i.e., perceiving visual information in an organized &quot;perceptual
      whole&quot;). These visual impairments are clinically significant, with research indicating that
      specific visual-processing alterations are significantly related to poorer performance on
      higher-level cognitive tasks, impaired facial emotion recognition, impaired reading ability,
      and worse functional outcomes. Despite such findings, very few studies have evaluated the
      therapeutic potential of interventions that are specifically designed to improve visual
      processing (&quot;visual remediation&quot;) for individuals with schizophrenia. Thus the aim of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of a computerized visual perceptual training program that
      targets low- and mid-level visual processes to improve visual, cognitive, and
      emotion-recognition functions in outpatients with schizophrenia through a small randomized
      controlled trial. The investigators will recruit up to 40 individuals with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder who are receiving treatment in Rutgers University Behavioral Health
      Care (UBHC) Partial Hospital Program; half will be randomized to receive the computerized
      visual training, which will be delivered in small groups over a period of 12-14 weeks. The
      specific aims of this study are to collect preliminary data on: 1) the feasibility of
      participant recruitment and retention, and tolerability of the treatment components of the
      study; and 2) the efficacy of computerized visual training (VT) to improve low- and mid-level
      visual processes, and higher-level cognitive and social-cognitive performance. Based on
      preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that the target number of participants will
      be successfully recruited and engaged in the VT intervention (n=16) and control condition
      (n=16), and that the participants who receive VT will demonstrate greater improvements on
      measures of low- and mid-level visual, higher-level cognitive, and social-cognitive functions
      compared to those who receive standard partial-hospital care without VT. The results of this
      initial trial will be used to inform the design and application for funding of a larger-scale
      investigation of visual remediation for individuals with schizophrenia.

    <description>The computerized visual training (VT) program that is being evaluated was developed by Aaron Seitz, who is a co-investigator on this project; it includes 1) ULTIMEYES, which targets broad-based visual functions, including low-level processes (e.g., visual acuity, contrast sensitivity), and 2) visual perceptual organization exercises, which target mid-level visual processes. Both elements of the program also involve higher-level visual functions, such as visual search and visual attention.</description>
