      Randomized, prospective study evaluating efficacy and safety of Goff transpancreatic
      septotomy vs. double wire technique for achieving biliary access in patients who fail initial
      cannulation at ERCP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selective placement of a guidewire into the bile duct (biliary cannulation) during endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is necessary for performing therapeutic biliary
      procedures. The success rate for biliary cannulation by experienced endoscopists during ERCP
      is approximately 85% with standard cannulation techniques. Inadvertent placement of the
      guidewire into the pancreatic duct rather than the bile duct often occurs when attempting
      selective biliary cannulation in technically challenging cases. When this occurs repeatedly,
      other approaches may be used to facilitate selective biliary cannulation, but there are few
      prospective studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of these approaches. Here the
      investigators evaluate two approaches for technically challenging biliary cannulation: one
      involving maintenance of a wire in the pancreatic duct, followed by repeat attempt at biliary
      cannulation (double wire technique) and one involving a small incision in the septum adjacent
      to the pancreas followed by repeat attempt at biliary cannulation (transpancreatic
      septotomy). This study is a prospective randomized trial comparing the rate of cannulation
      success, procedure duration and complications following these two approaches.
