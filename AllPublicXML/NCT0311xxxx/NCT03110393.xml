  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is the randomized comparison of two laryngeal mask (Intersurgical
      i-gel® and Ambu®AuraGain™) in obese patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the incidence of a difficult intubation lies between 4.5% -7.5%, the search for
      alternative airway devices has been forced in the past.

      As an option, the laryngeal mask is suitable, which has been used as a universal airway with
      a high degree of safety in routine anesthesia.

      There are numbers of different laryngeal masks available which have the characteristic to
      insert an endotracheal tube through the ventilation lumen.

      The indications for these laryngeal masks can be extended due to continuous improvements in
      the laryngeal masks, these laryngeal masks can also be used in obese patients. Obese patients
      generally have a 4-fold increased risk of a difficult airway, and a BMI over 35 is a
      predictor of a difficult tracheal intubation.

      There are no studies comparing the Intersurgical i-gel® Laryngeal Mask and the Ambu®AuraGain
      ™ Laryngeal Mask in obese patients.
