  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at comparing the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation and
      transcranial pulsed current stimulation on neurophysiological outcomes on patients with
      disorders of consciousness. This study also aims to evaluate the effects of these techniques
      on patients' level of consciousness.

    <intervention_name>Active tDCS</intervention_name>
    <description>A current intensity of 2mA will be used for 20minutes. The electrodes that will be used will be standard sponge electrodes. The anode will be place over the left prefrontal cortex and the cathode over the right supraorbitofrontal area.</description>

    <description>Sham tPCS will consist of applying the same parameters as for active but the corresponding device will be turned off after 30 seconds as to simulate the initial sensation of the active current. A current of 2mA will still be used (but turned off after 30 sec). The electrodes that will be used will be the same as for the active tPCS condition and the electrodes placement as well.</description>
