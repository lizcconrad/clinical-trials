  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune diseases represent a heterogeneous group of pathologies whose etiopathogenic
      mechanisms are most often unknown. Autoimmune diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality in young women and autoimmune thyroid diseases are the most common.

      Viral infections are the main environmental factors suspected of triggering autoimmune
      diseases. Several viruses are certainly involved, all of which are possibly capable of
      triggering an autoimmune response. However, the precise identification of the viruses
      involved remains to be established.

      It has been shown for the first time by the 2005 PHRC that enteroviral RNA is present in
      perioperative specimens of thyroid tissue. However, this case-control study did not show any
      difference between the thyroid group and the group other thyroid pathologies It has been
      recently published that Parvovirus is possibly involved in thyroiditis: the parvoviral genome
      is present in the thyroid tissue of Hashimoto thyroiditis operated and more precisely is
      present within the thyrocytes itself.

        Patients were recruited after PHRC 2005. Written information for the extension of the study
        will be sent with a copy of the summary of the scientific publication on Enterovirus (PHRC
