    <textblock>
      The LimiFlex™ Clinical Trial is a prospective, concurrently controlled, multi-center study to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of decompression and stabilization with the Empirical
      Spine LimiFlex™ Paraspinous Tension Band compared to decompression and transforaminal lumbar
      interbody fusion (TLIF) with concomitant posterolateral fusion (PLF) for the treatment of
      lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (Grade I per Meyerding classification) with spinal
      stenosis. Clinical trial sites will enroll solely LimiFlex subjects or solely TLIF/PLF
      subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LimiFlex™ Paraspinous Tension Band is a new stabilization option for patients being
      treated with surgical decompression for degenerative spondylolisthesis. The LimiFlex does not
      require pedicle screws to anchor to the spine; instead, two dynamic rods are attached by
      screws to pedicle-sparing straps which encircle adjacent spinous processes.
