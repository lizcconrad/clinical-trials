  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Astrocytomas / infantile desmoplastic gangliogliomas (DIA / DIG) are rare brain tumors
      usually affecting infants. They represent about 0.5% of all pediatric brain tumors. DIA / DIG
      occurs mainly in the first 2 years of life, with a sex ratio M / F of 1.7 to 1. From a
      histological point of view, DIA / DIG are neuroepithelial tumors. These tumors may have a
      purely astrocytic differentiation (DIA) or be composed of tumor cells with astrocytic and
      neuronal differentiation (DIG). The desmoplastic component is usually adjacent to the
      meninges and is defined by the increase or modification of connective tissues related to the
      presence of neoplastic cells with the formation of a collagen-rich extracellular matrix.

      Due to their benign biological behavior and favorable clinical course, they are classified in
      benign tumors, ie grade I according to the WHO classification. However, all tumors called DIA
      / DIG do not behave in a benign manner. Cases of metastatic cerebrospinal and malignant
      disorders have been described. It appears that about 40% of DIG cases require additional
      medical treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and / or new surgery, and 15% of infants
      and children with GIDD die from the disease. It is possible that what is grouped within the
      DIA / DIG is a heterogeneous group of tumors, evolution and prognosis very variable.

      The cytogenetic knowledge of DIA / DIG is very limited and is only available on small numbers
      of cases. Cytogenetic analyzes of several cases of DIG showed normal karyotypes. More
      recently, a CGH-Array study of 3 cases of DIA / DIG did not find any significant chromosomal
      gains or losses.

      It has been shown, however, that a mutation involving BRAF (BRAF rearrangement or BRAF V600E
      mutations) was a recurrent element in low grade gliomas, particularly in pediatric patients.

      It is also suggested that deregulation of BRAF activity in some DIA / DIG may indicate the
      importance of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway in signaling pathways for
      DIA / DIG development. However, data on the link between the BRAF gene and DIA / DIG remains
      very limited. Thus, further studies are needed to study the other members of the MAPK pathway
      in DIA / DIG (eg PI3K / AKT / mTOR). This could provide new therapeutic possibilities
      involving targeted therapies specific to the MAPK signaling pathway.

      It appears that DIA / DIG does not all behave in a benign manner and some would undergo a
      malignant transformation that could be due to chromosomal alterations such as, for example,
      TP53, PI3K. In addition, because of the limited number of cases, it would be interesting to
      study the characteristics of patients with DIA / DIG in order to study their characteristics
      and whether there are clinical, pathological, cytogenetic and / Molecular forms between
      benign and malignant forms.
