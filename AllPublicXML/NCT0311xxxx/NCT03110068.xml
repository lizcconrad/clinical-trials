  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presence of microvascular invasion can be estimated preoperatively, by some clinical imaging
      features such as patient characteristics, serum biomarkers and radiological features.
      Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) are
      routine preoperative conventional examinations for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in
      China. Combining features of CEUS, CECT and clinical factors may improve preoperative MVI
      assessment. The purpose of this study is to construct a nomogram for preoperative MVI risk
      estimation with these possible factors.

    <description>The Aplio SSA-770A or Aplio 500 (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 375BT convex transducer (frequency range, 1.9 to 6.0 MHz). CHI is used with a mechanical index that ranged from 0.06 to 0.10. After activating CHI mode, a bolus injection of 2.4 ml of SonoVue (Bracco, Milan, Italy) is administered intravenously via an antecubital vein, followed immediately by a flush of 5 ml of normal saline solution. The targeted lesion should be observed continuously for 5 minutes, and the entire arterial and portal venous phases and several repetitions of the late phase are stored on the hard disk. The arterial, portal venous and late phases are defined as 0-30 s, 31-120 s and 121-360 s after the injection, respectively.</description>

    <description>The Aquilion 64-slice helical CT machine (Tokyo, Japan) is used. The imaging protocol for CT examinations is as follows: 0.5 mm × 64 mm collimation, 120 kV, 150-200 mAs for 64-slice helical CT examination. The standard triphasic scan procedure is used. An unenhanced helical sequence scan through the liver will be performed first; thereafter nonionic iodinated contrast material (Ultravist, Schering, Berlin, Germany) (1.5 mL/kg) will be administered via antecubital vein with power injection at a rate of 4 mL/s for 64-slice helical CT. The arterial phase sequence is obtained 25-32 s after contrast material administration, followed by a portal venous phase sequence 70 s after contrast agent administration.</description>

        Between April 2017 and April 2019，all consecutive patients who will undergo curative
        resection (R0 resection) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in
        Guangzhou, China, for HCC based on the modified WHO classification of tumors of the
        digestive system, are considered for inclusion. By the eligibility criteria stated below,
        MVI presentative rate is 30-42% in chinese HCC population as reported, and an estimated 400
        patients will be needed for this study.
