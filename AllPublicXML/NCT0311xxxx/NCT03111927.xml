  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research study on the role of early life nutrition on brain and cognitive development during
      infancy and early childhood. Two blends of myelin-relevant nutrients at different levels will
      be compared and a breastfed group will be considered as epidemiological reference.

      This nutritional intervention study involves assessments in both the mother and her infant.
      The mother will be asked to complete self-report questionnaires and to undergo a brief
      cognitive assessment. If the mother is not breastfeeding, a study product will be provided
      and will be consumed by the infant daily up to 12 months of life. The study also involves
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans of the infant's brain while asleep as well as
      evaluations of general cognitive and social-emotional development.
