      Background Diabetic eye disease is the most frequent complication among the 320,000 Danes
      with diabetes. The formation of new vessels (PDR) in the inner part of the eye (retina) is a
      feared complication and a leading cause of blindness, since these vessels are fragile and
      often cause bleeding within the eye. Peripheral retinal laser treatment (PRP) halves the risk
      of blindness, but often comes with a high prize. The peripheral part of the retina is
      responsible for the visual field and the night vision, and PRP limits these abilities (i.e.
      loss of driving license).

      The technique of PRP has principally been the same for the past 40 years with standard
      treatment given for all patients. With this one size fits all approach, a substantial number
      of patients will either be treated too much or too little. Too little treatment is
      inefficient, and disease progression may occur. Excessive treatment may cause side effects
      like loss of visual fields and decreased night vision. Therefore, it is important to test if
      treatment can be applied on an individual basis to give high efficacy treatment with minimal
      side effects.

      IMPETUS 2018 - TREAT is the second of two studies aimed at making an individual design for
      retinal laser treatment. In IMPETUS 2018 - DETECT the investigators demonstrated that
      non-invasive examinations of the oxygen level and measurements of the retinal vascular tree
      provide important information of individual treatment response. For instance, if standard PRP
      led to three per cent higher retinal oxygen saturation, there was a 4-fold risk of disease
      progression despite treatment. Hence, such a patient would benefit from more treatment to
      avoid blindness. With these observations at hand, the investigators want to compare a less
      invasive treatment (individualized laser treatment) against the standard PRP.

      Another essential aspect in the treatment of PDR is to be able to give the right diagnosis
      and to evaluate the efficacy of laser treatment. So far, this has been performed by
      fluorescein angiography. However, this examination are highly person-dependent and unpleasant
      to patients, and a more objective approach is needed. Optical coherent tomography angiography
      (OCT-A) is a quick, noninvasive scanning of the retina which is ideal to visualize moving
      objects like blood within the retinal vessels. The method has been successfully implemented
      in a number of retinal diseases, but it has never been validated in PDR.

      Standard PRP is often performed in 3-4 sessions. However, it may be painful, and patients
      sometimes choose not to complete all sessions after the initial treatment has been given.
      There is insufficient knowledge of the patient-barriers to treatment, and it is important to
      address these in an individualized treatment design.

      Aim In this 6-month 1:1 randomized, prospective study the investigators want to investigate
      1) whether individualized retinal laser treatment compared with standard PRP has the same
      efficacy but less side effects, 2) whether OCT-A can be used as an objective marker for
      disease activity, and 3) to obtain a better understanding of patient-reported barriers to
      standard laser treatment PRP and whether these can be addressed with personalized retinal
      laser treatment.

      Setup Fifty eight consecutively recruited patients (1 May 2017 - 30 April 2018) with newly
      diagnosed PDR referred to the Department of Ophthalmology, OUH, and randomly assigned to
      standard PRP (n=29) or individualized laser treatment (n=29).

      Intervention Standard laser treatment is performed in all four quadrants of the retina.
      Individualized laser treatment is only performed in the part(s) of the retina with
      proliferation(s).

      Both treatments are carried out at baseline (BL), and additional treatment is given at month
      three (M3) and/or (M6), if necessary.

      Investigations Retinal digital images, fluorescein angiography, OCT-A (BL, M3, M6). Test of
      visual fields, dark adaptation and quality of life (BL, M6). Semi-structured interview will
      be performed with five patients who have received PRP in one eye and individualized laser
      treatment in the other eye. This will address treatment experience, potential barriers to
      treatment, etc.

      What to measure:

      Differences in need for retreatment, night blindness, visual fields, visual acuity, bleeding
      in the eye, surgery, and quality of life between the groups.

      Introduction Diabetes mellitus is an epidemic disorder, which in Denmark alone is affecting
      320,000 patients. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent long term complication to
      diabetes mellitus (1) and a feared cause of severe vision loss and blindness (2).

      Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the major cause of severe visual loss. Lack of
      oxygen to the retina (retinal ischemia) results in up-regulation of, in particular, the
      growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (3) followed by compensatory retinal
      proliferations. The neovasculature is fragile and often leads to vitreous hemorrhages or
      retinal detachment which makes the patient at high risk of irreversible vision loss (4).

      In 1976 it was shown that patients with severe PDR can halve the risk of severe vision loss
      by peripheral retinal laser treatment (photocoagulation panretinal, PRP) (5). This treatment
      reduces the retina's oxygen demand, which makes the VEGF concentration decrease and the
      proliferations shrink (5).

      PRP has largely been the same for the last 40 years. The standard treatment is basically the
      same for all patients (4 + 6), which leads to some patients being either over or under
      treated. If treatment is inadequate, patients are in risk of disease progression and thus
      difficult vision loss (7). On the other hand, the treatment may cause side effects in the
      form of loss of visual field (8-9), night vision loss (10) and accumulation of fluid in the
      eye's macula (diabetic macular edema) (11).

      This study is a continuum of the clinical project IMPETUS 2018 - DETECT, which aimed to
      identify the factors that were important for a successful PRP treatment of PDR. In the study
      the investigators prospectively followed 65 patients with newly diagnosed PDR. All patients
      received baseline navigated PRP, as in Scandinavia only offered at Odense University Hospital
      (OUH). Navigated panretinal laser with a Navilas® laser ensures optimized treatment (12),
      shorter treatment (13) and increased patient comfort (12-14). Treatment effect was
      investigated at month three and six, and if necessary, treatment was supplied. All the
      patients venous retinal oxygen saturation was measured to study whether this had any
      therapeutic value.

      The investigators observed that the retinal oxygen saturation was a strong predictor of
      treatment response. Compared to patients whose disease was slowed down after treatment,
      patients with progression three months after PRP had an increase in the venous retinal oxygen
      saturation (+ 4.1% vs. -1.8%, p = 0.02). Patients with an increase of at least 3.0% in venous
      retinal oxygen saturation had 4.0 times greater risk of disease progression than patients who
      were below this threshold (15). This observation is in line with another Danish study, which
      demonstrated that worsening of DR causes increased venous retinal oxygen saturation (16). By
      measuring if this increase in venous retinal oxygen saturation has slowed down, one can
      assess whether PRP treatment is sufficient.

      PDR is traditionally perceived as an ischemic disease, which initially affects the entire
      retina. In our above mentioned study the investigators were able to confirm the results
      regarding the venous retinal oxygen saturation in the affected segment of the retina, in 24
      of the patients in the study, who had only one peripheral proliferation. In these patients
      the oxygen saturation was increased with disease progression (+ 3.9% vs. -1.5%, p = 0.04).
      This indicates that the focal hypoxia are more important than previously thought, and thus
      the local treatment of the diseased area may be a treatment option that reduces the
      processing volume, thereby minimizing potential side effects.

      Retinal proliferations are fragile and often leak contrast fluid. When initiating the study,
      the investigators expected the leakage of fluorescein over time would be the optimal method
      to assess disease activity, but had to realize that this method was difficult to objectify
      (17). As an alternative to this objective evaluation, it is possible to observe the
      structural conditions at the interface between the retina and vitreous body (18), but
      technological limitations have so far prevented the possibility of repeated evaluations of
      the same lesion over time. Optical coherency tomography (OCT)-angiography is, however, a new
      method that can visualize retinal structures and potential development of these in detail
      (19).

      Purpose In a six-month randomized, prospective study of patients with newly diagnosed PDR the
      investigators want to investigate 1) whether individualized PRP compared with standard PRP
      has the same efficacy but less side effects and 2) whether OCT angiography can be used as a
      marker for disease activity in PDR.

      Hypothesis The investigators expect that 1) individualized PDR provides the same effect but
      fewer side effects and better quality of life than traditional PDR, and 2) OCT angiography
      has better sensitivity and specificity than wide field fluorescein angiography (FA) for the
      evaluation of disease activity by PDR.

      Methods

      Setup:

        -  Six-months 1: 1 randomized, prospective study.

        -  58 consecutively recruited patients with newly diagnosed PDR at the Department of
           Ophthalmology, University Hospital, included in the period 1 March 2017 to 28 February
           2018.

        -  Patients will be randomized to either 1) standard PRP with Navilas® (n = 29) or
           individualized PRP with Navilas® (n = 29). To ensure the same degree of ischemic
           disease, the two groups are balanced in relation to the number of retinal quadrants with
           proliferations.

      Intervention:

        -  Both treatments are carried out at baseline (BL) and supplemented if there is increasing
           disease activity at month three (M3) and / or month six (M6).

        -  Indications for additional treatment:

        -  Progression of PDR in the form of subjective growing lesion (assessed by ophthalmoscopy
