  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Convergent findings from several studies document that children, especially those who are
      already overweight or obese or from racial / ethnic minority groups, are at risk for
      accelerated weight gain during the summer months. Therefore, this project is comprised of
      three separate community-based interventions designed to increase access to healthy meals and
      physical activity opportunities to minimize excess summer weight gain in elementary school
      children from a diverse, low-income Rhode Island community. Specifically, we will complete a
      quasi-experimental study in which we will design and deliver a physical activity intervention
      in conjunction with the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to 50 children living in a
      low-income, urban community. We anticipate that the addition of physical activity programming
      to the SFSP, a federal program funded by the USDA which reimburses states for serving lunch
      meals to children during the summer in communities where at least 50% of students are
      eligible for free or reduced-price school meals, will increase both the acceptability and
      effectiveness of the SFSP and affect 1) physical activity levels, 2) sedentary behavior, and
      3) diet quality. The primary outcome (change in BMI z-score) will be compared between the 50
      kids enrolled in the active intervention and 50 children enrolled in the control condition,
      both recruited from the same community.
