  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on International Consultation on Incontinence (ICIQ-UI Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ-UI Short Form consists of 3 questions. The ICIQ score is a sum of the responses to the 3 questions with a total possible range of 0 (none) to 21 (all the time/a great deal).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on Medical, Epidemiological, Social Aging (MESA) Urinary Incontinence Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MESA Urinary Incontinence Questionnaire consists of 3 sections: General questions (unscored), Urge Incontinence (6 questions), and Stress Incontinence (9 questions). The scored questions can range from 0 (never) to 3 (often). The score for the Urge Incontinence is the sum of the responses/18, and the score for the Stress Incontinence section is the sum of the responses/27.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on Linear Analogue Self Assessment (LASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The LASA questionnaire consists of 6 questions, each ranging from 0 (as bad as it can be) to 10 (as good as it can be). Therefore, the total possible scores would range from 0 (as bad as it can be) to 60 (as good as it can be).</description>
