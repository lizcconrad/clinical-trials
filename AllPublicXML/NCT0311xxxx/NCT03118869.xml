      The b2-adrenoceptor (b2AR) mediates the physiological responses in the airway, which include
      bronchodilation, bronchoprotection. The b2-adrenoceptor (b2AR) mediates the physiological
      responses in the airway, which include bronchodilation, bronchoprotection, Enhanced
      mucociliary clearance.

      The b2AR gene is located on chromosome 5q31-q32, a region that is genetically linked to
      asthma and related phenotypes. There are three best known polymorphisms in the coding region
      of the b2AR gene that can modulate the function of the receptor.

      Asthma is a complex disease and has a strong genetic component in its pathogenesis. So far,
      considerable efforts have been made to evaluate the association between genetic variants and
      asthma risk, and numerous genes have been identified as asthma Reporting Items susceptible
      genes.
