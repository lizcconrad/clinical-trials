      Pemetrexed in combination with erlotinib as a salvage treatment in patients with metastatic
      biliary tract cancer (BTC) who failed gemcitabine containing chemotherapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) is rare in the Europe and the United States, but not uncommon
      in Asia and Latin America. The tumor arises from the ductular epithelium of the biliary tree
      within the liver (intrahepatic), the extrahepatic ducts (extrahepatic), or the gallbladder.
      Intrahepatic cancer is steadily increasing in the Western world. BTCs carry a poor prognosis
      with 1-year survival rate of 25%. Although surgery remains the only curative treatment for
      BTC, most patients present with advanced disease and die within a few months of diagnosis.
      While a combination of gemcitabine and platinum agents seems to be a conclusive treatment
      option as first-line treatment until now, the role or the optimal regimen for second-line
      treatment has not been established.

      Pemetrexed, a multitarget antifolate which inhibits thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate
      reductase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, was approved for the treatment of
      lung cancer and mesothelioma. In addition to its therapeutic efficacy, pemetrexed has
      tolerable safety profile and is considered as important therapeutic option for patients of
      poor performance statue or older age. Pemetrexed was studied in combination with gemcitabine
      in BTC patients and needs further research in BTC patients. Erlotinib is EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor. In BTC and pancreatic cancer, erlotinib showed prolonged survival in combination
      with chemotherapy. Moreover, the addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine and oxaliplatin showed
      antitumour activity in our previous phase III trial. And combination of pemetrexed and
      erlotinib showed tolerable safety profile in lung cancer trial.

      So we plan this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed in combination with
      erlotinib as a second line treatment in biliary tract cancer
