  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the department for substance use disorders at Uppsala University Hospital there are two
      wards. One that is locked, where the patients that are emitted can not go out to smoke and
      another ward where there is a possibility to go out and smoke during the day.

      The smoking habits on those two floors will be compared and how they feel about smoking will
      be evaluated when they are admitted to the ward, at discharge, after 1 mont and after 6
      months.

      another ward where there is a possibility to go out and smoke during the day.

      The smoking habits on those two wards will be compared and how they feel about smoking will
      be evaluated when they are admitted to the ward, at discharge, after 1 mont and after 6
      months.

      The questionnaires that will be used for evaluation are:

      Fagerst√∂ms test for nicotine dependence, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and Drug
      Use Disorders Identification Test and the symptoms of Tobacco withdrawal mentioned in DSM-V.

      Parameters that will be measured are: pulse, bloodpressure, peak expiratory flow, wight and
      height.

      There will also be some questions about their smoking and snuff habits, if they have tried to
      quite smoking Before and how they were affected by the stop.
