  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Human Immunome Program is a large-scale, open-source effort seeking to fill a major gap
      in our knowledge of the immune system. The power of the immune system to fight disease lies
      in its ability recognize and adapt to an astonishing range of threats from viruses, parasites
      and bacteria to cancer cells. Underlying this ability is a vast but specific set of genes and
      molecular structures known as the human immunome, or the &quot;parts list&quot; of the immune system.
      This study aims to decipher the genetic sequences that make up this part list and link it to
      information about a person's microbiome composition and characteristics such as health
      history, race, and demographics over time. This information, made freely available to the
      public for use in research in de-identified form, will allow investigators to answer a wide
      variety of different questions about immune system function. This could transform how we
      diagnose, prevent and treat disease though the identification of new biomarkers while
      enabling highly targeted, computationally designed vaccines and therapies that reduce time
      and risk of product development.
