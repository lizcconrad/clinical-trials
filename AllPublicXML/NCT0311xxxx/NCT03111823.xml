    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well aerobic exercise works in improving quality of
      life and health-related outcomes in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer undergoing
      chemotherapy. Aerobic exercise during chemotherapy may improve quality of life and reduce
      fatigue and inflammation in the blood related to heart disease and diabetes in patients with
      stage IV colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether a 6-week indoor or outdoor aerobic exercise program is feasible in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) undergoing chemotherapy and to explore
      patient's preferences for indoor versus (vs.) outdoor exercise.

      II. To determine the effects of a 6-week indoor or outdoor aerobic exercise program on
      cancer-related fatigue and quality of life (QOL) in patients with mCRC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 6-week indoor or outdoor aerobic exercise program on body
      composition (lean body mass, fat mass, body fat percentage [%]) and biomarkers of systemic
      inflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-a], C-reactive protein
      [CRP]) in patients with mCRC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 6-week exercise program on cardiovascular (CV) function.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo aerobic exercise sessions consisting of cycling or walking at a low-moderate
      intensity and progressing to moderate intensity for 30 minutes 2 times a week for up to 8
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 weeks and at weeks 13,
      19, and 31.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer

          -  Undergoing chemotherapy (have had 1 or 2 chemotherapy cycles infused at time of data
             collection; this will allow for any systemic inflammatory changes due to chemotherapy
             to set in); only patients with 1st or 2nd line therapy will be included

          -  Able to initiate a supervised exercise program (free from any CV, respiratory or
             musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity)

          -  Free from uncontrolled chronic disease including diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid
             disease

          -  Currently participate in less than 60 minutes of physical activity/week

          -  Willing to travel to the exercise facility at University of Southern California (USC)
             (parking fees and public transportation permits will be provided)

          -  Speak English or Spanish

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension or other uncontrolled chronic disease (e.g. diabetes
             mellitus, thyroid disease, pulmonary disease, etc)

          -  Moderate to highly active level of physical activity (e.g. currently participating in
             &gt; 60 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly)

          -  Orthopedic or other restrictions or contraindications to exercise

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants
