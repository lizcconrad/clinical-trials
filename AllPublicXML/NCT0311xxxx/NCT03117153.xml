      The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      single-center(Department of periodontology, Yonsei University Dental Hospital) study.

      98 patients were assessed for eligibility. Since two patients did not meet the inclusion
      criteria, 96 subjects were randomly assigned to either the test group.The test group was
      provided a liquid toothpaste and a control group received placebo. At the end of the study,
      results were analyzed for 87 patients : 42 in the test group and 45 in the control group .

      The study protocol requested 4 visits- once every two weeks-of each subjects in the center.
      At the baseline, subjects were randomly allocated to the test group or the control group.
      Scaling and tooth brushing instruction were performed and all of the clinical parameters were
      evaluated. At the 2- and 4-week examinations, clinical parameters of GI, PI were evaluated
      and at the 6-week examination, all of the clinical parameters were evaluated.

      Also, Microbiological quantitative analysis of this procedure was performed at the baseline
      and 6-week examinations.
