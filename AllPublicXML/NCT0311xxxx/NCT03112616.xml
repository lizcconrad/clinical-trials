  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the causes of disability in patients suffering from a stroke is postural imbalance.
      Sensory stimulation improves the postural symmetry of the subject transitorily and they are
      thought to have an effect on the spatial frame of reference through a sensory recalibration.
      Studies have shown that sensory stimulation by vibration of neck muscles have an immediate
      effect on static balance and when walking. The objective of this preliminary study is to test
      the long-lasting effects of repetitive neck muscle vibrations on postural disturbances in
      standing position and on spatial frame reference in chronic patients.

  <detailed_description>

      The hypothesis of this study is that the proprioceptive repeated stimulation by vibration of
      neck muscles in the long term improved postural asymmetry in connection with the egocentric
      representation of body disorders.

      The effect of vibration simultaneously on improving postural asymmetry and on improving
      markers of the perception of the body in space (LBA, SSA, Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV),
      Rod and frame) will be assessed.

    <description>The primary evaluation criteria is the percentage of the Weight Bearing Asymmetry on the hemiparetic lower limb (WBA) calculated as the mean of 4 trys, each based on a 30 seconds duration with the two eyes open (OP) and then again with the two eyes closed.
