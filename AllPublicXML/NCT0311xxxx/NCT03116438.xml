      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the CADence device by
      comparing it to the results obtained from standard coronary angiography. The CADence device
      collects acoustic (sound) data from locations on the chest for the purpose of identifying
      coronary artery turbulence, which may be indicative of coronary artery disease.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the CADence device by
      comparing it to the results obtained from standard coronary angiography. The CADence device
      collects acoustic (sound) data from locations on the chest for the purpose of identifying
      coronary artery turbulence, which may be indicative of coronary artery disease (CAD). The
      CADence3 is an electronic auscultatory device, intended to provide support to the physician
      in the evaluation of patients' heart sounds. Turbulence within the coronary arteries produces
      a distinct audio signal that can be identified using a proprietary algorithm built into the
      device. The CADence System is indicated for patients that have chest pains in addition to at
      least two other coronary artery disease risk factors such as obesity and hypertension. The
      device intends to be an alternative screening tool to nuclear stress testing for detecting
      coronary artery blockages. CADence acquires and records the acoustic signals of the heart and
      analyzes these signals.
