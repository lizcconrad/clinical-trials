    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, phase II clinical study is designed to assess the efficacy of
      preemptive treatment with topical steroids in preventing the papulopustular eruption induced
      by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRI) treatment in cancer patients.
      Participants will be followed up for 6 weeks of twice daily application of triamcinolone
      cream to the face, chest, and back.
