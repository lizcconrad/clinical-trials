  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is being done so we can determine the quality of the protein present in
      Canadian lentils. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and protein quality is
      determined by the amount of amino acids present and by their bioavailability (their
      absorption and use by the body). Some amino acids are essential which means they must be
      obtained from the diet. If any one of the essential amino acids is missing in the diet, the
      body cannot make proteins that are used to repair tissue build bone, teeth, etcâ€¦ Lentils as a
      food source contain low amounts of the essential amino acid methionine which makes its
      protein incomplete. The amino acids in lentils are also affected by cooking. Our objective is
      to determine the amount of methionine in lentils that the body can use. We will test lentils
      by studying them after cooking them in a stew, on their own and by combining the lentil stew
      with rice in a mixed meal to make a more complete protein.

      This research is being done in order to bridge the gap between knowledge of protein
      requirement and the amount of food needed to meet that requirement. Results from this study
      will be important for recommendations guiding food choices of lentils as a major protein
      source in the diet.

      Previously the quality of dietary protein for human consumption was studied in animals. This
      study is being done in humans because studies in animals are not directly applicable to
      humans. Excessive animal protein consumption is also linked to cardiovascular disease. Plant
      protein sources like lentils are important alternatives shown to &quot;enhance ecosystem
      resilience, and improve human health.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will receive 3 different amounts of lentils
      which will contain different amounts of the essential amino acid methionine as well as 3
      different amount of lentils complemented with rice. The lentils will be cooked in a stew
      served on its own or served with the rice. The quality of the protein in the lentils will be
      compared to the quality of a reference protein (egg protein) by giving you 4 reference diets
      containing amino acids make up like the amino acids in egg protein. The amount of lentils you
      receive will be provided in a random order.

      Breath samples will be collected after the 4th meal in 15 min intervals for 1 hour. Breath
      collection will resume again two and a half hours after the 5th meal every 15 minutes until
      30 minutes after the last meal. A total of 52 breath samples will be collected during each of
      the 3rd study day.
