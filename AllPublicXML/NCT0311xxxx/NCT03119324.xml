  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) has been recently introduced with success in the
      management of the pain associated to this condition. This double blind placebo controlled
      clinical trial analyzes a new home LLLT protocol to verify whether it was possible to avoid
      to the repeated presence at dental chair required by traditional LLLT protocols.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 patients with pain deriving from mono‐ or bi‐lateral TMJDs were enrolled in the study.
      Randomly subdivided in 3 groups. The Study Group (SG n=30) receive a LLLT by the B‐cure
      Dental Pro 808nm diode low level laser (Biocare Enterprise Ltd, Good Energies, Haifa, IL).
      The therapeutic protocol previews 2 applications a day for 7 consecutive days performed at 5
      Joules/min, 250 milliWatts and 15 KiloHertz for 8', (40 Joules total each) in contact mode
      over the painful area.

      The first application is performed at the Department of Oral Sciences of Sapienza University
      of Rome, by a laser expert blinded examiner and serves as instruction. The remnants
      applications must be performed at home by the patients themselves.

      The Placebo Group (PG n=30) follows the same protocol by a sham device, seemingly identical
      to the effective ones, including the pointer light, but devoid of the main diode source.

      The Drug Control Group (DG n=30) follows the conventional drug treatment for TMJDs related
      pain, 2 non‐consecutive cycles of 5 days of nimesulide (100mg a day), interspersed with one 5
      days cycle of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (10 mg a day) Two pain evaluation are registered,
      before and after treatment.

    <description>Thirty patients receiving LLLT by the B-Cure® diode laser (Good Energies, Haifa, Israel) 808nm low power device at 5 Joules/min, 250 milliWatts 15 KiloHertz for 8', (40 Joules each) in contact mode directly over the painful area, twice a day for 7 consecutive days.
The laser must be placed directly over the painful area, after having cleaned it with a soft cotton socket to remove skin impurities that could interfere with therapeutic light absorption.
The first application is performed at the Department of Oral Sciences of Sapienza University of Rome by a laser expert investigator and serves as instruction. The remnants must be performed by the patients themselves at home, once on the first day and twice a day in the following 6 days.
Patients were instructed to perform the applications always at the same time.</description>

From day 1 to 5, patients assumed 50mg of Nimesulide Ratiopharm®, twice a day; from 6th to 10th day they assumed 10mg of Flexiban® in single dose, from day 11 to 15 they assumed 50mg of Nimesulide Ratiopharm® twice a day.
