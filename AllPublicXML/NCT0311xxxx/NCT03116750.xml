  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ASPIREX®S Endovascular System is a rotating and aspirating catheter system. It is
      intended to be used for the percutaneous transluminal removal of fresh thrombotic or
      thromboembolic material from native blood vessels (or vessels fitted with stents, stent
      grafts or native or artificial bypasses) outside the cardiopulmonary, coronary and cerebral
      circulations.

      CAPTUREX® , a catheter with a filter basket, is intended to be used for the filtering of
      emboli from blood vessels during potentially embolizing procedures on the patient.

      ASPIREX®S and CAPTUREX® are CE-marked (Class III) medical devices. In this study the
      effectiveness and safety in the removal of thrombi in veins is assessed under real life
      setting.
