  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Understanding Needs&quot; Project is designed to gain an understanding of the needs of
      informal caregivers. Researchers have designed a survey to highlight activities of daily
      living involved in the caregiving role, pain related to caregiver, and potential services
      desired. The initial phase of the study will consist of a focus group of informal caregivers
      to discuss current needs. The survey will then be refined based on knowledge gained from the
      focus group, and feedback from expert researchers. The refined survey will then be
      disseminated to caregivers throughout the country.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Understanding Needs&quot; Project highlights the needs of informal caregivers. An informal
      caregiver is defined as a person who regularly provides unpaid care to another adult. The
      survey will ask about pain intensity, pain interference, and relation of pain to the
      caregiving role. The survey will also address which activities the caregiver assists with,
      and activities now lacking since becoming a caregiver. One focus group will be completed to
      refine the contents of the survey prior to dissemination. The results will be analyzed by an
      occupational therapist, with a focus on how pain may connect to assistance with daily living
      activities provided to the care recipient. The needs of caregivers within the community will
      be compiled to inform future involvement in remediation of needs.
