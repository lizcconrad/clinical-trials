  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A hallmark of our survival in the real world and of our capacity to navigate the complex
      social interactions of human society is our ability to show behavioral adaptation. Adaptation
      can be necessary for a number of reasons, making the study of the process challenging. Two
      classes of event can signal a need for adaptation: 1) Events caused by one's own actions and
      specifically FeedBack -FB- from those actions (e.g. the investigators adapt their strategy
      after an erroneous choice), and 2) Events not linked to our actions, specifically
      Action-InDependent Events -AiDE- (e.g. the investigators adapt their strategy after a change
      of rule). These two types of information - FB and AiDE - will frequently occur concurrently.
      A critical and difficult part of adapting appropriately involves resolving the difference
      between the two. So for example an incorrect FB can occur because the investigators made an
      error, or because something unexpected in the environment has changed -the rule switched,
      someone cheated, etc. The Investigators must work out which it is, as they will frequently
      require different behavioral adaptations. Their task is made even more complex by the fact
      that the dynamics of evidence accumulation after FB vs AiDE are very different. FB has a
      direct temporal and causal link to an executed action, which means that the investigators are
      certain to derive information about a given action from a given FB. In contrast, AiDE have no
      such contiguity and no initial relation to actions, which means that the investigators must
      accumulate evidence to identify the appropriate adaptation to an AiDE. So the crucial dilemma
      is this: after an unwanted outcome, should the investigators adapt as if they made an error
      and received a negative FB, or should they continue to accumulate evidence as if there has
      been an AiDE to which they need to know how to adapt. Animals are able to resolve this credit
      assignment problem, as evidenced by their ability to appropriately adapt their behavior. A
      breakdown of this ability to link unexpected events to their correct cause would seem to be
      at the source of impairments in a wide range of psychological and neurological disorders,
      from addiction and OCD to psychological symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Yet the neural basis
      of this process is currently unknown, and FB and AiDE processing have been assessed
      separately so far. ADAPCO will provide unprecedented characterization of brain systems
      critically involved in learning from and adapting to FB, AiDE, and their interactions, thanks
      to fMRI studies.

    <description>Subjects should perform simple tasks to map the premotor areas of the medial frontal cortex. In this context, they will have to perform hand, tongue, ocular movements for about 20s. Additionally, as part of a control condition, they will need to perform eye fixation on a cross shown at the center of the screen for about 20s.</description>
