  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will interrogate an existing data set to examine whether
      genetic variants contribute to an inverse association between weight status and cognitive
      function. Investigators hypothesize that body mass index (BMI) will be inversely related to a
      number of variables measuring cognitive function, and that that this inverse relation will be
      at least partially attributable to genetic variants which influence both BMI and cognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will use existing data collected as part of the Texas Twin Project (TTP). TTP
      collected neuropsychological task data on cognition (executive functioning and general
      cognitive abilities) from a computerized test battery, as well as BMI data, on a sample of
      869 twins. Investigators will use information from the known extent of genetic and
      environmental sharing between members of MZ (monozygotic; identical) and DZ (dizygotic;
      fraternal) twin pairs to quantify the genetic correlation between measures of cognition and
      BMI using biometric genetic modeling under the assumptions of the classical twin model. The
      specific aims are:

        -  To examine the association between BMI and executive functioning (EF) in a sample of 869
           twin children, ages 7 to 15 years old, who participated in the Texas Twin Project (TTP)

        -  To gauge the specificity of EF-BMI relations relative to academic achievement and
           general cognitive abilities.

        -  To examine the relative contribution of genetic and environment influences to the
           inverse association between BMI and EF
