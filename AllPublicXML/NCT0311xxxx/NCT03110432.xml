    <textblock>
      This is a prospective German registry for patients with dyslipidemia with very high
      cardiovascular risk who principally meet the Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (G-BA) stipulations
      for Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin like type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) use, and are
      treated by office-based cardiologists or in lipid ambulances.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is purely observational, and will document data from the patient charts only.
      Treatment of patients will not be changed by this study, and all clinical decisions
      (including on frequency of visits) will be upon the discretion of the physician. No blood
      samples must be taken solely for the purpose of the study.

      The registry will include two types of centers: 1) office-based cardiologists and 2)
      specialized lipid ambulances (outpatient departments).

      Data on patient disease and treatment history will be collected a first documentation
      (retrospectively).

      The documentation time is 3 years per patient. After the baseline visit, patients are
      followed-up every 6 ± 2months (last visit at month 36). This interval is considered narrow
      enough not to miss important events (safety reporting, cardiovascular events,
      hospitalizations).

      Patients with stable (maintenance) lipid-lowering therapy (including those with existing
      PCSK9i therapy) or those with any therapy changes (including newly initiated PCSK9i
      treatment) will be documented in this study. Compared to the former group with stable drug
      treatment, the latter group will likely have major LDL-C changes during the first few weeks,
      which will be accounted for by (retrospective) monthly documentation in the first 3 months
      (data will be documented at the 6-month visit.

      The documentation periods will be substantially longer than in the controlled studies of the
      PCSK9i (endpoints were as early as 3 months), and thus will provide much-needed information
      about the long-term effects on LDL-C and other lipid parameters, safety, and drug retention
      rates. Longer follow-up periods would likely be compromised by high rates of (administrative)
      discontinuation rates.
