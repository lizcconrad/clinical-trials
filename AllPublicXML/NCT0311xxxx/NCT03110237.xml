  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many survivors of acquired brain injury (ABI) suffer from decreased balance and increased
      risks of falls. Previous studies indicate that balance training improves balance, reduces
      falls, and increases walking speed and balance confidence. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if a multidimensional balance training based on the FallProof(TM) approach achieves
      better improvements in balance and walking performance than the current practice .
      Participants will be assigned to: 1)a task-oriented circuit training balance class (current
      practice), or 2) balance training class based on the FallProof(TM) approach. Standardized
      tests will determine if participating in balance training helps improve balance, walking
      speed and balance confidence.

      The purpose of this pilot research study is to determine if a balance training (BT) class
      based on the FallProof(TM) approach achieves better balance and mobility outcomes than the
      current practice. The FallProof's approach focuses on multiple components of balance
      impairment including multisensory, postural strategy and centre of gravity control training.
      Current practice is a task-oriented circuit training balance class.

      ABI survivors may have muscle weakness, decreased coordination and sensory loss, which
      contribute to reduced balance, difficulty with functional mobility and activities of daily
      living. Balance control provides the foundation for a person's ability to stand, walk and
      function independently. Previous studies indicate that balance training (BT) improves
      balance, reduces falls, increases walking speed and balance self-efficacy for ABI patients
      .The Ottawa Panel Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for ABI Rehabilitation
      supported the use of BT based on the research evidence. Interventions such as task-oriented
      training, multisensory training, trunk control training and perceptual exercises demonstrate
      positive effect on balance and mobility outcomes. To our knowledge, there are few studies
      that have examined a multidimensional approach to BT.

      A systematic review concluded that exercises performed for 20-60 minutes, 3-4 times a week
      for 6-12 weeks can improve balance in ABI patients. However, Treacy et al demonstrated that
      inpatient BT for just 2 weeks can improve balance compared to a control group who received
      traditional exercise interventions.

      At GF Strong Rehabilitation Center (GFS), the usual care provided to the ambulatory ABI
      patients consists of individualized one to one physiotherapy treatment, as well as a high
      level BT class. Currently, this BT class is a circuit training class that focuses on
      task-oriented gait exercises. FallProof balance training is a group- based approach that
      includes multisensory, postural strategy, centre of gravity control and gait pattern
      training. It was originally developed for older adults with impaired balance; but there is no
      research on the effectiveness of this approach for ABI patients. The FallProof approach has
      been introduced to the low level and intermediate level BT class at GFS, for ABI patients
      with sever and moderate balance impairments. These classes received positive feedback from
      patients and therapists. Patients reported improved functional mobility and confidence after
      attending the class. However, there was no functional outcome measurements collected to
      compare the effectiveness of the previous class and the new FallProof class. We plan to
      modify the current circuit training high level balance class with the FallProof approach in
      the spring of 2017. Before introducing the FallProof class, we would like to collect outcome
      measures with the current BT class for three months, and then collect collect data with the
      new class for comparison. We would like to determine if a multidimensional group based BT
      treatment approach is more effective at improving functional outcomes compared to the current
      practice.

    <description>There are four categories of exercises in this approach including: center of gravity control training (e.g. multi-directional weight shifts in standing, standing with altered base of support), multisensory training (e.g. standing on compliant surfaces, eyes open/closed), postural strategy training (e.g. resisted perturbation to facilitate ankle, hip or step strategy), and gait pattern variation training (e.g. walking with altered base of support , walking over and around obstacles). Each training category will be allocated 5 minutes with two exercises in each category. An additional 5 minutes will be allotted for games to challenge balance (balloon volleyball, pass the potato, circle soccer).There will be opportunity for group discussion and observational learning.</description>
