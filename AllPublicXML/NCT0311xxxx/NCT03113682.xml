    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to pilot cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-RD) for 10
      individuals ages 10 and older who have rumination disorder
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rumination disorder (RD; also known as &quot;rumination syndrome&quot;) is a disordered eating behavior
      characterized by the repeated regurgitation of food during or soon after eating. The
      frequency of repeated regurgitation of food typically occurs at least a few times per week,
      frequently daily with subsequent re-chewing, re-swallowing, or spitting out of the
      regurgitated material. The widely used technique for treatment of RD has typically been
      diaphragmatic breathing, which works by serving as a competing response to abdominal wall
      contractions, which is hypothesized to trigger regurgitation. However, the efficacy of
      diaphragmatic breathing remains unknown and has mainly been delivered through a one-session
      instruction with an occasional follow-up.

      In the absence of evidence-based treatments for RD, the investigators, alongside a
      collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Thomas at the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program
      (EDCRP) at Massachusetts General Hospital, have created a manualized treatment,
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Rumination Disorder (CBT-RD) informed by published case
      reports and currently in use at EDCRP at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Psychological
      Services Center at Drexel University. CBT-RD targets the habitual contraction of the
      abdominal wall and preceding events through the use of habit reversal, using primarily
      diaphragmatic breathing as a competing response.

      This study involves a phone screen to determine eligibility, followed by 5-8 sessions of
      CBT-RD (approximately 50 minutes each). A battery of questionnaires will be administered at
      pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up intervals.
