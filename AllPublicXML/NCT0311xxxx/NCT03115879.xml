      Introduction: Lower extremity weakness associated with musculoskeletal pathology can cause
      activity limitations. Physical therapy intervention in the form of exercise is commonly
      directed at improving muscular performance, however, neuromuscular adaptations may limit the
      effectiveness of traditional strengthening exercises. Manual therapy techniques have been
      used as a disinhibitory intervention to increase muscle activation and strength before
      participating in strengthening exercises or performing functional tasks While there is recent
      evidence to support joint mobilization as a valuable manual therapy disinhibitory
      intervention Currently, there is no evidence to substantiate anecdotal experience that a
      HVLAT hip distraction mobilization improves muscle performance in subjects with lower
      extremity pathology and lower extremity weakness. The purpose of this study was to determine
      if a HVLAT hip distraction mobilization would result in an immediate change of maximal force
      output of the quadriceps, gluteus maximus and gluteus medius.

      Methods: Forty individuals with a lower extremity pathology volunteered for this study.
      Inclusion criteria were having a unilateral musculoskeletal pathology, being greater than 18
      years of age, 10% decrease in muscle strength in symptomatic side compared to healthy side,
      and absence of medical precautions that would prevent a maximal effort strength test and
      exclusion criteria included individuals with a history lower extremity recent muscle or
      tendon ruptures (within the past 6 months) and postoperative knee, hip and ankle surgery.
      Demographic data, including diagnosis from referring physician were collected. All subjects
      completed the Lower extremity function scale (LEFS). A single evaluator blinded to the
      involved extremity was responsible for quadriceps, gluteus medius and maximus strength
      analysis pre and post mobilization of both symptomatic and non-symptomatic sides. The subject
      underwent the HVLAT hip distraction mobilization of the symptomatic side, and an immediate
      re-assessment of strength of both symptomatic and non-symptomatic sides followed the
      mobilization.
