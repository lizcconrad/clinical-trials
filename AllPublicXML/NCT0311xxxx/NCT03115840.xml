  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of older adults are hospitalized for a critical illness each year and although they
      are more likely than ever to survive this illness, they commonly face significant morbidity
      in the form of disabilities in basic self-care activities and in mobility in the months and
      years afterwards. A better understanding of the underlying risk factors for disability
      following critical illness is greatly needed, including the effect that activity during
      hospitalization may have on these outcomes. Therefore, we designed the Measuring OutcomeS of
      Activity in Intensive Care (MOSAIC) observational study to evaluate the relationship between
      activity (measured more rigorously than in prior investigations) and disability, physical
      function, and cognitive function in survivors of critical illness 3 and 12 months after ICU
      discharge.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MOSAIC observational study will measure activity in critically ill patients for up to 28
      days in the hospital using two different, objective measures, a clinical mobility scale and
      accelerometry. We will evaluate the independent association between activity and outcomes 3
      and 12 months after ICU discharge. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine the relationship
      between activity and disability in ADLs and mobility. Aim 2a will determine the relationship
      between activity and physical and cognitive function. Aim 2b will evaluate physical and
      cognitive function as mediators of long-term disability. Aim 3a will determine the
      relationship between activity and biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation. Aim 3b will
      determine the relationship between these biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation and
      disability, physical and cognitive function.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. adult patients (≥18 years old),

          2. in a medical or surgical ICUs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and

          3. are being treated for respiratory failure or shock.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Rapidly resolving organ failure criteria, indicated by planned immediate
             discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, NIPPV, and/or vasopressors at the time of
             screening for study enrollment, such that the patient will no longer meet inclusion
             criteria.

          2. Cumulative hospital days (ICU plus non-ICU) of five or greater in the last 30 days
             prior to meeting all inclusion criteria.

          3. Inability to live independently at baseline due to acquired or congenital disabling,
             physical, cognitive or mental health disorder requiring institutionalization (e.g.,
             nursing home, skilled nursing facility, group home, long-term acute care hospital,
             rehab facility) or any patient who resides outside an institution with an inability to
             walk without the assistance of another person (e.g., patients with quadriplegia,
             paraplegia, double amputees, those with residual paralysis from stroke).

          4. Acute or subacute severe neurologic (e.g., stroke anoxic injury, spinal cord injury)
             that is expected to prevent the patient from living independently after hospital
             discharge.

          5. Body mass index &gt;50

          6. Active substance abuse or psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia or schizo-affective
             disorder), recent (within the past 6 months) serious suicidal gesture necessitating
             hospitalization

          7. Blindness, deafness, or inability to understand English that will preclude follow-up
             evaluation. Patients with laryngectomies and those with hearing impairments are
             eligible for enrollment if their medical condition permits them to communicate with
             research staff.

          8. Expected death within 24 hours of enrollment or lack of commitment to aggressive
             treatment by family or the medical team (e.g., likely to withdraw life support
             measures within 24 hours of screening).

          9. Prisoners

         10. Patients who live further than 200 miles from Nashville and who do not regularly visit
             the Nashville area.

         11. Patients who are homeless and have no secondary contact person available

         12. Current enrollment in a study that does not allow co-enrollment

         13. Inability to obtain informed consent from the patient or an authorized representative
             within 72 hours of meeting all inclusion criteria for the following reasons:

               1. Attending physician refusal

               2. Patient and/or surrogate refusal

               3. 72-hour period of eligibility was exceeded before the patient was screened

               4. Patient unable to consent and no surrogate available within 72 hours of meeting
                  all inclusion criteria
