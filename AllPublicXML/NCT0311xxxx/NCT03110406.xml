      Introduction: Renal transplantation represents the therapeutic mode with more durable
      treatment, greater cost-effectiveness, survival benefits and quality of life of the patients,
      however, with high cardiovascular mortality.

      Objectives: To evaluate the acute and chronic effects on heart rate variability and the
      impact of chronic kidney disease on cardiorespiratory fitness in renal transplant recipients
      following a full-body Vibration training program.

      Methods: It will be a blinded randomized clinical trial (patient, evaluator and
      statistician), controlled and endowed with secrecy of allocation, to be performed in the
      Cardiopulmonary Physiotherapy Laboratory of the Physiotherapy Department of the Federal
      University of Pernambuco. Renal transplant recipients will be recruited at the Nephrology
      outpatient clinic of the Hospital das Clínicas de Pernambuco, according to the following
      inclusion criteria: age between 18 and 59 years, who underwent transplantation at least one
      year before and present a stable transplant function through the level Of creatinine

    <description>The whole-body vibration training will be performed with the patients in the static position, feet apart at 20 cm, semi-squat with knees at 15º flexion and upper limbs slightly flexed and supported on the platform. The exercises will be performed, in the first two weeks, for 10 minutes consisting of 60 seconds of low intensity with 30 seconds of rest standing in the anatomical position. From the second week to the end of the twelfth week (24 sessions) will be performed 15 minutes corresponding being 60 seconds of high intensity interspersed with 30 seconds of rest standing in the anatomical position. In the second month, the patient should be well adapted to the stimuli of the platform keeping the frequency of 35Hz and the amplitude 4mm. °</description>
