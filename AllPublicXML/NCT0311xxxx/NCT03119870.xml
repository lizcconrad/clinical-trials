  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efficient evaluation and monitoring of actions and outcomes are a key feature of primates'
      efficient adaptive cognition. Deficits in evaluating one's own actions and their consequences
      is a key feature of prominent disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD),
      schizophrenia, and anxiety. The Investigators know that these evaluative processes implicate
      medial structures of the brain that are related both to old limbic functions and to more
      recently evolved higher executive functions. Brain potentials related to performance
      monitoring have attracted a lot of interest in cognitive neuroscience but also in the
      clinical domain because they appear to be altered in different neurological or psychiatric
      disorders, such as schizophrenia, OCD, or anxiety, and could become biomarkers of
      pathologies. But the neural sources of these markers are not fully determined and are
      currently highly debated. In addition, our work suggests that non pathological factors, such
      as normal morphological cortical variations, could affect those markers. Understanding
      performance monitoring, acting directly on medial cortex, or using electrophysiological
      markers in clinic are thus currently problematic and challenging. This is mostly because
      structure-function relationships in the medial wall are ill defined for historical,
      conceptual, and methodological reasons. Importantly, although individual variability of brain
      morphology impedes precise assessment of structure function relationships, this variability
      is almost never taken into account. EEG-Feedback aims to resolve these issues by evaluating
      the consequences of individual variability in cingulate cortex morphology on 1) surface EEG
      markers of feedback monitoring and 2) functional connectivity patterns thanks to
      resting-state fMRI.

    <description>Each subject will conduct 3 sessions, i.e. a training session, an anatomical MRI session and an EEG session. The first session will be to train the subject to carry out the different behavioral tasks that he will then have to perform during the session of EEG.</description>

    <description>Each subject will be trained to perform a trial-error learning task. In this task, three visual stimuli will be presented to the subject. The subject will have to find by trial-error, the one associated with positive feedback, the other stimuli being associated with negative feedback (search period). Once the stimulus is associated with positive feedback, the subject will perform a period of repetition during which he will choose the stimulus associated with positive feedback. Two variants of the task will be used: a variant in which feedback will be visual (ie positive feedback = green square, negative feedback = red square) and a variant in which feedback will be fruit juice (ie positive feedback = Fruit juice (but less than 2ml), negative feedback = no volume or small volume of fruit juice).</description>

    <description>Once the tasks are learned, each subject will participate in an MRI session during which an anatomical scan will be obtained. For each task, the time of presentation of the stimuli will be 2s. During this time, the subject should indicate his choice of stimulus. After a delay of 2s, feedback will be presented for 1s. Each test shall be separated by an inter-test delay of 3s. The presentation of the stimuli and the control of the answers will be managed by the E-prime or Presentation software.</description>
