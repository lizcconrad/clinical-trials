  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test whether coupling of a mobile health technology
      application (HABC 2.0) with the Aging Brain Care (ABC) Clinical Program improves (1) the
      behavioral and psychological symptoms of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and
      related dementias (ADRD) and (2) the distress of their informal caregivers.

      Hypothesis #1:Patients who receive HABC 2.0 coupled with the ABC Clinical Program will have
      fewer symptoms at 12 months compared to those who receive the ABC Clinical Program only; and
      informal caregivers of patients who receive HABC 2.0 coupled with the ABC Clinical Program
      will have lower caregiver distress at 12 months compared to caregivers of patients who
      receive the ABC Clinical Program only.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to test whether combining HABC 2.0 with the ABC
      Clinical Program (1) reduces the number of emergency room and hospital visits for patients
      and their informal caregivers; (2) reduces the depressive symptoms and caregiver burden of
      informal caregivers; and (3) increases the caregiving self-efficacy of the informal
      caregivers.

      Hypothesis #2: Patients and caregivers who receive HABC 2.0 coupled with the ABC Clinical
      Program will have fewer emergency room and hospital visits at 12 months compared to these who
      receive the ABC Clinical Program only; and informal caregivers of patients who receive HABC
      2.0 coupled with the ABC Clinical Program will have fewer depressive symptoms, lower
      caregiver burden and higher caregiving self-efficacy at 12 months compared to caregivers of
      patients who receive the ABC Clinical Program only;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited from multiple primary care clinics affiliated with Eskenazi Health
      and Indiana University Health in central Indiana. Recruitment methods will utilize the
      research infrastructures of the Indiana University Practice-Based Research Network (ResNet)
      and/or the Center for Aging Research (if permitted by ResNet). The recruitment will be done
      face-to-face in the primary care clinics. 224 patients and their informal caregivers (for a
      total of 448 human subjects) will be enrolled in the study as dyads. It is anticipated that
      80% of enrolled dyads will be identified through screening and 20% will be referred directly
      to the ABC Clinical Program from physicians in primary care.

      Research personnel associated with the primary care recruitment sites will review the clinic
      schedules to identify adults aged 65 and older with upcoming appointments in the clinics.
      Research personnel will then approach these patients to screen for memory impairment using
      the Memory Impairment Screen (MIS). Patients who screen positive (MIS score &lt;= 4) will be
      referred to the ABC Clinical Program for a full diagnostic assessment to determine
      eligibility. Patients referred to the ABC Clinical Program directly by their primary care
      physicians will also complete the diagnostic assessment to determine eligibility.

      The consent process will occur in person at the Healthy Aging Brain Center (part of the ABC
      Clinical Program) after the patient has received a diagnosis of possible or probable
      Alzheimer's disease and the patient and caregiver have agreed to participate in the Aging
      Brain Care Clinical Program. Consent will be obtained by an individual trained in field
      research and ethical conduct of human subjects research.

      After informed consent has been obtained, patients and caregivers will be randomized to one
      of the two study groups: the intervention group (HABC 2.0 plus ABC Clinical program) or the
      comparison group (ABC Clinical Program-only). Randomization will be by dyad using a random
      number generator with unequal randomization using a 3:2 ratio to achieve n=132 and n=92 in
      the two arms (the larger enrollment in the intervention group), as recommended when expecting
      unequal drop-out. Within two weeks of enrollment, patients and their informal caregivers will
      complete a baseline assessment [including the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the
      NPI-Caregiver Stress, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Zarit Burden Interview
      and the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy] conducted by professional interviewers
      blinded to the subjects' randomization status.

      The intervention will continue for 12 months and primary outcomes will be assessed at
      baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Hypotheses are phrased in terms of 12 month outcomes;
      however, 3, 6 and 9 month outcomes are also assessed to test early effects.

      Informal caregivers will be interviewed either by telephone or in person when the patient has
      an appointment in the ABC Clinical Program, to measure patients' BPSD and informal
      caregivers' distress, depression, caregiver burden and caregiving self-efficacy. If at any
      time during the study, a caregiver receives a score of 1, 2 or 3 on the PHQ-9 item &quot;thoughts
      that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way&quot;, the research personnel
      will immediately inform a registered nurse or social worker from the ABC Clinical Program.
      The registered nurse or social worker will immediately evaluate the situation and intercede
      as appropriate.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) will be used to measure BPSD and the NPI-Caregiver Distress score will be used to measure informal caregiver distress. The NPI obtains information on the presence of psychopathology in 10 behavioral areas including delusions, apathy, hallucinations, disinhibition, agitation, depression, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, night-time behavior, and euphoria. Possible scores range from 0-144. The inventory is interviewer-administered to an informal caregiver. If the caregiver reports the presence of psychopathology, there are follow-up questions to assess frequency, severity, and the level of caregiver distress due to the behavior. Thus, the instrument is specifically designed to measure informal caregiver burden by calculating the NPI-Caregiver Distress score (possible range from 0-60). Total administration time is about 20 minutes. The test has excellent reliability and validity.</description>

    <time_frame>3, 6, 9 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Consent from all subjects and their informal caregivers will be obtained at enrollment for permission to review their electronic medical records. The INPC will be used to identify any episode of ambulatory or acute care that occurred within the 12 months following the enrollment date. Continuous variables will be structured to describe the number of ambulatory and/or acute care episodes. Furthermore, additional variables will be structured to describe a potentially preventable hospital admission (preventable hospitalization). Preventable hospitalization will include any hospitalization for an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 based disease that is considered an ambulatory care sensitive condition where the condition itself or its course can be mitigated through optimal outpatient management.</description>

    <time_frame>3, 6, 9 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total score of the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) will be used to measure caregiver depression. The PHQ-9 is a nine-item depression scale with a total score from 0 to 27, has good internal consistency and test-retest reliability as well as convergent, construct, criterion, procedural and factorial validity for the diagnosis of major depression.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview will be used to measure caregiver burden. This brief 12 item instrument assesses role strain and personal strain among caregivers. It is a widely used instrument with excellent psychometric properties. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy is a construct from Social Learning Theory and refers to a subjective belief that a person has about his or her ability to successfully carry out certain kinds of behavior. The Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy will be used to measure this construct. This measure contains 15 items within 3 subscales (self-efficacy for obtaining respite, responding to disruptive patient behaviors, and controlling upsetting thoughts about caregiving). Items are rated on a 0-100 scale for current beliefs.</description>

    <description>The goal of the ABC Clinical Program is to help primary care physicians achieve the standard of care in the diagnosis, evaluation and management of patients with ADRD. The ABC Clinical Program is delivered by an interdisciplinary team led by a care coordinator. The informal caregiver is also enrolled in the program and caregiver burden is assessed and managed. The ABC team collects all relevant data and formulates an individualized care plan in collaboration with the informal caregiver. The care coordinator communicates the team's recommendations to the primary care physician and finalizes a collaborative plan of action. During the next year, the ABC team uses face-to-face and telephone interactions with the patient and caregiver to monitor and modify implementation of the care plan.</description>

    <description>HABC 2.0 is a mobile health information technology application whose primary user is the informal caregiver of a patient suffering from ADRD. It is integrated with the electronic medical record system (eMR-ABC) in operation in the ABC Clinical Program. HABC 2.0 performs the following functions:
supports informal caregivers in managing the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) by delivering on-demand, around the clock feedback and personalized self-management support without any intervention from the ABC team; and
elicits frequent, real-time, longitudinal assessments of patients and informal caregivers, enabling the ABC team to monitor BPSD data and informal caregiver health, intervening as needed in between scheduled visits.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data, or results, will be shared through traditional mechanisms such as peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national meetings. The Enhanced Medical Record - Aging Brain Care (eMR-ABC), the dedicated electronic medical record for the Aging Brain Care (ABC) Clinical Program, was developed with the intent of sharing de-identified data with the scientific community. The Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) is a state-wide health information exchange. INPC data is collected for patient care purposes and is not &quot;owned&quot; by Indiana University or the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. — each participating health care system or program retains ownership of their data. At present, Indiana University/Regenstrief Institute scientists do not have the direct authority to share even de-identified patient data. Therefore, any request to use these data for research purposes must be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis.</ipd_description>
