  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, extension trial designed to evaluate safety over 12 additional weeks
      of TNX-102 SL therapy taken daily at bedtime for the treatment of PTSD. Patients recruited
      into this trial are those who have successfully completed the double-blind lead-in study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 5 study visits, including Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Day 0, which
      is anticipated to be the same visit as the last visit on double-blind treatment), a phone
      visit after 2 weeks of treatment, and in-clinic visits after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of TNX-102 SL tablets taken
      daily at bedtime over an additional 12 weeks in patients with PTSD who have completed a
      double-blinded lead-in study.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL tablets taken
      daily at bedtime over an additional 12 weeks in patients with PTSD who have completed a
      double-blinded lead-in study.
