      A prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CART19 for refractory/relapsed B
      cell lymphoma. Complete remission rate, overall survival rate, relapse rate and CRS rate were
      monitored. CART associated toxicities were also monitored.

         10. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for
             at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g.
             cervix, bladder, breast) or follicular lymphoma unless disease free for at least 3
             years

         17. History of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of enrollment

         18. Any medical condition likely to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of
             study treatment

         19. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in

             protocol-required study visits or procedures, including follow-up visits, or comply
             with the study requirements for participation

         24. History of autoimmune disease (e.g. Crohns, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus)
