    <textblock>
      This study will employ a randomized, wait-list controlled trial. A total of 30 participants
      (15 experimental, 15 wait-list control) between 18-65 years of age who have chronic SCI ≥ 1
      year prior will be recruited. Physical activity measures will be taken using wrist-based
      accelerometers and the Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire for people with SCI
      (LTPAQ). Psychosocial factors will be evaluated through questionnaires. The primary health
      outcome measure (aPWV), and secondary cardiovascular parameters will be assessed using a
      combination of echocardiography and ultrasound. Fitness will be determined using a peak
      oxygen consumption test on an arm-cycle ergometer. All measurement will be taken at baseline
      and after 9 weeks following intervention commencement. Physical activity will also be sampled
      mid-intervention at 4 and 7 weeks. Training will involve weekly, 10-15 minute coaching
      sessions for 9 weeks. All pre- and post-assessments will take place at the Blusson Spinal
      Cord Centre at ICORD. Intervention content will be delivered in-person, over Skype or phone,
      and the wrist- worn accelerometers will be delivered and picked up from the participant's
      home during the intervention.

      A randomized, wait-list controlled trial will be used to compare the effects of tailored PA
      coaching sessions versus no coaching on PA behaviour, psychosocial factors, and health
      outcomes. Eligible individuals will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either the experimental (PA
      coaching sessions) or wait-list control condition. Matched randomization based on baseline
      physical activity levels will be used. The randomization sequence will be generated by a
      research assistant independent of the trial.

      Day 1 testing measures include vascular measures (arterial pulse wave velocity, arterial
      structure, and flow mediated dilation; 30 minutes), cardiac structure and function measures
      (30 minutes), a peak oxygen uptake test (60 minutes), for a total duration of 2 hours.
      Participants will be given an accelerometer to wear for the 6-day monitoring period (6.1.2)
      after which they will return for Day 2 testing.

      Day 2 testing measures include administration of the LTPAQ (5 minutes), administration of the
      demographics and Health Action Process Approach model questionnaire (25 minutes), and a
      measurement of energy expenditure at different sub-maximal wheeling speeds to calibrate MVPA
      cut-points (30 minutes) and at baseline, the first PA coaching session will be administered
      (60 minutes) whereas at post-test a semi-structured interview will be administered (60
      minutes). Total duration of day 2 testing will be 2 hours. The intervention protocol is
      described below. During the intervention, physical activity will be sampled at two time
      points; accelerometer and PARA SCI data will be taken during week 4 and week 7.

      INTERVENTION

      Intervention Protocol:

      Experimental participants will receive weekly PA coaching sessions. Each session will be
      10-15 minutes in duration and delivered either face to face, over Skype, or when the former
      modes are unavailable, over the phone. Additionally, supplemental resources may be emailed to
      the participants based on need throughout the intervention.

      Participants' motivation to exercise will first be determined according to stages of the HAPA
      model. Those who identify as pre-intenders (no intention to exercise) will receive
      intervention strategies that focus on changing motivation to be physically active. Those
      identified as intenders (willing to exercise but have not started) will focus on providing
      resources and behavioural strategies to commence physical activity. Lastly, those identified
      as actors (already exercising) will receive intervention strategies that help participants
      maintain or improve PA behaviour.

      For those in the intender or actor stage, the intervention aims to promote the international
      SCI PA guidelines to promote fitness (at least 20 minutes of moderate vigorous aerobic
      activity twice/week and strength training twice/week). For those exceeding the fitness
      guidelines, the international SCI PA guidelines to promote health are promoted (at least 30
      minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity three times/week and strength training
      twice/week). However, these aims will be modified based on the individual's baseline PA.
      During the first visit, participants' baseline PA levels will be reviewed and an appropriate
      PA goal to achieve in the following month will be formed. Ultimately, the goal is the
      decision of the participant.

      Following goal setting, barriers to participating in PA will be identified. The
      interventionist will select intervention strategies based on the identified barriers. A
      pre-formed chart of corresponding intervention strategies (e.g. use of behaviour change
      techniques, referral to facilities or peers, suggesting at-home exercises) was developed to
      aid this pairing process (Appendix A). These intervention strategies are accompanied by a
      comprehensive toolkit based from the HAPA model (Appendix B). In brief, the toolkit advises
      on three key strategies for promoting PA to people with SCI: i) education, ii) referral, iii)
      tailored PA prescription.

      Remaining weekly coaching sessions will review participants' progress and barriers to discuss
      new goals and strategies as outlined above.

      Control Participants:

      Control participants will complete baseline and post-testing only. Following completion of
      post-test measures they will be administered the same PA coaching session as the intervention
      group, with post-test measures being repeated upon intervention completion.

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, week 7, week 10, 1,2,3, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire, guided by the co-investigator (Jasmin Ma), that asks the participant to recall in the last 7 days how many days and for how long leisure time physical activity was performed. The recall assessment will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Activity: 6-day Physical Activity Monitoring Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, week 7, week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be fitted with a wrist-based tri-axial accelerometer to be worn 24 hours a day for 6 days in order to determine intensity and amount of PA. They will keep a detailed PA diary recording all leisure time PA performed during the day. The primary outcome will be minutes of PA per day equivalent to moderate intensity or higher (≥ 3 SCI METs determined from individual calibrations, see 2.14) from a tri-axial wrist-worn accelerometer (GT9X, ActiGraph LLC, FL). During the intervention, the accelerometer will be picked up and dropped off to the participant's home to decrease burden. Text or email reminders (i.e. &quot;Please don't forget to wear your accelerometer today&quot;) will be used to promote adherence to accelerometer wear.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 9 weeks from intervention start (week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>This survey will examine psychological factors that may affect PA participation. The survey will be recorded either electronically or with pen and paper depending on the respondent's preference. Survey will take approximately 25 minutes to complete, and will assess constructs related to exercise such as perceived risks, self- efficacy, planning, and social support. The demographics questionnaire will also be administered with this measure.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pulse Wave Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 9 weeks from intervention start (week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>aPWV (m/s) is calculated by dividing the distance between measurement sites, by the pulse transit time. Distance between the carotid and femoral arteries will be measured using measuring tape along the surface of the body, held parallel to the testing table. The pulse transit is determined from the arterial blood pressure waves, which are collected at each arterial site. A pen-like device (model SPT-301; Millar Instruments Inc., Houston, TX) will be applied to the carotid and femoral arterial sites using a light pressure to obtain arterial pressure waves. Heart rate will be recorded using a single-lead (lead I) electrocardiogram (ECG) (model ML 123, ADInstruments Inc., Colorado Springs, CO).</description>

    <description>Participants will perform a graded arm ergometer test on an electronically braked arm ergometer. Blood pressure and respiratory measures will be collected two minutes prior to exercise. Heart rate will be recorded at one-second intervals via a chest strap heart rate monitor. For participants with tetraplegia who have limited handgrip function, gloves will be used to secure hands to the ergometer handles. Participants will be instructed to maintain a cycling rate of 50 revolutions per minute (rpm) for the duration of the test. After an initial warm-up at 0W, power output will be increased each minute at a rate of 2-5 W/min for participants with tetraplegia, or 10 W/min for participants with paraplegia, until volitional exhaustion (i.e. dropping below 30 rpm). Oxygen consumption will be recorded on a breath-by-breath basis for the duration of the test and reported as rolling 30-second averages sampled at 5-second intervals as per consensus recommendations.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive weekly physical activity coaching sessions. Each session will be 10-15 minutes, delivered either face to face, over Skype, or over the phone. Additional resources may be emailed to participants based on need throughout the intervention (for example, a goal, list of places to exercise, contact information to reach mentoring services). A typical session may include:
An assessment of motivated the participant is to be physically active
A: If motivated, a physical activity goal will be set, strategies will be reviewed, and resources to accomplish that goal will be provided.
B: If not motivated, questions will be asked to understand why the reasons for lack of motivation. If it is for any reasons including barriers, fear, confidence, or knowledge, the interventionist will discuss strategies to overcome these obstacles.
Progress and barriers will be reassessed and discussed.</description>
