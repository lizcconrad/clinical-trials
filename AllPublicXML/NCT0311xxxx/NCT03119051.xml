    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of computerized cognitive training on different cognitive
      domains in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Patients will be randomized into the
      computerized training group and the control group in 1:1 ratio.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD). Increasing
      evidence has indicated that cognitive trainings improve cognition functions of MCI patients
      in multiple cognitive domains, making it a promising therapy for MCI. However, the effect of
      long-time training has not been widely explored. It is also necessary to evaluate the extent
      of its function in reducing the conversion rate from MCI to AD.
