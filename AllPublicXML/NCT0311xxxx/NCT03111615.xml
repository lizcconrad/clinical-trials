  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer is a public health issue worldwide. The time from diagnosis to treatment
      initiation varies from country to country and regionally within a country. Early diagnosis
      and prompt treatment initiation are key factors in patient survival rates.

      Currently there is a rising trend, with a high percentage of patients with &quot;Luminal&quot; like
      breast cancer only undergoing adjuvant endocrine therapy.

      Authors argue that tumor biology alterations after introducing very early endocrine therapy
      might have a prognostic and therapeutic impact and should be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selected patients of female gender, above 50 y.o, and after a biopsy of Luminal-like Breast
      Cancer will go under aromatase inhibitor, from the diagnosis day till the surgical therapy to
      be decided (if so).In this study are going to be included patients that refuse surgical
      treatment, remaining this way in an &quot;active surveillance&quot;. This last group is going to be
      randomised in order to recieve hormontherapy plus placebo vs hormontherapy plus
      acetolisalicilic acid.

      In this way, authors want to investigate if:

        1. st This approach influences the tumor biology

        2. nd This approach influences tumor pathologic response and progression free survival.

        3. rd It is a valid approach and in which grade, for patients that refuse surgical
           treatment
