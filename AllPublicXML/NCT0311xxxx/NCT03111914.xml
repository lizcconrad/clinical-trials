  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a more accurate and precise way to image (take
      pictures of) metastatic bone disease in patients with prostate cancer for staging and
      monitoring response to therapy. More specifically, the study aims to evaluate the
      capabilities of dual energy CT as a more precise and accurate tool for staging and monitoring
      of therapy response in patients with osseous metastases from castrate-resistant prostate
      cancer.

      Bone metastases in prostate cancer patients are a clinical and diagnostic challenge to image.
      Sometimes very small metastatic bone lesions may only become detectable by imaging in
      response to therapy due to increased bone deposition during the first three months after
      therapy. Commonly used imaging tests (such as regular CT or bone scan) are unable to reliably
      tell the difference between increased bone deposition (therapy response) and growth of the
      lesion (progressive disease). This diagnostic challenge may have profound negative effects on
      patient management since it may require additional imaging before an accurate determination
      of tumor response can be made. An appropriate determination of tumor response is needed for
      appropriate management of prostate cancer. The investigators anticipate that the new imaging
      tested in this study (called dual energy CT) may provide additional critical information in
      this clinical and diagnostic challenge.

      Approximately 100 people with prostate cancer and metastatic bone disease will take part in
      this study. At enrollment, three months, and six months, they will will receive a
      non-enhanced (without contrast) dual energy CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis before
      receiving their routine, clinical contrast-enhanced CT scan.
