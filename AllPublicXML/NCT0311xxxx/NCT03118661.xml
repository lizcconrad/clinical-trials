  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to determine the effect of maraviroc when it has been a part of
      the antiretroviral (ART) regimen given immediately after allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplant (allo-HCT) for HIV-1 infected participants who have a hematopoietic malignancy or
      other underlying disorder requiring an allogeneic transplant. Maraviroc has been given in
      practice to alleviate symptoms of graft vs. host disease (GvHD). Given its mechanism of
      action, it may also have an effect on the reservoir size of HIV-1 in infected patients. This
      study will inform potential future studies, evaluating the effect of this approach on the
      incidence and severity of GvHD, and determining its effect on HIV-1 reservoir.

    <description>Step 1: participants who have received at least 30 days of maraviroc immediately post allo-HCT can be enrolled. Blood will be drawn at 2 time points at least 2 weeks apart, but within 4 weeks, and assessed for HIV-1 reservoir using both DNA assays and cell-associated reactivation by infectivity after stimulation. If any biopsies post allo-HCT are performed as part of standard of care and available, these will also be assessed for HIV-1
Step 2: If HIV-1 reservoir is undetecable, antiretrovirals (ART) will be stopped in a structured treatment interruption (STI). HIV-1 VLs and CD4+ T-cells check weekly. Week 16, participants will have a large volume blood draw if remain suppressed. If confirmed return of viremia, ART will be reinitiated and he/she will be followed until HIV VL is &lt;50 copies/ml. If he/she remains suppressed at Week 16 and repeat assays confirm no detectable HIV-1, HIV-1 VLs and CD4+ T-cell counts will be checked monthly until Week 52, and then quarterly until Year 5</description>
