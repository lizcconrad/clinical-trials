    <textblock>
      This study aim to evaluate the effects of 16 weeks of multicomponent training on postural
      control, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems in pre-frail elderly through nonlinear
      and linear measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty syndrome is described as a clinical state of vulnerability to stress resulting from
      the decline of resilience and physiological reserves associated with aging. It is also
      characterized by a reduction of the interaction between systems and that would be reflected
      by a loss of physiological complexity. Physical exercise, especially the multi-component, is
      pointed out as a key element in the intervention of frail elderly individuals. However, it is
      still unclear whether the improvement in functional capacity observed with this type of
      training would be related to changes in the physiological complexity of these elderly
      individuals. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of multi-component training on
      the dynamics of the cardiovascular, motor, neuromuscular and physical activity levels of
      pre-frail elderly. Thirty-six pre-frail elderly individuals will be divided into intervention
      (IG, n = 18) and control (CG, n = 18) groups at three different moments (pre-intervention,
      post-intervention, 16 weeks, and follow-up of detraining of 6 Weeks). The complexity will be
      evaluated by calculating the entropy of the biological signals: a) heart rate, blood pressure
      (in supine and orthostatic conditions), b) oscillations of the pressure center (in open,
      closed eyes, after standing in a chair And under dual-task cognitive condition), c) torque
      oscillations of the knee extensor muscle group.
