      To compare the effect of lumbar spinal manipulation, physical therapy and surgical management
      in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.

      Low back pain (LBP) is a very common health problem which results in negative impact in daily
      life and burden especially in elderly. The global age-standardized point prevalence of LBP in
      2010 was estimated to be 9.4%. Among the etiologies of low back pain, lumbar spinal stenosis
      is frequently encountered by physicians. In a large observational study, the prevalence of
      lumbar spinal stenosis was 23.6% in the general population and higher in patients more than
      60 years-old. If untreated, the symptoms may persist in 70% of the patients over the 48-month
      observation period. On the other hand, previous studies have shown that surgery is more
      effective in pain relief, neurological symptoms and further functional status, however,
      conservative treatment still had favorable effect in patients with milder symptoms.

      The role of spinal manipulation has been discussed in previous study which compared the
      clinical efficacy of spinal manipulation against microdiskectomy in patients with sciatica
      secondary to lumbar disc herniation. According to this study, the pain, disability and life
      quality of both groups in 12-week period had no significant difference that chiropractic
      spinal manipulative treatment could be considered as a primary treatment. However, comparison
      among the effect of spinal manipulation, physical therapy, and surgery has not been conducted
      before. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the effect of spinal manipulation,
      physical therapy, and surgery in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.

    <description>For evaluation of disability related to LBP, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) is most widely used. ODQ is a 10-item self report instrument that evaluates perceived disability in 10 areas: pain intensity, ability to lift objects, ability to walk, ability to sit, ability to stand, ability to sleep, sex life, social life, traveling, and ability to complete personal hygiene activities. By using a 6-point Likert scale (0 = no limitation; 5 = severe limitation) , the total maximum scale is doubled and reported as a percentage of the patients perceived pain-related disability, with higher scores indicating greater disability.</description>

    <description>The Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire is a disease-specific self-report outcome instrument commonly used in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) for evaluation of outcomes of the treatment. It includes severity of symptoms, physical function characteristics, and patient's satisfaction after treatment. It was designed to complement existing generic measures of lumbar spine disability and health status in the evaluation of patients with LSS.</description>

    <time_frame>Clinical evaluation will be conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment day 7, post-treatment 3 months and post-treatment 6 months after treatments.</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome Survey Short Form (SF-36) was used to assess general health status. The SF-36 measures eight dimentions of health: general health perceptions, physical function, physical role, bodily pain, social functioning, mental health, emotional role, and vitality. The eight scales may be combined into two summary scores, the physical component summary(PCS) and the mental component summary(MCS). The SF-36 has well-established psychometric properties for the general population and individuals with LBP.</description>

    <time_frame>Clinical evaluation will be conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment day 7, post-treatment 3 months and post-treatment 6 months after treatments.</time_frame>
    <description>For evaluation of intermittent claudication, self-reported duration of walking will be recorded. It divides into three levels to evaluate how long the patient can walk without resting. The duration includes less than 10 minutes, 11-20 minutes, 21-30 minutes and more than 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>General anesthesia, the patient will be put in the prone and abdomen-free position. A 4-cm midline longitudinal incision will be made over the spinous processes of the L3-5 levels. It will be deepened through the fat and fascia in line with the skin incision to reach the spinous processes.The paraspinous muscles will be dissected subperiosteally down the spinous processes and along the lamina to the facet joints. Laminectomy will be done carefully at the herniated disc level for posterior decompression. The ligamentum flavum will be excised to expose the dural sac.Using blunt dissection, the investigators carefully continue down the lateral side of the dura to the floor of the spinal canal; the investigators retract the dura and its nerve root medially. After the posterior aspect of the disc space is revealed, the affected disc will be removed and discotomy will be performed.The wound will be closed in the routine fashion after meticulous hemostasis and normal saline irrigation.</description>
