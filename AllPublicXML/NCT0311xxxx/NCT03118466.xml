  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating how a drug called lenalidomide, given in combination with
      the standard chemotherapy regimen of Mitoxantrone, Etoposide, and Cytarabine, commonly
      referred to as MEC, works in individuals with either relapsed or refractory AML
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved lenalidomide for this
      specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses, including for patients with
      multiple myeloma and some patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. This treatment is
      investigational because it is not approved by the FDA for patients with AML. Lenalidomide is
      a chemotherapy that also modulates the immune system, and is in a category of drugs called
      immunomodulatory drugs or IMIDs. Some research studies suggest that lenalidomide may be
      effective in patients with AML. Since the investigators know that many patients who receive
      MEC chemotherapy alone have less than desired response rates and overall shorter periods of
      remission (time free from leukemia) after treatment, the investigators are studying whether
      the addition of lenalidomide to MEC improves upon typical responses.

      The combination of MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine) is a standard treatment
      option, commonly used for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
