  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of intracervical anesthesia on pain
      scores immediately following levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) insertion
      in nulligravida women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No prophylactic pharmacological intervention has proven efficacy in relieving pain during or
      after the insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), only in
      reducing pain associated with the tenaculum. It is known that the nulligravida women have 3
      times more chance of presenting moderate / severe pain associated to LNG-IUS placement. A
      previous study showed that injectable intracervical anesthesia reduced the risk of
      moderate/severe pain by 40%. However, the anesthetic dose was small (36 mg of lidocaine) and
      the study did not evaluate only nulligravida women which are potential candidates for most
      pain relief benefit. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of
      intracervical anesthesia on pain scores immediately following LNG-IUS insertion in
      nulligravida women.

    <masking_description>The care provider will open the randomization envelope and will do one of three possible approaches (a intracervical lidocaine injection, a intracervical dry needling or no intervention). Then, a second care provider will insert the intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) blinding for the approach of the first care provider. After IUC insertion, the latter care provider will assess the pain felt by the woman using proper scales. The woman will be also blinded to the approach used before IUC insertion.</masking_description>
