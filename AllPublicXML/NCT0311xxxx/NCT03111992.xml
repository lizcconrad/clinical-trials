      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and identify the recommended
      doses of single agent CJM112, and of CJM112 or LCL161 in combination with PDR001, in patients
      with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is comprised of 3 treatment arms:
Single agent CJM112 (Arm A)
A fixed dose of PDR001 in combination with CJM112 (Arm B)
A fixed dose of PDR001 in combination with LCL161 (Arm C)
Patients may switch from treatment on Arm A to the corresponding CJM112 dose level on Arm B at the time of disease progression if that dose level has been declared safe, and if patients do not have any DLTs on single agent CJM112. Otherwise, patients will switch to a lower dose level that has been declared safe. No other cross-over between treatment arms is allowed.</intervention_model_description>

             most recent line of therapy. Patients who have received a prior autologous bone marrow
             transplant and otherwise meet the inclusion criteria are eligible for this study.

          -  Must have measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 3 measurements:

          -  Serum M-protein ≥ 0.5 g/dL OR

          -  Serum free light chain (FLC) &gt; 100 mg/L of involved FLC

          -  All patients must be willing to undergo a mandatory serial bone marrow aspirate and/or
             biopsy at screening and subsequently following treatment for the assessment of
             biomarker/pharmacodynamics and disease status. Exceptions may be considered after
             documented discussion with Novartis.

        Other inclusion criteria included in the protocol might apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of systemic chronic steroid therapy (≥10mg /day of prednisone or equivalent), or
             any immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days of first dose of study treatment. Topical,
             inhaled, nasal, or ophthalmic steroids are allowed.

          -  Malignant disease, other than that being treated in this study. Exceptions to this
             exclusion include the following: malignancies that were treated curatively and have

             and squamous cell skin cancers, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease other than patients with vitiligo,
             residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring

             arms of the study.

          -  Patients with prior known toxicity from IL-17A directed therapy, which led to

             of the study.

          -  Any of the following clinical laboratory results during screening (i.e., within 28
             days before the first dose of study treatment):

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,000/mm3 without growth factor support within
                  7 days prior to testing

               -  Platelet count &lt; 75,000 mm3 without transfusion support within 7 days prior to
                  testing

               -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 3 times the
                  ULN
