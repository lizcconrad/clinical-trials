      This phase II trial studies how well dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) works in measuring relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) for
      early response to bevacizumab in patients with glioblastoma that has come back. DSC-MRI may
      help evaluate changes in the blood vessels within the cancer to determine a patient?s
      response to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether binary changes (increase versus [vs.] decrease) in rCBV within
      enhancing tumor from baseline to 2 weeks after initiation of anti-angiogenic therapy is
      associated with overall survival (OS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the baseline pre-treatment rCBV measure alone is associated with OS.

      II. To determine whether binary changes (increase vs. decrease) in rCBV within enhancing
      tumor from baseline to 2 weeks after initiation of anti-angiogenic therapy is associated with
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      III. To determine whether changes in rCBV as a continuous variable within enhancing tumor
      from baseline to 2 weeks after initiation of anti-angiogenic therapy is associated with OS or
      PFS.

      IV. To determine the association between rCBV and OS when adjusting for the changes in
      enhancing tumor volume.

      V. To determine whether baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) or change in CBF is associated
      with OS or PFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo DSC-MRI within 3 days before bevacizumab initiation and at day 15.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year
      and then every 6 months for up to 4 years.

               -  Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade glioma and a
                  subsequent diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made (high-grade
                  transformation)

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding

             therapeutically, either as single therapy or in conjunction with other
             chemotherapeutic regimens; patients getting bevacizumab to support additional
             radiation therapy or immunotherapy, or primarily for reduction of edema rather than
             for tumor treatment, are excluded; this must be the patient?s initial recurrence

          -  Patient must not have been treated previously with immunotherapies (vaccines,

          -  Intratumoral hemorrhage (acute, subacute, or chronic) as seen on hemosiderin-sensitive
             (gradient-echo) MRI may preclude patient inclusion because of anticipated limited
             evaluation due to magnetic susceptibility artifact on the heavily T2-weighted DSC-MRI
             images; if the region of enhancing tumor not affected by blooming artifact on the
             hemosiderin-sensitive images does not meet the 10 x 10 x 10 mm ?measurable
             enhancement? threshold specified elsewhere, the patient is ineligible

          -  Progressive enhancement (&gt; 25% increase in contrast enhancing volume compared to
             nadir) on MRI within 14 days of registration, &gt;= 42 days since completion of
             radiation/temozolomide therapy, and &gt;= 28 days since surgical resection or cytotoxic
             chemotherapy; measurable enhancement is defined as two perpendicular in-plane
             diameters of at least 10 mm and at least 10 mm in the 3rd orthogonal direction

          -  Patients must be able to tolerate brain MRI scans with dynamic intravenous
             gadolinium-based contrast agent injections

               -  Ability to withstand 22 gauge intravenous (IV) placement

               -  No history of untreatable claustrophobia

               -  No magnetic resonance (MR) incompatible implants/devices or metallic foreign
                  bodies

               -  No contraindication to intravenous contrast administration

                    -  Adequate organ function, including adequate renal function defined as
                       estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt;= 40 mL/min/1.73 m^2 as
                       calculated per institution standard of care, and meeting local site
                       requirements for intravenous administration of gadolinium-based MRI contrast
                       agents

               -  No known allergy-like reaction to gadolinium or moderate or severe allergic
                  reactions to one or more allergens as defined by the American College of
                  Radiology (ACR); patient may be eligible if willing to undergo pre-treatment as
                  defined by the institution's policy and/or ACR guidance

               -  Weight compatible with limits imposed by the MRI scanner table

          -  Patient must be scheduled to receive treatment with a standard dose regimen of
             bevacizumab (bevacizumab infusion on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day treatment cycle);
             patient can be treated with bevacizumab alone or in combination with other
             chemotherapies
