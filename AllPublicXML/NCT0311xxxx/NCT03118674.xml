  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the medical literature there case reports that Harvoni improves symptoms in patients with
      PCT. However, this has never been systematically tested. Therefore, the purpose of this study
      is to assess whether Harvoni alone is an effective therapy of active PCT in patients with
      Chronic Hepatitis C.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial, which means its purpose is to study an intervention or treatment.
      In this study all patients with PCT will be given a standard dose of Harvoni and monitored
      for two years. Currently there are two standard therapies for PCT, phlebotomies (removing
      certain amounts of blood at specific intervals), or low dose hydroxychloroquine (an oral
      pill). These treatments are used for patients with PCT whether or not they also have HCV. For
      patients with HCV however, we do not know whether treating the HCV first will also resolve
      the PCT symptoms. There will be an initial visit to determine whether participants are
      eligible to be in the study. If a participant is found to be eligible, he/she will be asked
      come to the study site once every month over the course of one year, and then once every 3
      months for an additional year. There will be approximately 17 visits over the course of the
      whole study. At these visits the study doctors will check in with the participant and some
      blood and urine samples will be taken. Participants will not be charged for any of the lab
      tests that are being done as a part of this study alone. All participants in this study will
      receive the Harvoni pills at no cost to them.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Willing and able to give informed consent

          2. ≥18 years of age

          3. Symptoms and signs consistent with PCT and well documented biochemical diagnosis
             (urinary total porphyrin excretion &gt; 800 mcg/g Creatinine with HPLC pattern typical of
             PCT—predominance of 8- and 7-carboxyl porphyrins)

          4. Clinical diagnosis of PCT established by a study PI

          5. Chronic hepatitis C: HCV RNA positive and quantifiable in serum detected within 90
             days of enrollment, and documented HCV genotypes 1,4, 5, or 6 for which Harvoni is an
             approved therapy.

          6. Women of child-bearing potential must be willing to avoid pregnancy and use an
             accepted and effective contraceptive method during treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Women who are pregnant or who are breast-feeding

          2. Patients who have already started treatment of PCT with phlebotomy or low dose
             hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, or who have been in such treatment in the past 30
             days

          3. Patients who have already started another treatment regimen for CHC, or who have taken
             such treatment in the past 30 days

          4. Subjects who are enrolled in PC7206

             alcohol per week during most weeks in the prior 4 months (History of prior, but not
             current alcohol abuse will NOT be grounds for exclusion because we seek to treat
             subjects with PCT and CHC of the type typically seen in clinical practice)

          7. Any ongoing active IV drug use

          8. Patients who are taking amiodarone or who have taken amiodarone within 60 days prior

             John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), both of which are P-gp inducers, which may
             significantly reduce the drug levels and therapeutic effects of Harvoni

         11. Chronic hepatitis B
