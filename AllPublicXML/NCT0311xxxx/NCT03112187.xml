      To evaluate the efficacy of a novel food supplement, Ferfer® to raise the capacity of
      Haemoglobin and Haematocrit levels

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia, described as a low blood Haemoglobin concentration, has been shown to be a public
      health problem that impacts low-, center- and high-earnings nations and has great unfavorable
      health results, as well as unfavorable influences on social and monetary development . even
      though the most dependable indicator of anemia on the populace stage is blood Haemoglobin
      attention, measurements of this attention by myself do now not determine the cause of anemia.
      Anemia may additionally result from a number of causes, with the maximum great contributor
      being iron deficiency. approximately 30%- 50% of instances of anemia are taken into
      consideration to be because of iron deficiency.

      Doctor will evaluate on the basis of inclusion or exclusion criteria, lab values and overall
      assessment and then enroll in this clinical trial. During the study patient will visit the
      Doctor four times, Day 0 week 4, week 8 and week 12. Doctor will investigate the Hemoglobin
      level and Hematocrit level and also evaluate the adverse effects and tolerability of Ferfer®
      at week 2 and week 8. Doctor also instructed to take the food supplements, twice daily, once
      in a morning and once in evening independently by food intake as Ferfer® has no interaction
      with food.

    <description>Ferfer is a food supplement in liposomal form, with essential, vitamins including Vitamin C and Vitamin B12. Ferfer directly dissolves in the mouth without the need for water. The technology of liposomal microencapsulation, allows daily iron supplementation without any of the typical side effects of conventional oral iron supplements, such as heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, nausea and coloring of the mucous membranes and of the stools, which increases patient compliance. It has no metallic taste or smell, does not color mucous membrane and has excellent tolerability</description>
