  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) has no known effective treatment. While often treated with
      long-term opioid therapy, opioids do not work well for many patients and can cause serious
      side effects, including addiction, poorer mental health, and overdose death. Even when paired
      with a standard-of-care cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), results are limited. Patients,
      families and clinicians are very interested in using alternative treatments for CLBP,
      especially complementary and integrative treatments such as mindfulness meditation (MM). MM
      helps train the mind to bring non-judgmental and accepting attention to present-moment
      experiences such as pain. MM offers an active and safe self-care approach to chronic pain
      that contrasts with the passive and potentially harmful nature of opioid treatment, and may
      prove more effective than CBT in helping improve health and well-being, and reduce reliance
      on opioids in adults with opioid-treated CLBP. Although this hypothesis is supported by early
      research, including a pilot study by the Principal Investigator, evidence on MM's
      effectiveness in this population is inconclusive, presenting a critical knowledge gap.

      With input from patients, family members, and clinicians, the Investigators have designed a
      study to address this gap and propose a clinical trial that will compare the effectiveness of
      MM to standard-of-care CBT in opioid-treated CLBP. Based on the existing research, it is
      hypothesized that MM training will lead to a larger reduction in pain intensity, increase in
      physical function, improvement in quality of life, and decrease in daily opioid dose, as
      compared to CBT training, with benefits of MM especially notable in adults with worse mood,
      anxiety or unhealthy opioid-use behaviors who often experience more severe symptoms of CLBP
      and less improvement in response to existing therapies.

      To test these hypotheses, 766 adults with opioid-treated CLBP from Madison, WI, Boston, MA,
      and Salt Lake City, will be randomly assigned into one of two 8-week treatment groups: MM
      (383 participants) that will receive the MM training or CBT (383 participants) that will
      receive the CBT training. The effectiveness of MM versus CBT will be assessed over a 12-month
      period with patient-reported measures, recommended by experts and endorsed by our stakeholder
      partners, including patients with opioid-treated CLBP, their families and clinicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common disabling chronic noncancer pain condition
      treated with opioids. Many opioid-treated patients experience inadequate pain relief and
      disability as well as dose-dependent adverse effects of opioids, such as worse mental health,
      opioid misuse, overdose and death. They frequently have co-occurring depression, anxiety, and
      opioid use disorders, which worsen outcomes. Poor outcomes and opioid-related harms
      underscore the need for safe and effective strategies for chronic pain care and opioid dose
      reduction, especially in high-impact, opioid-treated pain, as noted by the Institute of
      Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
      Institute.

      Our pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of mindfulness meditation (MM), a popular
      mind-body modality, demonstrated its potential to safely improve the health of patients and
      reduce opioid dosage in opioid-treated CLBP. To expand the evidence for MM for use in
      opioid-treated chronic pain, the Investigators propose a 5-year multi-site, mixed-methods
      pragmatic RCT comparing the effectiveness of MM to standard-of-care cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) for improving outcomes in opioid-treated CLBP. The study team will follow 766
      participants over 12 months and compare outcomes that matter to patients and their families
      in 383 adults randomized to the MM group to 383 adults randomized to the CBT group,
      controlling for relevant factors.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To compare the effectiveness of MM to CBT for reducing pain and increasing function. We
           hypothesize that adults with opioid-treated CLBP in the MM group will report a greater
           reduction in pain severity and a greater increase in function at 6 and 12 months
           compared to those in the CBT group.

        2. To compare the effectiveness of MM to CBT for improving quality of life (QoL) and
           reducing daily opioid dose. We hypothesize that adults with opioid-treated CLBP in the
           MM group will report a greater improvement in QoL and a greater decrease in daily opioid
           dose at 6 and 12 months compared to those in the CBT group.

        3. To examine if participant baseline characteristics impact treatment response to MM or
           CBT. We hypothesize that among those with increased baseline symptom severity of
           anxiety, depression and opioid misuse behaviors, MM will be more beneficial than CBT for
           improving Aim 1 and Aim 2 outcomes.

      Both MM and CBT interventions are patterned after established programs, adapted to meet the
      needs of patients with opioid-treated CLBP, with input from content experts and patient
      partners. The manualized interventions will be delivered by trained therapists over 8 weeks
      in weekly two-hour group sessions in addition to care the participants are already receiving
      from their regular clinicians; participants will also be asked to practice MM or CBT
      strategies at home during the entire study (at least 30 minutes/day, 6 days/week).

      Eligibility criteria will focus on English-speaking adults ≥21 years old, with
      moderate-to-severe CLBP treated with ≥30 mg/day of morphine-equivalent opioid dose for ≥3
      months. The study will implement a limited set of exclusionary criteria to ensure a diverse
      sample, from which findings can be generalized.

      Outcome measures were selected and prioritized based on guidelines and stakeholder input.
      They will be collected at baseline, at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Only baseline and 12 months
      post-entry data collection will be conducted in person; the 3, 6, and 9-month data collection
      will occur online or by phone to minimize burden. Pain severity and function, as assessed by
      standard, validated survey measures, will serve as primary (Aim 1), and quality of life and
      opioid dose (morphine-equivalent mg/day) as secondary (Aim 2) outcomes. Severity of negative
      affect (depression, anxiety) and opioid misuse behaviors, also measured by validated surveys,
      are the main hypothesized predictors of treatment success (Aim 3). The repeated measures
      intention-to-treat outcome analysis will compare the change in primary and secondary outcomes
      over the 12 month period and across the two groups. To determine prognostic factors of
      treatment effect, a linear mixed model analysis will be performed for Aim 1 and Aim 2
      outcomes, adjusting for potential confounders, study site and a random intercept for subject.

      A team of experienced investigators and engaged stakeholders will carry out this multi-health
      system, multi-site study led by the faculty from the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI),
      Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA) and the University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT).
      Stakeholders helped develop this proposal and will be integrally involved as partners in all
      aspects of the study, from finalizing the methods, trouble-shooting implementation of the
      research plan, and dissemination of results.

      Positive findings of this study could help improve health outcomes and reduce daily opioid
      dose in patients with opioid-treated CLBP, and inform clinical decisions of patients and
      clinicians about the choice between MM and CBT for opioid-treated CLBP.
