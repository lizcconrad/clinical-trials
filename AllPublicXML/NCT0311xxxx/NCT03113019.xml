      The purpose of this work: to assess the tolerability and effectiveness of the autogemotherapy
      method on the basis of autologous antigen-activated dendritic cells in the treatment of
      patients with breast cancer.

      This technology is intended for complex treatment of patients with breast cancer and is aimed
      at preventing the occurrence and treatment of secondary foci. The need for this technology is
      justified by the widespread occurrence of breast cancer among women, a decrease in the
      average age at onset of the disease and a young age, and the chemoresistantness of locally
      advanced forms of cancer.

      Currently, technologies are being developed to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with
      complex treatment of breast cancer. Many patients are immunosuppressed after surgical,
      radiation and chemotherapeutic treatment, which leads to dysfunction of T cells, resulting in
      tumor cells avoiding immune surveillance. Restoration of antitumor immunity during
      immunotherapy is one of the modern approaches in the treatment of breast cancer, which
      contributes to the formation of an effective specific immune response, the destruction of
      tumor cells while minimizing toxicity. Dendritic cells (DC) and the lymphocytes induced by
      them are one of the most effective methods for the destruction of residual cancer cells,
      which are the leading cause of relapse and metastasis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For the first time established morphologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer

          2. patients with II A, II B, IIIA, III B stages of breast cancer;

          3. Patients with progressive or primary IV stage of breast cancer with cytologically
             confirmed and accessible soft tissue metastases;

          4. Patients with HER-2 / neu 3 + positive and patients with triple negative breast cancer
             of the I-II stage (biologically unfavorable forms of breast cancer more prone to
             recurrence and metastasis).

          5. Absence of severe somatic pathology in which medical intervention (at the stage of
             obtaining biological material or the stage of immunotherapy) will only worsen the
             patient's condition,

          6. The patient's desire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy at any time,

          2. Impossibility of correction of therapy of concomitant diseases, if the taken
             preparations are proved to influence the immune status,

          3. Rapid progression of the underlying disease, in which the use of immunotherapy is
             deontologically unjustified,

          4. Individual intolerance to the components of the vaccine and / or the development of
             severe side effects on any of the components,

          6. Patient involvement in any other clinical study (including those that the patient has
             not been informed by the direct oncologist who has been treated, but which has become
             known already after the beginning of any stage of the study).
