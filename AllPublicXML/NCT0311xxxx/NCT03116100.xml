  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral disorders of psychiatric or neurological origin in the elderly are an emerging
      public health problem. Its management can include a prescription of psychotropic drugs
      (anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, antidepressants for the most part). Many studies
      highlight the misuse of psychotropic drugs in this specific and vulnerable population, as
      well as the need for targeted actions.

      As for neuroleptics, there is a deleterious over-prescription in the so-called productive
      behavioral disorders (cries, agitation, aggressiveness, ambulation), in particular in the
      patient with Alzheimer's disease (80% of patients) or related. The same applies to behavioral
      disorders in an acute episode of confusion, which also constitute a situation for the
      prescribing of psychotropic drugs in the elderly. The frailty of the elderly associated with
      neuroleptics is the cause of a significant iatrogenic (falls, confusions, excessive sedation,
      etc.), iatrogeny is largely avoidable.

      There is little data on the representation of behavioral disorders in the elderly, whereas
      the recognition and management of behavioral disorders are functions of the tolerance of the
      entourage and the training of the caregivers. Significant data exist in the literature about
      diagnosis, risk factors, factors favoring or triggering behavioral disorders and somatic
      pathologies to be sought urgently.

      The available recommendations on the drug treatment of behavioral disorders are complex and
      inappropriate in light of new data, including the dangerousness of psychotropic drugs. The
      deleterious effect of long-term drug treatments is proved. There is no validated drug
      strategy, especially in acute confusions of the elderly.

      One study showed that there was a change in the type of neuroleptic prescribed between 2003
      and 2010. Half of the general practitioners studied during this period switched from a
      first-generation neuroleptic to a second-generation neuroleptic. Nevertheless, the type of
      molecule chosen remains at the discretion of the treating physician or even required a
      psychiatric opinion or a passage in the emergencies. In the case where the practitioner
      initiates a prescription in office, in the home or in EHPAD, certain situations require the
      choice of a neuroleptic with or without pre-therapeutic assessment.
