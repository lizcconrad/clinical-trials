      decreasing the pain during the procedure .

      Research question :

      In women undergoing diagnostic hysteroscopy, does warm saline distension media decrease the
      pain during the procedure ?

      Aim of the work :

      - This study aim to assess the efficacy of warm saline distension media in decreasing the
      pain in women undergoing diagnostic hysteroscopy

    <description>d. The degree of pain that the patient feels in the procedure will be estimated by using visual analoge scale (VAS) (figure 1) at 2 times: At the end of the procedure and at 15 minutes after the examination. The patient makes a mark on the VAS line to indicate the intensity of her pain. The distance from the zero point to the marked point is measured using a graduated ruler. Each pain assessment is made on a separate line.</description>
