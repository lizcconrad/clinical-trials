  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I study is to know the pharmacodynamic profile in humans of the
      sodium heparin of porcine origin of the company União Química, building from the
      pharmacodynamic data generated its pharmacokinetic profile, due to the dosage limitation of
      heparin directly in biological samples. In addition, the toxicity of the product will be
      evaluated in healthy male participants.

    <textblock>
      This stage of product development follows the guidelines of the ANVISA (National Health
      Surveillance Agency) Heparin Development Guide.

      Unfractionated sodium heparin is a drug known and widely used in the world for over half a
      century, thus, no unknown adverse events or any risk of administration are expected in
      humans, however, this is the first human Biological product developed by União Química. The
      proposed development of this biological drug follows the individual route, the control
      heparin used in the present study has the objective of evaluating the results found with the
      test product, without the obligation to demonstrate bioequivalence among the evaluated
      products.

    <gender>Male</gender>
    <gender_based>Yes</gender_based>
    <gender_description>It is known that male participants are preferable in clinical trials due to the hormonal stability presented by males compared to females, and the results that the drug under test can present are clearer, that is, with less hormonal interference.</gender_description>
