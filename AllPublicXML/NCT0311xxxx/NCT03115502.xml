  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese patients have increased cardiovascular risk and target organ damage (TOD) as compared
      to people with normal weight. Weight loss reduces cardiovascular risk and TOD. These changes
      have been associated mainly to changes in inflammatory and pro-atherogenic markers. Office
      peripheral blood pressure (BP) appears to decrease after bariatric surgery, but information
      on changes in 24h-ambulatory-BP-monitoring (24h-ABPM) and central-BP(cBP), or about the
      possible role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS), serotonin(STS) and
      endocannabinoid(ECS) systems is scarce. Our hypothesis is that the hemodynamic changes
      mediated by alterations in the RAAS, STS and ECS after weight loss are also responsible for
      the reduction of TOD.
