  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human foot allows to perform several functions, rather than providing a Static support
      for the body, the foot acts dynamically in walking and Movement of the body, requiring
      adequate biomechanics responsible for Maintenance and posture of the body and harmonic
      distribution of plantar pressure.

      One of the most important structures for this control is the medial plantar vault (MPA), an
      important structure in the absorption of impact and essential for the function Foot. The
      deformation of the MPA in the gait support phase absorbs the Energy and propels the limb, to
      perform this biomechanical function the MPA must Stable from the anatomical point of view,
      which is conferred by the bone architecture and But also by the performance of the intrinsic
      and extrinsic musculature of the Feet. The fall of the MPA, decreases the stability of the
      foot, limits its biomechanical function,

      Besides being a risk factor for the development of pathologies such as:

      Tendinopathy of the calcaneus tendon and plantar fasciitis. Various Intrinsic Muscles And
      extrinsic have the function of stabilizing the foot and the MPA, being the main Extrinsic
      muscles: the posterior tibial, the flexor long of the hallux and the fingers. The Muscles
      when activated increase the height and decrease the Length of the MPA. Several methods are
      used to evaluate ALM, such as (AN), Feiss line (LF) and MPA angle (MPAH), in addition to the
      Baropodometry, which is used to evaluate dysfunctions in the feet, with the principle of Map
      the pressure of the plantar surface in a static and dynamic way. Based In this information,
      this study aims to evaluate the influence of the Strengthening of the intrinsic and extrinsic
      muscles of the feet, for the Of MPA in asymptomatic patients.
