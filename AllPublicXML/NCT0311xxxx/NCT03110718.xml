  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle vibration (MV) has been suggested as a useful non-pharmacological approach to control
      spasticity. Armeo Power® (AP) is a robotic exoskeleton for rehabilitation allowing early
      rehabilitation treatment. The objective of our study was to determine whether AP training
      coupled with MV applied on antagonist muscles of the spastic upper limb (UL) can reduce the
      spasticity of agonist muscles. We enrolled 20 chronic post-stroke patients, who underwent 40
      daily sessions of AP training. Ten subjects (group-A) received muscle MV (on triceps brachii,
      deltoid, and supraspinatus), whereas the other 10 (group-B) underwent a sham vibration.

    <description>The patients underwent forty 1h Armeo-P training sessions (i.e. five times a week for eight consecutive weeks). During the first session, the device was adjusted to the patient's arm size and the angle of suspension. The working space and the exercises were selected once the UL had been fitted with the system. All the subjects in the arm received a focal belly-muscle vibration on the spastic antagonist muscles (i.e. triceps brachialis-TB, deltoid-DE, and supraspinatus-SS) during shoulder abduction and elbow extension. MV was delivered by a pneumatic vibrator powered by compressed air, wired to appropriate-muscle probe diameter (up to 2cm2). MV was set at a frequency of 80Hz and an individually adjusted vibration amplitude so that it was just below the threshold for perceiving an illusory movement. The investigators chose such set up to avoid any signs of muscle contraction potentially reflecting either possible voluntary movement or occurrence of the tonic vibration reflex (TVR).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The patients underwent the same Armeo-P trainingas the experimental group. Only the vibration protocol was didderent. Indeed, in the control group a sham vibration was used, while in the experimental group, patients underwent a real one.
Sham vibration was delivered to the control group using the same procedure of the experimental group;however, vibration intensity was subthreshold (i.e. 50mBar below the threshold).</description>

    <description>All the subjects assigned to the experimental received a focal belly-muscle vibration on the spastic antagonist muscles (i.e. triceps brachialis-TB, deltoid-DE, and supraspinatus-SS) during shoulder abduction and elbow extension. MV was delivered by a pneumatic vibrator powered by compressed air (Vibraplus; @Circle, San Pietro in Casale, Italy) (fig. 2) wired to appropriate-muscle probe diameter (up to 2cm2). MV was set at a frequency of 80Hz and an individually adjusted vibration amplitude (approximately 2mm in indentation depth, mean pressure of 250mBar, which effectively induce inhibition of the monosynaptic reflex) so that it was just below the threshold for perceiving an illusory movement. We chose such set up to avoid any signs of muscle contraction potentially reflecting either possible voluntary movement or occurrence of the tonic vibration reflex (TVR).</description>
