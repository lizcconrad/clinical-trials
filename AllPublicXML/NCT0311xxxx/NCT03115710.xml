  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a ocular disease classified under ectatic diseases which often results in
      bilateral and asymmetrical corneal distortion. It usually affects patients at young age and
      can cause severe visual loss.

      The overall goal of this study is to assess the prevalence of keratoconus (KC) in children
      and adolescents in various regions of the world based on modern tomographic imaging methods,
      and to verify whether the occurrence rates reported from literature should be corrected. Our
      hypothesis is that the prevalence of the disease is much higher than that traditionally
      reported.

      At each site, corneal tomography examinations (Pentacam) will be performed bilaterally in
      children and adolescents, who are not ill or with any ophthalmological symptom. The
      population to be studied will be composed of children and adolescents on medical visits for
      non-ophthalmologic reasons, aged between 6 and 20 years. Multiple cities, from different
      continents (North America, South America, Asia and Europe) will participate.

    <description>One visit to Ophthalmology Department is required from participant. Parents or legal guardians must attend with their child. The interview and test during visit take approximately 15 minutes. Interview includes filling out a questionnaire about risk factors of the disease and double check on understanding the consent form. The child will sit in front of the instrument (Pentacam HR Scheimpflug imaging system). The rotational measuring procedure generates Scheimpflug images in three dimensions. The images taken during the examination are digitalized, and all image data are transferred to the computer. It calculates a 3D virtual model of the anterior eye segment, from which all additional information is derived.</description>
