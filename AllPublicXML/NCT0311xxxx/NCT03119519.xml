  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive therapy may improve survival in synchronous oligometastatic NSCLC and the goal of
      this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of local definitive radiotherapy in
      this subset of patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For NSCLC patients with synchronous oligometastases, first line chemotherapy or targeted
      therapy concurrent with non-salvage radiotherapy on metastatic or primary thoracic tumor
      contributed a longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy or targeted therapy alone.
