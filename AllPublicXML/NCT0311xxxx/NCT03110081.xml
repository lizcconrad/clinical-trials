  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess if Quadratus Lumborum (QL) blocks are non-inferior to epidural
      analgesia for pain control and opioid consumption through the third postoperative day in
      patients having open partial nephrectomy. Patients satisfying all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either epidural catheter or QL catheter.

      QL blocks with a single shot and catheters infusions may be an alternative to epidural
      analgesia. However, the relative efficacy, safety, and cost of the two approaches remain
      unclear.

      Epidural analgesia is frequently used as a component of multimodal analgesia for thoracic and
      abdominal surgery. QL block has been introduced recently as a component of multimodal
      analgesia for lower thoracic and abdominal surgery. In general, insertion of QL catheter is
      easier and safer than insertion of epidural catheters. QL catheter management is also less
      complicated than epidural analgesia (fewer catheter displacements and less hemodynamic
      compromise) and decreases the level of complexity in postoperative care. Our hypothesis is
      that the subcostal QL approach with a continuous catheter is non-inferior to epidural
      analgesia for pain control and opioid consumption in patients having open partial nephrectomy
      procedure.

    <description>Time-weighted average verbal rating scale for pain until 72 hours after operation as a time-weighted average, based on nursing assessments at four-hour intervals. The verbal rating scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating worst pain imaginable. Time-weighted average pain is defined as the sum of each time interval between two adjacent pain score measurements multiplied by the average of the two corresponding pain scores divided by the time interval between the first and last pain scores.</description>
