  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: After having a spinal cord injury (SCI), people develop changes in their body
      composition that influences their long-term health. Individuals with paralysis after SCI will
      have large declines in their bone density ant increases in fat mass which increases their
      risk of fracture and heart disease. Therapies to prevent SCI-related changes in body
      composition and their health effects are needed. Drugs known as &quot;statins&quot; used often to
      reduce high cholesterol, may help to reduce bone loss and inflammation.

      Hypothesis: Among adults with SCI for a long time, treatment with a drug named Rosuvastatin
      or a sugar pill, with supplements (coenzyme Q10, calcium and vitamin D), for twelve months
      can decrease their endocrine metabolic disease risk by increasing bone density and reducing
      inflammation.

      Study Design: A clinical trial will be conducted in Toronto, Ontario and Miami, Florida.
      Subjects will get statin therapy or placebo (sugar pill) by chance. Study subjects and
      research staff will not know whether they are taking the study drug or a sugar pill until
      after the study

      Subjects: Fifty-four adults (age 18-60 years) with a long-term SCI and no movement below
      their level of injury.

      Treatment: Subjects will be prescribed Rosuvastatin 10 mg daily or a sugar pill. In addition,
      all subjects will receive 100 mg of Co-Q10 daily, calcium carbonate 1250 mg and, vitamin D
      2,000 IU once a day.

      Data Collected: Subjects' bone density will be collected at the start and end of the study.
      Change in bone density between the two groups will be compared to see if one is better. Blood
      samples will be collected quarterly to make sure subjects are safe and do not develop
      problems with their liver or muscles and to measure the effects of the study drugs on
      inflammation throughout the body.

      Clinical Implications: Statins may be safe and effective therapy for adults living with SCI
      who are at increased risk of endocrine metabolic disease as they age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Individuals with motor-complete spinal cord injury (SCI) undergo dramatic changes
      in body composition in the first 18 months post-injury, including declines in bone mineral
      density (BMD) that increase lower-extremity fragility fracture risk, and increases in fat
      mass that increase cardio-metabolic disease (CMD) risk. While statins are an effective
      treatment for dyslipidemia, research evidence suggests additional pleiotropic effects on bone
      through promotion of osteogenesis, suppression of osteoblast apoptosis, and inhibition of
      osteoclastogenesis. There are currently no effective therapies to treat sublesional
      osteoporosis (SLOP) and reduce the risk of fragility fractures in individuals with SCI.

      Hypothesis: Twelve months of statin therapy with concurrent coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), to reduce
      risk of statin neuromyotoxicity, and standard care (calcium 1250mg OD and vitamin D3 2000IU
      OD) will be superior to placebo with CoQ10 and standard care, for augmenting knee region BMD
      and reducing inflammatory stress (hs-CRP), thereby reducing endocrine metabolic disease risk.

      Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of statin therapy for augmenting distal
      femoral BMD among adults with chronic motor-complete SCI in Toronto, Ontario and Miami,
      Florida.

      Study Design: Multi-centre, double-blind, randomized controlled Phase II safety and efficacy
      trial.

      Subjects: Consenting men and premenopausal women (N=54, age 18-60 yrs) with chronic (≥2
      years) spinal cord injury with a neurological level between C1-T10 and an AIS category of
      A/B.

      Intervention: Rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily at night versus placebo for 12 months. All subjects
      will receive osteoporosis standard care (calcium carbonate 1250mg po daily and vitamin D3
      2000 IU po daily) to maintain bone mass and CoQ10 100mg po daily to prevent statin-induced
      myopathy.

      Outcomes: Primary safety outcomes: i) establish the safety of rosuvastatin in chronic SCI by
      reporting the frequency of myotoxicity and type II diabetes onset; ii) frequency and mean
      duration of liver transaminase elevations in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups. Primary
      efficacy outcome: measure the mean between group absolute changes in distal femur areal BMD
      (aBMD, g/cm2) from baseline to one year. Secondary efficacy outcomes: will examine the mean
      absolute changes from baseline in: i) volumetric BMD (vBMD, g/cm3); ii) markers of bone
      turnover - Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BALP), telopeptide (CTX), Sclerostin and RANK
      Ligand (RANK-L); iii) serum inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C-reactive
      Protein (hs-CRP), Interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß). interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor - alpha
      (TNF-alpha), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); and, iv) lipid profile; low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides, and
      total cholesterol Clinical Implications: Should rosuvastatin prove to be safe and efficacious
      for reducing endocrine metabolic disease risk for adults with chronic SCI, the results will
      advance the health of people with SCI by reducing the frequency and severity of heart disease
      and fracture as they age, with a single intervention.
