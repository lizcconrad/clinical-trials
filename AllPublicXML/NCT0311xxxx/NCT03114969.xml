  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For effective drug delivery using inhalation route, it is important to use the inhalers
      correctly. This open-label study will evaluate the error rates during the use of ELLIPTA DPI,
      alone or in combination, in comparison with other DPIs. The study aims to provide clinical
      evidence in subjects with COPD that the reduced number of steps required to use the ELLIPTA
      DPI could result in fewer errors made by subjects, and therefore a more consistent treatment.
      Approximately 450 subjects prescribed with either of RELVAR® ELLIPTA, ANORO® ELLIPTA,
      INCRUSE® ELLIPTA, SYMBICORT® TURBUHALER®, SERETIDE® DISKUS®, SPIRIVA® HANDIHALER®, ULTIBRO®
      BREEZHALER® or SEEBRI® BREEZHALER will be included in the study and will have 2 clinical
      visits. At Visit 1, subjects will take their maintenance DPIs and the critical and overall
      errors made by subjects will be assessed. After the assessment, subjects will be instructed
      on correct use or informed of their correct use of their DPIs. The total duration of the
      study is approximately 6 weeks. ELLIPTA, SERETIDE and DISKUS are registered trademarks of the
      GSK group of companies. SYMBICORT and TURBUHALER are registered trademarks of the AstraZeneca

    <description>Subjects making any critical error in the use of the DPI prior to any training in correct use from a Healthcare Professional (HCP) will be recorded on the checklists. A critical error is defined as an error that is most likely to result in no or significantly reduced medication being inhaled.</description>

    <description>Subjects making an overall error (the combination of all errors 'critical' or 'non-critical') prior to any retraining in correct use from a Healthcare Professional (HCP) will be recorded on the checklists. A non critical error is defined as one where the dose may not be affected, but the subject has demonstrated improper use of their DPI as per the Patient Information leaflet.</description>
