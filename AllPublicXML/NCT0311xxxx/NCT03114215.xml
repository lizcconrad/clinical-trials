      This is a 6-month double blind randomized 2:1 placebo-controlled study with two arms
      (placebo, biotin 300 mg/day). The study will be followed by a 6-month extension phase during
      which all patients will receive biotin 300 mg/day.

    <intervention_model_description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of biotin at 300 mg/day over placebo in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
This is a 6-month double blind randomized 2:1 placebo-controlled study with two arms (placebo, biotin 300 mg/day). The study will be followed by a 6-month extension phase during which all patients will receive biotin 300 mg/day.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: 25 to 80 years, inclusive

          -  Male or female subjects with probable or confirmed ALS (revised international El
             Escorial criteria, Forbes et al., 2001).

          -  Patients presenting first motor deficits due to ALS for a maximum of three years at
             the first consultation in an ALS centre.

          -  Patients monitored for at least 6 months in an ALS centre or for whom the previous
             monitoring parameters are available (excepted for MIP and SNIP).

          -  Patients who have lost at least 5 points on the ALSFRS-R (ALS functional rating scale)
             during the last 12 months or at least 2 points during the preceding 6 months

          -  Patients who have been treated with riluzole for at least 3 months at a stable dose.
             In case of intolerance to this product or refusal for this treatment, patients who
             have not been treated with riluzole for at least 1 month before inclusion

          -  For patients with spinal form (onset of the disease affecting limbs) or respiratory
             form, slow vital capacity &gt; 60% of predicted value.

          -  For patients with a bulbar form, slow vital capacity &gt; 60% of theoretical value or, if
             spirometry not assessable (severe bulbar disability), patient should not have
             significant abnormality in both nocturnal capnography and nocturnal oximetry (median
             pCO2 (carbon dioxide partial pressure ) &lt; 52 mmHg, SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation )
             &lt; 90% less than 5% of the time during night) less than 3 months prior inclusion.

          -  Patients who are willing to give written consent (or oral consent in the presence of a
             trusted person if the patient is no longer able to write)

          -  Patients likely to be able to participate in all scheduled evaluation and complete all
             required study procedures (except for spirometry in bulbar patients with severe
             disability).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on non-invasive ventilation for respiratory insufficiency due to ALS for more
             than 10 hours a day

          -  Patients with an ALSFRS-R score at inclusion of &lt; 20 (maximum score without disability
             = 48)

          -  Patients who have lost less than 5 points on the ALSFRS-R during the last year or less
             than 2 points during the preceding 6 months

          -  Patients with a gastrostomy

          -  Patients who have lost more than 15% of their reference weight (defined as weight
             before disease onset)

          -  Patient with dyspnoea at rest or with the least effort (score &lt; 3 on the dyspnoea item
             of the ALSFRS-R)

          -  Patients with dementia

          -  Patient with severe or rapidly progressive form of ALS for whom the investigator
             estimates the life expectancy less than 3 months

          -  Patients with another progressive disease that has not been stabilized at the time of
             inclusion

          -  Patients with cancer, except basal cell carcinoma, for less than 5 years, or who
             require continuous treatment for cancer even if it is older

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Subject who are not covered by a social security scheme.

          -  Subject under temporary or permanent Judicial Protection.

          -  Contraception: Both male subjects, and female subjects who are not either surgically
             sterile (tubal ligation/obstruction or removal of ovaries or uterus) or
             post-menopausal (no spontaneous menstrual periods for at least one year confirmed by a
             negative hormone panel), must commit to using two highly effective method of birth
             control for the duration of the study and for two months after the treatment
             termination.
