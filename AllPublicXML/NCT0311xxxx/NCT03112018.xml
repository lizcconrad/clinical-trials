  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of evidence-based strategies
      can improve intrapartum and newborn care in facilities to reduce mortality among preterm
      infants. This will be a cluster randomized implementation science study across 23 facilities
      in Eastern Uganda and Western Kenya. Selected interventions will be supported in facilities
      to measure impact during the study period. These interventions are: a) data strengthening and
      data use activities; b) implementation of a modified WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist with an
      emphasis on preterm labor and preterm babies; c) simulation-based provider training and
      mentoring on key existing evidence-based practices to improve newborn outcomes; d) support of
      Quality Improvement (QI) cycles to identify and resolve facility-specific issues and
      bottlenecks. A two-stage design will be used where all study facilities will receive some
      aspects of the intervention initially, namely data strengthening and the modified checklist.
      Subsequently, the remaining interventions (QI cycles and simulation training of providers)
      will be rolled out to a randomly selected half of the facilities in the first stage. At a
      second stage, the remaining half of the facilities will receive the remaining interventions.

      This implementation science cluster randomized study includes a package of interventions.
      Control sites receive only the limited package of data strengthening and implementation of
      the modified Safe Childbirth Checklist. The randomly selected intervention facilities receive
      an enhanced package which also includes provider training/mentoring using PRONTO simulation
      and teamwork training, ongoing clinical mentoring, and support for Quality Improvement cycles
      (PDSA cycles) using a Model for Improvement framework. More detail about the contents of the
      intervention is included below.

      Data Strengthening Strategies: initial training focused on routinely collected data plus
      ongoing refreshers and mentorship throughout study duration

        -  Strengthen the MOH data collection system (birth registries, admission/discharge
           registries), as well as introduction of expanded documentation to capture preterm birth
           details

        -  Perform facility assessment to determine gaps in infrastructure, supplies as well as
           skills and competencies of providers and data managers to accurately and consistently
           report routine facility data

        -  Support facilities to use standardized definitions of indicators currently collected for
           antenatal and postnatal care

        -  Support adherence to national guidelines on documentation in the registers and patient
           charts through training, provision of registers/charts and motivation

        -  Introduce expanded routine documentation of preterm births including improving the
           register to capture data on preterm and still births, and implementation of the modified
           WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (see below)

        -  Support periodic data quality assessment cycles

        -  Create a synchronized online data dashboard repository system representing key
           indicators on an ongoing basis with selective access for health care providers and
           national policy makers

      WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist modified to address identification of preterm labor and newborn
      care for preterm babies: initial training plus ongoing refreshers and mentorship throughout
      study duration

        -  Introduce expanded routine documentation of preterm births including the piloting and
           use of a modified WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (mSCC)

        -  Introduce and train on use of the mSCC to detect, manage and treat high risk
           labor/babies

        -  Collect routine facility data including register reviews (study staff will visit each
           selected facility at least once per month)

        -  Conduct periodic audits of the mSCC to determine uptake and completeness, review for
           phenotyping information, and/or review for additional service indicators on preterm
           babies

      Measures to strengthen, recommended intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal care in facilities
      through PRONTO simulation-based provider training and mentorship: training of trainers and
      initial trainings in Kenya and Uganda plus ongoing mentorship in Kenya and modular refreshers
      in Uganda, throughout study duration

        -  Improve intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal management by using a customized PRONTO
           curriculum that includes highly realistic simulation and focused team training to
           address gaps in emergency obstetric and neonatal response. The training emphasizes
           lifesaving response during labor, delivery, postnatal and neonatal periods with specific
           emphasis on the care of preterm babies.

        -  Initial 2-days modular PRONTO training will be followed by periodic modular refreshers
           and supplemental mentoring. In Kenya, this involves 6 one-week mentoring sessions led by
           trained preterm champions over a 9-12 month period. In Uganda, a modular training model
           with intermittent refresher trainings and two-day clinical mentoring sessions will be
           offered over a 9-12 month period. Special emphasis will be put on evidence-based
           practices and the views gathered from Kenya and Uganda stakeholders.

        -  Promote close follow-up of preterm babies up to 28-days

      Measures to strengthen Quality Improvement (QI) cycles: initial training with ongoing
      mentorship; QI team meetings each week with quarterly cross-facility collaboration workshops
      throughout study duration

        -  Develop tools for, introduce and institutionalize QI cycles and regular project
           monitoring and evaluation

        -  Reinforcement of accurate and timely documentation in charts and registers in the
           facilities

        -  Reinforcement of use of the mSCC, including its use as a data source to track progress
           of change efforts

        -  Link system gaps or latent errors uncovered during simulation training and suggested
           solutions with QI efforts

        -  Develop and recommend some tools to improve data collection such as for triage,
           discharge and referral
