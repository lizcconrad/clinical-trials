    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PQ Bypass System to access,
      deliver guidewires and implant stent grafts for a percutaneous femoropopliteal (fem-pop)
      bypass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DETOUR II study is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, international,
      non-randomized, safety and effectiveness clinical investigation of the PQ Bypass system.

      The PQ Bypass System is intended to improve blood flow in patients with symptomatic
      peripheral arterial disease due to &gt;15 cm long occlusions and diffuse stenoses of
      femoropopliteal arteries, including in-stent re-stenosis, with reference vessel diameters
      ranging from 5.0 - 6.7 mm.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects are required to meet the following inclusion criteria in order to be
        considered eligible for participation in the study:

          1. Age 18 or older.

          2. Willing and able to provide informed consent.

          3. Severe claudication or rest pain or ischemic ulceration (Rutherford Becker scale 3-5)
             with a resting ABI ≤0.9. Resting TBI is utilized only if unable to reliably assess
             ABI. Resting TBI must be ≤0.5. Assessments are required for the target limb and
             contralateral limb.

          4. Venous Clinical Severity Score &lt;3.

          5. Femoro-popliteal stenotic lesions &gt;15 cm (TASC C and D) in length considered to be:

               -  Chronic total occlusion (100% stenosis)

               -  Diffuse stenosis (&gt;50% stenosis)

               -  In-stent restenosis (&gt;50% stenosis)

          6. Reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥5.0 mm and ≤6.7 mm, as measured via pre-screening
             CTA/MRA using 3D multi-plane reconstruction.

          7. Patent iliac and femoral arteries and tibial veins and access vessels, of sufficient
             size and morphology (including tortuosity), to allow arterial access with 8 Fr.
             introducer sheath.

          8. Visible SFA stump at the SFA origin.

          9. Significant aortoiliac or common femoral &quot;inflow&quot; lesions (i.e. angiographically
             defined &gt;50% stenosis of the iliac or common femoral artery) must be successfully
             treated prior to treatment of the target lesion. This can be done just prior to
             treatment of the target lesion. Successful treatment is defined as &lt;30% stenosis after
             either PTA or stenting of the inflow lesion. After successful treatment of the inflow
             lesion, the subject will be included in the study following sheath placement distal to
             the treated lesion.

         10. A subject with bilateral obstructive SFA disease is eligible for enrollment into the
             study. If a subject with bilateral disease is enrolled, and both limbs meet the study
             enrollment criteria, the target limb for study treatment will be selected at the
             Investigator's discretion. Lesion characteristic such as lesion length, percent
             stenosis, and/or calcification content may be used in study treatment decision. The
             non-target limb may be treated using currently available (non-investigational) methods
             &gt;30 days post index procedure.

         11. Non diseased patent popliteal artery 3 cm proximal to tibial plateau.

         12. At least 1 continuous patent tibial artery (&lt;50% stenosed) with flow to the ankle or
             foot.

         13. Patent femoral vein ≥10 mm in diameter or duplicate femoral vein.

         14. Subject is eligible for standard surgical repair, if necessary.

         15. Subject is ambulatory.

         16. Subject has &gt;1 year life expectancy.

         17. Subject is able to comply with the necessary follow-up examinations and tests in
             accordance with protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participating in the study if they meet any of the following
        exclusion criteria:

             considered to be at risk for reoccurrence.

         12. Known bleeding or hypercoagulability disorder or significant anemia (Hb&lt;8.0) that
             cannot be corrected.

         21. Has known hypersensitivities, allergies or contraindications to: nitinol, PTFE;
             aspirin, heparin, antiplatelet, anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy; or
