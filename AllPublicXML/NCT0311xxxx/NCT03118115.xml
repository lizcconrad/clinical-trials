  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MONITRANS project consist of developing a monitoring technology of post-operative breast
      reconstruction by detecting thrombosis. Its aim is to reducing time spent in hospital by
      monitoring patients at home.

      Thrombosis following to abdominal free flap harvesting for breast reconstruction is a rare
      phenomenon (with a 2 until 15 % frequency). Moreover, it leads to ischemia by limiting water
      intake in the plasma compartments. The investigator would like to prove, by this research
      project, that they are able to detect ischemia via bioimpedance technology.

      During abdominal free flap harvesting for breast reconstruction, there are few minutes where
      the flap is clamped because of anastomosis on the recipient vessels. The investigators would
      seize the opportunity of this step, which is similar to vascular thrombosis, to measure
      bioimpedance variations.

      Therefore they would like to measure variations of the flap bioimpedance before and after
      vascular section. Another purpose consists of developing an algorithm which will detect
      postoperative thrombosis.
