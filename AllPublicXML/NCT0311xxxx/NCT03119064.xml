  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New treatments are greatly needed for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Metronomic
      temozolomide is a standard treatment option but has, at best, modest activity. The
      nanoliposomal irinotecan may be much more active than the parent compound irinotecan since
      nanoliposomal irinotecan's ability to cross the blood brain barrier is improved. This phase I
      study will establish the MTD of the combination of nanoliposomal irinotecan in combination
      with temozolomide safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of the combination of
      nanoliposomal irinotecan and metronomic temozolomide.

    <description>Three patients will be accrued to level 1. If no dose limiting toxicities are observed following completion of 4 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment then accrual to dose level 2 will proceed (patients must be evaluated prior to their cycle 3 treatment and this will be used to confirm DLTs). If a DLT is observed in one of the first 3 patients in a dose level, then accrual for that level will be expanded to 6 patients. Accrual will continue in this way until the MTD of nanoliposomal irinotecan with temozolomide 50mg/m2/day is determined. Two or more instances of DLT in a cohort of 6 patients will result in the preceding dose level being defined as the MTD. If two or more instances of DLT in a cohort of 6 patients occurs in dose level 1 then dose level -1 of nanoliposomal irinotecan will be investigated. After determination of the MTD, the final cohort will be expanded so that a total of 25 patients are treated on study. The final cohort will be treated at the MTD.</description>
