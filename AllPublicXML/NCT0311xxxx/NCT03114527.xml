  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two center, 2 arm, Phase II study evaluating the combination of Ribociclib and
      Everolimus in patients with advanced DDL and LMS who have had at least 1 prior systemic
      therapy. Patients will be enrolled by sarcoma histology into DDL (Arm A) and LMS (Arm B). The
      purpose of this study is to determine the anti-tumor activity of this doublet therapy in
      these patient cohorts. Ribociclib will be administered orally at 300 mg/day 3 weeks on/1 week
      off. Everolimus will be administered 2.5 mg orally on a continuous 28 day cycle. Clinical and
      laboratory assessments will be made on day 1, d15 of cycle 1 and 2, and day 1 of each
      subsequent cycle. Tumor response will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 at (CT or MRI) at week 8, 16,
      24 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Study drug administration will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Patients will be followed until
      death or are lost to follow-up for analysis of secondary endpoints.

      There will be a 1 step registration process for dedifferentiated liposarcoma patients while
      patients with leiomyosarcoma will require a 2 step registration process. For step 1 of
      registration, patients must meet all the eligibility criteria necessary for step 1. For step
      2 registration, patients must meet the inclusion criteria necessary for step 2 to be enrolled
      into the study.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study and for at least 3 months after completion of treatment. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male
                  partner should be the sole partner for that patient

               -  Use of 1 highly effective method of contraception, and 1 additional (barrier)
                  method, at the same time

        Highly effective methods: Intra-uterine devices (IUD), Hormonal (birth control pills/oral
        contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patches, or contraceptive
        implants) Other effective methods (barrier methods): Latex condom, Diaphragm with
        spermicide; Cervical cap; Sponge

          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug and for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

        Inclusion Criteria Step 2 (LMS patients only):

        - Patients with leiomyosarcoma must have tumors with intact Rb as documented by protein
        expression by IHC for study entry. Patients without sufficient archival tissue for testing
        will not be eligible. Please see Section 9.0 for further details on testing and
        interpretation of results. In the event that a patient has prior sequencing information
        (i.e. through commercial testing) suggestive of intact Rb, the patient may be included into
        the study on a case by case basis as determined by the principle investigators. The patient
        will still be required to submit tissue for Rb determination by IHC, but will not need to
        wait for these results for study entry.
