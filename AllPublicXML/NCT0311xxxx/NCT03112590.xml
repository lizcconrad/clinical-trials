  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and to find the optimal dose in
      participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer who
      are given the combination of Interferon-gamma with paclitaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab.
      This study will also look at other effects of Interferon-gamma with paclitaxel, trastuzumab
      and pertuzumab, including its effect on this type of cancer.

      Interferon-gamma is a biologically manufactured protein that is similar to a protein the body
      makes naturally. In the body, interferon gamma is produced by immune cells and helps to
      prevent serious infections.

    <measure>Phase 1: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period for dose escalation will be during the first three weeks. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) dose level is defined as the highest dose level with ≤1 out of 6 participants experiencing a DLT. If the first dose level experience two or more DLTs, then dose de-escalation will occur. DLT during cycle one (C1) is defined as follows: Non-hematologic or hematologic toxicities that are ≥ grade 3 in severity and probably or definitely related to study therapy which leads to chemotherapy treatment delays &gt; 14 days are considered DLT. The MTD will become the RP2D.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Pathologic Complete Response Rate (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>After post therapy surgery - Therapy: approximately 12 weeks per participant</time_frame>
    <description>Pathologic complete response in the breast at definitive surgery after completion of protocol therapy. The pathologic response to treatment will be assessed by an institutional pathologist at Moffitt Cancer Center. The pathologist will evaluate response by the &quot;Residual Cancer Burden&quot;(RCB) for each participant as described in the online calculator (see RCB link in the More Information section).</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) based upon tumor measurements obtained on physical examination at baseline, after completion of 4 cycles of study therapy. Factors that will be evaluated include: Breast mass(es) - size (longest dimension); Axillary lymph node(s) - size (longest dimension); Skin edema of the breast - present worse, present unchanged, present improved, or absent; Skin erythema of the breast - present worse, present unchanged, present improved, or absent.</description>

    <description>Phase 1: Participants with HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer enrolled in groups of 3-6 or more; each group participant to be given the same dose and schedule of Interferon-gamma plus paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab. If group participants do not have bad side effects, the next group will be given a higher dose of Interferon-gamma. This will continue until the highest safe dose of Interferon-gamma is found. Once highest safe dose of Interferon-gamma is found, participants may be enrolled in Phase II.
Phase 2: Approximately 31 participants with Stage 2-3 HER2 positive early stage breast cancer enrolled to receive therapy with Interferon-gamma plus paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab. Interferon-gamma given at dose found in the Phase 1.

             inhibitors for prevention or treatment of breast cancer, are eligible. Patients who
             are hormone-receptor positive and who have received other hormonal agents for the
             treatment of breast cancer (e.g., Fulvestrant®) are also eligible. Tamoxifen therapy
