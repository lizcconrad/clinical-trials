      Early de-escalation of carbapenems can reduce unnecessary use of carbaepenems compared with
      late de-escalation without compromised clinical outcomes

    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized control trial was conducted among patients receiving care at the
      medicine units of the Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital.

      Patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. The standard group followed the hospital
      policy in which carbapenems were evaluated by ID specialist at 72 hours of admission (late
      de-escalation). De-escalation may occurred earlier depends upon the decision of the primary
      care team. The intervention group is de-escalation carbapenems early within 24 hours or no
      later than 72 hours of prescription by ID specialist (early de-escalation).

      Clinical outcomes included rate of de-escalation within the first 24 hour, the mortality
      rate, and other clinical outcomes.
