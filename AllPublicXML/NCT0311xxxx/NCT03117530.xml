  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly disabling, persistent neurodevelopmental
      disorders. There are no available treatments for core symptoms of ASD or biologically-based
      clinical biomarkers. Emerging evidence indicates that levels of brain inflammation are
      increased in ASD. In particular, recent work implicates hyperactivity of microglial cells,
      the resident immune cells of the brain. However, the functional consequences of microglial
      activation remain unknown. This study will measure microglial activation in ASD using
      positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging. Adult males with ASD (n=15) and healthy
      controls (n=15) will be recruited for this study and undergo comprehensive clinical and
      behavioral baseline assessment. All subjects will then undergo baseline PET imaging using a
      radiotracer that labels activated microglia. Subjects with ASD will then undergo 12-week open
      label treatment with minocycline, an FDA-approved antibiotic thought to block microglial
      activation. PET imaging will be repeated at 12 weeks to confirm target engagement. A subset
      of control subjects will also undergo repeat PET imaging to determine test-retest
      reliability. During minocycline treatment, ASD subjects will be evaluated every 2 weeks for
      safety, clinical impression, behavioral functioning, and measures of cognition. Results will
      provide important information regarding the relationship between levels of brain
      inflammation, cognitive and behavioral function in ASD.

    <description>Following initial baseline PET-CT imaging and clinical evaluation, adults with ASD will undergo a 12- week open-label treatment trial of minocycline to be conducted at UCLA under supervision of the UCLA IRB. During weeks 1-6, ASD subjects will be treated with 50 mg minocycline twice daily (low dose). From weeks 7-12, dosing will be increased to 100mg twice daily (typical clinical dosage). Every two weeks during this phase, a treating clinician will measure vital signs, assess safety, record adverse effects, and monitor compliance. Compliance will be obtained as an index of tolerability and will assessed through weekly medication diaries and pill counts.</description>
