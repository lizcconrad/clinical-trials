  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to primarily assess the rate of complication of anterior vitrectomy for
      patients undergoing femtosecond laser-assisted (FLA) cataract extraction and intraocular lens
      placement (CEIOL) compared to manual CEIOL, when performed by resident physicians under
      direct attending supervision. In this pilot study, the investigators aim to assess what the
      incidence of anterior vitrectomy is for each group, in order to better understand the sample
      size needed to assess whether there is a difference between these two groups. Secondarily, it
      will gather preliminary data on safety and refractive outcomes for patients undergoing these
      interventions.
