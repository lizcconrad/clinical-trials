  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To help determine if there is improved pain relief when a device that makes an arm muscle
      move (nerve stimulator) is used to place a needle in the area above the collarbone to prevent
      feeling of pain (anesthesia) of the upper arm.

      The Investigators will use the assessment of onset of motor and sensory block Q 5 minutes to
      distinguish the difference between blocks performed with ultrasound guidance with or without
      a nerve blockade monitor.

    <measure>Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post block</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will be assessing changes between muscle strength in the myotomal distribution of the upper limb corresponding to the anesthetized region of the brachial plexus following supraclavicular block, using the MRC power scale (medical research council scale, 0-5), with strength values obtained at time zero (initiation of the block), and to compared to subsequent measurements in 5 minute intervals until the final measurement at 30 minutes following the block.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hot cold discrimination</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post block</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will be assessing changes in temperature sensation in the dermatomal distribution of the upper limb corresponding to the anesthetized region of the brachial plexus following supraclavicular block, using cold alcohol wipe and recording responses on a binary scale of sensation (can or cannot feel cold stimulus), with sensory values obtained at time zero (initiation of the block), and to compared to subsequent measurements in 5 minute intervals until the final measurement at 30 minutes following the block.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>response to fine touch provocation</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post block</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators are assessing changes response to fine touch provocation in the dermatomal distribution of the upper limb corresponding to the anesthetized region of the brachial plexus following supraclavicular block, using a sterile non penetrating (blunt tip) needle and recording responses on a binary scale of sensation (can or cannot feel fine touch stimulus), with sensory values obtained at time zero (initiation of the block), and to compared to subsequent measurements in 5 minute intervals until the final measurement at 30 minute following the block.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Standard Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the Standard Group, in the absence of paresthesia and after negative aspiration, the 40 ml of local anesthetic block [0.35% marcaine] will be administered into the brachial plexus of the upper limb being operated on, at the supraclavicular level.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Test Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this group, the ultrasound guided local anesthetic block into the brachial plexus at the supraclavicular level of the upper limb being operated on will be supplemented by use of a blockade monitor (Nerve stimulator device) to direct final placement of the needle for the nerve block.
Only this group of the patients will receive this intervention with sufficient detail so that it can be distinguished from the Test Group</description>

    <intervention_name>Braun DIG-R-C Stimuplex Blockade Monitor System</intervention_name>
    <description>The blockade system will be initially set at 1 milliamp. As the proximity of the tip of the needle to the components of the brachial plexus becomes evident by ultrasound approximation and the stimulation pattern of the hand and wrist, the output of the system will be reduced to .3-.5 milliamps. With use of the Braun DIG-R-C Stimuplex Blockade Monitor System.</description>
