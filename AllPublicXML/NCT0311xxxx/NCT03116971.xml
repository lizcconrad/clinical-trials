             malignant pleural or pericardial effusion or hematogenous metastases [Tany, Nany,
             M1a/b; T3-T4, Nany, M0, due to multiple lung nodules or extent of disease that

             criteria could apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are not eligible for the study if they fulfill any of the following exclusion
        criteria:

             agents.

          -  Concurrent use of other anticancer therapy including any investigational agent within
