  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if anodal tDCS stimulation over M1 may decrease
      chronic knee OA pain in elderly subjects with defective CPM. In addition, this trial will
      help to investigate the role of central sensitization in knee OA and evaluate how tDCS
      stimulation may affect it.
