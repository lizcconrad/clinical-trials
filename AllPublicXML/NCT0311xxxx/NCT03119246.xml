  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease for which there are no
      existing disease-modifying treatments.

      Repair-HD is an EU FP7 consortium that aims to establish all the preclinical requirements for
      transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons in HD in order to replace those lost to the
      disease process. These requirements include the generation of new clinical assessments for
      detailed monitoring of patients with HD who have undergone cell replacement therapy.

      This protocol describes the beta testing of a new clinical assessment battery: Core
      Assessment Protocol for Intrastriatal Transplantation in HD version 2 (CAPIT-HD beta /
      CAPIT-HD2). CAPIT-HD beta represents a substantial revision of a previous CAPIT-HD battery
      published over 20 years ago, which is in need of updating in order to accommodate knowledge
      from clinical transplant studies over this time and to take advantage of technological
      advances in patient assessment.

      HD is a complex disorder in which there is relentless deterioration of motor, cognitive and
      behavioural functions, usually from mid-life onwards. The original CAPIT battery aimed to
      capture elements of change in all three domains, but was based predominantly on subjective
      semi-quantitative assessment tools that have poor inter-rater reliability. Moreover, a number
      of deficits, such as impairments in social cognition, were not recognised when the original
      CAPIT-HD battery was constructed, so we have developed novel assessments of these deficits,
      some of which are included in CAPIT-HD beta. The beta testing will take place in established
      HD clinical centres in Cardiff, Manchester, Paris, and Munster by teams of researchers who
      are experienced in leading clinic research in HD. Patients with early to moderate HD will be
      assessed at baseline, and at one and twelve months later, to assess the reliability and
      sensitivity of the CAPIT-HD beta battery. Arrangements for data storage and analysis are in
      place.
