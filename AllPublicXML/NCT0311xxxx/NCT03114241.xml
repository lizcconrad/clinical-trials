      Long-term evaluation of a coaching program which helps patients with severe COPD to increase
      their daily step count, in addition to usual care.

      Daily physical activity (PA) is a predictor of survival in the general population and has
      become a significant outcome measure in patients with COPD. Recent studies have demonstrated
      an independent association between PA, hospitalizations and mortality. Increased PA has
      significant benefits for patients with COPD. In most studies PA has only been assessed at one
      time point. Little is known about longitudinal changes in PA and data on determinants of
      changes in PA are scant. Moreover, information on best approaches to enhance PA in a
      population with decreasing PA is missing. To evaluate the long-term effect of a coaching
      program which is aimed at helping patients with severe COPD (FEV1&lt;50%) to enhance their level
      of daily physical activity, in addition to usual care. Furthermore, this study aims to
      evaluate mechanisms that are responsible for changes of physical activity over time such as
      sociodemographic factors, lung function, comorbidities, vascular function, exacerbations, and
      medication.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Daytime blood gas analysis will be performed without supplemental oxygen and immediately analysed with a commercially available blood gas analyser (ABL90 Radiometer Copenhagen. Arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) will be assessed. Further, oxygen saturation (SaO2) will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS):</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is especially designed for patients with physical impairment and assesses their symptoms of anxiety and depression. There are 7 items for each domain (anxiety and depression). Agreement on statements is expressed on a scale from 0 to 3 and domain scores are calculated by summing up the scores for the 7 items resulting in scores from 0 (no anxiety/depression) to 21 (depression/anxiety very likely).</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire: COPD Assessment Test (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test is designed to measure the impact of COPD on the patients' life and how this changes over time. The test includes 8 questions each with a scale from 0 to 5. The eight questions not only address respiratory or chest-related symptoms such as cough or sensation of mucus accumulation or chest tightness, but also more general complaints such as disturbances in sleep or decreased energy levels and daily limitations resulting from the disease. The total score will be assessed.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores that are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The categories are vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health</description>

    <description>Patients allocated to the intervention group receive a pedometer. They are encouraged to be more active by using the pedometer to measure the number of steps walked daily. An increase in step count of 15% compared to baseline will be set as the minimal goal for each patient. Monthly telephone calls are indicated to encourage compliance with the protocol and motivate patients to enhance their level of activity. The coached program ends after three months but patients keep their pedometer and are encouraged to sustain an increased level of daily physical activity for additional 9 months (end of study).</description>
