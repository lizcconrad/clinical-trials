  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric obesity, a defining health problem of the century, leads to long-term health
      disparities. This application evaluates strategies to prevent health disparities early in
      life by developing environmental wellness-related interventions focused on child-care center
      staff and families.

      Child-care centers provide an excellent opportunity to build healthy dietary and physical
      activity lifestyle habits and avoid the rapid weight gain that leads to health disparities.
      Building on a statewide survey among child-care centers and a pilot evaluation of an
      environmental intervention, this 3-cell randomized trial evaluates the impact of a
      staff-focused environmental wellness intervention and a staff and family-focused
      intervention, against a control condition.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention trial will be conducted in 48 child-care centers throughout Maryland,
      enrolling 1080 children age 30-54 months from low-income families, 1080 parents, and 450
      staff members. The aims are: 1) to examine the impact of the wellness intervention
      individually and combined with the family intervention versus control on child-care center
      staff wellness-related attitudes and behaviors; parent wellness-related attitudes and
      behaviors; and child dietary intake, food preferences, physical activity, and growth; 2) to
      examine the sustainability of the interventions; and 3) to examine whether changes in
      outcomes measures for children's food preferences, growth, and feeding behavior are mediated
      by changes in the child-care staff wellness-related attitudes and behaviors and/or parent
      wellness-related attitudes and behaviors. Findings from the trial will inform programs and
      policies in child-care centers to prevent obesity and reduce disparities, and will be
      disseminated locally, regionally, and nationally through conferences, information briefs,
      social media, and peer-reviewed journal articles. The overall objective is to promote
      statewide environmental strategies that reduce pediatric obesity and the long-term health
      disparities.
