  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As they age, the intestinal elimination function can be altered by external factors. Sleeping
      is also a vital need for maintaining health. Sleep time varies with age (from 18h / day for
      an infant to 7h30 on average for an adult) and sleep disorders increase with age (INSERM
      source). In our study, the night is from 9 pm to 7 am, corresponding to the working hours of
      the night shift. Between 42% and 50% of episodes of wakefulness of more than 4 minutes in
      EHPAD are due to noise, light or the practice of care related to incontinence. 87% of all
      incontinence care practices have been associated with wake-up episodes. A personalized day
      care program would allow residents to improve the quality of their sleep by minimizing stools
      at night and therefore interventions by caregivers.

      The ritual of stools, can be defined as the set of rules to observe to defecate in good
      physiological, physical conditions:

        -  Be in a suitable place for intestinal elimination: personal bathroom preferably on the
           toilet or on a pierced chair that will perhaps be more secure and comfortable with the
           armrests. The position to be taken is important.

        -  Propose a small bench to put under the feet to raise the knees higher than the hips and
           increase the abdominal pressure.

        -  Preserve the visual and auditory intimacy of the resident at the time of defecation.
           Failure to do so may result in the person repressing his desire to defecate.

        -  Allow the resident the time needed on the toilets the doorbell at hand and with the
           assurance that the caregiver will come back in a short time. Do not press it and do not
           forget it, privilege the autonomy and check that there is toilet paper.

      The establishment of the stool ritual is not intended to reduce the amount of stool by day,
      but it aims to postpone the nighttime exemption on the day, and does not prevent the stool
      emission to other times of the day or night.
