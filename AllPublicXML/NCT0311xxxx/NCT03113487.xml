      This phase II trial studies how well modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53
      (p53MVA) and pembrolizumab work in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer that has come back. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help
      the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such
      as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      p53MVA and pembrolizumab together may work better in treating patients with ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) after treatment
      with p53MVA and pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess median progression free survival (PFS), clinical benefit (CR+PR+ stable disease
      [SD] &gt; 6 months), overall survival, safety and tolerability and biological correlates which
      remain exploratory in nature.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing
      p53.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks and modified
      vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53 subcutaneously (SC) every 3 weeks for up to 3
      vaccines. Courses with pembrolizumab repeat every 3 weeks for up to 49 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Peripheral blood samples will be collected pre- and post-immunization for assessment of anti-p53 T cell responses and immunophenotyping. Immunosuppressive cell types (myeloid-derived suppressor cell, regulatory T cells) and other selected lymphocyte subsets and markers including PD-1, PDL-1 and PDL-2 will be quantified. Will evaluate if CD8+ T cell signal exceeds that detected in the single agent p53MVA trial. Estimates will be obtained using Wilcoxon rank-sum test based on residual re-sampling simulations based on historic area under the curve values.</description>

             months after completion of platinum based chemotherapy; patients must have measurable
             disease or detectable disease:

               -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately
                  measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded); each
                  lesion must be greater than or equal to 10 mm when measured by computed
                  tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or magnetic resonance
                  imaging (MRI); lymph nodes must be greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis
                  when measured by CT, PET/CT, or MRI

               -  Detectable disease in a patients is defined as one who does not have measurable
                  disease, but has at least one of the following condition:

                    -  Baseline values of CA-125 at least 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

                    -  Ascites and/ or pleural effusion attributed to tumor

                    -  Solid and/ or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet

          -  Patients whose ovarian cancer recurs/progresses within 0-6 months following
             platinum-based chemotherapy have platinum resistant disease; these patients are not
             considered to benefit from additional platinum-based therapy and are treated with
             other sequential single agents; such patients are eligible for this trial

          -  Patients with documented disease recurrence/progression within 6-12 months of
             completing platinum-based therapy, are considered to have 'borderline' platinum
             sensitivity; these patients will not be eligible for this trial

          -  Patients who relapse more than 12 months after completion of platinum-based treatment
             are considered 'platinum sensitive' and will not be eligible for this trial, since
             they have a favorable (33-59%) chance of responding to further rounds of platinum
             based chemotherapy

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt;
             2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60 %) and a life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of &gt;= 55%

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for six months
             following duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             that she is pregnant while participating on the trial, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately

          -  Patients with confirmed p53 mutation by molecular analysis and/or evidence of p53
             overexpression by immunohistochemistry (&gt;= 10% of cells within tumor staining
             positive) will be eligible; this will be assessed semi-quantitatively by a Clinical
             Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) approved pathology core pathologist, using CLIA
             approved mutational analysis or immuno-histochemistry techniques on formalin-fixed
             paraffin-embedded tissue; in the case of equivocal immunohistochemistry (IHC) results,
             p53 involvement may be confirmed by detection of p53 molecular analysis on tumor
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); patients on whom molecular analysis of p53 mutations is
             already available, will not require IHC analysis; molecular analysis may be performed
             as an additional research procedure at the end of the study (distinct from eligibility
             determination) if the principal investigator (PI) deems it of scientific value and
             research funding is available to cover the cost; patients must have PD-L1 positive
             ovarian cancer in order to be eligible for this clinical trial (defined as &gt;= 1% PD-L1
             expression within the tumor section, assessed by immunohistochemical staining)

          -  Subjects (or the legally-authorized representatives of cognitively impaired patients)

             consent

          -  Up to 4 prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent disease are allowed; adjuvant
             chemotherapy and maintenance Taxol after completion of six cycles of adjuvant
             carboplatin - Taxol will not be counted as a &quot;prior chemotherapy regimen&quot; for the
             purpose of this study; treatment with targeted agents or hormones would not be
             considered as a systemic chemotherapy regimen
