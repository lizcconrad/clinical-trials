  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find the maximum tolerable dose of radiation that can be
      delivered with concurrent chemotherapy (carboplatin &amp; paclitaxel) in patients with esophageal
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care for esophageal cancer based on the
      results of phase III randomised trials. The current standard radiation therapy dose has
      remained 50 Gy at -2 Gy/fraction for decades.However, locoregional control remain
      problematic, with 25% of patients having persistence and 20% relapse of locoregional disease
      following the combined modality approach. New regimen is urgently needed for improving
      localregional control and survival.Investigators hypothesize that hyperfractionated radiation
      dose escalation to residual tumor volumes after standard chemoradiotherapy as defined by
      positron emission tomography (PET) /computed tomography (CT) would improve local control and
      overall survival while reducing the acute and late normal tissue toxicity.
