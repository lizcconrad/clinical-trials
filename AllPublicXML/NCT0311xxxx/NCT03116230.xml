    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is complete a longitudinal cross-over clinical study to
      investigate the effect of treatments for knee pathology, including cutaneous stimulation
      (skin vibration and soft knee brace), on locomotion tasks (i.e. walking, jogging, stair
      ascending and descending), muscle function, and pain/function.
