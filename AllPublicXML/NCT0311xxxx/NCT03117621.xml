      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety of Blincyto in routine
      clinical practice. Blincyto effectiveness, medication errors, and utilisation; and select
      healthcare resource use while using Blincyto will also be described. Safety and effectiveness
      of Blincyto in specified subgroups of patients will also be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Medical records of patients initiating Blincyto after country-specific reimbursement in
        routine clinical practice will be eligible for extraction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical records of patients who have participated in Blincyto clinical trials will be
             excluded since their treatment will be prescribed by the study protocol unless the
             patient is receiving new Blincyto treatment outside the clinical trial.

          -  Medical records of patients participating in other Amgen non-interventional
             prospective studies in which safety endpoints are collected will be excluded

          -  Medical records of patients who have received Blincyto via an expanded
             access/compassionate use program will be excluded.

          -  In countries where patient informed consent is required for access to their medical
             records, any patient who does not provide informed consent will be excluded.
