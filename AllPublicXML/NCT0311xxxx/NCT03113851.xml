  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether radiation combined with recombined human
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF) is safe and effective for patients
      with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was still poor for those
      unsuitable for target therapy or immunotherapy. This study is to include patients evaluated
      as effective or stable disease after first-line chemotherapy or progressed after second-line
      chemotherapy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of receiving radiotherapy combined with
      recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF).
