      Interventional HIV prevention strategy based on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada®
      for people in the Île-de-France area (or Paris region) who don't have HIV but who are at high
      risk of becoming infected with HIV (men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender men and
      women, heterosexual men and women, sex workers, migrants) in combination with overall
      prevention services (communautary-based or educational counselling; addiction, social and
      psychological care; condoms and lubricating gel; clean injection equipment; sexually
      transmitted diseases (STD) screening and treatment; hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B
      virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccinations and post-exposure treatment of HIV
      infection as soon as possible after diagnosis using an antiretroviral combination recommended
      by the French Guidelines on HIV treatment).

      The individual benefit being already demonstrated in clinical trials, the aim is to
      demonstrate the public health impact of the interventional HIV prevention strategy by
      reducing the risk of getting HIV-1 infection of at least 15% of new diagnosis of HIV
      infections among MSM/transgender in the Ile-de-France area after a 3-year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assuming the PrEP efficacy of 80% and that 85% of included participants being MSM - the
      objective is to evidence a decrease of at least 15% of new diagnosis of HIV infections among
      MSM in Ile-de-France area. This objective is in the framework of a commitment of large cities
      against AIDS with the political support of the City of Paris for the &quot;Paris sans SIDA&quot;
      program and the commitment of the Île-de-France area.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Prevalence of HIV infection at the screening visit (undiagnosed epidemic)

        -  Incidence of HIV infection according to back-calculation approach, and by key subgroups

      Operational Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the origin of the recruitment according to the risk groups and the outreach
           actions

        -  Assess linkage to care for PrEP, retention in the study, reasons for consent withdrawal
           and satisfaction of the participants according to the screening site, the type of PrEP
           supply, the costs of global care, the key subgroups, the type of counselling, the time
           from STD testing to initiation of PrEP treatment in study sites

        -  Impact of a less intense counselling than the one provided in the ANRS IPERGAY trial, on
           adherence and efficacy of PrEP by comparing the incidence observed in MSM enrolled in
           the current study to that evidenced in the ANRS IPERGAY trial, with a method similar to
           that used in the Partner demonstration project in Kenya and Uganda.

        -  Impact of the communautary-based and educational counselling

      Clinical Objectives:

        -  Estimation, in individuals seeking for PrEP and thus getting tested for HIV infection,
           the prevalence of HIV infection in different key subgroups, which is a surrogate marker
           of the undiagnosed (or &quot;hidden&quot;) epidemic

        -  Evaluate who will become HIV-infected during the course of the study while on PrEP, the
           proportion of patients on combined antiretroviral treatment and the proposition of
           patients with a suppressed HIV viral load 12 months after HIV infection

        -  Evaluate the participants' need for post-exposure prophylaxis during the course of the
           study

        -  Adherence to PrEP (questionnaire and dried blood spots)

        -  Assessment of the PrEP dosing schedule used by MSM participants (daily or intermittent)
           throughout the course of the study

        -  Assessment of PrEP tolerability and safety

        -  Comprehensive study of incident HIV infections in those on PrEP (incidence, emergence of
           drug-associated resistance mutations, adherence to PrEP at the closest visit before HIV
           seroconversion and at previous visits)

      Participants Behavior:

        -  Acceptability of PrEP (including those who will decline participation in the study) and
           during the course of the study, and retention in the study.

        -  Impact of PrEP, within a comprehensive prevention offer, on sexual behavior of the
           participants throughout follow-up

        -  Factors associated with the integration of PrEP in the daily routine of participants:

             -  Qualitative study to explore the motivations, difficulties, behavior and
                expectations of the participants, their knowledge and communication on their use of
                PrEP

             -  Reasons related to the choice of the prevention strategy used in terms of dosing
                schedule (continuous or on demand in MSM) and type of counselling and participation
                to focus groups.

      Care Providers Behavior: Evaluation of knowledge, beliefs, perception and practice of the
      physicians, nurse and peer counselors involved in delivery of PrEP in the study

      Social epidemiology: Evaluation of social and/or territorial inequalities and disparities

      Cost-effectiveness of the comprehensive prevention strategy
