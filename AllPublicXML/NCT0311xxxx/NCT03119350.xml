  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering that the failure of the treatment of obesity is justified by the multifactorial
      pathophysiology of this morbidity, the present project has the following hypotheses:

        1. The occurrence of obesity is due to the derange,ent of mitochondrial energy metabolism ;

        2. The unbalance is therapeutically modified through physical training ;

        3. Obesity courses with the break-down in energy metabolism mitochondrial disease
           associated with systemic inflammatory characteristics that can be corrected through a
           combined long-term physical training program.

      This study have as objective : to analyse changes in mitochondrial function, inflammatory
      profile, oxidative stress and energy metabolism caused by concurrent physical training in
      obese women.

      Specific objectives:

      Body composition by deuterium oxide; Metabolic rate of resting and oxidation of substrates by
      indirect calorimetry; Proinflammatory cytokines Anti-inflammatory cytokines Oxidative Stress:
      Malondialdehyde, Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione-Peroxidase; Fatty acids: ceramide and
      palmitate; Mitochondrial respiration and citrate synthase enzyme; Quantify and qualify:
      mitochondrial number, endoplasmic reticulum structure, adipose cell size; Gene expression,
      quantify by microscopy and analyze the protein by western blot.

      The study began with 20 women, however, there was withdrawal of 6, ending with 14 women.
