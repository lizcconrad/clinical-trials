  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to compare the efficacy of PVI versus PVI plus catheter ablation, which
      includes ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) and linear lesions in
      the same procedure. If it is found that the PVI alone is as effective as PVI plus catheter
      ablation of CFAE and linear lesions, it may reduce the need for catheter ablation.
