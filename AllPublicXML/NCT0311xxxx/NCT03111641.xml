  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate pre-operative lung assessment is important to decide the most appropriate anesthesia
      plan. Until now, chest X-ray is considered the standard of care for lung assessment during
      perioperative evaluation. However, lung ultrasound is a rapid, simple, non-invasive,
      radiation-free imaging modality and can be used as an alternative to chest radiography for
      the diagnosis and follow-up of various lung diseases. Moreover, the decreased radiation
      exposure represents a considerable improvement in patient safety. Consequently, we decided to
      compare the data obtained from the lung ultrasound and the chest X-ray.
