  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to test the hypothesis that aggressive warming reduces the incidence of major
      cardiovascular complications, compared to routine care. Half of the participants will be
      randomly assigned to routine care (core temperature ≈35.5°C), while the other half will
      receive aggressive warming (&gt;37°C core temperature) in a multi-center trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia increases sympathetic activation, promotes tachycardia, and causes hypertension —
      all of which may increase the risk of myocardial injury. Moderate perioperative hypothermia
      is now uncommon, but mild hyperthermia (≈35.5°C) remains common. Whether aggressive warming
      to a truly normothermic level (≈37°C) improves outcomes remains unknown.

    <masking_description>To maintain blinding, the anesthesia record will be sealed in an opaque envelope before patients leave the post-anesthesia care unit. The envelope will be marked &quot;Do not open until [date 35 days after surgery].&quot; Some hospitals will have electronic records; in those cases, we will ask investigators evaluating postoperative outcomes not to access the anesthesia record.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients assigned to routine thermal management will not be pre-warmed and ambient intraoperative temperature will be maintained near 20°C per routine. Only transfused blood will be warmed. An upper- or lower-body forced-air cover will be positioned over an appropriate non-operative site, but will not initially be activated. Should core temperature decrease to 35.5°C, the warmer will be activated as necessary to prevent core temperature from decreasing further.</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to aggressive warming will be pre-warmed with a full-body Bair Hugger or Bair Paws cover for ≈30 minutes before induction of anesthesia. The warmer will initially be set to &quot;high&quot; which corresponds to ≈43°C. It will be subsequently adjusted to make patients feel warm, but not uncomfortably so. Patients will be aggressively warmed during surgery to a target intraoperative core temperature between 37 and 37.5°C, using two forced-air covers when clinically practical. All intravenous fluids will be warmed to body temperature.</description>
