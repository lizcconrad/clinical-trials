  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor sleep quality may lead to increase in oxidative stress and free radicals which in turn
      may decrease the reproductive function. Many researchers have already proven improvement on
      reproductive function after antioxidant (melatonin) administration. The investigators wish to
      study the relationship between unexplained, young poor ovarian responder and oxidative
      stress.

    <description>Total 50 patients are to be randomized into this group, 25 of which are poor responder and the others are normal responders. After randomization, participants for melatonin administration are to go under melatonin admisitration intervention from the time of COH to the date of oocyte retrieval. . If pregnancy is not confirmed in the first cycle, all subjects are to enter the second cycle after 1-2 months of recovery period.
For the second cycle, the procedure will be repeated same as the first cycle with doubling of the drug dosage . It should also be administered for 2 weeks until the date of oocyte retrieval.</description>

Participants for placebo comparator are advised to take the drug (placebo) from the time of COH to the date of oocyte retrieval.
