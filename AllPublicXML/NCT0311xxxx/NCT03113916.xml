  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pragmatic randomized clinical trial will assess the efficacy, cost, and sustainability
      of a culturally tailored weight-loss program targeting obese Hispanic women with pre-diabetes
      or T2D. The intervention will be integrated into patient care at a Federally Qualified Health
      Center serving over 30,000 low-income patients, and will be delivered by trained clinic
      staff, with minimal support from research staff. After the effectiveness clinical trial, two
      cohorts of clinic patients will receive the intervention in a sustainability test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic women have the highest estimated lifetime risk of developing diabetes of all
      ethnic/gender groups in the US, and their prevalence rates of overweight and obesity are
      among the highest in the US. Currently, nearly 90% of Hispanic women aged 40-59 are
      overweight or obese. If diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) at age 40, Hispanic women are
      projected to lose 12.4 life-years, and 21.5 quality-adjusted life-years.

      Several clinical trials have produced compelling evidence demonstrating the benefits of
      weight-loss interventions for both diabetic and pre-diabetic individuals, but most of the
      successful interventions tested in large clinical trials have been too costly for
      implementation in community settings, and they have not been assessed under real life
      conditions, targeting vulnerable populations.

      This study builds on the investigators' success with a culturally-tailored weight-loss
      intervention designed for Hispanic women. Elements of cultural adaptation will include:
      women-only groups, skill-building tasks around food measurement, focus on traditional dietary
      habits and cultural norms regulating food preparation and consumption, interactive learning
      formats with a minimum of written materials, culturally congruent physical activity, and
      addressing acculturative concerns.

      Follow-up data, including change in weight, waist circumference, and diabetes outcomes, will
      be collected at 6-, 12-, and 18-months post randomization. Additional analyses will include
      the cost of delivering the intervention and assessing the intervention's sustainability. The
      results of this study will inform the development of interventions to prevent diabetes onset
      or manage T2D in this population.
