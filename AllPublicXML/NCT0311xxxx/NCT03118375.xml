    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of new super-power bone-anchored hearing
      aid (BAHA) processors in BAHA users. BAHAs are able to help people with mixed/conductive and
      single-sided hearing loss when they are unable to use or receive limited benefit from
      traditional hearing. Until recently, BAHAs were only recommended to people with up to a
      moderate hearing loss. New super-power BAHA processors may be able to help people who
      previously were not candidates for BAHAs or received limited benefit from them. The
      information collected in this study may lead to improved evaluation of and expanded treatment
      options for people considering BAHA. Different types of hearing tests will be used to compare
      the devices.

      The objective of this study is to assess the benefit of new super-power bone-anchored hearing
      aid (BAHA) processors in BAHA users. BAHAs are able to help people with mixed/conductive and
      single-sided hearing loss when they were not receiving benefit from traditional hearing aids
      or could not use them due to differences in their ears related to surgery or congenital
      anomalies. Stronger super-power processors may be able to help individuals who previously did
      not meet candidacy for BAHA. This study will evaluate how much benefit they are getting from
      their current devices compared to new super-power devices.

      The information collected in this study may lead to improved evaluation of patients
      considering BAHA implantation and expanded treatment options for new and existing BAHA users.
      Primary outcome measures will include hearing threshold and speech perception measures. All
      devices are commercially available and FDA approved.
