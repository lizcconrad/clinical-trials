  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to complete the development of a video-enhanced, school-based
      drug prevention program for rural Hawaiian youth (Ho'ouna Pono) using community-based
      participatory research principles and practices, and to test the efficacy and adoption of the
      full intervention across all middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island. These purposes
      will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Year 1) is to complete the Ho'ouna
      Pono drug prevention curriculum initially developed and validated in a NIDA-funded
      pilot/feasibility study (R34 DA031306). To date, five professionally filmed video vignettes
      depicting drug-related problem situations specific to rural Hawaiian youth and seven
      interactive classroom lessons have been created, implemented in randomly selected
      intervention schools, and preliminarily evaluated using a pre-test, post-test control group
      design. Aim 1 enhances and builds upon this work by producing two new video vignettes,
      re-editing a &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; video, developing new classroom curricular components, and
      synthesizing the new content with the existing curriculum. AIM 2 (Years 2-3) is to evaluate
      the fully conceived curriculum across all middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island (N =
      15) using a dynamic wait-listed control group design (Brown, Wyman, Guo, &amp; Peña, 2006). Using
      this design, schools will be randomly assigned to four cohorts, and cohorts will be randomly
      assigned to receive the curriculum at designated times staggered across the two-year
      evaluation period. All participating youth will be measured at six designated time points
      across the two-year evaluation period. Because of the staggered implementation of the
      curriculum, intervention effects will differ by cohort, and earlier time points will include
      control schools for the initial cohorts receiving the intervention. All participating youth
      will receive pre-tests prior to curriculum implementation and post-tests upon curriculum
      completion, with youth attending schools in Cohorts 1-3 receiving follow-up evaluations. AIM
      3 (Year 4) is to assess community, systemic, and curricular factors related to the
      implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the curriculum within public
      middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island.

      The present study is the result of seven consecutive years of NIDA-funded pre-prevention and
      translational pilot/feasibility drug prevention research focused on rural Hawaiian youth and
      communities. The overall outcome of this study will be an empirically supported, culturally
      grounded drug prevention curriculum relevant to Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander youth.
      This study addresses the lack of prevention interventions for Native Hawaiians and other
      Pacific Islanders (NHOPIs) and indigenous youth populations, and directly contributes to the
      development of an indigenous prevention science (Okamoto, Helm, et al., 2014). It has
      implications for informing indigenous, Pacific Islander, and rural health disparities and
      health equity promotion.
