    <description>Subjects randomized to receive Bioseal, a thin layer will be applied to the entire length of the suture line and the adjacent area to approximately 5mm away, including all suture holes. Up to two layers of Bioseal may be used for each application. While Bioseal achieves complete coagulation, CSF leakage will be re-evaluated with the Valsalva maneuver to 10-20 cm H2O for 5 to 10 seconds. Up to two applications (one application includes applying up to two layers of Bioseal product followed by the CSF leakage re-evaluation with Valsalva maneuver) per subject are allowed. Closure of the remaining layers of the surgical site will be performed according to the surgeon's standard of practice.</description>

    <description>Upon completion of the sutured dural repair, the closure will be evaluated for intra-operative CSF leakage with a baseline Valsalva maneuver to 10-20 cm H2O for 5-10 seconds. Subjects who have a CSF leak will be enrolled into the study. If randomized to receive Bioseal, a thin layer will be applied to the entire length of the suture line and the adjacent area to approximately 5mm away, including all suture holes. Up to two layers of Bioseal may be used for each application. While Bioseal achieves complete coagulation, CSF leakage will be re-evaluated with the Valsalva maneuver to 10-20 cm H2O for 5 to 10 seconds.</description>

               2. Age ≥ 18 years.

               3. Patients who are able and willing to comply with the procedures required by the

                  fossa or in the supratentorial region and who are demonstrated to have persistent
                  CSF leakage following suture closure of the dural incision. CSF leakage will be
                  evaluated during a period of Valsalva of 10-20 cm of H20 for 5-10 seconds. If a
                  spontaneous leak is apparent immediately after dural closure, no Valsalva will be
                  performed.
