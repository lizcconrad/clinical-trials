      The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of an innovative web-based school nutrition
      intervention (Team Nutriathlon) aimed at promoting the consumption of vegetables and fruit
      and dairy products in high school students and to identify facilitators and/or barriers
      influencing its success.

      Classes of first and second year secondary students (grades 9 and 10) from the Québec City
      region will be randomized into two groups. Participants in the intervention (Team
      Nutriathlon) will be asked to increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables and dairy
      products using an innovative web-based platform, developed for this study, over six weeks.
      The control group will follow the regular school curriculum. The number of servings of fruits
      and vegetables and dairy products consumed by students per day and facilitators and barriers
      influencing the success of the program will be compared between the two groups over the
      study.
