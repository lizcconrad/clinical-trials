  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a common disorder among non-professional caregivers, and it can be
      disabling and costly. Although there are effective psychological interventions to prevent
      depression, most of them involve in-person treatment. New technologies have the potential to
      overcome the barriers this format presents, which limit accessibility to such interventions.
      The main objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral
      intervention in the prevention of depression, administered through a smartphone application
      (App), both with and without telephone contact through multiconferencing. Secondary
      objectives are: (a) test the moderating or mediating effect of the variables in the
      theoretical model underlying the intervention; (b) analyze the variables that are predictors
      of intervention outcomes; (c) analyze the acceptability and satisfaction with interventions.
      A randomized controlled trial will be perform. Caregivers with clinically significant
      depressive symptoms who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive episode will be
      included. Recruitment of 174 participants is planned, with random allocation to one of the
      three conditions (58 participants per intervention): (a) a cognitive-behavioral intervention
      administered via a smartphone App (CCIA); (b) a cognitive-behavioral intervention
      administered via a smartphone App + telephone contact via conference call (CCIA+CC); (c)
      attention control group (ACG). Both interventions will be administered in 5 modules via an
      App for Smartphones and one group additionally will receive telephone contact via conference
      call in group format during 4 sessions of 30 minutes. These phone sessions will be recorded
      to assess the therapists adherence to the intervention protocols. All participants will be
      evaluated at pre and posttreatment, and 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up by trained
      interviewers who will be blind to the aims of the study, the interventions employed, and the
      group to which any given participant belongs. Incidence of depression will be examined as the
      primary measure, with secondary measures being depressive symptoms, symptoms related to the
      model (pleasant activities, negative thoughts and social contacts) and the acceptability of
      and satisfaction with the intervention.

    <description>The presence of a major depressive episode will be assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5, DSM-5® —Clinician Version (SCID-5-CV; First, Williams, Karg, &amp; Spitzer, 2015). This is a semi-structured interview that provides DSM-5 diagnosis and must be administered by a specialized professional. It includes diagnostic assessment of depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorders, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, adaptative disorders, and it allows screening for 17 additional disorders. For this study the module corresponding to major depressive episode was use. The interrater reliability (Kappa) ranges from .70 y 1.00.</description>

    <description>Depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] (Radloff,1977; Spanish version of Vazquez, Blanco, &amp; Lopez, 2007). This 20-item scale is self-administered and assesses depressive symptoms. The person evaluates each item based on how often they have experienced it in the last week using a Likert scale with four response options ranging from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most of the time).The total score ranges from 0 to 60, and higher scores correspond to greater depressive symptomatology. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the scale ranges from .85 and .90, with .89 for the Spanish version (Vazquez et al.,2007 and 2014).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Socio-demographic characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sociodemographic characteristics were collected via the Care Characteristics and Status of Caregiver questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed in a previous study (Vázquez et al., 2014, 2016), and assesses the sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, marital status, social class, family monthly income per household, level of education, main occupation and area of residence), and the care situation (number of persons cared for, relationship with the persona cared for, age and sex of the person cared for, disease of the person cared for, time of care, and hours a day of care) of non professional caregivers.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Automatic negative thoughts to post-treatment (6 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of automatic negative thoughts will be assessed through the 30-item Automatic Negative Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ-N, Hollon and Kendall, 1980). The subject must indicate the frequency for which a number of thoughts have suddenly arisen in their mind over the last week on a five-point scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Scores range between 30 and 150, and there is a direct relationship between the score and the frequencies of certain types of thoughts, with a higher score indicating more negative thoughts experienced by the subject. The internal consistency for the ATQ-N subscale is .96.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Pleasant activities to post-treatment (6 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The pleasant activities will be assessed via the List of Pleasant Activities for Caregivers (LAA). It includes 40 activities to evaluate the pleasant activities that the caregivers have performed during the last week. It consists of a pleasant activities list, where the participants indicate whether or not a certain activity is pleasant to them, if they performed it during the last week, and the number of times it was carried out (developed and used in a previous study; Vázquez et al., 2016). In the previous study it showed an internal consistency of .89.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Social contacts to post-treatment (6 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the participants' weekly social contacts we will use the Register of Social Networking (developed and used in the previous study by Vazquez et al., 2016) that asks the participants to report the number of people they had daily contact with.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of dropouts</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention sessions (5 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>We will construct a registry of the number of dropouts from each group to assess their response to the interventions over the duration of the study.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention sessions (5 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment adherence will be assessed by recording the number of meetings each caregiver attends and whether they complete homework assignments.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the service received</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant satisfaction with the service received will be evaluated upon intervention completion. We will use the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire ([CSQ-8]; Larsen, Attkisson, Hargreaves, &amp; Nguyen, 1979; Spanish version Vazquez, Torres, &amp; Otero, 2009). It is an 8-item scale with 4 possible answers and a final ranking score ranging from 8 to 32, where a higher score implies greater satisfaction with the service received. It is a widely used tool with an internal consistency between .83 and .93 (Attkisson &amp; Greenfield, 2004).</description>
