  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate antibiotic treatment to target bacteria about the
      shoulder. This bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes, is detected in many revision shoulder
      surgeries and is thought to contribute to periprosthetic joint infections, pain, and failure
      of total shoulder arthroplasty as well as other shoulder surgeries. This study is
      investigating adding an FDA approved antibiotic that is commonly used for treatment of this
      bacteria and many common infections. The investigators will take intraoperative cultures to
      look for the presence or absence of specific bacteria. The investigators are conducting this
      trial to see if adding another antibiotic to specifically target this common bacteria found
      around the shoulder will be effective.

      Patients undergoing total and reverse shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral
      arthritis will be invited to participate in this study if patients meet inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized to receive either standard perioperative
      antibiotics with cefazolin or to the treatment group to receive doxycycline in addition to
      cefazolin. Patients will then undergo routine surgical treatment. 3 cultures from the
      superficial tissue, dermis, and glenohumeral joint will be taken and cultured for 14 days to
      detect any bacterial growth.
