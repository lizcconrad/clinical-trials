  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigate associations between mild hypothermia (patients' core temperature â‰¤
      36.0 degrees Celsius) and intra-operative blood loss and surgical site infections (SSI) in
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates associations between patients' core temperature during surgery and
      intra-operative blood loss, and to SSI. Additionally, the investigators observe the use of
      hypothermia prevention measures in operating theaters, use of surgical safety checklists. SSI
      is registered at discharge from hospital and up to 30 days post-discharge.

      The goal of the study is to contribute to focus on prevention of even mild hypothermia in
      surgery.

      This study is of interest for healthcare personnel as operating room nurses, surgeons, nurse
      anaesthetists, anaesthesiologists, ward nurses, post anaesthetic care unit nurses, and other
      healthcare staff involved in the in-hospital surgical pathway.
