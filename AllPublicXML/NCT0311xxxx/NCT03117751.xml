    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this study is to use novel precision medicine strategies based
      on inherited and leukemia-specific genomic features and targeted treatment approaches to
      improve the cure rate and quality of life of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
      and acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (LLy).

      Primary Therapeutic Objectives:

        -  To improve the event-free survival of provisional standard- or high-risk patients with
           genetically or immunologically targetable lesions or minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥ 5%
           at Day 15 or ≥1% at the end of Remission Induction, by the addition of molecular and
           immunotherapeutic approaches including tyrosine kinase inhibitors or blinatumomab for
           refractory B-ALL, and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for those lacking targetable
           lesions.

        -  To improve overall treatment outcome of T-ALL by optimizing pegaspargase and
           cyclophosphamide treatment and by the addition of new agents in patients with targetable
           genomic abnormalities (e.g., activated tyrosine kinases or JAK/STAT mutations) or by the
           addition of bortezomib for those who have a poor early response to treatment but no
           targetable lesions.

        -  To examine in a randomized study design whether the administration of one dose of
           rituximab to children with B-ALL during early Remission Induction therapy decreases
           allergic reactions to pegaspargase.

        -  To determine in a randomized study design whether the incidence and/or severity of acute
           vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy can be reduced by decreasing the dosage of
           vincristine in patients with the high-risk CEP72 TT genotype or by shortening the
           duration of vincristine therapy in patients with the CEP72 CC or CT genotype.

      Secondary Therapeutic Objectives:

        -  To estimate the event-free survival and overall survival of children with ALL and LLy.

        -  To examine whether the administration of one dose of rituximab can lower the minimal
           residual disease (MRD) levels.

        -  To determine the tolerability of combination therapy with ruxolitinib.

      Biological Objectives:

        -  To use data from clinical genomic sequencing and sequencing-based MRD in bone marrow,
           blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

        -  To assess clonal diversity and evolution of pre-leukemic and leukemic populations.

        -  To identify germline or somatic genomic variants associated with drug resistance of ALL
           cells.

        -  To compare drug sensitivity of ALL cells from diagnosis to relapse.

      Supportive Care Objectives

        -  To conduct serial neurocognitive monitoring of patients and to evaluate the benefits of
           a computer-based cognitive intervention.

        -  To evaluate the impact of low-magnitude high frequency mechanical stimulation on bone
           mineral density and markers of bone turnover.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To identify pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic predictors of treatment
           outcome.

        -  To perform a detailed assessment of thiopurine metabolism and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP)
           tolerance, toxicity, and treatment outcome.

        -  To establish xenografts of representative subtypes of ALL.

        -  To prospectively determine the risk and epidemiology of breakthrough infection or
           febrile neutropenia and adverse effects of antibiotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be classified into one of three categories (low-, standard-, or high-risk)
      based on the presenting age, leukocyte count/lymphoma staging, presence or absence of CNS-3
      status or testicular disease, immunophenotype, molecular genetics, DNA index, and early
      response to therapy.

      Treatment will consist of three main phases: Remission Induction, Consolidation, and
      Continuation. Early Intensification therapy will be given prior to Consolidation to patients
      with provisional standard-risk or high-risk ALL/LLy or any provisional low-risk patients with
      Day 15 MRD ≥1% as well as provisional low-risk LLy patients who do not obtain complete
      response at the end of Induction.

      Brief outline of treatment plan:

      Patients will be assigned to treatment based on risk group: Low-Risk, Standard-Risk and
      High-Risk and cell type (T or B cell).

      Remission Induction initially consists of prednisone (28 days), vincristine (4 weekly doses),
      daunorubicin (1 to 3 weekly doses), and pegaspargase (2 doses). The second part (given over 2
      weeks and overlapping with the last week of the first part of induction) consists of
      cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and mercaptopurine combinations. Patients with B-ALL will be
      randomized for administration of a dose of rituximab on Day 3 prior to the first dose of
      pegaspargase to prevent sensitization to asparaginase and subsequent asparaginase reaction
      and to improve anti-leukemia outcome. Dasatinib will be added for patients with Ph+ and
      Ph-like ABL1-class fusions and bortezomib will be given to patients with no targetable
      lesions and Day 15 minimal residual disease (MRD) &gt;5%.

      Early Intensification will be given prior to Consolidation to patients with provisional
      standard-risk or high-risk ALL/LLy or any provisional low-risk patients with Day 15 MRD ≥1%
      as well as provisional low-risk LLy patients who do not obtain complete response at the end
      of Induction. For patients with Ph-like ALL that is targetable with JAK inhibitor and Day 15
      MRD level ≥5% or end of Remission Induction ≥1% as well as all patients with early T cell
      precursor (ETP) ALL, ruxolitinib will be used. This includes, but is not limited to CRLF2,
      JAK2, and EPOR rearrangements and sequence/structural changes in JAK1/2/3, TYK2, IL7R, and
      SH2B3. Ruxolitinib will be added in LLy patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling whose
      responses do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction. Activation of
      JAK-STAT signaling is defined in ALL/LLy that contains genetic alterations associated with
      JAK-STAT pathway. Dasatinib will continue for patients with ABL1-class fusions. Bortezomib
      will be added for patients with no targetable lesions and Day 15 MRD &gt;5% or Day 42 MRD &gt;1%
      and LLy patients without targetable lesions whose responses do not qualify complete response
      at the end of Remission Induction.

      Consolidation Therapy will consist of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) (every other week for 4
      doses); daily mercaptopurine and IT chemotherapy on the same dates of HDMTX. Standard and
      high-risk patients will also receive pegaspargase. Dasatinib will continue for patients with
      ABL1-class fusions. Ruxolitinib will continue for patients with activation of JAK-STAT
      signaling and Day 15 MRD ≥5% or Day 42 MRD ≥1% (or for LLy patients who do not qualify
      complete response at the end of Remission Induction) and all cases with ETP ALL.

      Immunotherapy with blinatumomab will be given to High Risk B-ALL and B-LLy patients.

      Reintensification therapy will be offered to certain High Risk patients with persistent MRD
      after Immunotherapy (B-ALL and B-LLy) or Early Intensification (T-ALL and T-LLy), or those
      who cannot receive Immunotherapy.

      Continuation Treatment will consist of 120 weeks of risk-directed therapy. Dasatinib will
      continue in patients with ABL1-class fusion. Ruxolitinib will continue in patients with
      activation of JAK-STAT signaling and Day 15 MRD ≥5% or Day 42 MRD ≥1% (or for LLy patients
      who do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction) and all cases with
      ETP ALL. ALL Patients with the CEP72 rs904627T/T genotype (16% of patients) will be
      randomized (unblinded design except those who evaluate neuropathies) to receive either 1.5
      mg/m^2 or 1 mg/m^2 of vincristine after Continuation Week 1. Patients with either a CEP72
      rs904627 C/T or C/C genotype (84% of patients) will be randomized to receive vincristine and
      dexamethasone pulses through Week 49 of Continuation Treatment or through Week 101 of
      Continuation Treatment.

    <description>This study will use un-blinded stratified randomization, and analysis be reported by group. All B-ALL patients will be randomized before Day 3 of Remission Induction, at a 1:1 ratio into two groups, in one of which rituximab will be administered, and no rituximab in the other. The randomization will be stratified by diagnostic WBC levels (&lt;50 x 10^9/L vs. ≥50 x 10^9/L) and CD20 expression (positive vs. negative) because these are factors known to affect rituximab effect. In the final analysis the investigators will also compare the allergic reaction rate between the two groups by logistic regression, accounting for potential confounding factors, such as Day 15 MRD status (&gt;5% vs. not), risk and subtypes that affect treatment intensity</description>

    <description>This will be a single-blind, stratified block randomized experiment. Although the investigators who evaluate neuropathy and neuropathic pain and the patients are blinded for treatment assignment, treating clinicians and pharmacy staff are not. Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two treatment groups: 1.5 mg/m^2 vs. 1 mg/m^2 vincristine (VCR) dose. Randomization will be stratified by two factors known to significantly affect neuropathy during the Continuation phase, namely, Grade 2 or higher neuropathy prior to Continuation (none, 1 episode, 2 or more episodes) and race (black, others). The proportion of patients who develop two or more episodes of Grade 2 or higher neuropathy during Continuation Treatment will be compared between the two VCR dose groups, using a Z-test for two sample proportions.</description>

    <description>This will be a single blind stratified block randomized experiment. The investigators who evaluate neuropathy and neuropathic pain and the patients are blinded for treatment assignment. Treating clinicians and pharmacy staff will not be blinded. Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two treatment groups at Week 49 of Continuation therapy: to vincristine + dexamethasone (VCR+DEX) pulses or to 6-mercaptopurine + methotrexate (6MP+MTX). The primary analysis will compare the cumulative incidence of the first episode of Grade 2 or higher neuropathy or neuropathic pain (the end point) by stratified Gray's test. Adverse events other than the endpoint rendering a patient drop out after Continuation Week 49 are regarded as competing events.</description>

    <description>A single-blind (psychological examiner), randomized, controlled, group sequential design will be used to evaluate the impact of computer-based cognitive intervention (Cogmed) administered during therapy, relative to the end of therapy, on neurocognitive outcomes. Patients will be randomized according to the procedure outlined in the protocol. Randomization will be stratified based on age (4-8; &gt;9 years old) and treatment risk arm (low; standard/high) in order to roughly balance the groups on these factors. Patients will be randomized according to a 2:2:1 allocation (2 - On Therapy, 2 - End of Therapy, 1 - Control).

    <description>The primary outcome is BMD in the tibia, measured at baseline and the end of intervention. The changes from baseline to the end of the intervention between the treatment and control groups will be compared using a two-sample t-test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test if normality does not hold. Furthermore, the linear mixed model will be used to analyze the time effect, group effect and their interaction, adjusting for the factors used for stratification (gender, pubertal status, and risk group) and possible confounders (i.e., hormonal function and vitamin D metabolism, physical activity, etc.).</description>
