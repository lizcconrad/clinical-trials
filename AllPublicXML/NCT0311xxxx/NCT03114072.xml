  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy, and the incidence increases during the third
      trimester. Light and specially the blue wavelengths of light, is affecting sleep and the
      circadian rhythm. The main aim of this randomized controlled study is to investigate the
      effect of Blue-blocking glasses (BB-glasses) used in the evening and night on sleep and mood
      in pregnant women in the third trimester. The outcome measures assess sleep variables,
      alertness, melatonin level, sleepiness (subjectively), mood and symptoms of anxiety and
      depression. In addition we want to measure the pregnancy related sleep problems, alcohol
      intake, physical activity and perceives stress in the study population, and the association
      with daily/nightly light exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several hormonal and mechanical influences can cause insomnia in pregnancy, and insomnia has
      been reported by 62% of pregnant women, a number that is significantly higher than found in
      the general population (10-15%). Disrupted sleep among pregnant women also includes nocturia
      (a frequent need to get up and urinate at night), dyspnea (shortness of breath), nasal
      congestion, muscular aches and pelvic pains, fetal activity, leg cramps as well as reflux.

      Artificial light in the evening and during the night increases alertness, disturbs sleep,
      shifts the timing of the circadian clock and impairs the brains' restorative slow waves
      during deep sleep. Recent studies have however shown that use of BB-glasses in the evening
      improves sleep quality (subjectively reported) among persons with insomnia, and prevent
      alertness caused by blue-light emitting screens which are part of devices such as
      smart-phones and tablets.

      This project will contribute with new knowledge on how filtering nightly light exposure in
      pregnant women in their third trimester affects their sleep and mood. Importantly, the
      project initiates new research on a potential non-pharmacological treatment of sleep
      disturbances by blocking blue wavelengths of light in the evening and during nocturnal
      awakenings. Blue light is known to increase alertness through a recently described retinal
      receptor; the intrinsically photoresponsive retinal ganglion cell (IpRGC), specialized for
      detecting daytime light signal. This project is highly innovative and may have significant
      practical implications Due to the variety of aims and outcome measures, we plan to present
      the outcomes in separate articles.
