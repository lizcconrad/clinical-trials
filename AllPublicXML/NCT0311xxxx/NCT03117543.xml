  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) means raised blood glucose found for the first time in pregnancy.
      GDM is common, particularly in women from minority ethnicities. GDM does not cause any
      symptoms in the mother. GDM is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes which can be
      improved with treatment of GDM. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care
      Excellence (NICE) recommend pregnant women with one or more risk factors should have a 75g
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The OGTT is performed in a clinic with venous plasma
      glucose measured fasting and at 2 hours. This is resource-intensive, and some women with GDM
      may be missed by this risk-factor based approach. The International Association of Diabetes
      and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG 2010) recommends screening all pregnant women with 2-hour,
      3 sample (fasting, 1 and 2 hour), 75g OGTT, which is even more resource intensive. Developing
      more cost-effective and convenient approaches to screening for GDM is a priority.

      The researchers will validate a new home-use OGTT system (hOGTT), which measures whole blood
      glucose in capillary blood ('finger-stick' sample), against the gold standard venous plasma
      glucose in pregnancy.

      The researchers will also investigate the performance of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in
      screening for GDM. HbA1c is used for diagnosis of diabetes outside of pregnancy, but is
      currently not recommended for screening for GDM.

      The researchers will also investigate relationships between glucose measured in different
      samples (venous versus capillary), different fractions (plasma versus whole blood), and using
      different methods in pregnancy.

      In a substudy the researchers will investigate: ethnic differences in HbA1c and other
      glycaemic markers; the contribution of fasting and postprandial glucose handling, diet and
      ethnicity on HbA1c; and ethnic differences in insulin responses to 75g OGTT in pregnancy.

      The researchers will invite pregnant women between 16-34 weeks gestation to participate. The
      research involves one hospital visit for an OGTT. Participants will have venous blood samples
      taken fasting and at 1-hour and 2-hours, and at the same times finger-stick blood samples
      will be tested. The researchers will invite women of Black African, Black Caribbean and White
      European ethnicity to participate in a substudy in which participants will have extra blood
      taken and a diet assessment.

      If the hOGTT provides accurate results in pregnancy, using it to perform OGTTs at home would
      make screening for GDM less expensive and more convenient and may facilitate universal
      screening for GDM. Understanding ethnic differences in HbA1c will help determine if HbA1c is
      a reliable screening tool for GDM in our ethnically diverse local population.
