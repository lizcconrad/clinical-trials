  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a remote support group
      intervention for people with aphasia, and will investigate the impact of that intervention on
      measures of wellbeing, quality of life and communication. The intervention will be delivered
      to 32 participants in Eva Park, a virtual island specifically designed for people with
      aphasia.
