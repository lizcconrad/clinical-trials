  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common motor deficiency after stroke or traumatic brain injury is hemiparesis. Most
      hemiparetic patients recover walking, but rarely with a speed permitting easy ambulation
      outdoors with family or friends. One of the mechanisms of gait impairment in hemiparesis is
      insufficient active hip flexion during swing phase, which leads to insufficient ground
      clearing at swing phase, with associated gait slowness and risks of fall.

      The main hypothesis behind the present study is that insufficient hip flexion during
      hemiparetic gait is partly due to overactivity of rectus femoris. Focal treatment of lower
      limb muscle overactivity using botulinum toxin has not been demonstrated to increase walking
      speed in hemiparesis as yet. However, most studies have focused distally, on improving foot
      dorsiflexion only. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of botulinum toxin
      injection and placebo in rectus femoris (RF) + plantar flexors versus plantar flexors only.
