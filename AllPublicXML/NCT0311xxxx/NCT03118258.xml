  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, in France, 3 000 women are diagnosed for cervical cancer, and 1 000 die each
      year. The incidence of this cancer is very inequal: recent studies found regional, social and
      economical inequalities.

      Currently, in France, the pap-smear test is the reference in prevention for cervical
      neoplasia (CIN) and cancer screening. Screening and treatment allowed to reduce the incidence
      and the mortality by cervical cancer by half, since the two last decades. But many women are
      still not reached by prevention programs, especially precarious women. In 2013, Doctors of
      the World France evaluated that almost 70% of women aged from 25 to 65 years coming in its
      medical center had never benefit of a pap-smear test.

      The objective of this study is to compare the rate of participation in the pap-smear
      screening with the proposition of a prevention consultation about sexual and reproductive
      health associated or not with the proposition of a vaginal Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
      self-sampling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every woman aged from 25 to 65 years met in a the Doctors of the World's programs will attend
      to a prevention consultation about sexual and reproductive health and cervical cancer
      screening. 8 programs are included at this study: medical centers and mobile programs, in
      five french cities. Those programs intends to facilitate access to care for people who does
      not have access for different reasons :no health insurance, living far from health services,
      doesn't know prevention or health system in France.

      After the dedicated consultation, one intervention will be proposed :

        -  Either an orientation to health centers partners for a pap smear test (arm &quot;Pap test&quot;)

        -  Or a vaginal HPV self-sampling on site, and after results an orientation to health
           centers partners for a pap smear test (arm&quot;HPV self sampling + Pap test&quot;)

      The inclusion of women in one or the other arm will be done through randomization: 7 periods
      of one month with a proposition of vaginal HPV self-sampling and 7 periods of one month
      without vaginal HPV self-sampling. Each period with a proposition of HPV self-sampling will
      be followed by a period without HPV self-sampling, to prevent the seasonality impact. The
      first period have been randomized for each program.

      To lead this consultation, prevention team members have been trained on how to lead the
      consultation and specifically how to deal with sexual and reproductive health, cervical
      cancer screening topics and counseling. Illustrated tools have been specially developed for
      this purpose. Professional translators will be involved in consultation when needed.
