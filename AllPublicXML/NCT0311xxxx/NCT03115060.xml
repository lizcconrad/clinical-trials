  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid management being an important component of surgery becomes more challenging for an
      anesthesiologist in case of renal transplant. Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an inevitable
      consequence of kidney transplantation, leading to metabolic acidosis .Normal saline (NS; 0.9%
      NaCl) is administered during kidney transplantation to avoid the risk of hyperkalemia
      associated with potassium-containing fluids. Plasmalyte is another fluid which can be used
      and probably will lead to better metabolic profile in these group of patients.The primary
      objective of this study will be to compare the effects of using normal saline (NS), Ringer
      lactate and Plasmalyte as intravenous fluids on acid-base balance and electrolytes during
      living donor kidney transplantation. Secondary outcomes assessed will be the effect on renal
      function.
