  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that digoxin can be safely added to decitabine and will increase
      the response rates in medically unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML/MDS or those with
      relapsed/refractory AML/MDS. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the addition of digoxin to
      decitabine will result in distinct epigenetic alterations in AML/MDS patients.

    <intervention_model_description>For Group#1 a total of 37 patients with newly diagnosed MDL or MDS will be enrolled, including the eligible patients originally enrolled in the phase Ib portion (safe dose group) of the study, with the goal of determining the clinical activity of our experimental regimen. In the phase II segment, all new patients who are enrolled will initially be randomized in a 1 to 1 fashion to receive decitabine alone or decitabine plus digoxin for one cycle before receiving decitabine plus digoxin for all subsequent cycles for a total of 6 cycles.
For Group#2 the target will be to enroll a total of 60 patients with relapsed or refractory AML/MDS, including the eligible patients enrolled in the phase Ib group. This group will have randomization and treatments similar to Group#1.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of one of the following:

               -  Newly diagnosed AML (excluding APL)

               -  Newly diagnosed intermediate-2 (INT-2) or high-risk MDS

               -  Relapsed or Refractory AML, or INT-2 or high-risk MDS

          2. For patients with refractory disease they must be at least 4 weeks out from most
             recent therapeutic intervention.

          3. Age &gt; 18 years.

          4. ECOG performance status 0 - 2.

          5. Patients must have normal organ function as defined below:

               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST/ALT (SGOT/SGPT) &lt; 2 times institutional normal limits

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels

             sexual activity throughout the duration of treatment and for 2 months after
             discontinuation, for protection against the risk of embryofetal toxicity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events (less than or equal to

          6. Patients requiring treatment with one or more beta-blockers (metoprolol, atenolol,
             propranolol) or calcium channel blockers with AV-nodal blocking activity (verapamil,
             diltiazem).

          7. Patient with history of prior exposure to decitabine.

                  induction chemotherapy in newly diagnosed AML.

                       Peripheral Blasts, Creatinine

                    -  Score above 13.1 associated with 31%+ chance of death after induction

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

         10. Known HIV-positive patients on combination anti-retroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with digoxin. In addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

         11. Pregnant or breast feeding
