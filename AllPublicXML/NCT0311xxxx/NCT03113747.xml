    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of tissue engineered construct
      based on allogeneic cultured adipose-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells
      (ALLO-ADSCs) and platelet-poor plasma fibrin hydrogel to treat patients with 2-B and 3-
      degree burn wounds

    <textblock>
      For more than 20 years in clinical practice allogeneic transplantation of diploid fibroblasts
      (ADP) for burn wounds has been successfully used, it is used as an independent method, and a
      method of preparing wounds for autologous skin grafting [1].

      The clinical efficacy of transplantation ADP, after the research done by E.V. Glushchenko;
      Rahayev AM [2,3] is not doubted.

      Several studies have shown the efficacy of stem cells in promoting faster and superior wound
      healing. Alexaki [4] successfully used adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in wound
      healing in mice and compared their effect with dermal fibroblasts. The application of stem
      cells in wounds promoted more efficient reepithelialization by their proliferative effect on
      keratinocytes.

      In recent years, the world's leading burn centers attempted to restore the skin over large
      areas of burn wounds by epidermal layers transplantation of allogeneic cells cultured in
      culture medium.

      The information expected in the study will be based on the principles of evidence-based
      medicine and will have practical significance for the treatment of burn wounds.

      It is expected to show a positive effect of cultured multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in
      the epithelization of burn wounds process as well as the extent and speed healing of skin
      flap during autologous skin grafting.
