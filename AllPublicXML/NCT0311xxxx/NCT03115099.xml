  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety of single doses of a study drug known as
      LY3325656 that is given orally to healthy participants and participants with type 2 diabetes.
      Information about any side effects that may occur will be collected.

      It will also investigate how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream, and how long
      it takes the body to get rid of it.

      The study consists of two parts. Part A will study healthy participants over approximately 12
      weeks and Part B will study participants with type 2 diabetes over approximately 5 weeks,
      excluding screening. Screening is required within 28 days of the start of the study.
