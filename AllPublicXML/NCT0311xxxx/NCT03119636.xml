  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intracerebral transplantation of human
      embryonic stem cells-derived neural precursor cells in patients with Parkinson's Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I/II, open-label, non randomized clinical trial. The study will enroll
      50 patients for cell injection, administering a single dose of neural precursor cells by
      stereotaxic intra-striatal injection.

    <measure>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score is derived from Part I (Mentation, Behavior and Mood), Part II (Activities of Daily Living) and Part III (Motor Examination). Part I assesses 4 functions; Part II assesses 13 activities of daily living; Part III assesses 14 motor symptoms. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The minimum total score possible is 0 and the maximum total score possible is 176. Each subject was independently rated by two observers at each study visit and a mean score was calculated for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change in DATscan from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>DATscan is an imaging technology that uses small amounts of a radioactive drug to help determine how much dopamine is available in a person's brain.Its principle is based on using of radiopharmaceutical, which bind to dopamine transporters (DAT).</description>
