  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dose heparin regimens are required in cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
      and this may increase postoperative bleeding. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect
      of heparin dose calculated according to lean body weight on intraoperative and postoperative
      bleeding.

      Patients with preoperative demographic data such as age, gender, body weight, height, and
      additional disease, medications, previous surgery, preoperative Htc / Hb values were recorded
      in the operation room without medical premedication. Standard anesthesia induction was
      performed after arterial cannulation and peripheral venous route. Patients were randomly
      divided into two groups: 400 IU heparin / kg (Group I) and 400 IU heparin / kg (Group II)
      according to actual body weight and lean body weight respectively before CPB. Before and
      after heparin administration, CPB entry and ACT (Activated Clotting Time) values were counted
      every 30 minutes, after CPB exit and protamine. In both groups, supplemental heparin was
      administered when there was a failure to reach the pre-CPB target ACT value of 400 sec.
      Hemodynamic data and transfusion requirements were recorded during the operation. Patient's
      intraoperative CPB and crossover times, postoperative drainage volume and blood transfusion
      requirement were recorded.
