  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled and multicenter study.And the
      trial is going to enroll better control intrahepatic tumors for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)
      patients who meet the inclusion criterion.The patients were divided into two groups, the
      group A by TACE and the other group B by external- beam radiotherapy(EBRT) after 2 times
      TACE. Then the therapeutic effects and toxicities of TACE and EBRT are evaluated during the
      follow-up period. The study design plans to enroll 300 patients, and each group includes 150
      cases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled HCC patients met the inclusion criterion, in the late or advanced stage, without
      extrahepatic metastasis and macro-vascular invasion (secondary vascular branches or below
      it), and the number of tumor was≤3.Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      either TACE or TACE+EBRT.

      TACE group: The frequency of treatment is determined based on the disease condition at a 4-6
      weeks interval for patients who are randomly assigned to group of TACE treatment. TACE is
      performed via an injection into the hepatic artery of agents by puncturing the common femoral
      artery, and micro-embolization superselective catheterization is preferred. Adriamycin(30 to
      60mg) is considered as basic chemotherapy drugs in the process of transcatheter endovascular
      perfusion.The dose of lipiodol was determined by diameter and blood supply type of
      HCC,generally 5-20ml,and no more than 30ml once.The boundary is considered whether there are
      large amounts of lipiodol to deposit in the tumor and tiny branches shadow of portal veins in
      paracarcinoma under fluoroscopic guidance. Embolizing agents(gelatin sponge particles
      350um-560um) are added after lipiodol emulsion embolization. And all the blood supplies of
      the tumor should be embolized as far as possible.

      TACE+EBRT group: Patients who were randomized to the radiotherapy group start radiotherapy
      3-5 weeks after the completion 2 times TACE. Radiotherapy equipment is based on the
      conditions of the cooperative units. 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy(3-DCRT),
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy(IMRT) or Image-Guided Radiotherapy(IGRT) will be opted
      based on hospital. IGRT can also be used via helical tomotherapy, Rapid Arc or Volumetric
      Modulated Arc Therapy(VMAT). The target volume should include the visible tumor.
