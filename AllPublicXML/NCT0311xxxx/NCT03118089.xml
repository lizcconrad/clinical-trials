  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The health risks and costs associated with malnutrition can be significantly reduced if
      symptoms are recognized early and treated effectively. Oral nutritional supplements (ONS)
      have been shown to increase nutrient intakes and maintain or improve nutritional status and
      functional outcomes in patients in a variety of settings. However despite this it is
      frequently reported that compliance to ONS, which are often milk based drinks, is poor. The
      aim of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of a new biscuit style nutritional
      supplement in the management of malnutrition.

      The study is a randomized controlled eight-week intervention study. Suitable participants
      currently being prescribed ONS and who meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, will
      be identified by either staff in care facilities, Registered Dietitians or by General
      Practitioner (GP) surgeries. Participants (n=80) will be stratified based on BMI and gender
      and randomly assigned to either the biscuit ONS group (n=40) or to remain on their existing
      ONS prescribed as part of their standard care practice (n=40). Changes in anthropometry,
      functional status, nutritional intake and appetite, general health, gastrointestinal symptoms
      and biochemistry (correction of nutritional deficiency), as well as compliance and
      acceptability of ONS will be assessed between week 0 and week 8. Participants will also be
      visited mid-intervention (week 4) to ensure well-being and assess compliance.

      This work is funded by Calerrific Ltd. and seeks to determine if the new biscuit style
      nutritional supplement could be used as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, existing
      ONS to improve compliance and aid the recovery of malnourished patients.
