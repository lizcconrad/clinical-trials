  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim will be to compare the effects of a Pilates intervention program with a prescription
      of home exercises in individuals with chronic nonspecific low back pain. A second objective
      will be to assess the cost of interventions, associated with effects on outcomes. This is a
      randomized controlled clinical trial, characterized by the application of therapeutic
      exercises, in two modalities: Pilates Method and Home Prescription of Exercises. Participants
      will be sequentially enrolled and will be randomly allocated into two groups: 1) Pilates:
      which will be submitted to Mat Pilates sessions, 2x / week, for 6 weeks; 2) Home Exercise: 2
      sessions of exercise supervised by a physiotherapist and, after, all participants will
      receive a booklet with the prescription of home therapeutic exercises, to be performed in the
      period of 6 weeks (2x/week) and monitored in a diary. Participants will be evaluated in three
      different moments: 1) Baseline (pre-intervention); 2) At the end of the intervention period
      (6 weeks); And 3) After two months of follow-up. Primary outcomes will be pain (measured by
      VAS), perception of recovery (likert scale of 6-points), functionality (measured by the
      Quebec Questionnaire - QDS) and kinesiophobia (measured by the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia).
      Secondary outcomes will be the postural balance and the quality of life. An economic
      evaluation will be carried out, from the economic perspective of the society, with a survey
      of direct and indirect costs, associated to the effects of the interventions. Data analysis
      will be performed through SPSS software version 22.0. The data normality assumptions will be
      evaluated using the Shapiro Wilk test. If the test confirms the assumptions, a mixed ANOVA
      with repeated measures will be used, based on the outcomes (functionality, pain, postural
      balance, quality of life, perception of recovery and kinesiophobia) and independent variables
      (Pilates and Home Exercises), for the comparisons between pre-intervention, post-intervention
      and follow-up. Pilates is expected to have better effects than the home exercise prescription
      group, associated with the outcomes of interest. In addition, the hypothesis is that the
      Pilates costs will exceed the costs from the home-based exercise prescriptions; however, the
      analysis of cost-benefit will demonstrate positive results in favor of the home-exercises.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized controlled clinical trial, characterized by the application of therapeutic exercises, in which subjects will be randomly allocated into two groups: Pilates Method and Home-Based Exercises. The participantes will be individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain. The study will be reported following the recommendations of the CONSORT Statement. For the present study, chronic non-specific back pain was defined as uninterrupted low back pain for more than 12 weeks, with unknown causes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Mat Pilates Program, 2x/week, for 6 weeks, supervised by a Physiotherapist. Sessions will last forty five min, with 4 individuals per session. On average, 10 to 15 exercises will be performed per session, with repetitions ranging from 10 to 20 times, according subject's limitations. If necessary, the exercises will be adapted individually for the three levels of difficulty: basic, intermediate and advanced. Progress will be dependent on the absence of postural compensations when performing the repetitions of the exercises.</description>

    <description>Composed by two familiarization sessions, supervised by a Physiotherapist. The protocol include postural reeducation exercises, stretching and muscle strengthening, stabilization and mobilization of the spine. Subsequently, participants will receive an educational booklet containing information on low back pain, anatomy of the spine and its relation to the muscular chain, care during daily life activities and the importance of regular physical exercises. Also, it will include a booklet with the prescription of therapeutic home exercises to be performed during the next 6 weeks. It will be recommended that the participants perform the exercises 2x/week. Participants will also be contacted weekly by email and/or telephone, for remote supervision and for checking the prescribed exercises.</description>
