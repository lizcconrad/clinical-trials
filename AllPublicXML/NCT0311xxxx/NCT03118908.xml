      1. To evaluate effectiveness of combined use of dietary supplements Amberen and Smart B (vs
           placebo) by women with a typical (without complications) form of climacteric syndrome,
           with mild to moderate vegetative symptoms during perimenopause and menopause in regards
           to vasomotor, endocrine-metabolic, and neuro-psychological dysfunctions;

        2. To evaluate safety of combined use of dietary supplements Amberen and Smart B (vs
           placebo) by women with a typical (without complications) form of climacteric syndrome,
           with mild to moderate vegetative symptoms during perimenopause and menopause, lasting no
           less than 1 year in regards to vasomotor, endocrine-metabolic, and neuro-psychological
           dysfunctions;

        3. To develop recommendations for combined use of dietary supplements Amberen and Smart B
           for women with a typical (without complications) form of climacteric syndrome, with mild
           to moderate vegetative symptoms during perimenopause and menopause (menopausal for at
           least 1 year).
