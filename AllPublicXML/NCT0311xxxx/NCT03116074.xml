  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to implement and evaluate an interactive patient-centered discharge
      toolkit (PDTK) to engage patients and care partners in discharge preparation and
      communication with providers after discharge. The aims of this study are to:

        1. To refine and implement an interactive PDTK on a general medicine unit that patient and
           caregivers can use to prepare for discharge and communicate with key providers during
           the transition home.

        2. To evaluate the impact of the PDTK on patient activation (primary outcome). Patient
           reported self-efficacy after discharge; post-discharge healthcare resource utilization;
           and perception of patient-provider communication will be measured as secondary outcomes.

        3. To identify barriers and facilitators of implementation, adoption, and use of the PDTK
           by patients, caregivers, and providers using qualitative and quantitative methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transition from the hospital is a vulnerable time for patients and stressful for
      caregivers-new treatments have been initiated, conditions require close monitoring, and the
      plan of care is in flux. Achieving a high-quality transition requires effective understanding
      of the discharge plan by patients/caregivers as well as seamless communication with key
      inpatient providers to address patients' concerns during and immediately after
      hospitalization. We designed an interactive patient-centered discharge toolkit (PDTK) that is
      accessible from an acute care patient portal. The PDTK allows patients and/or caregivers to
      self-assess discharge preparedness via a validated, pre-discharge checklist tool and
      communicate directly with key members of the care team. Information entered by the patient
      regarding their discharge preparedness is presented to the unit-based care team on an
      interactive safety dashboard so that providers can address any barriers prior to discharge.
      After discharge, patients can communicate directly with providers about issues or concerns
      that arise prior to follow-up with their ambulatory providers.

      The PDTK will be implemented and evaluated for patients admitted to and discharged from
      general medicine units. The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
      maintenance) framework will be used to inform research questions and methods that guide
      implementation and evaluation. A pre-post study will be performed in which the primary
      outcome is analyzed as the proportion of patients with Patient Activation Measure (PAM)
      Levels 3 or 4 at discharge. Approximately 358 patients will be enrolled to provide adequate
      power to detect an improvement in the primary outcome from 72% to 84%. Quantitative and
      qualitative methods will be used to assess implementation, adoption, and use of the
      intervention.
