  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, obtaining samples directly from the small bowel is difficult due to the highly
      invasive intubation methods used. Research on the effect of dietary probiotics on the gut
      microbiota is therefore largely dependent on measurement of the microbial composition in
      fecal samples. At best, the measurement in fecal samples reflects microbial composition of
      the large intestine. The microbial composition in the small intestine differs substantially
      from the composition in feces. In addition, many physiological processes that are modulated
      by dietary probiotics, such as immunoregulation, mainly occur in the small intestine.
      Therefore, it is vital to study the effects of dietary probiotics on the small intestinal
      microbiota, as well. Successful sampling of the small intestine has been demonstrated in
      animals and humans, using the IntelliCap® CR system. The main aim of the current study is to
      explore and compare the small intestinal microbiota profiles in healthy subjects before and
      after consumption of a probiotic drink containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS)
      (Yakult®).

      The study is a dietary intervention study with a repeated measures design, comparing the
      upper gastrointestinal microbiota profiles in healthy male subjects before and after
      consumption of a probiotic drink containing LcS.

      This study is explorative in nature. This pilot-study is used to explore trends in microbiota
      profile shifts in the small intestine. In addition, the investigators would like to explore
      whether these microbial shifts are similar to those observed in fecal samples. Information
      derived from this pilot-study can be used to design future intervention studies focusing on
      either the effect of probiotics on microbial shifts in the small or large intestine.
