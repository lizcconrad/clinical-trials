    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well a lay health worker outreach works in
      increasing colorectal cancer screening in Asian Americans. Training community members to
      educate participants about colorectal cancer and its prevention may improve colorectal cancer
      screening rates in Asian Americans.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the efficacy of lay health worker (LHW) outreach on colorectal cancer (CRC)
      screening among 3 Asian American groups (Filipinos, Hmong, and Koreans) in a cluster
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CRC education delivered by LHWs (intervention) to
      a CRC brochure and nutrition education (control).

      II. Examine the processes through which LHWs communicate with, connect to, and convince
      community members from 3 Asian American cultures of the importance of CRC screening using
      mixed methods.

      OUTLINE: Lay health workers (LHWs) are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (CRC EDUCATION): LHWs undergo training over 3 days and recruit 15 participants from
      their social network. Participants attend a CRC educational session conducted by an LWH over
      90 minutes at month 1 and 3. Participants receive phone calls from the LWH at months 2 and 4
      reminding them about CRC screening.

      GROUP II (CRC BROCHURE): LHWs undergo training over 3 days and recruit 15 participants from
      their social network. Participants attend a lecture on healthy nutrition for cardiovascular
      health presented by a professional health educator at months 1 and 3. After the first
      meeting, participants receive a brochure on CRC screening. Participants receive phone calls
      from the LWH at months 2 and 4 regarding changes in their nutritional behavior. Participants
      may attend an optional post-intervention LHW outreach session on CRC screening.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 2 months.

    <description>Bivariable and multivariable analyses of the binary outcomes (CRC screening ever, up-to-date, and intention) will be conducted using generalized linear models to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. A linear model with identity link function will be used with group (intervention or control), time (pre- or post-), and group-by-time interaction to test for a difference in the change from pre- to post-intervention between the 2 groups, thus measuring the efficacy of the intervention.</description>
