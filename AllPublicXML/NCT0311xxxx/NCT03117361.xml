      This is a multi-center, open-label, single arm, non-comparative phase II trial, designed to
      evaluate the efficacy of plitidepsin in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in
      patients with MM double refractory to bortezomib and lenalidomide.The primary endpoint will
      be overall response rate (ORR), including stringent complete response (sCR), complete
      response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) and partial response (PR).

      Approximately 64 evaluable patients will be needed for the evaluation of the primary
      endpoint, ORR.

      An early futility analysis will be performed with the efficacy data collected from the first
      20 evaluable patients. The futility analysis will commence once patient number 20 has
      completed two full treatment cycles. Patient recruitment will not be halted during the
      conduct of this futility analysis.

    <description>Response or disease progression will be assessed on D1 of each therapy cycle according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria with evaluation of serological myeloma specific markers: M-protein, serum FLC and IF from blood and urine. When serological markers indicate Complete Response (CR), a bone marrow (BM) aspirate or biopsy will be performed. Also, a skeletal survey will be performed to confirm no increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response)</description>
