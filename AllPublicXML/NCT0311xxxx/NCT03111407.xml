    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate Zimmer® iASSIST™ with respect to
      radiographic, clinical and economic outcomes and compared to conventional instrumentation in
      primary total knee arthroplasty (NexGen or Persona knee implants).

    <textblock>
      The study design is a prospective, multicenter, comparative outcome study. The study requires
      each site to obtain IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval prior to study enrollment. All
      potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

      All study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their total knee
      arthroplasty. Investigators will collect clinical data for 12 months. Follow-up clinical
      visits include 3 and 12 months post-operatively.

      The primary endpoint of this study is defined as component alignment as determined using long
      leg X-Rays. The secondary endpoint will be to evaluate the Knee Society Score, EQ-5D
      (EuroQol-5Dimensions) scoring system, operating room time, blood loss and complications

    <description>patients will have primary total knee arthroplasty with the iAssist. The iAssist Knee System is a computer assisted stereotaxic surgical instrument system to assist the surgeon in the positioning of orthopedic implant system components intra-operatively. It involves surgical instruments and position sensors to determine alignment axes in relation to anatomical landmarks and to precisely position alignment instruments and implant components relative to these axes.</description>

             knee implant

          -  Patient is diagnosed with non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease (e.g.,
             osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, etc.)

          -  Patient is over 18 years old

          -  Patient is able to:

               -  Understand what participation in the study entails and willing to consent
                  (patient or his/her legal guardian) to participate in the study by signing and
                  dating an IRB/EC (ethics committee) approved inform consent form, and

               -  Follow surgeon/staff instructions, and

               -  Return for all follow-up evaluations, and

               -  Able and willing to undergo a preoperative full-leg, standing radiographs and/or
                  CT-scan

          -  Patient meets an acceptable preoperative medical clearance and is free of or treated
             for cardiac, pulmonary, hematological or other conditions that would pose excessive

          -  Patient has insufficient quality or quantity of bone to support the implant due to
             prior knee surgery (or surgeries), cancer, metabolic bone disease,
             osteoporosis/osteopenia (diagnosed or treated with medication), active/old/remote
             infection, etc.

          -  Patient has a mental condition that may interfere with his/her ability to give an
             informed consent or interfere with his/her ability or willingness to fulfill the

          -  Patient has a condition that would place excessive demands on the implant (e.g.,
             Charcot's joints, muscle deficiencies, multiple joint disabilities, skeletal
             immaturity, etc.).

          -  Patient has collateral ligament insufficiency.

          -  Patient has an immunosuppressive disorder (e.g., AIDS, etc.) that would require
