  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total of 89 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery will be enrolled.

      Right CVC insertion begins at their intersection of the cricoid cartilage level and the
      triangular point where the sternal head of the SCM muscle meets the clavicular head. After
      insertion the central venous catheter through the right internal jugular vein and positioning
      it, the location of the tip of the central venous catheter will be confirmed by TEE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigator confirms the location of the 2 cm from the junction between right atrium and
      superior vena cava to the end of the tip of the catheter using TEE, and measures the
      insertion depth of the catheter at insertion point. It is possible to find the ideal central
      venous catheter insertion depth in actual clinical practice in adult patient.

      The ideal central venous catheter insertion depth can be measured accurately when the end of
      the central venous catheter is monitored with transesophageal ultrasonography, and it can be
      derived a meaningful formula for predicting the ideal central venous insertion depth from the
      patient's height .
