  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      I plan to investigate the value of video-based feedback in endoscopic training -
      specifically, the role of terminal video feedback as compared to usual concurrent feedback on
      cold snare polypectomy technique in trainees, using Direct Observation of Polypectomy Skills
      (DOPyS) competency score. I have focused the study on the competency of cold snare
      polypectomy for subcentimeter polyps. The majority (&gt;75%) of colon polyps are smaller than
      one centimeter. Cold snare polypectomy has been shown, and recommended by the American
      Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), to be an effective removal technique. However,
      its widespread use and moreover, its teaching to trainees is lacking. It takes time and
      resources to learn and teach endoscopic techniques. Our study will hope to identify a
      mechanism through video-based feedback that could help to improve the translation of the
      training of polypectomy skills to its actual performance, and to accelerate the learning
      curve.
