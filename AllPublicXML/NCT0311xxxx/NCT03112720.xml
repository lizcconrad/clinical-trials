  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a pain block in the midface, versus the traditional,
      more invasive, therapeutic epidural patch for the treatment of headaches
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sphenopalitine nerve block has been used to treat headaches. Patients have headaches
      after epidural access from post dural puncture. We need to know if sphenopalitine nerve block
      will help the patient with the headache.

    <intervention_name>Epidural Blood Patch</intervention_name>
    <description>A device: 17 gauge Touhy needle will be placed to the epidural space using the loss of resistance technique. Once positioned a sterile stylet will be replaced within the needle to maintain the sterility of the epidural space. A tourniquet may be used to identify a peripheral venous site, which will be sterilely prepped with betadine x3 and then chloroprep. Venipuncture will be performed with a device: 20gauge or larger needle. 20mL of blood will be aspirated in a sterile system into an appropriately sized syringe. After sterile transfer, this autologous blood will be slowly injected into the epidural space.</description>

    <description>The drug: 5% lidocaine ointment, a local anesthetic, will be applied to the end of a device: long channeled cotton tipped applicator inserted into both nares and placed over the mucosa in the area of posterior aspect of the middle ethmoid, toward the presumed anatomic location of the sphenopalatine ganglion, evidenced by a slight resistance at the appropriate depth. 5mL of drug: 1% lidocaine solution will then be injected into the hollow shaft of the device: applicator and allowed to topically anesthetize the ganglion by gravity flow for 30 minutes.</description>
