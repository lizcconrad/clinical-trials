  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in current human study. This
      study aims to investigate the intervention effect of AOB-w on the short-term exposure and
      toxicokinetics of acrylamide, a dietary hazardous substance generated during heat processing,
      in Chinese adolescents.

    <textblock>
      In the morning of test day, participants were served with a meal of potato chips,
      corresponding to a single oral dose of 12.6 μg/kg b.w. exposure to acrylamide, and an edible
      capsule, which contains 350 mg AOB-w or the placebo with the same dose. Urine were collected
      within 48 hours thereafter. The diet was rigorously controlled within 24 hours prior to study
      till entire study finished. Four mercapturic acid metabolites have been investigated as
      urinary biomarkers for short-term internal exposure of acrylamide in human
