      Aim:

      To test if MRI can detect meaningful changes in portal pressure in the liver to assess
      whether treatment with beta-blockers has worked.

      Liver Disease:

      Most people with liver disease do not have symptoms. Over time they develop 'cirrhosis' -
      severe liver scarring. In the United Kingdom deaths due to cirrhosis have doubled over the
      last decade, because of increasing rates of alcohol consumption and obesity, while heart,
      kidney, lung diseases, strokes and cancer fatalities have fallen.

      Portal pressure:

      Cirrhosis causes increased pressure within the liver and changes in the circulation leading
      to the development of varicose veins in the gullet and stomach called 'varices'. Varices
      bleed easily, leading to emergency situations that can be life threatening. However, if the
      increased pressure within the liver (portal pressure) is detected early, then treatment can
      prevent variceal bleeding. The only test we have to predict prognosis and treatment success
      in someone with cirrhosis is by measuring the portal pressure.

      Measuring portal pressure:

      Currently the only existing test to measure portal pressure is to pass a pressure sensor
      through a vein in the neck, down into the liver. This is called the hepatic venous pressure
      gradient (HVPG) measurement. The HVPG measurement is disliked by patients because it is an
      invasive procedure. It is also expensive and not widely available. Hence, patients with
      cirrhosis need to have regular camera tests (endoscopies) to look for varices.

      How can you treat varices?

      Two options;

        1. With tablets to lower the pressure (beta-blockers)

        2. Endoscopy treatment (banding)

      Both have advantages and disadvantages;

        -  Beta-blockers only lower the portal pressure in about half of those that take them, with
           some evidence they may also have a protective effect against infections from the bowel
           by increasing the speed of bowel motion

        -  Treating the varices with endoscopy requires several endoscopies and can lead to
           life-threatening bleeding.

      Most patients are therefore given beta-blockers and monitored closely to see if they work.

      Why does it matter?

      Beta-blockers can cause side effects (e.g. fainting) that are unpleasant enough to make up to
      one third of patients stop taking them. Beta-blockers only reduce the portal pressure in half
      of patients. The remaining patients are exposed to potential side effects and possible harm
      in those with the most advanced liver disease. These patients may still have a
      life-threatening bleed as the varices have not been adequately treated. There is a desperate
      need to discover whether the portal pressure changes with treatment (such as with
      beta-blockers) without invasive tests across the NHS.

      Proposed study:

      Researchers in Nottingham have shown MRI can be used as an accurate marker of portal pressure
      with just one scan. To be useful to patients, doctors and researchers, this study will
      investigate whether MRI can detect meaningful changes in portal pressure after treatment with
      beta-blockers. This study has been designed with patient and public involvement (PPI)
      integrated throughout. A focus group shaped the study design and committed to collaborate in
      developing patient materials, recruitment, retention and dissemination.

      All patients who have HVPG will be given information about the study.

      Study Visit 1

        -  One hour MRI scan

        -  Endoscopy to identify varices

             -  If varices are present the patient will be started on beta-blockers and invited to
                visit 2

             -  If there are no varices, patients will return to regular follow up with the liver
                team

      Study Visit 2 (after one week)

        -  Assess side effects, blood pressure and pulse

        -  Increase dose of beta-blocker as appropriate

      Study Visit 3 (after 4-12 weeks)

        -  One hour MRI scan

        -  Repeat HVPG measurement

      Treatment success is determined by the second HVPG measurement. If beta-blockers are working
      they will be continued. If not, the patient will have treatment with endoscopy. This
      represents the ideal pathway which is more personalised than current standard care.
