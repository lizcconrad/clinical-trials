      Methodology:

      This was a monocentric, open label, non-randomised, non-comparative, dose-finding phase I
      study with a traditional 3+3 design, conducted in Chinese patients with advanced solid
      tumours without an established therapeutic alternative.This study was performed in strict
      accordance with Good Clinical Practice including the archiving of essential documents.
