  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact origin of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown. The current hypothesis
      is that IBD is secondary to an abnormal intestinal immun response directed to all or part of
      the intestinal flora in genetically predisposed individuals. Several experimental studies
      have demonstrated the ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow or adipose
      tissue origin to control intestinal inflammation in animal models. However, to date, there
      are no data regarding the functions of resident MSCs in the colon and small intestine of IBD
      patients. We hypothesize that dysfunction of resident intestinal MSCs contributes to the
      disruption of intestinal homeostasis in patients with IBD causing the development of
      intestinal inflammation. The aim of this research project is to identify, describe and
      characterize at the molecular and functional level MSCs of the colon and small intestine of
      patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and to compare them with a control
      population.

      Primary and secondary objectives:

      Main Objective: Characterize morphologically, molecularly and functionally the MSCs of colon
      and small intestine of patients with IBD and compared to MSCs of colon and small intestine of
      control patients.

      Secondary objectives: To study the reaction of colon and small intestine MHC in patients with
      IBD following stimulation with bacterial compounds.

      Methodology:

      Clinical study exploratory translational physiopathological. Two groups of patients with
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis who require colonoscopy or surgery for intestinal
      resection will be included. These two groups will be compared to a control group consisting
      of patients requiring colonoscopy for screening or intestinal resection for colorectal cancer
      or diverticulum.

      Intestinal sampling by biopsy during the colonoscopy or with surgical specimen during the
      surgery will be performed to isolate the MSCs.

      The outcome measures will be a qualitative and quantitative analysis of MSCs by
      immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, cell proliferation and differentiation, production
      of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the basal state and after bacterial stimulation.

      Total of 60 patients (20 in groups, 15 with colonoscopy and 5 with surgical specimens).
