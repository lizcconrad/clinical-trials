  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized control trial to compare the impact of two different types
      of pre-operative web-based breast cancer information on the quality of patient decision
      making. Patients are emailed web-based information prior to the surgical consultation.
      Outcomes are assess at multiple time points: 1) prior to the surgical consultation, 2)
      immediately following the consultation.
