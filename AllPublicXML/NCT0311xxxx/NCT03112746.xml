  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have difficulties performing daily
      activities which reflects negatively on participation, impacting their lives. To date, there
      are a number of interventions to improve performance of these children on activities they
      want or need to. In Brazil, there is little research on the efficacy of such approaches. Our
      main objective was to start a set of studies to examine the effects of the Cognitive
      Orientation to Daily Occupational Performance Approach (CO-OP Approach) protocol on
      occupational performance and satisfaction of Brazilian children who have DCD; to examine
      whether children were able to transfer strategies and skills learned during CO-OP to
      untrained goals.

      Background. Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have difficulties
      performing daily activities which reflects negatively on participation, impacting their
      lives. Objectives. To examine the effects of the Cognitive Orientation to Daily Occupational
      Performance Approach (CO-OP Approach) protocol on occupational performance and satisfaction
      of Brazilian children who have DCD; to examine whether children were able to transfer
      strategies and skills learned during CO-OP to untrained goals. Methods. A pre-post group
      comparison design with eight boys aged 6-10 years old. Children participated in 12 CO-OP
      sessions with their parents twice a week, with an extra session added to the protocol for
      parents´ orientation. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and the Performance
      Quality Rating Scale were used as outcome measures.
