    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CLARIX™ 100 and CLARIX™ CORD 1K as a
      tissue barrier when used as an annular patch in discectomy patients with low back &amp; leg pain
      when compared to traditional discectomy patient outcomes. This will be a 120 patient,
      prospective randomized study model over a 5 year post-operative period.
