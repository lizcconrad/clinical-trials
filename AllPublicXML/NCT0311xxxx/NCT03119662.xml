  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled study will examine the incidence and
      severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage
      III/IV following an i.v. injection of iso-osmolar iodinated contrast material iodixanol
      (Visipaque™ Injection 320 mgI/mL), as compared with patients who received saline and
      underwent a non-enhanced CT (NECT) and duplex ultrasound (US) during their scheduled
      post-EVAR surveillance imaging.

        procedural imaging follow-up examination.

          -  Has previously completed one or more of his or her post-EVAR surveillance imaging
             examination(s) that provided evidence on stable post-EVAR status.

          -  Has a documented diagnosis of stage III or IV CKD and stable renal function.

          -  Is able to provide written informed consent.

             24 hours prior to the Baseline Visit and for at least 48 hours after the imaging
             procedure.

          -  Has been exposed to any intravascular iodinated contrast medium in the 7 days prior to

             procedure-with the exception of acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) at a dose of ≤100 mg
