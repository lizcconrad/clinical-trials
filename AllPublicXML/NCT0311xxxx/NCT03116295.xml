    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioavailability and the bioequivalence between
      two active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) sources of opicapone (OPC) at two different dosage
      strengths (25 mg and 50 mg) after a single oral dose administration under fasting conditions
      in healthy male and female subjects.

      Single-center, fasted, open-label, randomized, gender-balanced, single-dose, laboratory
      blinded, two-periods, two-sequence, crossover study in 2 groups of subjects.

      In Group 1, subjects will receive randomly in Period 1 and 2, either a single 25 mg dose of
      OPC approved formulation [AF] or a single 25 mg dose of OPC formulation to be submitted for
      approval [NF].

      In Group 2, subjects will receive randomly on Period 1 and 2, either a single 50 mg dose of
      OPC (AF), or a single 50 mg dose of OPC (NF
