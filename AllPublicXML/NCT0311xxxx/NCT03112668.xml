    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well acceptance and commitment therapy works in
      improving well-being in patients with stage III-IV cancer and their partners. Learning how to
      accept negative thoughts and feelings and how to live in the present without worrying about
      the future or past may improve coping skills in patients with stage III-IV cancer and their
      partners.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the feasibility and acceptability of couples' acceptance and commitment therapy
      (ACT) (C-ACT).

      II. To collect pilot data on the impact of C-ACT on patients' and partners' anxiety,
      depression, and quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and their partners attend 6 weekly ACT sessions over 60-75 minutes. Couples learn
      skills of acceptance, avoidance, awareness, values and committed action, mindfulness and
      values in relationships, and handling persistent worries and concerns. Patients and their
      partners also do homework assignment after each session.

      After completion of the study, patients and their partners are followed up at 1 week.

    <measure>Change in acceptance as measured by the COPE acceptance subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-post changes will be examined using t-tests in the primary outcomes as well as the mechanisms of change (e.g., flexibility, avoidance self-disclosure). Because this is primarily a pilot and feasibility study and not an efficacy test, these data will be used primarily to examine whether an impact on distress and well-being was made but statistical significance will not be the primary aim.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility defined as acceptance</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility defined as session drop out</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1-week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This trial will be considered feasible if drop out from sessions (at any point over the 6 sessions) is less than 20% (thus, 6/30)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility defined as survey follow ups</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1-week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This trial will be considered feasible if 3) completion of study surveys at the follow up is 80%, and patients are not lost to progressive disease.</description>
