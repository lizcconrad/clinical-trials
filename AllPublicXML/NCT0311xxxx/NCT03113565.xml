  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After cardiac surgery, patients' follow-up after discharge is a major public health issue.
      Since the main complications occur mostly during the first extra-hospital month, a follow-up
      period becomes necessary as the average duration of hospitalization tends to decrease. The
      resumption of normal physical activity is rarely transmitted and when complications arise,
      the healthcare team is most often informed late.

      An electronic wristband is worn by the patient during the day, between the day of discharge
      from the hospital (D0) and the end of the second extra-hospital month (D60). The data
      recorded by the wristband include : bracelet ID, date, time, number of steps per day, and
      heart rate averaged by 5 minutes.

      The primary objective of the study is to measure the resumption of physical activity after
      elective cardiac surgery. This objective will be quantified by the number of daily footsteps.

      A secondary objectives is to determine perioperative predictors of the physical resumption.
