  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplant patients have on average 3-5 times more risk of developing cancer than the
      general population. This rate can be increased up to 10 to 15 times in some type of cancer
      like kidney cancer. Among the identified risk factors, immunosuppressants and, in particular,
      calcineurin inhibitors (ciclosporin and tacrolimus) play a major role in increasing cancers
      apart from their depressant effects on the immune system.

      Calcineurin inhibitors (CCN) are the basis of immunosuppressive therapy in renal
      transplantation. Several mechanisms have been implicated to explain their pro-oncogenic
      properties. One related to an increase in VEGF expression seems particularly interesting in
      the study of renal cell carcinoma in the transplanted patient. Indeed, the physiopathology of
      kidney cancer has clearly been associated with an increase in the production of VEGF.
      Furthermore, some polymorphisms of the gene encoding VEGF have already been associated with
      the survival of patients with renal carcinoma and the circulating level of VEGF in the
      general population. The search for an association between the polymorphisms of the VEGF gene
      and renal carcinoma in renal transplant patients could thus identify patients whose risk of
      renal cell carcinoma (cRCC) post-transplantation is increased. If the involvement of certain
      polymorphisms in the development of cRCC was confirmed in this population, their research
      before the introduction of the immunosuppressive treatment would make it possible to direct
      the choice of treatment towards molecules without pro-oncogenic property in the Patients such
      as mTOR protein inhibitors (sirolimus, everolimus). This research project is therefore in
      line with the desire to move towards a more &quot;personalized&quot; medicine that could be beneficial
      for the patient.
