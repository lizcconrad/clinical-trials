  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Control of hypertension remains one of the most important interventions available to
      clinicians to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and stroke. Self-measured
      home blood pressure monitoring plus additional support has been shown to reduce blood
      pressure in adults with previously uncontrolled hypertension. Most previous studies have
      utilized healthcare personnel to facilitate communication of home blood pressure levels to
      physicians and did not provide methods to directly transmit self-measured blood home blood
      pressure levels to physicians via the electronic health record. Emerging technology now
      provides the ability for patient's to upload self-measured blood pressure levels into their
      own medical record which may eliminate the need for additional health personnel. This study
      will examine the feasibility, patient adherence and physician and patient perceptions of a
      web-based application which will facilitate direct input of self-measured home blood pressure
      levels and patient reported symptoms directly into the electronic health record with message
      alerts to the provider for hypertension management. Up to 10 Loyola primary care physicians
      and 20 of their respective patients age 50 years and older who have a smart phone device or
      home computer and have treated hypertension will be enrolled. The study will utilize the
      existing web-application called MyChart. MyChart is the name of the web-based application and
      it is not an acronym. Enrolled patients will download the existing MyChart web-based
      application on their smart phone device or home computer and will record home blood pressure
      measurements using their home blood pressure machine into their smart phone application. The
      MyChart application is available to all patients receiving care in the Loyola Health Care
      System. The blood pressure readings and patient reported symptoms will then be available for
      their physicians to review within the electronic health record. After using the web-based
      application for two months, both patients and physicians will be asked to participate in
      focus groups and interviews, respectively, to determine their perceptions and satisfaction
      with the web-based application. Data from this feasibility study may be used to guide a
      future clinical trial of hypertension management that examines the effectiveness of the
      MyChart web-based application for frequent blood pressure monitoring compared to standard
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that clinicians fail to intensify
      therapy in hypertensive management despite patients not meeting goal. For this reason,
      patient centered tools can help facilitate meeting goals with the provider. Web-based
      communication combined with provider care management successfully lowered blood pressure to
      &lt;140/90 mm Hg in prior studies of patients with hypertension. Emerging technology now
      provides the ability for patients to upload self-measured home blood pressure information
      into their own medical record which may eliminate the need for additional health personnel.
      This study will investigate the feasibility of health informatics to facilitate better
      compliance and safety for both provider and patient for hypertension management. The home
      blood pressure readings along with patient reported symptoms will be recorded using the
      MyChart, a web-based tool available to all patients receiving care at Loyola University
      Medical Center. MyChart can be accessed with a hand-held device or home computer. After
      enrollment, patients will receive a notice every two weeks via MyChart to upload home blood
      pressure values and patient reported symptoms. This information entered into MyChart by
      patients will be placed into the electronic health record in a home vital signs flow sheet,
      which will be separate from the flow sheet of vital signs measured in the clinic. Physicians
      will receive an alert message when patients upload the blood pressure data. The alert message
      will provide physicians with the average blood pressure value over the two weeks and will
      provide simple guidance on whether actions, such as titrating existing medication should be
      taken (based on whether BP is ≥ 140/90 mmHg). Patients will also be able to track their own
      home blood pressure values using the MyChart application. As a first step, we are first
      examining the feasibility of this web-based application and determining the perceptions of
      both patients and physicians.
