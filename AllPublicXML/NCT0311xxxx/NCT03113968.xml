  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to conduct a comparative randomized trial of electroconvulsive
      therapy (ECT) vs. ketamine for patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) in a real
      world setting with patient reported outcomes as primary and secondary outcome measures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with treatment resistant depression who meet all inclusion criteria and do not meet
      any exclusion criteria will be randomized to either electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) three
      times per week or ketamine infusion two times per week. Patients will answer questionnaires
      about their symptoms prior to treatments. The acute treatment phase of the study will last
      three to five weeks. Depending on response to treatment, some patients will be followed for
      an additional six months.

    <description>ECT is a procedure done under general anesthesia where small electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. Patients who have not responded to antidepressant medications may be candidates for ECT. ECT is FDA approved for treatment resistant depression.</description>

    <description>Ketamine is a medication that is used as a short acting anesthetic in pediatric and adult medicine. Subanesthetic (low) doses will be given to patients via infusion in order to assess whether it helps with depression symptoms in patients who have not responded to antidepressant therapy. Ketamine is not FDA approved for this indication and its effectiveness in treatment resistant depression has not been proven. Prior studies have indicated that subanesthetic doses of ketamine may be helpful for treatment resistant depression.</description>
