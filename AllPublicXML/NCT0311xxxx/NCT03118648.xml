  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to reduct spontaneous use an activities of daily living of the paretic upper limb
      after stroke i six months after patient discharge from rehabilitation center. The level of
      functional recovery at rehabilitation discharge could better guide rehabilitation strategies
      to enhance independence and participation in daily life.

      This study aims to determine, in patients after stroke, the optimal affected upper limb
      recovery threshold at rehabilitation discharge to predict spontaneous level of use of
      affected upper limb in activities of daily living, six month later.

      This study is a multicentric prognostic prospective cohort study. The main prognostic
      variable will be the Action Arm Test (ARAT, Lyle, 1981) score at rehabilitation discharge and
      the predicted variable will be the Motor Activity Log - 28 (Taub et al. 1993) score at 6
      months post discharge.

      Adults after stroke will be recruited at post-acute rehabilitation discharge. Three
      evaluation times will be undertaken: at discharge, three and six months after discharge.
      Evaluation battery will focus on the three level of the Functioning International
      Classification: affected upper limb level of strength, proprioception and level of functional
      recovery, hemineglect, depression, cognition status, and activity level by doing a
      standardised instrumental task of daily living, and level of participation questionnaire.
      General characteristics will be taken into account: Age, social status, laterality.

      At six months, the spontaneous level of affected upper arm use in daily living will also be
      assessed using accelerometers.

      As the main aim of the study is to build a prediction model, the study size is calculated to
      observe a minimal number of events by potentially predictive variable. We consider here 7.5
      events by independent variable (Vittinghof and McCulloch, 2007) and eight independent
      variables. According to literature review, we estimated that 35% of adults included in this
      study would spontaneously use their affected upper arm in activities of daily living six
      months after discharge. According to these data and considering 10% of protocol deviations,
      we calculated that 192 subjects will have to be included in the study. The inclusion duration
      will be 30 months.

        Patients eligible to participate in the study will be adults who have experienced a first
        stroke and are about to leave the rehabilitation facility for their home. These people
        should have a good oral comprehension. They must not have a psychiatric history with
        hospitalization of more than 6 months. They must have been independent in the activities of
        daily life before their stroke. They must be affiliated to a social security scheme, be
        willing to participate in the study and not participate in another research.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years old leaving the correctional institution with orientation back
             home

          -  First stroke deficit with non-regressive clinical expression in 24 hours

          -  Independent in activities of daily living and living at home and daily activities
             independence before the stroke. This earlier independence is confirmed by the absence
             of professional carers in personal care activities (yes / no)

          -  Proper oral understanding as measured by score 7 in the language screening test LAST
             (Flamand-Roze et al, 2011)

          -  No psychiatric history that led to hospitalization for more than six months

          -  Patient has given its consent within the period provided after reading the briefing
             note

          -  Patient affiliated or beneficiary of a social security scheme.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lack of minimum functional motor recovery in paretic upper limb allowing the patient
             to go put hand to his mouth and to realize do a 45 degrees abduction with the paretic
             upper limb.

          -  Barthel Index score (BI) less than or equal to 40. It is suggested in the literature
             that a score less than or equal to 40 is a key score of total dependence

          -  Persistent severe hemineglect (bells test score &gt; 6).
