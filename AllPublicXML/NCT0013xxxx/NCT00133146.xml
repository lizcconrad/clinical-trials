  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), the administration of gradually increasing quantities
      of an allergen extract to an allergic patient, is a curative approach which directly treats
      the underlying allergic disease. GrassMATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal
      specific immunotherapy for patients with an allergy to grass and rye pollen (hay fever).

      The tolerability and immunogenicity of GrassMATA (allergen modified with glutaraldehyde and
      adsorbed to tyrosine) with and without MPL adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A, extracted from a
      bacterial cell surface) is being investigated in this double-blind, randomized Phase IIa
      study in volunteers allergic to grass and rye pollen.

      Additionally, this study will assess residual allergenicity of the modified grass and rye
      pollen in the product GrassMATAMPL using skin prick testing in volunteers allergic to grass
      and rye pollen.

             an IgE-mediated allergy to pollen from grass and rye

          -  Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females who are post-menopausal or naturally or
             surgically sterile. Females of childbearing potential have a confirmed absence of
