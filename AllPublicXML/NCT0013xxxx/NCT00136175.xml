    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination chemotherapy (paclitaxel,
      carboplatin, and gemcitabine) prior to surgery in the treatment of patients with locally
      advanced transitional cell cancer of the bladder.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin and
      gemcitabine in the treatment of locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
      Patients will be stratified based on extent of disease. Patients with T3, N0 disease will
      receive 3 cycles of chemotherapy and then proceed to cystectomy. Patients with T4 disease or
      any patient with N1-3 disease will receive 3 cycles of therapy followed by assessment of
      response. Patients with evidence of response will then receive an additional three cycles of
      therapy with reassessment of resectability after cycles #6. Correlative Studies: Tumor
      specimens obtained at initial biopsy will be assayed for expression of p53, Rb and p21.
