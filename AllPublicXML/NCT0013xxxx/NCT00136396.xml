  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if rituximab is a safe and effective therapy for
      steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive rituximab intravenously one time per week for four consecutive weeks.
      Once therapy is completed, the patient will have weekly visits with their physician for four
      more weeks, at which they will complete a simple questionnaire designed to evaluate the
      severity of chronic graft versus host disease.

      At the end of the eighth week on the study (4 weeks of study treatment and 4 weeks of
      observation), patients will be evaluated to determine whether their chronic graft versus host
      disease (GVHD) has resolved.

      If chronic graft versus host disease has resolved entirely, the patient will be monitored for
      the remainder of the year.

      If after the initial eight weeks on the study the patient still has symptoms or signs of
      GVHD, they may receive a second four week study treatment.

      If the patients' chronic GVHD reappears after receiving either one or two courses of
      rituximab, a third and final four week course of medication can be given provided it has been
      at least eight weeks since the last dose.

      Blood tests will be performed at the beginning of the study, after 8 weeks on the study,
      after 16 weeks on the study and at the end of 1 year.
