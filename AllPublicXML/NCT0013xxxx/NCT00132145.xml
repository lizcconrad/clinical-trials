  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular diseases (cardiac events, strokes, peripheral vascular disease) remain the number
      one killer in Canadian society as well as the leading cause of hospitalization and days spent
      in the hospital. A 1996 estimate placed Ontario's vascular disease financial burden at $5.5
      billion in total. Any intervention which lowers vascular risk, will have a direct impact on
      the quantity and quality of life and costs of health care. Further integration of health
      professionals in teams focused on chronic disease management in individuals and populations
      is also ripe for further evaluation. Increased collaboration between family physicians,
      physician specialists, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are generally thought to be
      beneficial for patient outcomes, but the literature is inconclusive and their
      cost-effectiveness is unproven. In addition, combining centralized electronic up-to-date
      information on the patient's status with evidence-based recommendations and the ability to
      communicate either electronically or by phone is expected to result in improved access to
      care, quality of care, continuity of care and increase cost-effectiveness of chronic disease
      management.

      COMPETE III builds on the researchers' previous work to study an electronic vascular tracking
      and decision support system shared by patients and their physicians, combined with a clinical
      care coordinator and automated telephone support system. The researchers are evaluating its
      impact on vascular risk processes and outcomes, perceived usefulness, ease of use, need for
      improvement, medication adherence, quality of life and patient goals and motivation.

      Study hypothesis: Patients at increased risk of vascular events, if connected with their
      family physicians, medical specialists and care coordinator via an electronic network (Web,
      fax and telephone) sharing an intensive tracking, advice and support program, will lower
      their vascular risk more than those in usual care.

      COMPETE is Canada's original electronic medical record research network and specializes in
      the rigorous development, implementation and evaluation of electronic technologies in health
      care. COMPETE III will build on COMPETE II to incorporate the latest evidence on:

        1. the management of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and previous vascular events,

        2. improving patient-clinician interactions,

        3. the use of technology to enhance the quality, safety and efficiency of care and

        4. motivational strategies to change both patient and clinician behaviour.

      Specifically, the researchers will:

        1. Expand the disease focus to a vascular risk population (diabetes, hypertension,
           dyslipidemia or previous vascular event);

        2. Expand the electronic care network beyond patients and primary care providers to also
           include specialists (physician specialists, specialty nurse clinicians, etc);

        3. Expand the geographical network from Hamilton area, and Ottawa to include other primary
           care reform (PCR), Ontario Family Health Networks (OFHN) or EHR using sites;

        4. Tighten the integration with the leading Ontario EHR products and concentrate on those
           meeting the new Ontario Smart Systems for Health Clinical Management System
           specifications,

        5. Strengthen the clinical decision support by offering evidence-based algorithms specific
           to the patient, provide specific formulary advice - drug listing, Limited Use
           prescriptions and codes, Section 8 criteria and form letters;

        6. Improve the researchers pharmacosurveillance network which pursues reasons for starting
           and stopping medications by seeking adherence information directly from patients;

        7. Provide direct links via Internet for patients and clinicians to best evidence about
           vascular disease,

        8. Improve the automated telephone support (ATS);

        9. Support physicians in managing this advanced care network by providing clinical care
           coordinators, either nurse clinicians or clinical pharmacists;

       10. Use HL-7 messaging standards as per Canada Health Infoway guidelines;

       11. Rigorously evaluate the cost-effectiveness of our package intervention in order to
           provide specific advice to health planners and payers on costs and benefits.
