  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to identify a safe, tolerable dose of pentoxifylline
      in children with cerebral malaria and to establish an acceptable pentoxifylline dosage
      regimen for use in multi center Phase II and Phase III studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, prospective, dose-escalating study, designed to elucidate the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of pentoxifylline in children of
      the ages greater than/equal to 9 months and less than/equal to 96 months with cerebral
      malaria. The study is designed to evaluate pentoxifylline as adjunct therapy in severe
      pediatric malaria by evaluating its toxicity and associated adverse events, and by
      establishing both an acceptable dose and the associated pharmacokinetic profile. The
      pharmacodynamic effects of four different dose levels (10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg/24 hours)
      will be accessed on the following biological, immunological, and parasitological parameters:
      cerebral blood flow velocity, tumor necrosis factor concentration, rosetting, coma resolution
      time, parasite clearance time, and fever clearance time. Due to the variability observed in
      the biological, immunological, and parasitological parameters under scrutiny, a control group
      of ten patients will be intercalated in the study (4 patients prior to enrollment of the
      first pentoxifylline recipient, 2 patients in-between each of the 3 dose escalations). As
      there is no information about the relationship of treatment duration to biological,
      immunological, and parasitological effects, treatment will continue for 72 hours, by which
      time peripheral parasitemia will have cleared in the majority of patients. The selection of
      the pentoxifylline dosage regimen for the larger, multi center Phase II and Phase III studies
      will be made on the basis of the maximum tolerated dose (based on clinical and laboratory
      observations) which minimizes the dose-related side-effects and adverse events (based on
      pharmacokinetics) while permitting maximum biological, immunological, and/or parasitological
      effects (pharmacodynamics).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Children meeting all of the following criteria are eligible for inclusion in the study.

        Age greater than or equal to 9 months and less than or equal to 96 months. Informed consent
        granted by parents/guardians (Appendix I).

        Has cerebral malaria defined as all of the following:

        peripheral parasitemia with asexual forms of P. falciparum; inability to localize a painful
        stimulus 30 minutes after correcting hypoglycemia (blood glucose less than 2.2 mmol/l) in
        patients who present with hypoglycemia 30 minutes after cessation of convulsive activity in
        patients who are convulsing on admission; no neck stiffness; no clinical evidence of
        pneumonia (no rales, no decreased breath sounds, no bronchial breathing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children with the following will not be enrolled in the study:

        Hypotension: mean blood pressure less than 60 mmHg (mean blood pressure = diastolic blood
        pressure (mmHg) + 1/3 (systolic blood pressure

          -  diastolic blood pressure)). Thrombocytopenia: platelet count less than 50 x 10(to the
             ninth power)/l. Spontaneous bleeding noted in mouth, throat, nares, rectum, or a
             venipuncture site following adequate pressure.

        Hematocrit &lt; 20% OR hematocrit between 20-25% with parasitemia greater than 10%.
