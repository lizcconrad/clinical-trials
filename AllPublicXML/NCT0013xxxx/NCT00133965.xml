  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, 3-site trial (Winnipeg Canada, MSKCC NYC, Perth Australia) accruing
      120 patients per site (120x3). The purpose of this study is to compare two types of
      counseling for cancer patients: &quot;Dignity Psychotherapy&quot; and &quot;Supportive Psychotherapy&quot; as
      well as &quot;Standard Palliative Care.&quot; Many cancer patients seek counseling to help with the
      emotional burden of their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by giving
      them a place to express their feelings. We, the investigators at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
      Cancer Center, have developed a type of counseling we call &quot;Dignity Psychotherapy.&quot; It is
      intended to help cancer patients maintain or enhance a sense of purpose, meaning, and overall
      quality of life, despite having cancer. &quot;Supportive Psychotherapy&quot; is another type of
      counseling intended to help patients feel more at ease and express and reflect on any
      feelings or concerns they might have about their illness. Both of these types of counseling
      will be compared to &quot;Standard Palliative Care.&quot; We will look at how these types of treatments
      affect patients' mood, outlook, and quality of life. We also want to see how the type of
      treatment they receive affects their family members and significant others.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To establish the efficacy of a new and unique individual, brief intervention we call
           &quot;Dignity Psychotherapy&quot; in enhancing a sense of meaning, purpose and overall well-being
           for patients with advanced, end stage cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the effectiveness of &quot;Dignity Psychotherapy&quot; with &quot;Supportive Psychotherapy&quot;
           and &quot;Standard Palliative Care&quot; in bolstering the patients' sense of meaning, purpose,
           generativity, and overall sense of dignity and quality of life, while lessening
           hopelessness, sense of being a burden to others, and suffering.

        -  To explore the impact &quot;Dignity Psychotherapy&quot; has on the bereavement experience of those
           family members/significant others taking part in this arm of the study protocol.

        -  To compare the bereavement experience of bereaved family members/significant others
           whose loved ones took part in any one of the three study conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must be at least 18 years of age (because of the nature of &quot;Dignity
             Psychotherapy,&quot; which presumes a relatively advanced level of social and psychological
             development).

          -  Have a terminal illness (Stage IV with a prognosis of less than 6 months, but expected
             to live at least 7 to 10 days, i.e. the average length of the protocol)

          -  Must be able to identify a family member/significant other who agrees to participate
             in the study (in the case of &quot;Dignity Psychotherapy,&quot; this family member/significant
             other will receive the generativity document)

          -  Be able to communicate with an English-speaking therapist (patients who are visually
             impaired will be offered assistance with the consent forms and surveys)

          -  In the investigator's judgement, participant is cognitively able to provide valid,
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant psychiatric disturbance sufficient to preclude participation in a
             psychotherapeutic intervention (e.g. acute, severe psychiatric symptoms which would
             require individual treatment and medication management rather than a psychotherapy
             intervention).

          -  Active psychotic mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, acute mania), or marked paranoid
             ideation. Patients who are on stable regimens of psychotropic medications (e.g.
             antidepressants for clinical depression) or who are in concurrent individual or group
             psychotherapy will not be excluded. This information regarding concurrent psychiatric
             treatment will be collected and utilized as a co-variate in data analysis.

          -  Presence of a cognitive disturbance (i.e. delirium or dementia) sufficient to preclude
             participation in psychotherapy, and/or data collection.

          -  Physical limitations or illness severity sufficient to preclude participation in
             psychotherapy
