    <textblock>
      This study enrolled men with prostate cancer who had failed hormone therapy (as shown by
      rising prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels) and who were about to start a new line of
      chemotherapy. Blood was drawn prior to the patient receiving chemotherapy and then monthly
      thereafter for up to 18 months or until disease progression, whichever occurred first. The
      blood was tested to find circulating tumor cells (CTC) and to count them. The circulating
      tumor cell levels were studied in relation to the patient's overall survival. Serum was also
      collected for PSA testing, and additional blood samples were drawn to test for circulating
      endothelial cells and RNA was isolated for future gene expression testing.
