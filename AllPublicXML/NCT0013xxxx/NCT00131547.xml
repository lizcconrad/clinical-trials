  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if weight loss interventions aimed at lifestyle
      modification (dietary education, food diary pedometer) result in weight loss in patients with
      mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) when compared to usual patient care. The
      secondary purpose of the study is to determine if the amount of weight loss achieved in a 6
      month period results in improvements in snoring and other symptoms and in the frequency of
      apnea on overnight monitoring.

      The purpose of the study is to determine if weight loss interventions aimed at lifestyle
      modification (dietary education, food diary pedometer) result in weight loss in patients with
      mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) when compared to usual patient care. The
      secondary purpose of the study is to determine if the amount of weight loss achieved in a 6
      month period results in improvements in snoring and other symptoms and in the frequency of
      apnea on overnight monitoring.

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine if weight loss interventions aimed at lifestyle modification (dietary
           education, food diary pedometer) result in weight loss in patients with mild-moderate
           OSA when compared to usual care.

        -  To determine if the amount of weight loss achieved in a 6 month period result in
           improvements in objective measures of sleep disordered breathing (AHI).

      Secondary Objective

        -  To determine if the weight loss achieved in 6 months result in improvements in OSA
           symptoms (e.g., snoring, sleepiness) and quality of life.

        -  To determine if metabolic parameters (e.g., lipids, glucose) improve.

        -  To determine if there is improvement in sleep structure and oxygenation during sleep.
