  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction. Lymphatic filariasis is a devastating mosquito-transmitted parasitic disease
      that causes lymphedema or elephantiasis of the leg in 15 million persons, the majority of
      whom are women. In these persons, frequent bacterial infections (&quot;acute attacks&quot;) of the legs
      adversely affect physical health, economic well-being, and quality of life. Prevention of
      bacterial infections through hygiene and skin care can result in significant improvements in
      lymphedema and patient well-being.

      Methods. To determine the extent to which antibacterial soap can help reduce the incidence of
      acute bacterial infections of the lower limbs in persons with filarial lymphedema, 200
      patients of the Ste. Croix Hospital lymphedema treatment clinic in Leogane, Haiti randomly
      assigned to receive either antibacterial (Safeguard) or placebo (Camay) soap and acute
      attacks monitored monthly for 12 months. Both groups received specific instructions on
      washing and skin care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for participation include those who are currently enrolled in the
        lymphedema treatment program in Leogane who 1) have been trained in the techniques of
        self-care, 2) who live in a 10-km radius of the hospital, and 3) for whom we have adequate
        data on incidence of acute bacterial infections, risk factors for infection, and ability to
        comply with the treatment protocol (particularly hygiene).

        Exclusion Criteria: Don't meet inclusion criteria.
