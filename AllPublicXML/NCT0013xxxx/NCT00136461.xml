  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the combination of all-trans retinoic
      acid in combination with one of two schedules of Bryostatin 1 in patients with myelodysplasia
      and acute myelogenous leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receive all-trans retinoic acid at a dose of 150 mg/m2/day and patients are
      randomized to one of two schedules of Bryostatin 1.

      Arm 1: Bryostatin 1 is administered at a dose of 60 mcg/m2 as a 30 minute intravenous (IV)
      infusion on days 8 and 22.

      Arm 2: Bryostatin 1 is administered at a dose of 40 mcg/m2 as a 72 hour IV infusion starting
      on days 8 and 22.

      Patients are assessed for response on day +50 with a bone marrow examination and patients
      with either a clinical response or stable disease receive further therapy.

      Bryostatin 1 pharmacokinetic samples are to be drawn on days 1, 8 and 50 of each cycle.
