  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine at which point in the dosing regime grass pollen
      immunotherapy causes a significant reduction in the late skin response to allergen challenge.
      A once weekly cluster regimen of 2 injections per visit was employed during the up-dosing
      phase, followed by monthly maintenance injections of 100,000 SQ units. Symptom scores and
      need of rescue medication were recorded by patients during the study period. The size of
      early and late cutaneous response to allergen challenge was recorded and measured by a
      physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single centre, randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trial of grass pollen
      injection immunotherapy (Alutard SQ, ALK Abello, Denmark) in adults with severe summer
      hayfever unresponsive to antihistamines and topical steroids. The main aim was to determine
      at which point in the dosing regime grass pollen immunotherapy causes a significant reduction
      in the late skin response to allergen challenge. A once weekly cluster regimen of 2
      injections per visit was employed during the up-dosing phase, followed by monthly maintenance
      injections of 100,000 SQ units. Twelve patients received active treatment (mean age 31, 7
      male) whilst 6 were given placebo (mean age 37, 2 male). The 24 hour skin response (size of
      swelling, (mm)) to intradermal allergen challenge (0.1, 1, 10 BU) was determined on alternate
      weeks during the 8 week up-dosing phase and then monthly up to 6 months and 3 monthly up to
      11-13 months following initiation of treatment.

      Results:

      At the end of the up-dosing phase (approximately 8 weeks) there was a significant reduction
      in the size of the late phase response which was evident with all three intradermal doses
      (p=0.02 for 0.1 &amp; 1 BU and p=0.04 for 10 BU). This reduction was sustained throughout the
      maintenance phase (p=0.04 for 0.1 BU and 0.01 for 1&amp; 10BU).

      Conclusion:

      The up-dosing phase of grass pollen immunotherapy alone is sufficient to dampen the late skin
      response to allergen challenge. Whether or not this may be predictive of the clinical
      response to immunotherapy remains to be determined.

          -  A clinical history of severe rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (interfering with usual
             daily activities or sleep), which remain troublesome despite treatment with
             anti-allergic drugs during the grass pollen season

          -  Positive Skin Prick Test (SPT) response (wheal diameter ≥ 3 mm) to Phleum pratense

          -  Positive specific IgE against Phleum pratense (≥ IgE Class 2)

          -  Physical examination with no clinically relevant findings
