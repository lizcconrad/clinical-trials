  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine
      is effective in treating patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

    <textblock>
      Patients will receive both gemcitabine and vinorelbine once a week for two weeks and then one
      week with no chemotherapy (1 cycle equals 21 days). Gemcitabine and vinorelbine will be
      administered on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle.

      Blood tests will be performed on each day chemotherapy is administered. A CT scan will be
      done after every 2 cycles (approximately every 6 weeks) to determine the effects of the
      chemotherapy on the sarcoma.

      A physical exam will be performed at the start of chemotherapy and at least every three weeks
      thereafter.

      Patients will remain on this study as long as the disease does not progress or there are no
      unacceptable side effects.
