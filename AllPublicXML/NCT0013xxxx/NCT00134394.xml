      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of etanercept 50 mg SQ weekly plus tacrolimus
      0.1% topical ointment twice daily compared to etanercept 50 mg SQ weekly plus placebo
      ointment twice daily. Subjects will be either beginning etanercept therapy or already using a
      stable dose of etanercept when they begin to apply tacrolimus to half of their body and
      placebo ointment to the other half. The study is double blinded. Total duration of the study
      is 12 weeks.
