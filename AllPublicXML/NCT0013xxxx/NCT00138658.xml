    <textblock>
      This clinical study will help determine if giving OGX-011 (custirsen sodium) in combination
      with gemcitabine (GEM) and cisplatin (CIS) or carboplatin (CARB) is a safe and effective
      treatment for patients with lung cancer. This study will help to assess the safety and
      anti-tumor effect of OGX-011 when given to patients in combination with GEM and CIS/CARB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OGX-011 is an experimental drug that has been shown to increase the effectiveness of commonly
      used cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapy in several kinds of
      cancer types in animals. OGX-011 is being studied in the treatment of cancer patients in
      combination with chemotherapy. In humans, OGX-011 in combination with hormone therapy has
      been shown to decrease the tissue levels of a protein called clusterin, which can be
      overproduced in cancer cells. Clusterin has been found to block cell death and makes cells
      more resistant to cancer therapy. Gemcitabine (GEM), cisplatin (CIS) and carboplatin (CARB)
      have been approved by Health Canada and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States
      for the treatment of patients with lung cancer.

      OGX-011 was administered as a 2-hr intravenous (IV) infusion on Days -7, -5, and -3 prior to
      Cycle 1, then weekly on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 21-day cycle; GEM was infused IV after OGX-011
      on Days 1 and 8; either CIS or CARB was infused IV after GEM on Day 1 of each cycle. Six
      cycles of treatment were planned. Most patients received OGX-011 at 640 mg, but 3 patients
      received OGX-011 at 480 mg dose; OGX-011 dose groups were combined due to the small number of
      patients who received 480 mg.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate of OGX-011 in Combination With Gemcitabine/Platinum-based Regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Based on assessments at baseline and after Cycles 2, 4, and 6. All subjects were followed for survival for a minimum of 3 years after the first dose of OGX-011 or until death.</time_frame>
    <description>Per RECIST Criteria V 1.0 and based on radiographic evaluations a subject was defined as having an objective response (OR) if the subject achieved either a confirmed partial response (PR) or confirmed complete response (CR).
The evaluations were conducted after every two cycles of treatment for a maximum of 6 cycles.
CR: disappearance of clinical/radiological evidence of tumor.
PR: &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.
SD: did not fulfill the criteria for CR or PR but not progressive disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>All subjects were followed for a minimum of 3 years after the first dose of OGX-011 or until death.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from first treatment with OGX-011 to documented evidence of disease progression or date of death. For subjects without disease progression based on RECIST who initiated subsequent anti-cancer therapy, date of progression was defined as date of initiating new cancer treatment. PFS was censored as of the date of first OGX-011 dose for subjects who failed to return for assessments after screening. For subjects who were still alive and without progressive disease at the time of data cut-off, PFS was censored at date of last disease assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>All subjects were followed for a minimum of 3 years after the first dose of OGX-011 or until death.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as time from date of first treatment with OGX-011 to the date of death from any cause. Overall survival was censored at date of last contact for subjects who were still alive at end of study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of OGX-011 on Serum Clusterin Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected at baseline and prior to infusion on Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the effect of OGX-011 on serum clusterin levels. The drug substance, OGX-011, is an antisense product designed to bind to clusterin mRNA, resulting in the inhibition of the production of human clusterin protein. Therefore, serum clusterin levels were expected to decrease.</description>

          <description>Custirsen sodium (OGX-011) was to be infused intravenously over 2 hours on Days -7, -5, and -3 of Cycle 1 (Pretreatment loading doses). OGX-011 was then to be infused for 2 hours weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-day cycle. Gemcitabine (GEM) was to be infused IV for 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 and either cisplatin (CIS) or carboplatin (CARBO) were to be infused IV on Day of the 21-day cycle. Patients were to receive a maximum of 6 cycles (1 cycle =21 days). Most patients received OGX-011 at 640 mg; but 3 patients received a 480 mg dose. The 2 dose groups were combined due to the small number of patients who received 480 mg. All patients who received at least one dose of OGX-011 were included in the Intent to Treat Analysis Set.</description>

          <description>The ECOG score is a performance status which attempts to quantify cancer patients' general well-being.
Grade 0=Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction.
Grade 1=Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work.
Grade 2=Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours.</description>

          <description>Patients enrolled in this study were required to be either Stage IIIB or Stage IV.
Stage IIIB lung cancer is defined as a tumor of any size that has spread to distant lymph nodes, has invaded other structures in the chest (such as the heart or esophagus), or has a malignant pleural effusion (fluid build-up containing cancer cells between the layers lining the lungs).
Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer is defined as a tumor of any size that has spread (metastasized) to another region of the body or to another lobe of the lungs.</description>

        <description>To measure the effect of OGX-011 on serum clusterin levels. The drug substance, OGX-011, is an antisense product designed to bind to clusterin mRNA, resulting in the inhibition of the production of human clusterin protein. Therefore, serum clusterin levels were expected to decrease.</description>
