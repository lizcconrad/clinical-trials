  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare one type of dressing against the current standard
      dressing that is used to cover an unburned area of the skin where a piece of skin is removed
      to cover another part of the body that was burned.

      Hypothesis: The mean healing time for wounds treated with the Silverlon Dressing will be less
      than the mean healing time for wounds treated with Xeroform Dressing.

      At the time of the procedure, donor sites that are symmetrical in size and shape will be
      selected. Once the grafts have been harvested, the wounds will be randomized for treatment
      using either the Silverlon dressing or Xeroform. The wound dressings will then be observed at
      least once a day beginning 72 hours after surgery until healed, defined as 90% or more of the
      wound surface being confluently re-epithelized.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older; male or female.

          -  Burn wounds of less than 30% total body surface area (TBSA) with no systemic
             abnormalities

          -  Burns do not involve the harvesting area

          -  Burn wounds require excision and grating of sufficient extent to justify two donor
             sites of equal and symmetrical size on non-dependent body surface areas

          -  Scheduled excision and grafting procedures is the first such operation for subject
             during this hospitalization

          -  Subject agrees to participate in follow-up evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Critical illnesses requiring ventilator support, systemic infection or hemodynamic
             instability

          -  Major acute or chronic illnesses affecting wound healing (e.g. peripheral vascular
             disease, insulin dependent diabetes, blood clotting disorder)

          -  Subject receiving medications that inhibit/compromise wound healing (e.g.
             anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, oral steroids). The use of anticoagulants does not
             include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

          -  Cellulitis or other infection of potential donor site

          -  Previously harvested donor site

          -  Subject with greater than 30% TBSA burns

          -  Subjects with sensitivity to silver or nylon

          -  Pregnancy
