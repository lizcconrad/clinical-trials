  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more general practitioners (GPs) use spirometry in their practices. At this time,
      there is sufficient reason to presume that, after a single postgraduate training program
      without any further support, most GPs have insufficient knowledge and ability to assure valid
      interpretation of their spirometry tests. Therefore, some kind of continuous diagnostic
      support with regard to spirometry interpretation by GPs is advisable. The aim of the present
      study is to assess whether implementation of spirometry expert support (either by a
      computerised expert system or a working agreement between general practitioners and
      respiratory consultants with respect to spirometry interpretation) causes changes in
      diagnosing and appropriateness and efficiency of medical care in subjects with chronic
      respiratory morbidity managed in general practice.

      More and more general practitioners (GPs) use spirometry in their practices. At this time,
      there is sufficient reason to presume that, after a single postgraduate training program
      without any further support, most GPs have insufficient knowledge and ability to assure valid
      interpretation of their spirometry tests. Therefore, some kind of continuous diagnostic
      support with regard to spirometry interpretation by GPs is advisable. The problem formulation
      for the study proposed is: &quot;Does implementation of spirometry expert support (either by a
      computerized expert system or a local working agreement between GPs and respiratory
      consultants with respect to spirometry interpretation) cause changes in diagnosing and
      quality and efficiency of medical care in subjects with chronic respiratory morbidity managed
      in general practice?”. In order to address this issue, two separate studies with different
      designs are proposed. Study I (n=62 GPs) is an ‘in-depth’ study of the GPs‘ decision-making
      process with regard to spirometry, and the impact of a computerized expert system on this
      process. Study II (n=39 general practices) is a pragmatic randomised-controlled
      implementation study evaluating two realistic modes of spirometry expert support (i.e., a
      computerized expert system or a working agreement between GPs and respiratory consultants).
