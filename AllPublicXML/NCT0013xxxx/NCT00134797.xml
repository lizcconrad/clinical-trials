  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of an estimate value of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) per Modification of
      Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] (LEVEY) equation is being included and reported on all routine
      chemistry panels in the experimental group. The control group is only having serum
      creatinine, the current standard of care, reported on routine chemistry panels.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients already referred to or being followed by nephrologists were excluded. Inclusion
      criteria were all patients in the Internal Medicine clinic at NMCSD who were sent to the lab
      to obtain routine chemistry panels for follow up by their primary care providers. The primary
      outcome is increased referral to nephrology in accordance with NKF K/DOQI guidelines if GFR
      values are reported on routine chemistry panels. Key secondary outcomes are Primary Care
      Provider knowledge of NKF K/DOQI guidelines, specifically when patients with chronic kidney
      disease need to be referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation.
