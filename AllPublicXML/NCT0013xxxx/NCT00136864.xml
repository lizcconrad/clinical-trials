  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC, (Stage III) is potentially curable with
      aggressive combined modality therapy (chemotherapy and radiation). Conventional imaging can
      only evaluate gross anatomic abnormalities but functional imaging with positron emission
      tomography (PET) may more accurately identify patients who will benefit from aggressive
      combined modality therapy.

      This prospective randomized clinical trial will enroll 400 patients that have undergone
      conventional staging for lung cancer and have been found to have Stage III NSCLC. The
      patients will then be randomized to either standard combined modality therapy for Stage III
      NSCLC or to PET imaging prior to combined modality therapy with curative intent. Based on the
      PET findings, patients will either be suitable for combined modality therapy with curative
      intent or not.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological evidence of NSCLC. Must have documented pathology report
             with histology indicated (e.g. squamous, adenocarcinoma, large cell, NSCLC not
             otherwise specified).

          -  Stage III (mediastinal node positive) NSCLC based on conventional staging (e.g.
             computed tomography [CT] scan of chest and upper abdomen, CT or magnetic resonance
             imaging [MRI] of brain, bone scan).

          -  Suitable for combined modality (chemotherapy and radiation) therapy or radical
             radiation therapy or trimodality therapy (chemotherapy, radiation and surgery).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stage IV NSCLC (by conventional staging).

          -  Small cell lung cancer.

          -  Poor performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 3-4.

          -  Poor pulmonary function precluding radical radiation therapy (Adequate pulmonary
             reserve for radical radiation therapy. Pulmonary function tests should have forced
             expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt; 1.0 liter or &gt; 40% predicted, diffusing
             capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt; 45% and/or predicted contralateral
             FEV1 &gt; 800 cc based on quantitative ventilation perfusion lung scan).

          -  Significant concurrent medical problems (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, active cardiac
             problems, significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

          -  Insulin dependent diabetic where requirements for PET imaging may be problematic.

          -  Unable to lie supine for at least 30 minutes in radiation treatment position for
             imaging with PET.

          -  Failure to provide informed consent.

          -  Previous PET scan relating to recent cancer diagnosis prior to entry into study.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Prior thoracic radiation.

          -  Prior malignancy within 3 years from randomization (except nonmelanotic skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix).

          -  Administered more than two cycles of chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy
             or concurrent chemoradiation (as part of induction or sequential chemotherapy prior to
             randomization) for the current malignancy.
