      The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the interrelationships between
      health status and measures of cardiac performance in children 6 to 18 years of age with
      congenital heart disease who have undergone a Fontan procedure as surgical treatment for
      functional single ventricle. The goal was to develop a data set that will permit
      identification of a clinically relevant endpoint for subsequent trials of medical management
      of the Fontan patient.

      BACKGROUND:

      Children born with one functional ventricle and who undergo a Fontan procedure, have a higher
      incidence of late complications than other congenital heart patients. While the Fontan
      procedure results in restoring near-normal systemic oxygen saturation, there are recognized
      problems and little information about the overall health status, functional status and
      ventricular performance in these children.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This cross-sectional observational study included children 6-18 years of age who had
      undergone a Fontan procedure for a congenital cardiac defect. Prospective data collection for
      each patient occured within a 3 month time period and included cardiac MRI, echocardiography,
      serology and exercise testing. Historical clinical and surgical data, as well as parent and
      child self reports of health status, was collected.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Age 6 through 18 years at the time of enrollment.

          -  Fontan surgery of any type at least 6 months prior to the time of testing.

          -  Agreement and ability to have all of the following testing completed:

               1. An echocardiogram at the study center,

               2. Parent health status questionnaire, and

               3. Blood testing.

          -  Planned or ongoing cardiac care at the study center that will allow completion of
             study testing within 3 months of study enrollment.

          -  Informed consent of a parent or guardian, and assent of the study participant if
             he/she is able to provide it, according to institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Non-cardiac medical or psychiatric disorder that would prevent successful completion
             of planned study testing or would invalidate the results of study testing.

          -  Ongoing or planned participation in another research protocol that would either
             prevent successful completion of planned study testing or invalidate the results of
             study testing.

          -  Lack of reading fluency by the primary caregiver in both English and Spanish,
             languages for which the parental report health status questionnaire has been
             validated.

          -  Pregnancy at the time of enrollment or pregnancy planned prior to completion of study
             testing.
