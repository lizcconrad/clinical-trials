  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surveys suggest that up to 80% of veterans with a persistent mental illness have a
      co-occurring substance use disorder. Substance abuse among this population is problematic and
      often results in poor engagement in treatment and thus, frequent hospitalizations and an
      unstable illness course. Regarding treatment engagement, data from a VA New Jersey facility
      indicated that 50% of those veterans discharged from the acute psychiatric hospital unit to
      outpatient care did not attend their initial screening appointment and another 30% dropped
      out within six weeks. To assist with the transition from inpatient to outpatient care, we
      previously developed an eight-week augmentation intervention entitled, Time-Limited Case
      Management (TLC). TLC integrates evidence-based interventions of 1) Dual Recovery Therapy; 2)
      Critical Time Intervention Case Management along with 3) Peer Support with the goal of
      assisting individuals with the transition from inpatient to outpatient care.

      This study involved a randomized attention controlled trial of 102 individuals recruited on
      the inpatient psychiatry service at the New Jersey VA with a substance abuse disorder and a
      severe and persistent mental illness. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two
      conditions: 1) treatment-as-usual in inpatient and outpatient services plus 8 weeks of Time
      Limited Care-Coordination (TLC), a brief linkage augmentation intervention or 2)
      treatment-as-usual along with 8 weeks of matched attention in the form of health education
      sessions (TAU+A). The data analytic plan included descriptive and advanced statistical
      analysis.

      Objective # 1: To determine whether those in TLC have better attendance in inpatient sessions
      compared to those receiving Treatment-As-Usual Plus Attention (TAU+A).

      Objective # 2: To determine whether those in TLC have better attendance in outpatient
      sessions compared to those receiving Treatment-As-Usual Plus Attention (TAU+A).

      Objective # 3: To determine whether TLC, compared to Treatment-As-Usual Plus Attention
      (TAU+A) reduces rehospitalizations and has an effect on the use of the Emergency Room use.

      Objective # 4: To determine whether TLC achieves a reduction in drug usage and related
      problems as compared to those receiving TAU+A.

      A total of 102 veterans were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) Time Limited
      Care-Coordination (TLC), an eight-week co-occurring disorders intervention or (2) Treatment
      As Usual + Matched Attention (TAU+A) control condition in the form of health education
      sessions. However, both groups also received treatment as usual in inpatient and outpatient
      settings.
