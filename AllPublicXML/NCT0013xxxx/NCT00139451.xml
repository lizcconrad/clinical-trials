  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if patients with constitutional delay of growth have
      a mismatch between energy intake and utilization (as measured by doubly labeled water) and to
      compare the improvement in growth and energy balance between a group of boys treated with
      growth hormone (GH) alone versus those given GH plus added nutritional supplements for one
      year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of boys 7-10 years old who are very short and below average in weight but
      otherwise healthy will be studied. One group will be observed initially for 6 months and then
      receive GH injections every day for the subsequent 12 months. Another group of boys will get
      a high-calorie drink every day for 6 months, and then receive GH injections plus the
      supplement every day for the next 12 months. We will compare how well boys grow in height,
      weight and the changes in body composition. We will compare diet and energy usage using the
      doubly labeled water technique. A battery of hormonal and nutritional tests will be
      performed, as well as body composition assessment.

    <description>With the assistance of a research dietician, we will prescribe and monitor the use of a liquid food supplement (Pediasure). Adjustments to the supplementation will be made based on weight measurements in the clinic with subjects wearing paper gowns at 2 and 4w, and monthly thereafter, and repeat dietary intake and TEE assessment at 6 and 12mo.</description>
