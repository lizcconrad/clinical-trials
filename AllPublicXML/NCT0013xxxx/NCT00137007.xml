  <official_title>A Multicenter, Open Label Trial Evaluating Intravenous Azithromycin Plus Intravenous Ampicillin/Sulbactam Followed by Oral Azithromycin Plus Intravenous Ampicillin/Sulbactam for the Treatment of Hospitalized Subjects With Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intravenous (IV) regimen containing azithromycin (Zithromax) plus ampicillin-sulbactam is
      consistent with current guidelines for the treatment of CAP. In fact the International
      guidelines for the treatment of CAP in hospitalised patients suggests the use of a
      combination between a b-lactam and a macrolide.

      This trial will allow investigators to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin plus
      ampicillin-sulbactam in the treatment of hospitalized subjects with community acquired
      pneumonia. In addition, this trial will allow investigators to evaluate the safety and
      toleration of combination therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must require hospitalization and intravenous therapy.

          -  Subjects must have a Fine pneumonia score &gt; 70 (Fine Class &gt; II).

          -  Subjects must have a medical history and clinical and radiological findings consistent
             with a community-acquired bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia. The following criteria
             must be met:

               -  new infiltrate(s) on chest X-ray; AND

               -  at least two of the CAP signs or symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any systemic antibiotic for 24 hours or longer within 72 hours of the
             baseline visit, or treatment for more than 7 days within 15 days.

          -  Specific systemic diseases or other medical conditions that would interfere with the
             evaluation of the therapeutic response or safety of the study drug, including:

               -  Known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or suspected Pneumocystis carinii
                  pneumonia;

               -  Neutropenia;

               -  Cavitary lung disease by chest X-ray;

               -  Primary lung cancer or other malignancy metastatic to the lung;

               -  Aspiration pneumonia;

               -  Empyema;

               -  Known or suspected tuberculosis;

               -  Neoplastic disease;

               -  Cystic fibrosis;

               -  DDM;

               -  Bronchiectasis, bronchial obstruction or history of post-obstructive pneumonia
                  (this does not exclude patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease);

               -  Significant gastrointestinal or other conditions which may affect study drug
                  absorption; and

               -  Significant cardiovascular disorders.

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy, defined as chronic treatment with known immunosuppressant
             medications

          -  Impaired hepatic function, as shown by, but not limited to, AST, (SGOT), or ALT (SGPT)
             greater than three times the laboratory upper limit of normal, or total bilirubin
             greater than two times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Subjects already hospitalized or who resided in a long-term-care facility for greater
