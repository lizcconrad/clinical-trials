        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have persistent post cataract extraction macular edema whose condition is stable

          -  Have no change in medication regimen of immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents;

             randomization

          -  Have at least one eligible eye to be treated in the study

          -  Have an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan with a qualifying retinal thickness in
             the study eye

          -  Have macular edema confirmed by fluorescein angiography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have proliferative vitreoretinopathy greater than grade B in either eye

          -  Have ocular disorders in the study eye that may confound interpretation of study
             results

          -  Have ophthalmic disorders in the study eye that may influence final visual acuity
             and/or fluorescein angiography interpretation

          -  Have had cataract surgery in the study eye in the past 2 months, YAG laser capsulotomy
             within the past 1 month, or any other intraocular surgery within the past 90 days

          -  Have uncontrollable elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or advanced glaucoma

          -  Have had any periocular or intravitreal injection of corticosteroids in the study eye
             within 3 months

          -  Have had any ocular implant device for the delivery of therapeutic agents

          -  Be taking any excluded medications that could obscure or confound study results
