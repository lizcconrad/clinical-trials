  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if 1 course of antibiotic treatment with
      telithromycin is superior to azithromycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract
      infections (LRTIs), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) and community-acquired
      pneumonia (CAP) in the community setting.

        Subjects of Reproductive Potential:

        Women of childbearing potential may participate in the study only if the following

          -  Had a normal menstrual flow ≤ 1 month before study entry

          -  Has a negative pregnancy test (serum β-subunit hCG) immediately before study entry
             (ie, before the start of treatment or any other study procedure that could potentially
             harm the fetus). If obtaining the serum pregnancy test result will cause a delay in
             treatment, a subject may be entered on the basis of a negative urine pregnancy test
             sensitive to at least 50 mU/mL, pending results of the serum pregnancy test.
             Subsequently, if the result of the serum test is positive, the subject must be
             discontinued from study drug, and every attempt must be made to follow such subjects
             to term.

          -  Must agree to use an accepted method of contraception (ie, oral or implanted
             contraceptive with a barrier method; spermicide and barrier methods; or intrauterine
             device). The subject must agree to continue with the same method throughout the study.
