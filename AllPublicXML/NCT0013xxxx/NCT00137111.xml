  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to estimate the overall event-free survival of children at least one
      year of age at diagnosis who are treated with risk-directed therapy and to monitor the
      molecular remission induction rate.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These are the following secondary objectives:

        -  To determine if CNS irradiation can be safely omitted in the context of the systemic
           therapy used in the protocol.

        -  To identify whether prolonged (24 hour) intravenous infusions of HDMTX produce greater
           methotrexate polyglutamate (MTXPG) accumulation than short (4 hour) infusions 42 hours
           after 1 gm/m2 of HDMTX, stratified for lineage (T- vs B-lineage) and ploidy
           (hyperdiploid vs non-hyperdiploid B-lineage).

        -  To determine whether prolonged (24 hour) intravenous infusions of HDMTX produce greater
           antileukemic effects than short (4 hour) infusions, based on the inhibition of de novo
           purine synthesis in bone marrow blasts and the decrease in circulating blasts during the
           4 day &quot;window&quot; prior to initiation of conventional remission induction therapy.

        -  MRD

        -  Other exploratory objectives

      Details of Treatment Plan

      Treatment will consist of three main phases, Remission Induction, Consolidation, and
      Continuation. Treatment with an Upfront HDMTX Window for research purposes will be optional.

      All patients will receive IT therapy on day 1, dose is age dependent.

      Upfront High-Dose Methotrexate Window

      HDMTX (1 g/m2) as a 4 hour infusion versus as a 24 hour infusion. Leucovorin rescue will be
      given.

      Remission Induction

      Prednisone 40 mg/m2/day PO Days 5 - 32 Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/week IV Days 5, 12, 19, 26
      Daunorubicin 25 mg/m2/week IV Days 5, 12 L-asparaginase 10,000 Unit/m2/dose IM Days 6, 8, 10,
      12, 14, 16 (19, 21, 23) Cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2/dose IV Day 26 Cytarabine 75 mg/m2/dose
      IV Days 27-30, 34-37 6-Mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2/dose PO Days 26-39 Imatinib 40 mg/m2 bid for
      Ph positive patients starting Day 22 of induction. Intrathecal therapy will be administered
      on day 1 and 19, dose age dependent. Patients with high risk of CNS relapse will receive
      additional IT treatments on days 8 and 26.

      Consolidation Treatment

      High dose methotrexate targeted dose depending on risk status, days 1, 15, 29, and 43 and
      mercaptopurine 50 mg/m2/day, days 1-56.

      Reintensification treatment for patients with high risk disease:

      Patients with high risk disease will be offered the option of hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) and may receive an additional 1-2 cycles of reintensification treatment
      prior to maximize the anti-leukemic kill before transplant.

      Dexamethasone 20 mg/m2 PO days 1-3 Cytarabine 2 g/m2 IV x 4 doses, days 3-5 Etoposide 100

      The same treatment (weeks 21-28) will be repeated for a total of 6 times (until week 68).
      After week 68, all patients will receive daily 6MP and weekly MTX with pulses of
      dexamethasone and vincristine every 4 weeks until week 100, after which only 6MP and
      methotrexate will be given. Intrathecal treatment will be given every 8 weeks only to
      patients at high risk of CNS relapse after week 48 and will be discontinued after week 96.
      Continuation therapy will be discontinued after 120 weeks in girls and after 146 weeks in
      boys

      Patients who meet the criteria of high-risk ALL are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation. However, if the option is declined by the patients or guardians,
      or the procedure is deemed unsuitable by the attending physician and the principal
      investigator, the patient will remain on study and continue to receive chemotherapy
