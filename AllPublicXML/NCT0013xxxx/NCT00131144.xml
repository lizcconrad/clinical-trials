  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common ocular disease in patients with diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, is present in
      approximately 40% of diabetic patients; about 8% of diabetic patients have vision threatening
      diabetic retinopathy. Although intensive control of blood glucose has been shown to reduce
      the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy, intensive control of glucose is
      usually not achieved in clinical practice.
