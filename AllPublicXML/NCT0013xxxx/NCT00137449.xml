    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathologically proven diagnosis of malignant GIST that was not amenable to
             standard therapy.

          -  Failed prior treatment with imatinib mesylate, defined either by progression of
             disease (according to Response Evaluation Criterion in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or World
             Health Organization (WHO) criteria), or by significant toxicity during treatment with
             imatinib mesylate that precluded further treatment. Intolerance to prior imatinib
             mesylate therapy was defined as follows:

          -  Life-threatening adverse events (ie, Grade 4) at any dose (attempt to dose reduce or
             rechallenge not required) or Unacceptable toxicity induced by a moderate dose (eg, 400
             mg/day), specifically, Grade 2 toxicity that was unacceptable to the patient (such as
             nausea) that persisted despite standard countermeasures

          -  Evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment on a SU011248 clinical trial.

          -  Diagnosis of any second malignancy within the last 3 years, except basal cell
             carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ carcinoma, that had been adequately
             treated with no evidence of recurrent disease for 12 months.

          -  History of or known brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous
             meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Any of the following within the 12 months prior to starting the study treatment:
             myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass
             graft, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic
             attack, or pulmonary embolism.

          -  Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of grade 2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or QTc
             interval &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for females.

          -  Hypertension that could not be controlled by medications (&gt;150/100 mm/Hg despite
             optimal medical therapy).
