    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the proportion of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      subjects on dialysis receiving Sensipar® and low dose vitamin D or escalating doses of
      vitamin D alone who are able to achieve the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease
      Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI) secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) treatment
      targets for both biointact parathyroid hormone (biPTH) and calcium-phosphorus (Ca x P)
      product.

        Inclusion Criteria: - On hemodialysis for at least 3 months and have received intravenous
        vitamin D therapy (paricalcitol or doxercalciferol) for at least 3 months prior to entering
        screening - Historical iPTH 150-800 pg/ml (or biPTH 80-430 pg/ml) within 6 months and
        corrected serum Ca greater than 8.4 mg/dl within 2 months prior to screening period. For
        subjects with biPTH 80-160 pg/ml (iPTH 150-300 pg/ml), Ca x P must be greater than 55
        mg²/dl² within 2 months prior to the screening period - Screening (pre-washout) biPTH
        80-430 pg/ml and a corrected serum Ca level greater than 8.4 mg/dl. For subjects with biPTH
        80-160 pg/ml Ca x P must be also greater than 55 mg²/dl² - Baseline mean biPTH
        (post-washout) greater than 160 pg/ml and mean corrected Ca greater than 8.4 mg/dl
        Exclusion Criteria: - Parathyroidectomy in the 3 month period prior to screening - Current
        gastrointestinal disorder that may be associated with impaired absorption of orally
        administered medications or an inability to swallow tablets - Use of investigational drug
        or device or participation in a trial of investigational drug or device within 30 days of
        screening - Females of child bearing potential who are pregnant (e.g., positive pregnancy
        test) or are breast feeding or who refuse to use highly effective contraceptive measures
        (as determined by the investigator) throughout the study - Previously participated in this
        or any other Sensipar® study or has received or is receiving Sensipar® as a commercially
        available product
