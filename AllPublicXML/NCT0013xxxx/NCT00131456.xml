      The purpose of this study is to determine if Venlafaxine Extended Release (Ven-XR) is
      effective in treating individuals with marijuana addiction and depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that depression and marijuana addiction often occur together, medications to treat
      individuals diagnosed with both conditions may be effective. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effectiveness of Ven-XR in treating individuals diagnosed with depression and
      marijuana addiction.

      During this twelve-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, study visits will occur
      twice each week. During study visits, participants will receive either placebo or medication
      and provide a urine sample for drug screening. Blood tests will be collected each month and
      women must take pregnancy tests each month. Throughout the study, all participants will
      receive individualized psychotherapy sessions. At each study visit, participants will be
      given $5 to cover transportation costs.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted from January 2004 through September 2010. Treatment seekers for problems related to marijuana use were recruited by local advertising or clinical referrals. Participants were treated at Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute or at Columbia University/North Shore-LIJ Medical Center.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial included a one-week placebo lead-in. Placebo responders during the placebo lead in (N = 7), defined as a Clinical Global Impression rating of 1 or 2 and a reduction in the Hamilton Depression score &gt; 75% or total score ≤ 7, were not randomized. Additionally, 13 participants were lost to follow-up so a total of 103 were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Two Consecutive Weeks of Marijuana Abstinence</title>
          <description>The primary outcome measure for marijuana use was a dichotomous abstinence response,defined as at least two consecutive urine-confirmed abstinent weeks. Each week during the study, subjects were scored as urine-confirmed abstinent if both self-reported marijuana use for that week was negative, according to the quantitative substance use daily inventory (Timeline FollowBack), and all urines collected for that week were negative for THC. Patients who achieved the two consecutive abstinent weeks were classified as abstinent whether or not they subsequently dropped out of the study. Patients who dropped out of the study without achieving two continuous weeks of abstinence were classified as not abstinent.</description>

            <groups_desc>Logistic regression was used to analyze all dichotomous outcomes. The dichotomous primary outcome marijuana abstinence was modeled using independent predictors: treatment(Venlafaxine vs. Placebo) and baseline urine THC level. The initial analysis included an interaction between treatment and baseline urine THC levels which was deemed not significant and omitted from the final logistic model.</groups_desc>
