    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Sirolimus
      eluting Cypher Select(TM) stent in reducing angiographic in-stent late loss in de novo native
      coronary lesions as compared to the TAXUS(TM) Paclitaxel-eluting stent in patients presenting
      with two or more coronary artery stenoses (prospective, randomized, intra-individual
      comparison).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, 2 arm, randomized, multicenter Phase III study (6 centers).

      A total of 110 patients with at least two de novo native coronary artery lesions (lesion A,
      lesion B) ≤ 30 mm in length and ≥ 2.25 mm to &lt; 3.0 mm in diameter by visual estimate will be
      enrolled. Patients will be randomized for implantation of the sirolimus eluting Cypher
      Select(TM) Balloon-Expandable Stent or to the TAXUS(TM) Paclitaxel-eluting stent for lesion A
      and B.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must be &gt;=18 and &lt;=85 years of age

          -  Female of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of
             enrolment and utilize reliable birth control for the duration of their participation
             in the trial

          -  Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald
             Classification B&amp;C, I-II-III) and documented ischemia OR patients with documented
             silent ischemia

          -  Two or more de novo lesions &lt; 30 mm in length (visual estimate)

          -  Target vessel at lesion site is ≥ 2.25 mm and ≤ 3.0 mm in diameter (visual estimate)

          -  Target lesion is located in a native coronary artery which can be covered by one stent
             (single lesion)

          -  Acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG)

          -  Target lesion stenosis is &gt; 50% and &lt; 100% (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction
             [TIMI] 1) (visual estimate)

          -  Target lesions do not differ in length for more than 6 mm

          -  Patient is willing to comply with the specified follow-up evaluation

          -  Patient must provide written informed consent prior to the procedure using a form that
             is approved by the local Ethics Committee

             and CK-MB enzymes are back to normal

          -  Unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;= 50% stenosis

          -  Impaired runoff in the treatment vessel with diffuse distal disease

          -  Target lesion involves bifurcation including a side branch &gt;= 2.5 mm in diameter
             (either stenosis of both main vessel and major branch or stenosis of just major
             branch) that would require side branch stenting which is likely to occur if side
             branch is diseased and intended to be stented

          -  Prior stent within 5 mm of target lesion this includes in-stent restenosis

          -  Significant (&gt; 50%) untreated stenoses proximal or distal to the target lesion that
             will not be treated during the procedure and may require revascularization or impede
             runoff

          -  Intervention of another lesion has occurred within one month before or is planned or
             highly probable to be performed within the next 30 days after this index procedure

          -  Any significant medical condition which in the investigator's opinion may interfere
             with the patient's optimal participation in the study

          -  Target lesion located in an arterial or venous by-pass graft
