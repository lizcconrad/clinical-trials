  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare a low versus high intensity physiotherapy early
      rehabilitation program combined with a low versus high dose vitamin D early rehabilitation
      program in a randomized controlled trial among elderly patients with acute hip fracture in an
      acute care setting. The primary outcome to be compared between treatment arms is the rate of
      falls during a 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are injurious falls, number of persons
      who fell, low-trauma fractures (at the hip, forearm, humerus, pelvis, ankle, spine, femur,
      tibia), disability, quality of life (Euro-Qol), mortality and health care utilization.
      Another secondary outcome will be admission to nursing home compared between treatment arms
      among subjects, who are community-dwelling prior to the index hip fracture. Admission to
      nursing home is the marker of loss of independence for the individual, but also triggers high
      cost for the society.

      The study will provide new early rehabilitation guidelines to allocate health care resources
      efficiently in the acute care setting. Eventually and most importantly, the study will help
      improve outcomes in patients with hip fractures.

      Subjects:

      The researchers will enroll 204 elderly subjects (men and women) admitted to two large
      hospital centers with acute hip fracture. Subjects may be institutionalized or
      community-dwelling prior to admission. To be enrolled in the study subjects need to be 65
      years or older. Demented persons, who reach a Folstein Mini Mental Status of less than 15 are
      excluded.

      Design:

      Once written informed consent from participants or proxies is given, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to 4 different program combinations based on a 2X2 factorial design: (1)
      low dose vitamin D / low intensity physiotherapy; or (2) low dose vitamin D / high intensity
      physiotherapy; or (3) high dose vitamin D / low intensity physiotherapy; or (4) high dose
      vitamin D / high intensity physiotherapy. Low dose Vitamin D is 800 IU cholecalciferol per
      day and high dose vitamin D is 2000 IU cholecalciferol per day.

      Subjects will be recruited within 5 days after hip fracture surgery and followed for adverse
      outcomes over a 12-month period. Dose of vitamin D will be double-blinded.
