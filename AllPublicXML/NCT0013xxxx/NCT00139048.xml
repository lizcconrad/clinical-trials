    <textblock>
      Women who access the website, are aged between 38-45 years and are considering screening
      mammograms will be randomized to either the Decision Aid (a booklet providing information and
      exercises to help them to make a decision about whether to having screening mammograms) group
      or the Control Group. The Decision Aid group will first read the decision aid, and then will
      be asked some demographic and knowledge questions. The control group will be asked the
      demographic and knowledge questions only. The control group will have access to the Decision
      Aid after they have completed the questions
