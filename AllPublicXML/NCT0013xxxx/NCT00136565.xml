  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and the safety profile and toxicity of
      a combination of Velcade™ (bortezomib) with a standard chemotherapy regimen (ACVBP
      [doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisone]) in the treatment of
      previously untreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, open-label, non-randomized, non-competitive clinical study,
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of V-ACVBP chemotherapy in previously untreated patients
      aged from 18 to 65 years with peripheral T-lymphoma.

      It is anticipated that 60 subjects will be enrolled over two years (from June 2005 to May
      2007).

      The duration of the treatment period is approximately 28 weeks and patients are followed
      until death.

      The total duration of the study is expected to be 5 years (from June 2005 to May 2010).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  B-cell lymphoma or other subtype of T-cell lymphoma including anaplastic large cell
             lymphoma AKL(+), lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

          -  Any previous therapy for lymphoma except for short-term corticosteroids before
