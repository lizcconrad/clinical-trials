  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for patients with resectable, locally advanced esophageal cancer. There is
      evidence to suggest that celecoxib in combination with cisplatin and irinotecan (CPT-11) may
      work well with radiation therapy to kill cancer cells. The primary goal is to develop a
      well-tolerated cancer treatment that has an acceptable response rate.

      Patients will take celecoxib orally twice daily 3 days prior to radiation therapy and until
      one week prior to surgery. Celecoxib will then be restarted when the patient is discharged
      from the hospital following surgery and continued for 26 weeks.

      Patients will receive chemotherapy (cisplatin and irinotecan) weekly on weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5
      during radiation therapy. Chemotherapy must occur on or before the fifth day of radiation
      therapy.

      Radiation therapy will be performed 5 days a week over a 5.6 week period.

      Patients will undergo an esophagectomy within 4-8 weeks of chemotherapy/radiation therapy.
      Technically accessible lymph nodes will also be removed.

      During chemotherapy/radiation therapy, a physical exam and bloodwork will be conducted
      weekly.

      Between chemotherapy/radiation therapy and surgery a physical exam, bloodwork and CT of
      chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed.

      After the completion of treatment and surgery, a physical exam and bloodwork should be done
      every 6 weeks for 6 months, then every 3 months for 1 1/2 years, then every 6 months for 3
      years.

             gastroesophageal junction, histologically confirmed, American Joint Committee on
             Cancer (AJCC) Stage IIA, IIB, III. Additionally, patients with tumors of the lower
             thoracic esophagus and gastroesophageal junction may have regional lymph node
             involvement (M1A-Stage IVA), as long as the lymphadenopathy can be entirely
             encompassed by the radiation field.
