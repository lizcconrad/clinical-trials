  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents Matter is a community-based project whose goal it is to develop and test an
      intervention designed to promote effective parent-child communication about sexuality in
      order to promote sexual health among adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the intervention are African American parents or guardians who have children
      in the 4th or 5th grade that are 12 or younger. Recruitment was done through schools, housing
      authorities, community based organizations, and churches. Participants were randomly assigned
      to participate in one of three interventions delivered by community based interventionists.
      The enhanced sexuality communication intervention consists of five 2.5 hour sessions
      conducted over 5 weeks with booster sessions at 12 and 24 months post-intervention. The full
      sexual communication intervention focuses on general parenting skills and sexual
      communication skills using a variety of presentation modalities: group discussion, video, and
      role-plays. The brief sexual communication intervention consists of a single 2.5 hour session
      in which parents are provided with information on general parenting skills and sexual
      communication skills. Thus, this intervention seeks to provide the same information as the
      full sexual communication intervention but in a condensed format with little group
      participation. The control intervention is a single 2.5 hour session focusing on general
      child health issues such as diet and exercise rather than parenting and sexual communication.
