  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of grass pollen immunotherapy on
      symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and quality of life in seasonal rhinitis and asthma.
      Hay fever symptoms and medication use, health-related quality of life, and measurements of
      non-specific bronchial responsiveness were recorded during the study period.

      This was a single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study.
      The main aim of this study was to assess the effects of grass pollen immunotherapy on
      symptoms, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and quality of life in seasonal rhinitis and asthma.
      Forty-four patients with severe summer hay fever (of whom 36 reported seasonal chest symptoms
      and 28 had seasonal bronchial hyperresponsiveness) participated in a randomised double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study. After symptom monitoring for one summer,
      participants matched placebo injections (n=22) in a rapid up-dosing cluster regimen for 4
      weeks, followed by monthly injections for 2 years. Outcome measures included hay fever
      symptoms and medication use, health-related quality of life, and measurements of non-specific
      bronchial responsiveness.

      Results: Significant reductions were observed in immunotherapy group compared with the
      placebo group in hay fever symptoms (49%, 15%: P = 0.1), medication scores (80%, 18%;
      P=.007), and seasonal chest symptoms (90%, 11%; P &lt; .05). Impairment of overall quality of
      life (mean score of 7 domains) during the pollen season was less in the immunotherapy group
      than in the placebo group (median difference [95% CI], 0.8 [0.18-1.5]; P=.05=2]. During the
      pollen season, there was no change in airway methacholine PC20 (provocation concentration
      producing a 20% fall in FEV1) in the immunotherapy-treated group (P=5), compared with an
      almost 3 doubling-dose decrease in the placebo-treated group (P=.5), compared with an almost
      3 doubling dose decrease in the placebo-treated group (P=.01, between-group difference).
      There were no significant local or systemic side effects during the study.

      Conclusion: Grass pollen immunotherapy improves quality of life in seasonal allergic rhinitis
      and reduces seasonal asthma symptoms and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

          -  A clinical history of grass pollen induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis of two years
             or more requiring treatment during the grass pollen season

          -  A clinical history of severe rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (interfering with usual
             daily activities or sleep), which remain troublesome despite treatment with
             anti-allergic drugs during the grass pollen season

          -  Positive Skin Prick Test (SPT) response (wheal diameter ≥ 5 mm) to Phleum pratense

          -  Positive specific IgE against Phleum pratense (≥ IgE Class 2)

          -  Physical examination with no clinically relevant findings
