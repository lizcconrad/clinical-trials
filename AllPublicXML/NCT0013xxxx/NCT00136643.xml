  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical study are to evaluate the extended safety, tolerance and
      acceptability of a vaginal gel formulation when applied in 452 healthy women volunteers. This
      vaginal formulation was shown to be well tolerated in a previous smaller clinical study. The
      formulation is being developed as a microbicide for the prevention of sexually transmitted
      infections (STIs) including HIV.

      Objectives: The objectives of this Phase I/II clinical trial are to evaluate the safety,
      tolerance and acceptability of a gel formulation containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)
      (compared to gel alone and placebo) when applied intravaginally in healthy volunteers.

      Design: In part A of the protocol, three groups: gel alone, gel plus SLS, and placebo will be
      tested for safety, tolerance and acceptability when applied intravaginally once, twice or
      three times daily for 14 days in 252 healthy subjects. The volunteers will be divided as
      follow: 36 sexually abstinent healthy subjects (12 per group) will apply the gel, gel plus
      SLS or the placebo once daily for 14 days; 72 sexually active healthy subjects (24 per group)
      will apply the gel, gel plus SLS or the placebo once daily for 14 days; 72 sexually active
      healthy subjects (24 per group) will apply the gel, gel plus SLS or the placebo twice daily
      for 14 days and 72 sexually active healthy subjects (24 per group) will apply the gel, gel
      plus SLS or the placebo three times daily for 14 days. The gel will be applied between
      menses. For the sexually active group, the gel should be applied less than 1 hour before
      sexual intercourse, if planned. Subjects will have vaginal intercourse a minimum of 4 times
      in a 2-week period of gel application.

      In part B of the protocol, the extended safety of the gel alone, gel plus SLS and placebo
      will be studied when applied intravaginally twice daily for 8 weeks in sexually active
      healthy subjects. In this part B (actually represents Phase II of the trial), 80 healthy
      sexually active subjects for the gel alone group and 80 subjects for the gel + SLS group and
      40 subjects for the placebo group, will be studied. The part B involves the participation of
      a total of 200 subjects. Subjects will have vaginal intercourse a minimum of 4 times in a
      2-week period of gel application. The gel will be applied between menses. The gel should be
      applied less than 1 hour before sexual intercourse, if planned, but no more than twice a day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sign an informed consent

          -  Healthy female subjects aged between 18 to 49. Healthy female subjects are defined as
             individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or disease as determined
             by their medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests.

          -  Normal physical and gynecological examinations

          -  Normal colposcopic examination

          -  Have regular menstrual cycle with 21-40 days between menses

          -  HIV-negative subjects and at low risk of acquiring HIV

          -  At low risk of getting STIs (i.e. sexually abstinent or having history of protected
             sexual intercourse or having a stable sexual partner). Sexual intercourse is defined
             here as vaginal penetration. Stable sexual partner is defined as the same sexual
             partner for the length of the study.

          -  Agreeing to abstain from sexual intercourse from screening to the end of the study
             (for sexually abstinent subjects).

          -  Agreeing to have sexual intercourse a minimum of 4 times for each period of two weeks
             of gel application (for sexually active subjects)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical and/or gynecological examination

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings

          -  Allergy to applicator material (polyethylene) or to gel polymer
             (polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene) or to latex

          -  Participation in any investigational study involving drugs, vaccines or microbicides
             in the last 30 days

          -  HIV infection

          -  Bacterial vaginosis or Candida or Trichomonas vaginitis at time of screening

          -  Breakthrough menstrual bleeding, or vaginal bleeding during or following sexual
             intercourse, in the last 3 months

          -  Intravenous (IV) drug use except for medical reasons in the last year

          -  Pregnant at enrolment or breast-feeding

          -  Having received antibiotics in the last 14 days

             directions
