  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7974
      administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle in subjects with solid malignancies that have
      progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists.

          7. Patients must have adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;= 3 times the
             upper limits of normal (ULN), unless related to liver involvement by tumor, in which
             case &lt;= 5.0 times ULN.

          8. Patients must be willing and able to sign written informed consent and be able to

         10. Patients may have either measurable or non-measurable disease.

        For Prostate Cancer patients only being enrolled at the MTD expansion phase:

          1. Males with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate that has progressed
             (i.e. a minimum of three successive baseline values to document two consecutive rises
             in Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) (with the last value 5 ng/mL) taken at least one
             week apart prior to study entry) despite castration or maintenance of castrate-level
