  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine what effects (good and bad) bevacizumab (Avastin)
      and docetaxel (Taxotere), used in combination, have on metastatic gastric and esophageal
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously in an outpatient clinic once a week, every
      other week. Docetaxel will also be administered intravenously in the outpatient clinic once a
      week for three out of four weeks. Blood tests and vital signs will be performed weekly.

      After the first eight weeks of therapy a CT scan will be performed to determine and assess
      the progress of the disease. If therapy is continued, radiological procedures will be
      performed at week 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter.

      Treatment will be given for a minimum of 8 weeks, as long as the patient does not experience
      unacceptable side effects. Chemotherapy will continue for a year and a half as long as the
      cancer is responding and there are no unacceptable side effects.
