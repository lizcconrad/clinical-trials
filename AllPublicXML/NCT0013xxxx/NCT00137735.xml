      The purpose of this study is to determine whether gabapentin is safe and effective in the
      treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of treatment options exist at present for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) with no
      universal agreement. Recent reports suggested that untreated CTS might improve or remain
      stationary. In this respect, treatment directing towards symptom suppression alone may have a
      role in the initial management of CTS. Gabapentin (1-[aminomethyl]-cyclohexaneacetic acid;
      Neurontin, Pfizer) is an effective drug for treatment of neuropathic pain and has been
      reported to be effective in case series for the treatment of CTS with relatively benign side
      effects profile. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      gabapentin in the treatment of CTS.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sensory symptoms over median nerve distribution for more than three months.

          -  Confirmatory electrophysiologic results defined as prolonged median nerve distal motor
             latencies (DML) &gt; 4 ms or median-ulnar palmer sensory latency differences &gt; 0.5 ms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of severe CTS: fibrillation potentials or reinnervation on
             needle examination of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle or clinical examination
             showing wastage of the thenar muscles. (These patients were referred for surgical
             decompression on presentation.)

          -  Clinical or electrophysiological evidence of accompanying conditions that could mimic
             CTS or interfere with its evaluation, such as proximal median neuropathy, cervical
             radiculopathy, or significant polyneuropathy.

          -  Known epilepsy.

          -  Patients who have received previous steroid injection or oral steroid therapy for CTS.
