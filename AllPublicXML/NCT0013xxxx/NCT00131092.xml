  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare a telephone-administered physical activity counseling
      program delivered by a person or by a telephone-linked computer system and test their
      relative benefits in improving regular physical activity among adults ages 55 and older.

    <textblock>
      Two hundred and twenty five healthy, sedentary men and women ages 55 and older will be
      randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 12 months of physical activity counseling
      delivered by a human counselor, 12 months of physical activity counseling delivered by a
      telephone-linked computer system, or a 12-month attention-control condition (a health
      education class). Data on physical activity participation and related quality of life
      indicators (e.g., improved physical functioning, fitness, sleep) will be collected at
      baseline, 6 months, 12 month post-test and 18 month follow-up. The primary hypotheses are:

        -  participants in either physical activity counseling condition will show greater
           improvements in physical activity participation at 12 months compared to the
           attention-control condition;

        -  participants in the human counselor condition will show greater improvements in physical
           activity at 12 months relative to the computer condition; and

        -  participants in the computer condition will show better maintenance of physical activity
           between 12 and 18 months compared to participants in the human counselor condition.
