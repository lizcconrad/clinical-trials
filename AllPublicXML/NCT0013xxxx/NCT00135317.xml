  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess if the addition of intravenous (IV) iron to 500 mcg every 3
      week (Q3W) darbepoetin alfa treatment enhances response as compared to the standard practice
      (oral iron or no iron administration).

        Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects with non-myeloid malignancy (chronic myeloid leukemia [CML],
        acute leukemia [acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)],
        hairy cell leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma are specifically
        excluded) - Planned to receive at least 8 weeks of cyclic cytotoxic chemotherapy regardless
        of schedule (chemotherapy may already be ongoing at time of screening) - Hemoglobin
        concentration less than 11 g/dL within 24 hours before randomization - Eastern Cooperative
        Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 Exclusion Criteria: - Known (documented
        in medical records) history of seizure disorder (subjects with a previous history of
        seizure disorders will be eligible for the study, if they have had no evidence of seizure
        activity, and have not been taking anti-seizure medication for the previous 5 years) -
        Known (documented in medical records) history of thromboembolism - Known primary
        hematologic disorder which could cause anemia other than a non-myeloid malignancy (e.g.,
        sickle cell anemia, thalassemia) - Radiotherapy within 4 weeks before randomization in
        which the radiation is administered to greater than 25% of the marrow - Unstable or
        uncontrolled disease/condition, related to or affecting cardiac function (e.g., unstable
        angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension and/or unstable cardiac
        arrhythmia) - Chronic inflammatory disease that is not stable (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis,
        Crohn's disease, peptic ulcer, ulcerative disease, etc) - Inadequate renal and/or liver
        function - Received any red blood cell transfusion within 14 days before randomization or
        any planned red blood cell transfusion between randomization and study day 1 - Received any
        erythropoietic therapy within 4 weeks before randomization or any planned erythropoietic
        therapy between randomization and study day 1 - Known sensitivity to iron administration -
        Subject of reproductive potential is evidently pregnant (e.g., positive serum HCG test) or
        is breast feeding - Subject of reproductive potential who is not using adequate
        contraceptive precautions - Subject has any kind of disorder that compromises the ability
        of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures
