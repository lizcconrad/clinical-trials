      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the experimental drug eculizumab for
      treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a disorder that can cause premature
      destruction of red blood cells. PNH may result in anemia requiring blood transfusions.
      Patients may be at high risk of life-threatening blood clots in their veins and may have
      urine discoloration, stomach pain, difficulty swallowing, tiredness, and poor quality of
      life. Men may have problems getting or maintaining an erection. Eculizumab is a monoclonal
      antibody that may improve the survival of red blood cells in patients with PNH.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with PNH for more than 6 months,
      who have active disease, and who require blood transfusions may be eligible for this study.
      Each candidate is screened with a physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood and urine
      tests, and a questionnaire for information on how PNH affects the patient physically,
      socially, emotionally, and functionally.

      Participants receive infusions of eculizumab through a needle in a vein once a week for five
      doses and then every two weeks for another 24 doses. All patients are vaccinated against
      Neisseria meningitides, a bacteria that can cause symptoms, possibly including
      life-threatening meningitis, in susceptible people, including people who take eculizumab.

      At every treatment visit, patients update their health status, transfusion record, and
      medication use; review their laboratory results from the preceding visit; have vital signs
      measured; and provide a blood sample for laboratory tests. At selected visits, they also
      provide a urine sample, have a repeat electrocardiogram, and complete a questionnaire. At the
      final treatment visit, participants have a complete physical examination, in addition to the
      routine procedures.

    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder of the hematopoietic
      stem cell characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis.
      The clinical features of PNH result from the lack of one or more of GPI-linked proteins that
      serve to protect cells from autologous complement mediated attack. Two such proteins, CD55
      (decay accelerating factor) and CD59 (reactive lysis inhibitor) have been shown to be absent
      from PNH erythrocytes and platelets as well as other cell types.

      Evidence strongly suggests that lack of the terminal complement inhibitor CD59 is responsible
      for the sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes and platelets to the effects of autologous
      complement. Since the pathogenesis of PNH is due to the inability of PNH red cells and
      platelets to inhibit the activation of terminal complement, it is logical to hypothesize that
      a terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop the intravascular hemolysis, obviate
      or lessen the need for transfusions, and possibly decrease the propensity of life threatening
      thrombosis. Eculizumab (h5G1.1-mAb) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that like CD59
      inhibits terminal complement.

      This study is an open label, multi-center study of eculizumab, administered intravenously for
      52 weeks to approximately 85 PNH patients. The study is designed to evaluate the safety of
      eculizumab in transfusion dependent patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
      and to determine if the administration of this terminal complement inhibitor could provide a
      safe and effective substitute for CD59 function.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  The study population will comprise individuals who have transfusion-dependent
             hemolytic PNH.

          -  Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:

               1. Individuals at least 18 years of age

               2. Patients with a diagnosis of PNH greater than 6 months

               3. Presence of a GPI deficient red blood cell clone (type III cells) by flow
                  cytometry of greater than or equal to 10%

               4. Patients must have: at least one transfusion in the past two years for anemia or
                  anemia-related symptoms -or personal beliefs that preclude the use of
                  transfusion, with severe hemolytic PNH

               5. Documented LDH level greater than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
