  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that oral administration of ruboxistaurin
      will reduce the occurrence of sustained moderate visual loss (SMVL) in patients with
      clinically significant macular edema. SMVL is defined as a 15 letter or more decrease from
      baseline in best-corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity
      that is sustained for the patient's last 6 months of study participation. The SMVL data from
      this study will be combined with the SMVL data from Study B7A-MC-MBDL for the purpose of
      comparing ruboxistaurin to placebo.

    <description>SMVL is defined as a 15 letter or more decrease from baseline in best-corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity that is sustained for the participant's last 6 months of study participation. ETDRS visual acuity uses an eye chart with 5 letters per line. The scores range from 0 (no letters read correctly) to 100 (all letters read correctly).</description>
