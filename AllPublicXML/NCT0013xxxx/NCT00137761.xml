  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what activity the combination of docetaxel and
      Iressa have against metastatic pancreatic cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iressa will be taken orally once daily without interruption. Docetaxel will be administered
      intravenously once weekly for two out of every three weeks. Patients will also receive
      dexamethasone the night prior, morning of, and the evening after docetaxel treatment to help
      prevent an allergic reaction.

      Every week that chemotherapy is given, blood tests and vital signs will be taken.

      After the first 6 weeks of therapy a CT scan (or other radiological procedure) will be done
      to assess the progress of the disease. If the cancer is responding to the treatment and no
      unacceptable side effects have occured, treatment with Iressa and docetaxel will continue.

      CT scans (or other radiological procedure) will be performed at week 12 and every 9 weeks
      thereafter to monitor the progress of the disease.
