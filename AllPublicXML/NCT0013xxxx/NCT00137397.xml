  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate whether taking Tolterodine for overactive bladder
      symptoms can reduce the thickness of the bladder wall, as measured by intra-vaginal
      ultrasound. This will help doctors to understand whether there is a link between changes in
      the thickness of the bladder wall and progression of symptoms.
