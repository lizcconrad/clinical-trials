    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab compared with placebo when combined with a
      single stable background immunosuppressive medication in subjects with moderate to severe
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial will be
      evaluated at 52 weeks.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved a Major Clinical Response (MCR), Partial Clinical Response (PCR), or Nonclinical Response (NCR) Defined by British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Scores Over The 52-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BILAG Index measures clinical disease activity in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). A single alphabetic score (A through E) is used to denote disease severity for each of the 8 domains. The global BILAG score is the sum of a converted numerical score (A=9, B=3, C=1, D=0, E=0) over 8 domains. MCR = participants who achieved BILAG C scores or better at 24 weeks, maintained this response without developing a flare to 52 weeks, and did not experience a severe flare from Day 1 to Week 24; PCR = participants who achieved BILAG C score or better at 24 wks and maintained response without a flare for 16 consecutive weeks, or maximum of one BILAG B score at 24 weeks and maintained response without a flare to 52 wks, or maximum of 2 BILAG B scores at 24 wks without development of BILAG scores of A or B until Week 52 if the baseline BILAG score was 1A+&gt;=2Bs, or&gt;=2 As, or&gt;=4 Bs, or participants who enrolled with scores of severe disease and did not achieve a single BILAG B at Month 6.</description>

    <description>The BILAG Index measures clinical disease activity in SLE. A single alphabetic score (A through E) is used to denote disease severity for each of the 8 domains. The global BILAG score is the sum of a converted numerical score (A=9, B=3, C=1, D=0, E=0) over 8 domains. The AUCMB of BILAG Score Over 52 Weeks was calculated as:
Calculate the AUC of the BILAG global score versus time (in days) by 52 weeks.
Calculate the Time-Adjusted AUC by dividing the AUC by the number of days a patient was on the study.
Minus the Time-Adjusted AUC by the baseline BILAG global score</description>

The global BILAG score is the sum of a converted numerical score (A=9, B=3, C=1, D=0, E=0) over 8 domains. A severe flare = participants had BILAG A score(s) present in one or more domains or BILAG B scores present in three or more domains at the same visit following a visit of inactive disease state defined above.

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved a Major Clinical Response (MCR), Partial Clinical Response (PCR), or Nonclinical Response (NCR) Defined by British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Scores Over The 52-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The BILAG Index measures clinical disease activity in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). A single alphabetic score (A through E) is used to denote disease severity for each of the 8 domains. The global BILAG score is the sum of a converted numerical score (A=9, B=3, C=1, D=0, E=0) over 8 domains. MCR = participants who achieved BILAG C scores or better at 24 weeks, maintained this response without developing a flare to 52 weeks, and did not experience a severe flare from Day 1 to Week 24; PCR = participants who achieved BILAG C score or better at 24 wks and maintained response without a flare for 16 consecutive weeks, or maximum of one BILAG B score at 24 weeks and maintained response without a flare to 52 wks, or maximum of 2 BILAG B scores at 24 wks without development of BILAG scores of A or B until Week 52 if the baseline BILAG score was 1A+&gt;=2Bs, or&gt;=2 As, or&gt;=4 Bs, or participants who enrolled with scores of severe disease and did not achieve a single BILAG B at Month 6.</description>

        <description>The BILAG Index measures clinical disease activity in SLE. A single alphabetic score (A through E) is used to denote disease severity for each of the 8 domains. The global BILAG score is the sum of a converted numerical score (A=9, B=3, C=1, D=0, E=0) over 8 domains. The AUCMB of BILAG Score Over 52 Weeks was calculated as:
Calculate the AUC of the BILAG global score versus time (in days) by 52 weeks.
Calculate the Time-Adjusted AUC by dividing the AUC by the number of days a patient was on the study.

        <description>The BILAG Index measures clinical disease activity in SLE. A single alphabetic score (A through E) is used to denote disease severity for each of the 8 domains. The global BILAG score is the sum of a converted numerical score (A=9, B=3, C=1, D=0, E=0) over 8 domains. PCR = participants who achieved BILAG C score or better at 24 wks and maintained response without a flare for 16 consecutive weeks, or maximum of one BILAG B score at 24 weeks and maintained response without a flare to 52 wks, or maximum of 2 BILAG B scores at 24 wks without development of BILAG scores of A or B until Week 52 if the baseline BILAG score was 1A+&gt;=2Bs, or&gt;=2 As, or&gt;=4 Bs, or participants who enrolled with scores of severe disease and did not achieve a single BILAG B at Month 6. MCR = participants who achieved BILAG C or better at 24 weeks, maintained this response without developing a flare to 52 weeks, and did not experience a severe flare from Day 1 to Week 24.</description>
