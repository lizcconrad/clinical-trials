  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) who use peritoneal dialyses with Physioneal(R)
      (Baxter A/S, Denmark) were allocated to inject either placebo or tinzaparin daily into the
      morning dialysis bag. Active medication, as well as placebo, was added for three months
      separated by a one month washout period. At the beginning and end of each treatment period
      peritoneal equilibrations tests (PE-tests), Kt/V, blood and dialysate samples were analyzed.
      We, the researchers at Ribe County Hospital, set out to examine inflammation (local and
      systemic), nutrition and ultrafiltration.
