      The primary endpoint is coronary artery diameter, normalized for body surface area, 5 weeks
      after randomization. Secondary endpoints include duration of fever, CRP levels, and adverse
      events.

      BACKGROUND:

      Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an inflammatory vasculitis of unknown etiology that affects infants
      and children and can cause coronary artery aneurysms. Standard therapy consists of 2 gm/kg of
      intravenous immune globulin plus high-dose aspirin in the acute phase, and low-dose aspirin
      in the convalescent phase. Some children do not respond to this therapy, and some children go
      on to develop coronary artery aneurysms in spite of aggressive treatment. This led to the
      design of this randomized controlled trial to compare a single dose of intravenous steroids
      vs. placebo on the background of standard therapy. Recruitment began in December, 2002 and
      ended in December, 2004 with nearly 200 patients randomized.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This is a randomized controlled trial to compare a single dose of intravenous steroids vs.
      placebo on the background of standard therapy
