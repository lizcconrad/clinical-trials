  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth occurs very often in patients who receive radiation treatment. Amifostine is a drug
      approved to reduce the short and long-term occurrence of dry mouth when patients receive
      radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. Some studies have shown that Amifostine reduces
      the side effects of radiation treatment for lung cancer. The use of Amifostine is still being
      investigated in lung malignancies. Amifostine is found to be a protectant from radiation side
      effects of such normal tissues as bone marrow, skin, oral mucosal, esophagus, kidney and
      testes. Patients that receive radiation treatments for lung cancer may experience side
      effects involving the esophagus. It is hoped that patients will benefit from the protection
      of their esophagus and avoid delays in radiation treatment due to side effects of the
      radiation.

    <textblock>
      The protective capacity of thio-containing compounds against normal tissue damage from
      radiation have been recognized for over 40 years..

      Although intravenous administration is the approved standard route, because of practical
      advantages there has been increasing interest in the subcutaneous administration of Ethyol,
      which presents multiple advantages when used for radioprotection.

      Based on the data that has been presented, as well as the personal experience of this and
      other physicians/centers with subcutaneous administration of amifostine, the researchers are
      proposing an open-label study evaluating the rate and severity of toxicities associated with
      this route of administration. Toxicities to be assessed include nausea/vomiting, hypotension,
      and skin/fever reactions.
