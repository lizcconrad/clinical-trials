  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of the
      combination taxotere, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. We will also preliminarily
      assess whether the combination is effective in treating squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck.

      -  Patients will be premedicated at home with dexamethasone and leucovorin.

        -  On the first day of treatment, the patient will receive taxotere intravenously for one
           hour. Approximately one hour after the taxotere is completed, the patient will receive a
           4 hour infusion of cisplatin and begin a four day continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil
           and leucovorin. The infusion of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin will be completed at home
           with the use of an infusion pump. This process will be repeated every 21-35 days (1
           cycle) depending upon how quickly the patient recovers from the chemotherapy.

        -  During each cycle blood tests will be performed weekly. During the first cycle a
           physical exam will be performed weekly and then halfway through each subsequent cycle
           and immediately prior to the start of each subsequent cycle.

        -  At the end of each cycle the impact of the chemotherapy will be assessed. If after 2
           cycles the cancer has not responded the treatment will end. If significant reduction in
           the size of the tumor is observed, a third and final cycle will be done.

        -  After the last cycle of chemotherapy is done, radiation therapy will be performed twice
           daily for 6-7 weeks.
