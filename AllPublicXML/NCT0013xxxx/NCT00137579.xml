  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until now, the best administration route of the anti-flu vaccine for patients receiving long
      term oral anticoagulation therapy has been the subcutaneous one; the intramuscular route has
      not been recommended because it may increase the risk of muscular haematoma. Although this
      practice is widely extended, no significant differences between the safety of both routes
      have been found. Some authors, analysing a small group of patients, affirm that the anti-flu
      vaccine can be administered safely by the intramuscular route on patients receiving long term
      oral anticoagulation therapy, while a previous opinion article recommended the subcutaneous
      route without any scientific evidence. Due to this, the investigators have done a clinical
      trial with the aim of determining the safety and effectiveness of the flu-vaccine
      intramuscular route in patients receiving long term oral anticoagulation therapy and also to
      analyse the possible interactions between the vaccine and the oral anticoagulant treatment.

      Phase IV, simple blind, 2-parallel groups, multicentric randomized trial where each patient
      will receive a single dose of the recommended by the WHO anti-flu vaccine for the 2003-2004
      period, the control group will receive it subcutaneous and intervention group intramuscular.
      The assignation to each group will be randomized. The study included 4 basic areas of
      Barcelona city. Three visits have been scheduled for each patient: moment 0, 24 hours and 10
      days after the vaccination, and a 7 month follow up period to control the incidence of the
      flu.
