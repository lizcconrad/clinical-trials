  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain after gall bladder removal can be significant, mobility limiting and
      extend hospital stay. ALGRX 4975 is an ultra-pure form of capsaicin, which is a pain medicine
      that has the potential for long-term pain relief following a single administration. This
      study will determine whether ALGRX 4975 can provide pain relief following gall bladder
      removal.

    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain after open cholecystectomy can be significant and mobility limiting,
      causing increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary complications, and extended
      hospital stay. With increasing emphasis on early postoperative mobilization, adequate
      postoperative pain control is essential. Acute postoperative pain is currently managed
      largely with opioids and co-administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).
      Opioids are highly effective in managing acute postoperative pain, however dosing is often
      limited by side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, and sedation.
      NSAIDS are administered to reduce opioid use, but may also have limiting side effects, such
      as gastrointestinal toxicity and platelet dysfunction. New strategies to manage acute
      postoperative pain would provide clinical benefit. ALGRX 4975 is an ultra-pure form of
      capsaicin, which is a pain medicine that has the potential for long-term pain relief
      following a single administration. This study will determine whether ALGRX 4975 can provide
      pain relief following open cholecystectomy.
