      The purpose of this study is to determine whether minimizing the intake of milk and dairy
      products will reduce the recurrence of acne among people who have been successfully treated
      for acne with isotretinoin.

      Acne is one of the most common dermatologic diseases affecting 40 to 50 million people in the
      United States, most of who are adolescents and young adults. In addition to the
      well-recognized physical sequelae of this condition, several studies have linked severe acne
      to considerable social impairments and serious psychological conditions including suicidal
      ideation and major depression. Furthermore, severe acne has been recognized in some studies
      as a risk factor for breast cancer, suggesting that these conditions may have common causes.
      Little is known about the role of diet in the pathogenesis of acne. Recent analyses of the
      Nursesâ€™ Health Study II and the Growing-Up Today Study suggest that high intake of milk
      increases the risk of developing acne during adolescence. Despite the consistency of findings
      between these two studies, they cannot be regarded as conclusive and further research is
      needed in this area. Establishing the nature of the association between milk intake and acne
      can have broad clinical and public health implications. It could enhance the currently
      existing therapeutic options for the treatment of acne. More importantly, public health
      recommendations regarding milk and dairy intake could be designed in order to prevent its
      effects on the sebaceous glands and probably other hormone sensitive glands like the breast.

      To test the hypothesis that milk intake increases the risk of developing acne, we will
      compare the effect of minimizing milk and dairy intake against not making changes in the diet
      of subjects who usually consume at least 2 servings/day of milk and dairy products on the
      recurrence of acne lesions among patients previously treated with isotretinoin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged between 16 and 25 years of age who have successfully completed treatment
             for acne with oral isotretinoin.

          -  Patients who regularly consume at least 2 servings (480ml) of milk per day.

          -  Patients who can attend scheduled study follow-up visits at the Leeds General
             Infirmary.

          -  Patients who grant informed consent for participation in the study.

          -  Patients who agree to comply with the intervention and follow-up procedures in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received isotretinoin for a condition other than acne (e.g Malassezia
             folliculitis).

          -  Patients who have been off isotretinoin for more than 60 days at the moment of
             enrolment into the study.

          -  Patients who used any topical or oral acne medications between the end of therapy with
             isotretinoin and enrolment in the study.

          -  Patients who have been previously diagnosed with an endocrinologic disorder likely to
             cause acne such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal
             or ovarian tumors or any other hyperandrogenemic states.

          -  Patients who are using any of the following medications which are likely to cause or
             abate acne:

               -  Corticosteroids;

               -  Contraceptives containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, norgestrel or
                  levonorgestrel;

               -  Dilantin or other antiepileptic;

               -  Finasteride, spironolactone or flutamide;

               -  Testosterone or dietary body-building protein powders.
