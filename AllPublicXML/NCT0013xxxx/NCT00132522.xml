  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the safety and tolerability of the experimental biological drug EMD
      273066 when given with low dose cyclophosphamide to patients with recurring EpCAM positive
      ovarian, prostate, colorectal or non-small cell lung cancers. EMD 273066 is an experimental
      biological drug that may increase the immune response to certain cancers. Patients will be
      enrolled in groups of 3, with each successive group receiving a higher dose if the prior
      group adequately tolerates the study medication.

    <description>dose-escalating study and subjects enrolled in the study may receive a maximum of 6 cycles of the assigned regimen over 18 weeks. Each cycle will be 3 weeks (21 days) with cyclophosphamide on Day 1 and EMD 273066 on Days 2 to 4, followed by 17 days with no experimental pharmaceutical product.
Each cycle, cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m2 given per institutional guidelines 1 day (22-28 hours) prior to 3 consecutive days of EMD 273066 as a 4-hour IV infusion at 1 of 6 planned dose levels of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 mg/m2.</description>
