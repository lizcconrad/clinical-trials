        Inclusion Criteria:

        For the portion of the pilot study conducted at the UCLA CVR, an umbilical cord blood
        sample will be obtained from approximately 8 to 12 healthy pregnant women who are
        delivering neonates at the Obstetrical delivery ward of Harbor- UCLA Medical Center.
        Informed consent will not be obtained because the blood will be obtained after delivery
        from a clamped umbilical cord attached to the placenta (afterbirth) that otherwise would be
        discarded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A cord blood sample will not be collected from women who have requested special
        arrangements for a cord blood registry service.
