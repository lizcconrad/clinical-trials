  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if sildenafil is effective in the treatment of infants
      with severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia (determined by the presence of prolonged
      pulmonary hypertension or prolonged oxygen supplementation on mechanical ventilation), as
      measured by the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure following treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a condition characterized by pulmonary parenchymal
      and vascular hypoplasia. Severe CDH carries a high rate of mortality, and significant
      morbidity among survivors. This proposal is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of activity of sildenafil, a
      phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, for treatment of severe CDH. Infants who meet criteria at â‰¥10d
      of age predicting a poor outcome [death or chronic lung disease (CLD) severe enough to
      require hospital discharge on supplemental oxygen (O2)] will be eligible for the study.
      Infants whose parents consent for the study will undergo an initial echocardiogram to assess
      the degree of pulmonary hypertension. They will then begin either sildenafil or placebo
      therapy for a 45d course. A final echocardiogram will be performed after the experimental
      drug course is completed. The pulmonary arterial systolic pressure estimate during hyperoxic
      conditions will be compared between the sildenafil and placebo groups. Infants from either
      group who have severely elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (despite supplemental O2) will
      be considered for open-label sildenafil, which will continue after hospital discharge,
      depending on the results of a cardiac catheterization performed for clinical care.
