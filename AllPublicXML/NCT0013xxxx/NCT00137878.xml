  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of TNFerade™ to pre-operative
      chemoradiotherapy increases the number of pathologic complete responses when compared to
      pre-operative chemoradiotherapy alone as assessed following complete surgical resection of
      primary rectal cancer.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who have biopsy proven T3 or T4 rectal cancer which is confined to the
             primary tumor site with or without regional lymph node involvement

          -  Patients must be willing to return for follow-up

          -  Patients must be able to give and sign informed consent

          -  Patients must be suitable candidates for surgical resection post-chemoradiation, i.e.
             no history of severe congestive heart failure or severe pulmonary disease

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of distant metastatic disease

          -  Any of the following hematologic abnormalities: hemoglobin (HGB) &lt; 8.0 gm/dL unable to
             be corrected with a transfusion; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1500 cells/mm3;
             platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio or
             International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 (except in patients who are therapeutically
             anticoagulated for non-related medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation and
             whose anti-thrombotic treatment cannot be withheld for vector injection or surgery).

          -  A history of hepatic cirrhosis or present hepatic dysfunction with total bilirubin &gt;
             2.0 mg/dL except for patients with Gilbert's syndrome who must have a direct bilirubin
             &lt;/= 1.0 mg/dL; AST/ALT &gt;/= 2.5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Renal insufficiency as determined by a serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Patients may not have received prior therapy with chemotherapy, biologic therapy or
             radiation therapy for rectal cancer

          -  Significant history of a medical problem that would preclude the patient from
             undergoing an operative procedure such as a history of severe congestive heart failure
             or active ischemic heart disease

          -  Concurrent second malignancy requiring systemic therapy

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Chronic systemic corticosteroid use

          -  Prior surgery for rectal cancer

          -  Patients with history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism

          -  Patients with Doppler evidence of deep venous thrombosis at screening

          -  Known history of documented coagulopathy or thrombophilic disorders

          -  Hormone replacement therapy within one month prior to Day 1

          -  Known history of documented cerebrovascular disease, stroke or transient ischemic
             attack (TIA)

          -  Surgery within the last one month, excluding diverting colostomy or ileostomy for
             obstruction
