      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To demonstrate the efficacy of once daily administration of Nasacort AQ 110 µg compared
           with placebo in children 2-5 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis; and

        -  To assess the safety of Nasacort AQ 110 µg in children 2-5 years of age.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be male or female children ages 2-5 years with a history of at least 1
             year of perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) with or without seasonal allergic rhinitis
             (SAR) characterized by nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge, sneezing, nasal itching, and
             total eye symptoms, and verified by positive skin test or radioallergosorbent test
             (RAST) to perennial allergen that is present in the subject's environment (documented
             historical testing performed during the past year will be accepted).

          -  Subjects (assisted by a parent/guardian/care provider) must meet an aggregate symptom
             score of at least 18 (out of a possible 36) for nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge and
             sneezing for both the reflective (previous 24 hours) and instantaneous symptom scores
             recorded in the morning

          -  Subjects must not have clinically relevant disease other than allergic rhinitis or
             have clinically relevant deviations from normal on a physical examination.

          -  Subjects must not have been recently exposed to rhinitis medications prior to
             screening

          -  Subjects must have no history of hypersensitivity to glucocorticoids or to any
             excipients of the formulation

          -  Subjects undergoing cosyntropin stimulation test must have a morning (8 AM ± 1 hour)
             pre-stimulation serum cortisol level ≥ 5 µg/dL and 30 minutes post-stimulation serum
             cortisol level ≥ 18 µg/dL at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:

          -  Asthma, requiring chronic use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids in the previous 6
             months; upper respiratory tract infection or sinus infection requiring antibiotic
             therapy within 2 weeks prior to screening or viral upper respiratory tract infection
             within 7 days of screening.

          -  Nasal polyps, deviated septum, or nasal/facial anatomic abnormalities that interfere
             with symptom evaluation and/or use of intranasal corticosteroids

          -  Treatment with more than 2 courses of systemic corticosteroids (each course not
             exceeding 14 days) within 1 year of screening

          -  Use of intranasal or ocular corticosteroids within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Use of oral, inhaled, or intravenous corticosteroids within 1 month of screening

          -  Use of intramuscular or intra-articular corticosteroids within 3 months of screening

          -  Use of high potency dermatological corticosteroids within 1 month of screening

          -  Use of oral leukotriene modifiers within 1 week of screening

          -  Use of nasal or oral antihistamines or oral or nasal decongestants within 3 days of
             screening

          -  Current or history of cataract or glaucoma

          -  Treatment with any investigational product or use of an investigational device within
             1 month of screening

          -  Immunotherapy, with the exception of a stable maintenance schedule, for at least 1
             month prior to screening

          -  History of hypersensitivity to glucocorticoids or to any excipients of the formulation

          -  Subject is the investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, or other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct
             of the protocol.

        Any waiver of these inclusion and exclusion criteria must be approved by the investigator
        and the sponsor on a case-by-case basis prior to enrolling the subject. This must be
        documented by both the sponsor and the investigator.

        No subject will be allowed to enroll in this study more than once.
