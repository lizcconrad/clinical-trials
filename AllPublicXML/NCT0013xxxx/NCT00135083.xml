      The purpose of this study is to show the non-inferiority of insulin glulisine administered
      with 1 meal versus 2 meals versus 3 daily meals, as measured by the change in hemoglobin A1c
      (HbA1c), from baseline to study week 24.

      <textblock>
        Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have been using a stable combination oral
        antidiabetic therapy of 2 or 3 agents in different therapeutic classes for on at least 3
        months will be enrolled in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects 18 to 79 years of age with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
             mellitus for at least 6 months

          -  Current treatment with a stable dose of 2 oral antidiabetic agents. The oral agents
             must be in 2 or 3 of the following 3 different classes:

               -  Sulfonylurea: dosage greater than or equal to, one-half the maximum recommended
                  dosage (eg, glimepiride &gt;/= 4 mg; glipizide, including gastrointestinal
                  therapeutic system [GITS], &gt;/= 10 mg; glyburide &gt;/= 10 mg; Glynase® &gt;/=3 mg). The
                  dosage must have been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening.

               -  Biguanide: metformin dosage ≥ 1000 mg daily, including Glucophage XR®. The dosage
                  must have been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening.

               -  Thiazolidinedione (TZD): pioglitazone &gt;/= 15 mg or rosiglitazone &gt;/= 24 mg. The
                  subject must have been using the same thiazolidinedione for at least 6 months,and
                  the dosage must have been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening.
