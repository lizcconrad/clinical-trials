  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The JIKEI HEART Study has been designed to investigate whether concomitant treatment with
      valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), in addition to conventional treatment,
      will improve the prognosis of 3000 Japanese patients with cardiovascular diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several recent clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
      have cardiovascular as well as renal protective effects. However, it is a problem that the
      number of Asian patients is very little in these trials. The researchers examine the
      treatment meaning by ARB about the prognosis of the patient who amalgamates either among high
      blood pressure, the ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failures.
