      Primary Objective:

        -  The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of telithromycin
           over azithromycin and over cefuroxime axetil in the reduction of Streptococcus
           pneumoniae (Sp) strains resistant to beta-lactams or macrolides at the Test of Cure
           (TOC) visit in the sputum of patients with Sp detected at the start of the study (Visit
           1).

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To demonstrate the superiority of telithromycin over azithromycin and over cefuroxime
           axetil in achieving clinical cure and Sp eradication success at the Test of Cure visit
           in patients with Sp detected in sputum specimen at the start of the study (Visit 1);

        -  To compare the clinical cure rates achieved by each treatment group in the penicillin or
           erythromycin resistant Sp (PERSp) population with the cure rates in the sensitive Sp
           (SSp) population at the End of Therapy (EOT) and Test of Cure visits;

        -  To compare the effect of telithromycin, azithromycin and cefuroxime axetil at the End of
           Therapy visit on the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to
           beta-lactams or macrolides in the sputum of patients with Sp detected at the start of
           the study (Visit 1);

        -  To compare the clinical efficacy at the End of Therapy visit and safety at the Test of
           Cure visit of telithromycin, azithromycin and cefuroxime axetil in the &quot;global&quot;
           randomized population.

          -  Patients with a documented history of chronic bronchitis, characterized by cough and
             excessive sputum production for most days of at least three months for 2 consecutive
             years

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB),
             presumed due to bacterial infection based on increased sputum purulence with either
             increased dyspnea or sputum volume

          -  Patients producing spontaneous sputum

          -  Patients with three or less AECB in the previous 12 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:

          -  Patients with a known diagnosis of bronchiectasis; cystic fibrosis; lung cancer or
             lung metastases; active pulmonary tuberculosis; or with suspected pneumonia.
