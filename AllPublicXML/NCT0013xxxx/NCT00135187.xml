  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take part in this research study because they have multiple
      myeloma which has relapsed after (come back), or is refractory to (unaffected by), initial
      therapy.

      For patients who have relapsed or are refractory to therapy, there is no agreed upon standard
      treatment. Treatment options include chemotherapy and, for some patients, bone marrow
      transplants. None of the available treatments are curative and investigators are continually
      looking for more effective treatments. This study involves treatment with a new combination
      of standard drugs: VELCADE, Doxil, and Dexamethasone. Preliminary results from a study using
      a combination of VELCADE with Doxil showed high response rates (disease reduction). Two other
      studies showed that an addition of Dexamethasone to VELCADE in patients not responding to
      VELCADE alone improved response rate. The proposed combination of all three drugs may improve
      efficacy and response.

      VELCADE is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in multiple myeloma.
      Doxil is not approved for use in multiple myeloma but is an approved drug for use in patients
      with some other cancers. Several published clinical trials provide evidence that Doxil is an
      active agent in multiple myeloma and it is used in treatment combinations for multiple
      myeloma in general practice. Dexamethasone is approved for use in multiple myeloma. The
      combination of all three drugs is experimental (not FDA approved).

      The goals of this study are to determine if this new combination therapy with VELCADE, Doxil
      and Dexamethasone is an effective treatment, and also to determine the side effects that
      occur when this combination treatment is given.

      Multiple myeloma remains a non-curable disease. Combination therapies such as VAD have been
      effective, with partial response rates in ~40-60% range and tolerable toxicity. A recent
      study showed that substituting Doxil for Doxorubicin in a regimen similar to VAD (DVd)
      resulted in an improved toxicity profile and similar efficacy. The most active agents in VAD
      (and presumably in DVd) are Doxorubicin (or Doxil) and Dexamethasone, while Vincristine adds
      little, if at all to the efficacy of these regimen(s). One of the new active agents in
      multiple myeloma is VELCADE (bortezomib, formerly known as VELCADE). This molecule has a
      novel mechanism of action by specifically inhibiting the proteasome. A recently reported
      Phase II trial showed that VELCADE as a single agent induced at least minimal responses (i.e.
      &gt; 25% reduction in monoclonal protein) in 35% of patients and at least a stabilization of the
      disease in 59% of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma using strict SWOG
      criteria. An additional 18% responded when Dexamethasone was added to VELCADE. Pre-clinical
      observations showed that the addition of VELCADE to other chemotherapeutic agents, such as
      doxorubicin, enhances cytotoxicity of multiple myeloma cells. Preliminary results from Phase
      I study of combination of VELCADE with Doxil showed 60% response rate (i.e. &gt; partial
      response) with acceptable toxicity. In this study we propose to combine three active agents,
      i.e. Doxil, Dexamethasone (two most active agents from DVd), and VELCADE. The ultimate goal
      is to show that this combination of drugs is more efficacious than VAD or VELCADE with either
      Dexamethasone or Doxil and without additional toxicity.
