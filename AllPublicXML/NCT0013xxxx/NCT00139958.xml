      Objectives: Evaluate differences for mortality, morbidity and the cardiovascular risk factors
      between HIV and non-HIV patients with an acute coronary syndromes (ACS) after a 3-years
      follow up.

      Background: There have been many cases of myocardial infarction reported in HIV-infected
      young adults treated with HAART. Little is known to date, concerning the outcome and
      prognostic factors of patients with acute coronary syndrome and HIV-infection.

      Methods: Prospective cohort study to compare the evolution and prognosis between HIV and
      non-HIV patients with an ACS.

      Duration of the study: Two years for including patients. Three years of follow-up 100
      HIV-patients with ACS and 200 non-HIV patients with ACS will be included in the study. All
      patients will be included in the study from 30 Intensive Care Unit of Cardiology departments
      in France.

      Results: To compare the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality (myocardial
      infarction, sudden death, cardiogenic shock, fatal stroke), morbidity (non fatal myocardial
      infarction, unstable angina, recurrence of ischemia, cardiac failure, non fatal stroke) and
      revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery)
      during a 3-year follow-up between HIV and non-HIV patients with ACS. Univariate and
      multivariate analysis of predictive factors for cardiovascular events will be done.
