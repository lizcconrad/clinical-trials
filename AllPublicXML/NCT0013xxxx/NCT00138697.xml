      The kinetics, efficacy and safety of a liquid intravenous immunoglobulin product, IVIG-L,
      were studied in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, who are regularly treated with
      intravenous immunoglobulin substitution therapy.

      Sanquin has developed, in cooperation with the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service
      (FRCBTS), a liquid intravenous immunoglobulin product, IVIG-L. The liquid formulation of
      intravenous immunoglobulin simplifies the infusion, eliminates possible mistakes in the
      reconstitution with water for injections and reduces the space requirements in storage.

      In addition to the donor selection and donor screening, several viral safety steps have been
      included into the production process.

      In this clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of IVIG-L in patients with
      hypogammaglobulinemia, who are regularly treated with intravenous immunoglobulin substitution
      therapy, will be studied. IVIG-L will also be studied in patients with chronic ITP (KB98001).
      Data from both studies will be used for an application for marketing authorisation in Finland
      and the Netherlands.
