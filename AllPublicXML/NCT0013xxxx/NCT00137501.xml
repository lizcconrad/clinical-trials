    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is one of the most important causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. Prevention and treatment of preterm labor is important, not as an end in itself,
      but as a means of reducing adverse events for the neonate. A wide range of tocolytics, drugs
      used to suppress uterine contractions, have been tried. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is the most
      widely used tocolytic at the American University of Beirut Medical Center despite the fact
      that an effective tocolytic role of MgSO4 has never been established. Moreover, the currently
      available data are suggestive of deleterious fetal effects of MgSO4 in the setting of preterm
      labor to the extent that some authorities are recommending abandoning it for routine use as a
      tocolytic therapy. Calcium channel blockers have the ability to inhibit contractility in
      smooth muscle cells. Consequently, nifedipine has emerged as an effective and rather safe
      alternative tocolytic agent for the management of preterm labor after several studies have
      shown that the use of nifedipine in comparison with other tocolytics is associated with a
      more frequent successful prolongation of pregnancy, resulting in significantly fewer
      admissions of newborns to the neonatal intensive care unit, and is associated with a lower
      incidence of respiratory distress syndrome. The unequivocal impact of this method of
      tocolysis on short term postponement of delivery and the opportunity that this provides for
      affecting in-utero transfer and steroid administration has prompted many investigators to
      recommend focusing future trials on testing different dose regimens of nifedipine. To the
      best of the investigators' knowledge, no study comparing two different dose regimens of
      nifedipine has been previously published in the literature. The objective of their study is
      to compare the effectiveness of a high versus a low dose regimen in a total of 200 patients
      admitted with the diagnosis of preterm labor between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation. In
      addition, the investigators' study will try to assess the safety profile of the 2 dose
      regimens on the mother and the neonate by assessing a selected number of outcome variables.
      The data generated will be used to change their protocol for managing patients presenting
      with threatened preterm delivery and will fill the existing gap regarding the most effective
      and safest dose regimen of nifedipine in such patients.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  All pregnant women diagnosed with preterm labor defined as regular contractions
           associated with cervical change between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation.

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Multiple pregnancy

        -  Preterm rupture of membranes

        -  Congenital fetal malformations

        -  IUGR (intra uterine growth restriction)

        -  Previous tocolysis this pregnancy

        -  Chorioamnionitis

        -  Cervical dilation &gt; 4 cms

        -  Maternal medical conditions such as renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, or
           myasthenia gravis

        -  Non-reassuring fetal heart rate

        -  Maternal hypotension, defined as a blood pressure &lt; 90/50 mm Hg

      Randomization procedure:

      Randomization envelopes will be prepared by means of a random number table. After informed
      consent is obtained, the next numbered opaque envelope will be opened to assign each patient
      to receive either the low or high nifedipine dose regimen. Because of the different doses of
      nifedipine, neither patients nor physicians will be blinded to treatment allocation.

      Routine studies and procedures:

        -  A baseline ECG will be performed before starting the medication.

        -  All patients will receive a 500-mL intravenous bolus of isotonic sodium chloride
           solution unless they have clinical volume overload, followed by a maintenance
           administration of 125 mL/h.

        -  Maternal blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded every 15 minutes as long as the
           patient is in labor and every 4 hours thereafter.

        -  Fetal heart rate and uterine activity were monitored continuously throughout the study
           period.

        -  All patients eligible for the study will receive antibiotic prophylaxis for Group B
           Streptococcal infection (IV Pen G or Ampicillin) for at least 48 hours, pending the
           vaginorectal swab culture that is done routinely on every patient presenting with
           preterm labor.

        -  All patients will receive one course of 12 mg betamethasone intramuscularly every 24
           hours for 48 hours to promote fetal lung maturation and a rescue dose if they present in
           labor again at &lt; 34 weeks of gestation.

      Interventions:

      First arm (high dose):

      Nifedipine (Adalat速) 20 mg sublingual crushed, repeated after 30 minutes if contractions do
      not decrease in intensity. Maintenance of 120-160 mgs of slow-release nifedipine (Nifedicor速)
      daily for 48 hours (30 mg Q 6 hrs up to a maximum of 40 mg Q 6 hrs). Once contractions cease,
      nifedipine will be maintained at 80-120 mg daily in divided doses up to 36 weeks of gestation
      on an outside basis.

      Second arm (low dose):

      Nifedipine (Adalat速) 10 mg sublingual crushed, then 10 mg sublingual in 15 min, followed by
      10 mg PO Q 15 mins PRN to a maximum of 40 mg in the first hour. Maintenance of 60-80 mgs of
      slow-release nifedipine (Nifedicor速) daily for 48 hours (20 mg Q 8 hrs or 20 mg Q 6 hrs).
      Once contractions cease, nifedipine will be maintained at 60 mg daily in divided doses up to
      36 weeks of gestation.

        -  Tocolysis will be considered to be achieved when uterine activity decrease to &lt;4
           contractions/h with the absence of cervical change.

        -  If patients continue to have uterine activity after 6 hours or have cervical dilatation
           &gt;2 cm after admission examination, they could be switched to another tocolytic regimen,
           namely intravenous MgSO4 or intravenous ritodrine.

      Written Consent:

      The written consent will be handed to every pregnant patient eligible for this study. She
      will be given enough time to read it and decide whether she is willing to participate in the
      trial.

      Outcome variables studied:

        -  Speed of onset of uterine quiescence

        -  Uterine quiescence at 6 hours of initiating therapy

        -  Delivery &gt;48 hours from initiation of therapy

        -  Delivery &gt;7 days from initiation of therapy

        -  Delivery &lt;37 weeks of gestation

        -  Delivery at &lt;34 weeks of gestation

        -  Side effects to nifedipine

        -  Maternal adverse drug reactions requiring cessation of treatment

        -  Antepartum hemorrhage

        -  Maternal length of hospital stay

        -  Pregnancy prolongation

        -  Postpartum hemorrhage

        -  Birthweight

        -  Apgar score &lt;7 at 5 min

        -  Admission to NICU

        -  Mechanical ventilation

        -  RDS (respiratory distress syndrome)

        -  IVH all grades

        -  Neonatal nursery stay

        -  Neonatal jaundice

        -  NEC (Necrotizing enterocolitis)

        -  Neonatal death

      Side effects associated with nifedipine include a mild decrease in blood pressure and a rise
      in pulse, headache, flushing, dizziness and nausea.

      Data Collection:

      The initial information in the data sheets will be filled by the resident in charge of
      delivery suite. However, the follow up on the response of the patients to the medication and
      data regarding the maternal side effects and neonatal outcome will be filled by a part time
      research assistant.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistical package. Categoric data
      like maternal characteristics, the rates of neonatal morbidity and mortality will be compared
      using Chi square when sample sizes support the approximation. Otherwise, categorical data
      will be analyzed with two-tailed Fisher exact test if the expected cell frequencies were
      small. Continuous variables will be compared by Student t test if assumptions of normality
      and homogeneity of variances appeared to be reasonable. Unpaired variables and differences in
      distributions will be compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Neonatal outcomes will be
      analyzed comparing the total number of affected neonates in each group. A p-value &lt;0.05 will
      be considered statistically significant.

      Proposed budget:

      Personnel:

      A part time research assistant with &quot;BS&quot; background 450,000 L.L./ month x 29 months
      =13,050,000 L.L.

      Tasks expected:

      Completing the data sheets:

        -  F/U on response of mother to tocolysis and assessing maternal side effects

        -  F/U on the neonates and getting information about the neonatal outcome variables

        -  Data entry

      Medical supplies:

      Medications will be provided through the pharmacy.

      Compensation for patients:

      The total amount of money needed in Lebanese pounds:

      13,050,000 L.L./year.

      Time frame:

        -  May 2003 - May 2006 - Collection of data and randomization of patients to the 2 arms of
           the study

        -  June 2006 - Sep 2006 - Follow up on patients that were randomized during the first 5
           months of 2006 to get information about their pregnancy outcome

        -  Oct 2006 - Nov 2006 - Data analysis and writing the final paper

      Data collection will be under the direct supervision of the principal investigator.

      Percent of time spent by principal investigator on this proposal: 20% of research time which
      accounts for about 20% of time allocated for research activities.

      Co-Investigators' Role:

        -  Dr Usta will help in data analysis and in writing the final paper (5% of research time)

        -  Dr Mroueh will help in writing the final paper (5% of research time). Two
           Investigational Drug forms will be used since this trial will involve the same drug
           nifedipine in 2 different forms Adalat速 and Nifedicor速.
