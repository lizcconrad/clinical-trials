      The overall objective of the study is to quantify the true prognostic value and
      cost-effectiveness of routine follow-up visits in patients who receive an approved pacemaker
      of any type for the first time.

      Specific objectives :

        -  To determine the incidence of complications occurring in the first year after
           implantation of a pacemaker.

        -  To determine the quality of life at one year after pacemaker implantation in comparison
           with the quality of life before implantation.

        -  To determine which baseline (patient and pacemaker related) characteristics measured
           during implantation are prognostic predictors for the occurrence of complications and
           quality of life after one year.

        -  To determine which characteristics measured during follow-up visits truly have added
           predictive value, and to what extent.

        -  To determine to what extent responsibilities for pacemaker check-up can be safely
           delegated to non-cardiologists (e.g. pacemaker technicians or manufacturers' delegates).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each patient aged 18 years or over receiving a pacemaker for the first time in one of
             the participating Dutch pacemaker implanting centers, is a potential candidate for the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are not eligible if they refuse to sign informed consent on use of personal
             medical data.

          -  Patients who are taking any investigational (new) drug or have a non-approved or
             investigational pacemaker system which requires unusual follow-up regarding the
             pacemaker

          -  Patients having diseases that are likely to cause death or significant morbidity
             during the study period such as neoplasia and immune, infectious or degenerative
             diseases will be excluded.
