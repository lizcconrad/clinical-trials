  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to find out how much mercury is in the blood, urine, and stools of
      premature and low birth weight infants who have received standard childhood vaccines that are
      given to all infants in Argentina. Seventy-two newborn premature and low birth weight infants
      from Durand Acute General hospital will participate in this study. Each infant in the study
      will need to make two visits, one at the time of vaccination and another 12 hours to 30 days
      later. Urine, stool, and a small sample of blood will be taken at each visit.

      The primary objective is to describe the levels of mercury in the blood of premature newborns
      greater than or equal to 32 weeks and less than 37 weeks gestation and birth weight greater
      than or equal to 2000 grams but less than 3000 grams, who receive the routine birth dose of
      Hepatitis B immunization containing ethyl mercury in the form of thimerosal and the birth
      dose of BCG immunization, and to evaluate the excretion of mercury in these newborns by
      examining mercury levels in stool and urine. Secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the
      half-time of mercury in blood following vaccination of premature and low birth weight infants
      with thimerosal-containing vaccines, and 2) to screen premature and low birth weight infants
      for evidence of early effects of thimerosal on the kidney by measurement of urinary gamma
      glutamyl transpeptidase levels. All infants will have stool, urine, and blood samples
      collected prior to receipt of routine birth hepatitis B and BCG immunization. Cord blood will
      serve as the baseline blood specimen. Each infant will be seen once at a predetermined
      follow-up visit time point. There will be 6 follow-up visit time points, with sampling from
      12 infants at each time point. All infants will provide blood, urine, and stool specimens at
      the assigned follow-up visit.

        Inclusion Criteria: 1) Parent/guardian gives written informed consent. 2) Good health as
        determined by negative gestational history, subject's medical history and physical
        assessment. Medical history will include a review of the major body systems (e.g.,
        ear-nose-throat, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal,
        genitourinary, hematological). 3) Newborn cohort: within 3 days of birth and gestational
        age = 32 weeks and &lt; 37 weeks and a birth weight = 2000 grams and &lt; 3000 grams. 4) Able to
        attend the scheduled visits and to comply with the study procedures. Exclusion Criteria: 1)
        Infant history of vaccinations and date received is unknown or undocumented. 2) Known
        history of high-level mercury exposure in mother or infant. 3) Any contraindication to
        routine vaccinations. 4) Clinically significant findings on review of systems (determined
        by investigator or sub-investigator to be sufficient for exclusion). 5) Known or suspected
        impairment of immunologic function or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy or
        immunoglobulin since birth. 6) HIV-positive mother by history. 7) Personal or immediate
        family history of congenital immune deficiency. 8) Developmental delay or neurological
        disorders.
