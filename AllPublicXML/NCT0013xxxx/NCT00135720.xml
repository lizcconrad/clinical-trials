  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out about the effectiveness and the safety of an
      investigational drug called etanercept (Enbrel) to treat pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus
      vulgaris is a potentially life threatening blistering condition that currently has no cure.

      An investigational drug is one that has not been approved by the United States (US) Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a particular condition or disease. Etanercept has been
      approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and
      psoriasis, but not pemphigus vulgaris.

      People with pemphigus vulgaris have been found to have an increased amount of a substance
      called tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in their blood. Etanercept may control
      pemphigus vulgaris by blocking the effect of TNF-alpha. Patients diagnosed with pemphigus
      vulgaris have been asked to participate in this research study.

      Enrolled subjects will be given either etanercept or placebo. A placebo looks just like the
      study drug but contains no active medication. Placebos help study doctors find out if the
      effects of the study drug are due to the drug itself or just because of being in the study.
      This type of study design helps measure the true effectiveness of a treatment. Patients have
      2 chances in 3 of receiving etanercept and 1 chance in 3 of receiving placebo.

      The researchers expect to enroll 24 subjects in this study. Up to 16 subjects will be
      enrolled at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

      This study is sponsored by Amgen, Inc., the manufacturer of etanercept.

      If taking part in another research study or have taken part in a research study in the last
      28 days, patients will not be able to take part in this study. Patients cannot be on multiple
      studies simultaneously; however, exceptions are made for non-invasive, non-interventional,
      and observational studies.

      This study will last about 16 weeks with a total of 6 study visits: screening, week 0
      (baseline), weeks 2, 4, 8 and 16. The participants will be able to continue on your current
      medications for pemphigus throughout the study.

      All participants must be at least 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of pemphigus
      vulgaris and at least 6 active blisters or erosions. Neither pregnant nor nursing women will
      be included in the study.
