  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with type 2 diabetes cannot maintain their target blood glucose levels on a
      single therapy. This is a 28-week extension to a study to assess the safety and effectiveness
      of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, in lowering overall blood glucose levels when added to
      insulin in people with type 2 diabetes who are not at target blood glucose levels on insulin
      alone. The purpose of the extension study is to gather data on the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of vildagliptin in people with type 2 diabetes.
