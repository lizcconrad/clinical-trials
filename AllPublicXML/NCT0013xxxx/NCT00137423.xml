        <description>FACIT Fatigue Scale: Overall score from 13-questionnaire, which measures fatigue / asthenia for patients with chronic, life-threatening illnesses. For each question, a patient rates his / her condition for the past week on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores always represent less fatigue / asthenia. Outcome based on completed questionnaires.</description>

If more than 50% of the items in the scale were answered, then missing items were imputed with the mean of the non-missing items scored at that visit.
