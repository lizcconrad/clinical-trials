      Our primary aim is to investigate if cyclosporine A may reduce insulin secretion by 20% or
      more. In order to get cyclosporine A naïve patients we will perform this investigation in
      dialysis patients on the waiting list for a renal transplantation. In addition we will
      investigate if also the peripheral insulin sensitivity and endothelia function is affected by
      cyclosporine A treatment in these patients. Since these patients will be treated with
      cyclosporine A we will also measure cyclosporine pharmacokinetics at the time of
      investigation and repeat this investigation at the time of the first week following
      transplantation in order to evaluate if a pretransplant cyclosporine dose can be of value in
      predefining the dose to be used at the time of transplantation.
