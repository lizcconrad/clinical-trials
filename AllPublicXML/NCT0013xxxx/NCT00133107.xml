  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine whether efalizumab 1.0mg/kg given by subcutaneous injection for 12
      weeks is effective in treating oral lichen planus.

      This is a 20 week, single center, open-label pilot study to enroll 5 subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>primary efficacy measure will be oral mucosal surface area involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>area of oral mucosa involvement was measured in cm2 at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 and week 20. the primary efficacy outcome measure was the change in oral mucosal involvement at week 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>clinical lesion score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, and 20</time_frame>
    <description>a numerical score from 0 to 5 where 0 = no lesion; 1 = white striae only; 2 = white striae and erosion &lt; 1 cm; 3 = white striae and erosion &gt; 1 cm; 4 = white striae and ulceration &lt; 1 cm; 5 = white striae and ulceration &gt; 1 cm</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ten centimeter visual analogue pain scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, and 20</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to put an X on a 10 cm line that corresponded to their degree of pain where 0 cm represented no pain and 10 cm represented the most severe pain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>oral health impact profile-14 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, and 20</time_frame>
    <description>The OHIP-14 is a validated measure of the negative impact of oral disease on an individual's well being. The impact of various oral problems are rated from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often,&quot; which correlates to a score of 0 to 4. The responses are weighted and summated giving a maximum score of 56 and a minimum score of 0.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

             the study.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of oral lichen planus deemed by the investigator to be of
             sufficient severity to require systemic agents. The diagnosis can be made by biopsy
             proven oral lichen planus or biopsy proven cutaneous lichen planus in the setting of a
             subject with oral disease consistent with lichen planus.

          -  Subject has a clinical lesion score of at least 2.

          -  If female of childbearing potential, subject will have a negative urine pregnancy test
             at screening and week 0.

          -  If female, subject will be either post-menopausal for &gt; 1 year; surgically sterile
             (hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation); or practicing one form of birth control
             (abstinence, oral contraceptive, estrogen patch, implant contraception, injectable
             contraception, intrauterine device [IUD], diaphragm, condom, sponge, spermicides, or
             vasectomy of partner). Female subjects will continue to use contraception for 3 months
             following the last injection.

          -  Subjects must be on stable doses of topical medications, such as corticosteroids,
             cyclosporine, and tacrolimus for the past 4 weeks.

             medical condition.

          -  Subject has a chest X-ray consistent with an active infection or previous exposure to
             tuberculosis (TB) and/or a positive purified protein derivative test at screening (&gt; 5
             mm). (Subjects may participate if they are being actively treated in accordance with
             Centers for Disease Control [CDC] guidelines.)

          -  Subject has a serious, active or recurrent bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. This
             includes hepatitis B and C, and HIV.

             successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Subject has any dermatologic disease in the target site that may be exacerbated by
             treatment or interfere with examination.

          -  Subject has been administered an investigational drug in another clinical study within
             30 days prior to baseline (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer). Subjects in
             observational studies without investigational drugs or devices may still be enrolled.

          -  Subject has used the following systemic agents within 4 weeks prior to week 0:
             photochemotherapy, systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine,
             methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, quinacrine,
             dapsone, or thalidomide.

          -  Subject has previously been treated with biologic immune response modifiers including
             alefacept, etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab within 12 weeks prior to day 0 (or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer).

          -  Subject has previously been treated with efalizumab.
