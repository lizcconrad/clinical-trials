  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug ABR-217620 is a combination of two proteins, one that recognizes tumor cells and one
      that triggers an attack on the tumor cells by activating some white blood cells belonging to
      the body's normal immune system. In animals, this results in an accumulation of white blood
      cells in the cancer that can fight the cancer. This study will test how much of the drug, in
      combination with docetaxel (an approved drug for treating non-small cell lung cancer
      [NSCLC]), can be given to patients with NSCLC without causing unacceptable side effects.
