  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether compliance with occlusion therapy for
      amblyopia could be improved and, secondly, if risk factors for non-compliance could be
      identified.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-compliance is a limiting factor for success of occlusion therapy for amblyopia (lazy eye)
      in childhood. It is responsible for approximately 1% of the adult population being unable to
      read with the amblyopic eye. The researchers used electronic monitoring of compliance to
      investigate predictors and a remedy for non-compliance.

      Methods: In a prospective randomised controlled trial, compliance was measured for one week
      every three months during 30 months in newly diagnosed amblyopic children in The Hague,
      Frankfurt and Leicester. The family’s social-economic and ethnic background was assessed
      through a questionnaire. Children were randomised to receive either an educational cartoon
      story explaining, without text, the rationale for treatment to the child with reward stickers
      and an information sheet, or a picture to colour. All received standard orthoptic care by a
      treating orthoptist, who was unaware of the randomisation. The electronic device and
      educational programme were distributed via home-visits by researchers. The primary outcome
      measure was percentage of compliance (realised/prescribed occlusion time). The secondary
      outcome measure was influence of social-economic, ethnic and clinical factors on compliance.
