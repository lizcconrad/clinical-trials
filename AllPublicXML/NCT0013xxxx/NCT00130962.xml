      Subjects will have painful primary or post-operative intermetatarsal neuroma. Study drug or
      placebo will be injected into the space containing the neuroma. Subjects will complete weekly
      assessments for severity of foot pain, a brief pain inventory, and the amount of pain
      medication taken. Subjects will be seen for a screening visit, a treatment visit, and two
      follow-up visits after treatment. The last scheduled visit is one month after treatment. Some
      subjects may be followed by monthly telephone interviews to assess their level of pain over
      the six-month period following treatment.

      Subjects will have painful primary or post-operative intermetatarsal neuroma. Each subject
      will be randomly allocated to receive either ALGRX 4975 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Study drug
      or placebo will be injected into the intermetatarsal space containing a painful neuroma.
      Subjects will complete weekly assessments for the Average Foot Pain Severity, the 7
      Interference Items of the BPI, and the number of analgesic units taken. Some subjects may be
      followed by monthly telephone interviews to assess their level of pain over the six-month
      period following treatment.

      Plasma concentrations will be assessed pre-dose and post dose at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45
      min and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 4 hours.

      Safety will be assessed at baseline and during the study with adverse events (all visits),
      vital signs (Visit 2 pre and post-injection and Visit 3 or at early termination), and
      laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis) and ECG (Screening and Visit 3 or
      at early termination). The injection site will be examined and assessed by a 6-point scale
      for erythema, edema, and hemorrhage before the injection and at 1, 2 and 4 hours after the
      injection. A pain on injection NRS will be assessed immediately post- injection at 15, 30,
      and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after study drug administration. A sensory
      examination of the foot will be performed before the injection and 4 hours after the
      injection and at the completion of the study. If a subject has injection pain, the foot may
      be wrapped in ice for up to 20 minutes, analgesic medication may be provided.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females aged &gt;18 years

          -  Foot X-ray to rule out alternative pathology, and ultrasound or magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) to confirm the presence of a neuroma within 6 months of study entry

          -  Evidence of either a primary or post surgical recurrence neuroma

          -  A score of 4 or greater on the Average Foot Pain Severity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)
             during the week prior to randomization

          -  Failed conservative treatment such as wide shoes, orthotics, arch supports, or oral
             and/or injected analgesics

          -  Signed an Informed Consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board

          -  For female subjects: is surgically sterile, at least 2 years postmenopausal, or using
             a medically acceptable method (as determined by the Principal Investigator) of birth
             control; if of child-bearing potential is not pregnant (have a documented negative
             urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment), is not planning to get pregnant (during the
             time course of the study), or is not lactating

          -  Able to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of clearly documented allergic reaction to lidocaine or capsaicin.

          -  Prior participation in ALGRX 4975 study.

          -  Presence of any medical condition or instability that, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, might adversely impact the conduct of the study and the collection of
             data, including chronic conditions that are likely to alter the rate of healing or are
             likely to result in safety complications unrelated to the study medication, such as
             diabetes mellitus or extensive vascular disease

          -  Treatment of neuroma with a narcotic analgesic

          -  Other painful foot pathology

          -  Active cutaneous, or other disease, at the anticipated site of study drug injection

          -  Laboratory results that are both out of normal range and, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, clinically significant

          -  Drug or alcohol abuse within the past 2 years

          -  Require regular oral steroid medication, except for stable use (6 months or longer on
             the same scheduled dose) for mild or moderate asthma

          -  Use of an investigational medication in the 30 days prior to the current study or
