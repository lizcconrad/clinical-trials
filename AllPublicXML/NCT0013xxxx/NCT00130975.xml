      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that treatment with the angiotensin II
      type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan may reduce the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation
      after electrical cardioversion.

      Background: The most effective procedure to restore sinus rhythm in patients with persistent
      atrial fibrillation (AF) is electrical cardioversion, but AF recurs in 60-80% of the patients
      during the first year. AF is associated with electrical and anatomical remodelling of the
      atria, and angiotensin II is involved in the remodelling process. Studies have indicated that
      the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan may counteract both electrical and
      anatomical remodelling induced by AF. The investigators therefore hypothesised that treatment
      with candesartan may reduce the recurrence rate of AF after electrical cardioversion.

      Study design: 171 patients with persistent AF scheduled for electrical cardioversion are
      randomised in a double blind, placebo-controlled study. The patients receive tablets of
      candesartan 8 mg or matching placebo once daily for 3-6 weeks before cardioversion, and
      candesartan 16 mg or matching placebo once daily for 6 months after cardioversion. The study
      medication is discontinued if electrical cardioversion is unsuccessful or if AF recurrence is
      documented. Primary endpoint is recurrence of AF. Clinical, electrocardiographic,
      echocardiographic and biochemical markers will be analysed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with atrial fibrillation, diagnosed electrocardiographically, of more than 48
             hours duration in whom direct current (DC) cardioversion is planned.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any
             angiotensin II receptor blocker or any angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

          -  Patients currently receiving an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II antagonist because of
             heart failure or other strong indication.

          -  Patients currently receiving any antiarrhythmic medication including sotalol. Other
             beta-blockers will not be regarded as specific antiarrhythmic agents.

          -  Significant renal artery stenosis and any medical condition in which administration of
             a vasodilator is contraindicated; serum creatinine &gt; 225 micromol/L; or serum
             potassium &gt; 5.5 mmol/L; or serum sodium &lt; 128 mmol/L.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.

          -  Life-limiting disease or substance abuse which may affect participation.

          -  Patients unwilling to participate.

          -  Patients who have previously undergone DC cardioversion for atrial fibrillation within
             the last month.

          -  Thyrotoxicosis.

          -  Patients with a systolic blood pressure of &lt; 100 mm Hg.

          -  Hypertensive patients requiring intensified treatment prior to DC cardioversion.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.
