  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is the assessment of treatment outcome among traumatized
      patients seeking individual and/or group therapy at the Victims of Violence Program. The
      study gathers information from patients using quantitative (self-report) and qualitative
      (interview-based) approaches, to determine changes in symptom patterns and domains of
      functioning relevant to psychological trauma.

      The focus of the Trauma Recovery and Resiliency Project is primarily the evaluation of
      treatment outcome among complexly traumatized patients seeking individual and/or group
      therapy at the Victims of Violence (VOV) Program, a specialty clinic located in the
      Outpatient Psychiatry Department of the Cambridge Health Alliance and affiliated with Harvard
      Medical School. The project has two major components: (1) All patients seeking VOV treatment
      are administered a battery of self-report measures assessing symptoms associated with complex
      trauma (i.e., interpersonal trauma that is usually repeated and prolonged) (2) A subsample of
      patients are interviewed using the Multidimensional Trauma Recovery and Resiliency Interview
      (MTRRI) and its companion rating scale (MTRR; Harvey et al, 1994, 2000, 2003) to assess
      trauma impact, recovery and resiliency on eight domains of psychological functioning. Data is
      analyzed using quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluate treatment effectiveness
      and elucidate the recovery trajectories of patients receiving VOV treatment. Two subprojects
      include (a) preparation of a treatment manual documenting the Women's Trauma Recovery Group,
      and (b) pilot testing a new interview-based measure of complex trauma symptoms, the Symptoms
      of Trauma Scale (SOTS).
