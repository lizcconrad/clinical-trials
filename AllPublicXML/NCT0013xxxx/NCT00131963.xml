      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain
      after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and/or
      paclitaxel work in treating women with nonmetastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the pharmacogenomics of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin and
           cyclophosphamide and/or paclitaxel in women with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer.

        -  Determine treatment-induced myelosuppression (e.g., neutropenia) in patients treated
           with adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide who have polymorphisms in drug activation
           and metabolism genes.

        -  Correlate the incidence of peripheral neuropathy with pharmacogenomic analysis in
           patients treated with paclitaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine response (i.e., relapse in the adjuvant setting) during a 10-year follow-up
           period in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive treatment on The Cancer and Leukemia
      Group B study(CALGB) CALGB-40101 OR are assigned to receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens on this
      study.

        -  Regimen 1: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 10 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over
           30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

        -  Regimen 2: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in regimen 1. Patients
           then receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months and then
      annually for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (300 treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
      and 200 treated with paclitaxel) will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.
