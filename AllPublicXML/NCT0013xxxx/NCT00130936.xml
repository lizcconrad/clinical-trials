  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although declining in incidence, gastric/gastroesophageal cancer is still a commonly
      diagnosed malignancy in Canada. Patients who have undergone surgical resection for early
      disease have a high rate of local recurrence and distant spread. More than 50% of patients
      present with either locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients with advanced disease
      have an extremely poor prognosis, with average survival times ranging from 3 - 9 months.
      Development of new therapeutic approaches for locally advanced or metastatic
      gastric/gastroesophageal cancer, is clearly needed.

      Despite its proven efficacy, ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional 5-fluorouracil
      [5-FU]) has not been widely adopted in North America and is likely due to the technical
      difficulties and inconvenience associated with infusional chemotherapy. This study will
      substitute the oral chemotherapy drug capecitabine for infusional 5-FU in addition to
      substituting intravenous cisplatin with carboplatin (ECC - epirubicin, carboplatin and
      capecitabine). It is hoped that these substitutions will not only reduce the typical ECF
      related adverse effects but also allow for a more convenient administration of outpatient
      chemotherapy. It is also hoped that the genetic correlates of this study may also identify
      specific populations that preferentially benefit from ECC treatment.

      Background Information:

      Capecitabine is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine which is
      converted to 5-fluorouracil. Capecitabine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
      and then hydrolyzed in the liver. Capecitabine has been studied in the treatment of
      gastric/gastroesophageal cancer in addition to a wide variety of other malignancies (e.g. GI,
      breast).

      Objectives

      Phase I:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine with combined fixed doses of
           epirubicin and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid cancers. With the
           identification of the MTD, determination of the recommended phase II dose will be made
           and used to further evaluate the specific anti-tumor activity of ECC in unresectable
           locally advanced and/or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety, toxicity profile, principle and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)
           of ECC when given on this schedule; and

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic behavior of capecitabine when given in combination with
           epirubicin and carboplatin as part of the ECC regimen.

      Phase II:

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the anti-tumor activity of ECC when given at the RPTD in patients who have
           unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer who have
           not received prior palliative chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To further characterize the toxicity profile of the ECC regimen;

        -  To determine time to progression, duration of response, and overall survival of patients
           on this study;

        -  To determine the effects of thymidylate synthase (TS) polymorphisms on both toxicities
           and efficacy of ECC in prospectively genotyped patients;

        -  To prospectively evaluate other potential pharmacogenetic correlates which may also play
           a role in augmenting toxicity, including MTHFR; and

        -  To assess effects of uridine glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT 2B7) polymorphisms on
           epirubicin metabolism.

      Study Design:

      This is a Phase I/II trial that will study the safety as well as the efficacy of the ECC
      combination chemotherapy regimen.

      Epirubicin: will be administered as an IV push at a fixed dose of 50mg/m2 on day 1 - repeated
      every 21 days

      Carboplatin: will be administered IV, at a fixed dose with an AUC of 5 (over a 1-hour
      infusion in 500ml of 5% dextrose) on day 1 - repeated every 21 days

      Capecitabine: will be administered as a twice daily oral medication (variable dose for phase
      I portion of the trial, but fixed dose for phase II portion of the trial) for 14 consecutive
      days (days 1-14) - repeated every 21 days

      For the phase I portion of the study cohorts of 3 patients will be treated at each of 3
      pre-determined dose levels of capecitabine and monitored for toxicity:

        -  Dose level 1: 750 mg/m2 bid

        -  Dose level 2: 850 mg/m2 bid

        -  Dose level 3: 1000 mg/m2 bid

        -  Dose level 4+: 25% dose escalation (rounded to the nearest twice a day dosing).

      Statistical Analysis

      Phase I:

      Summary statistics such as frequency and intensity of toxicity occurring at each dose level
      will be provided. The percentage of patients developing DLT at each dose level will be
      computed. The dose-toxicity curve can be estimated accordingly using either parametric or
      non-parametric methods.

      Phase II: A Simon's optimal two-stage phase II study will be conducted in patients with
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-esophageal cancer at the RPTD
      of the ECC regimen. A total sample size of 43 patients will be required, 13 in the first
      stage and 30 in the second stage, if criteria for second stage accrual are met. If &lt;=3/13
      patients respond, this is deemed to correspond with the initial rejection limit and no
      further patients will be enrolled. If &gt;=4/13 patients respond, an additional 30 patients will
      be enrolled in the second stage (total sample size = 43). Further statistical details are
      specifically outlined in Section 8 of the protocol. The response rate, standard error and its
      95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated under the binomial distribution model. The
      efficacy of the regimen will then be evaluated by comparing the point estimates and 95% CI
      with historical data. Potential covariates for response will also be identified and evaluated
      via the logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier estimates will be computed to estimate the
      secondary endpoints such as time to progression and survival. Cox-regression model can be
      applied incorporating covariates in the model. Fisher's exact test will be applied to compare
      the response rates between the different genetic TS polymorphisms groupings.

      Stopping Rules:

      Treatment will be discontinued and the patient will come off the trial therapy due to severe
      intercurrent illness, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient request to stop,
      and/or if the physician deems it in the best interest of patient to discontinue.
