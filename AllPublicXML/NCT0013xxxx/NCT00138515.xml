  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with type 2 diabetes cannot maintain target blood glucose levels when taking a
      single oral drug. This is a 28-week extension to a study to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, in lowering overall blood glucose levels
      when added to metformin in people with type 2 diabetes who are not at target blood glucose
      levels on metformin alone. The purpose of the extension study is to gather data on the
      long-term safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin in people with type 2 diabetes.
