      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of telmisartan 40
      mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg (Micardis Plus) with that of losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide
      12.5 mg, a reference AIIA combined with diuretic, in Taiwanese patients with mild to moderate
      hypertension.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Mild to moderate hypertension as defined by a morning mean(&gt;95 and &lt;115mmHg) of two
             diastolic blood pressure measurements (DBP) after 5 min in the sitting position
             following a minimum 2-week placebo run in phase.Mean sitting systolic blood pressure
             (SBP) must be &gt;140 and &lt;200mmHg. The mean DBP and SBP values are calculated as the
             mean of the two sitting measurements taken 2 min apart just before the drug intake.

          2. Male or female between 20 to 80 years old

          3. Ability to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients are still taking more than three anti-hypertensives at the screening visit

          2. Pre-menopausal women

          3. Known or suspected secondary hypertension

          4. Mean sitting DBP&lt;95mmHg and/or mean sitting SBP &gt; 200mmHg at the end of placebo run-in
             phase

          5. Hepatic and/or renal dysfunction

          6. Known bilateral renal artery stenosis, patient with a solitary kidney, post renal
             transplant

          7. Known NYHA functional class Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) III, IV

          8. Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or stroke within the preceding
             six months

          9. Post-Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty(PTCA) within the preceding three months

         10. Sustained ventricular tachycardia, atria fibrillation, second or third degree AV
             block, VPC or APC (&gt;10% of heart rate) or other clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia
             as determined by the clinical investigator

         11. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, hemodynamically relevant
             stenosis of aortic or mitral valve.

         12. Once documented evidence by ophthalmological examination of significant retinal
             haemorrhages/ exudates

         13. Clinically significant sodium depletion as defined by serum sodium level less than 130
             mmol/L

         14. Clinically significant hyperkalemia as defined by serum potassium level &gt;5.5 mmol/L

         15. Non-insulin dependent DM poorly controlled whicih is defined as HbA1c&gt;8% twice
             consecutively within 6 months and/or AC blood sugar&gt;180 mg/dl.

         16. Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus

         17. Chronic administration of oral anticoagulants and/or digoxin within the past 6 months.

         18. Known drug or alcohol dependency

         19. Administration of medication known to affect blood pressure, except medication allowed
             by the protocol

         20. Angioedema with ACE inhibitors

         21. Use of nitrates
