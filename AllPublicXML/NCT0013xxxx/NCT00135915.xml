    <textblock>
      Although there is no evidence that individuals with type 1 diabetes have a different approach
      to alcohol compared to the background population, nevertheless, its use does have
      implications for patients mainly because of the risk of hypoglycaemia unawareness. However,
      binge drinking has been implicated as a factor in the development of ketoacidosis and is
      probably under-recognised. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of binge drinking
      on glucose, insulin, counter-regulatory hormones and other metabolites in patients with type
      1 diabetes. It is hoped that data from this project will be used to develop a larger study
      comparing different treatment regimens for patients using alcohol to reduce the risks of
      hyperglycaemia as well as hypoglycaemia.

      This is a randomised trial involving Type I diabetics who have had Type I diabetes &gt;5 years.
      They will be using multiple daily injections of a basal insulin and a rapid acting
      component.Apart from insulin and oral contraceptive, none will be on regular medication. All
      will be regular consumers of modest amount of alcohol (Female - less than or equal to 14
      units, males - less than or equal to 21 units). Each will participate in 2 studies. Subjects
      will be randomised either to white wine or an equivalent volume of alcohol-free wine.Outcome
      measures are the results of the effect of acute ingestion of alcohol on glucose levels and
      intermediate metabolites in subjects with Type I diabetes.
