    <textblock>
      This study will add interleukin-2 (IL-2) to a regimen of post-remission therapy consisting of
      high-dose ara-C. Patients with AML in first remission will receive 3 cycles of high-dose
      ara-C followed by continuous infusion and bolus interleukin-2 (IL-2). We, the researchers at
      the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, plan to evaluate the immunologic effects of such treatment
      in these patients.

      Patients will receive standard remission induction therapy with daunorubicin at a dose of 45
      mg/m2/day for 3 days and continuous infusion cytarabine at a dose of 200 mg/m2/day for 7
      days.

      Those patients who enter a remission status and have preserved liver and kidney function will
      then receive 3 cycles of post-remission therapy that will consist of high-dose cytarabine at
      a dose of 3000 mg/m2 every 12 (q12) hours on days 1, 3 and 5 (total of 6 doses).

      Patients who are still in remission will receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) upon count recovery at
      a dose of 8.1 X 10^5 U/m2/day by continuous infusion for 10 weeks. In addition, patients will
      receive bolus IL-2 at a dose of 6 X 10^5 U/m2 by intravenous bolus weekly for 6 doses through
      day 63.

      Patients will be seen on a weekly basis while on treatment for examination and bloodwork.

      At the end of treatment, patients will have a physical exam and bloodwork performed monthly
      for two years, then 4 times per year for two years.
