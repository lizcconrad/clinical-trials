  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized crossover trial comparing two treatments,
      Alprazolam ODT versus conventional alprazolam tablets, in subjects who were already taking
      conventional immediate-release alprazolam tablets for anxiety. The trial included five study
      visits (four periods of 7 3 -day duration): Screening (Visit 1), Treatment Period 1 (Visit
      2), Treatment Period 2 (Visit 3), Final Visit (Visit 4), and Follow-up (Visit 5 [telephone
      visit]). At Visit 1, following screening, eligible subjects continued to take their own
      conventional alprazolam as prescribed by their physician. At Visit 2, eligible subjects were
      randomized in approximately equal numbers to one of two treatment sequences: Alprazolam ODT/
      conventional alprazolam or conventional alprazolam/ Alprazolam ODT. Subjects continued taking
      alprazolam in accordance with the treatment sequence to which they were assigned, at the same
      dose regimen as their own prescribed alprazolam. At Visit 3, subjects crossed over to the
      alternate treatment until Visit 4. At Visit 4, subjects completed the Subject Preference
      Questionnaire, and a physical examination and clinical laboratory tests were performed. At
      the end of Visit 4, subjects resumed taking their own conventional alprazolam. The site made
      a follow-up telephone call 7 - 3 days after Visit 4 to assess the subject's health status.
