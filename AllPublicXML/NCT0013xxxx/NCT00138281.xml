    <textblock>
      Sixty adults, ages 18-49, will be randomly assigned to receive either FluMist or Fluzone.
      Some of the subjects will have participated in previous studies for these 2 vaccines. The
      study will last 4 months with subject participation being 28 days. The purpose of this study
      is to measure immune response to the vaccinations.

      This is a Phase 4, single-center, study of the immune responses of adults to one of two
      licensed influenza vaccines (either inactivated vaccine given IM or live, attenuated vaccine
      given intranasally). The study will enroll up to 60 adults, ages 18-49, some of whom were
      immunized in the Years 1 and 2 studies. This study began Year 1 of this grant with a protocol
      testing the two vaccine products in their age-approved populations. FluMist is approved for
      use in healthy children and adolescents, 5-17 years of age, and healthy adults 18-49 years of
      age. Fluzone is approved for all age groups starting at 6 months of age. To match for age and
      to study the youngest children possible, the age cohorts of 5-9 and 18-49 years were chosen
      for initial Year 1 study. In 2003, 70 adults and 16 children were enrolled, randomized 1:1 to
      receive either FluMist or Fluzone and immunized. In 2004, 44 of the original 70 adults were
      re-immunized with the same preparation they received in 2003. In addition, studies were
      conducted in twenty-eight 6mos to 5yo children who all received Fluzone and in thirty-nine
      5-9 yo children who were randomized 1:1 to receive either FluMist or Fluzone. For 2005, we
      propose to study in this protocol, adults from last year who agree to a third immunization
      plus as many new adults to add up to a total of 60. Blood samples will also be taken at Days
      0, 7-9 and 28 to be analyzed for CD4 and CD8 T-cell, B-cell, NK-cell and homing receptor
      responses.

          5. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

          6. If the subject is female and of childbearing potential, she must use an acceptable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of immunodeficiency.

          2. Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function including, but not limited to,
             clinically significant liver disease; diabetes mellitus; moderate to severe kidney
             impairment.

          3. History of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome.

          7. Chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disorder.

          8. Chronic metabolic diseases (including diabetes), renal dysfunction or
             hemoglobinopathies requiring regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during the
             preceding year.

          9. Use of immunosuppressive medication. Corticosteroid nasal sprays are permissible.

         10. Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities that preclude
             subject compliance with the protocol.

         11. Inactivated vaccine 14 days prior to vaccination.

         13. Use of investigational agents within 30 days prior to study.

         14. Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin in the past 6 months.

         15. Donation of the equivalent of a unit of blood within 6 weeks prior to enrollment.
