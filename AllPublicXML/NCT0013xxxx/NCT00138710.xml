  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 50 obese men with a hormonal imbalance will be treated with letrozole or
      placebo for six months in order to examine the effects on the hormonal balance, and on weight
      loss. The study will also address the side effects and psychological effects of letrozole as
      compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of the study is to establish the short-term efficacy and safety of aromatase
      inhibition in restoring and maintaining eugonadism in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadal men.
      Secondary aim is to detect the short-term somatic and psychological effects.

      Study design: Double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.

      Treatment: 26 weeks of either letrozole or placebo. All patients will start on 1 tablet per
      week, dose adjustments will be performed if serum testosterone or estradiol are outside the
      target range. All men will be prescribed a mildly hypocaloric diet.

      Endpoints: BMI, body weight, waist circumference, body composition, exercise capacity, serum
      levels of several hormone markers, glucose tolerance, psychological characteristics.

      All patients will be measured 6 times during the study.
