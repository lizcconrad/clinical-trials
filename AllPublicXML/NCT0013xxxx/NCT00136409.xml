      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects (good and bad) of Gleevec in patients
      with BCR-negative myeloproliferative disorders including myelofibrosis with myeloid
      metaplasia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

      Gleevec will be administered at a dose of 400 mg orally once daily.

      Patients will continue to receive the drug until either drug progression or the development
      of intolerable side effects.

      Patients will be assessed with a complete blood count weekly for the first 8 weeks and will
      have monthly physical examinations and bone marrow examinations every 3 months.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or
             chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Patients may be entered based on a prior
             cytogenetic karyotype showing the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome.

          -  Patients may be entered prior to completion of reverse transcription-polymerase chain
             reaction (RT-PCR) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies, but a patient
             who is subsequently found to be BCR-ABL or FISH positive will be removed from protocol
             treatment. FISH will only be performed on patients with a normal karyotype. A PCR
             sample will be sent on all patients.

          -  The patients with myelodysplasia must have French-American-British (FAB) subtype
             chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) defined as peripheral blood monocytosis, and
             less than 30 percent blasts in the peripheral blood or the bone marrow.

          -  The patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia can have one of the following:
             agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (idiopathic myelofibrosis), or post-polycythemic myeloid
             metaplasia (post-polycythemic myelofibrosis), or post-thrombocythemic myeloid
             metaplasia.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of 6 months or greater.

          -  Serum bilirubin equal to or less than twice the upper limit of normal.

          -  Serum SGOT and SGPT equal to or less than twice the upper limit of normal.

          -  Serum creatinine equal to or less than twice the upper limit of normal.

          -  Age at least 18 years.

          -  Greater than 4 weeks from any chemotherapy (except hydroxyurea), radiotherapy,
             immunotherapy, or systemic glucocorticoid therapy (non-glucocorticoid hormonal therapy
             is allowed). Systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-malignant disease is allowed.

          -  The last dose of hydroxyurea must be 24 hours prior to the initiation of Gleevec.

          -  Greater than 2 months following bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell
             transplantation or treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled active infection.

          -  Pregnancy or nursing mothers.

          -  Patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
             who have transformed to acute myelogenous leukemia.

          -  Prior treatment or diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia.

          -  Patients with Philadelphia positive cytogenetics by either peripheral blood or bone
             marrow sampling.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &gt; 3.

          -  Prior exposure to Gleevec.

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) disease.

          -  Evidence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus.

          -  Active psychiatric or mental illness making informed consent or careful clinical
             follow-up unlikely.
