      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of Xolair using non-invasive techniques
      from the expired gas of patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional methods of sampling secretions from the lower respiratory tract include sputum
      collection, sputum induction, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. They cannot be
      repeated within a short period of time because of their invasiveness, and because the
      procedures themselves may include an inflammatory response. The need to monitor inflammation
      in the lungs has led to the exploration of exhaled gases and condensates. Noninvasive
      monitoring may assist in differential diagnosis of pulmonary diseases, assessment of disease
      severity and response to treatment.
