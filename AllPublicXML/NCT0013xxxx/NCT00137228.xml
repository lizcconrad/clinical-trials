    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the reliability and concurrent validity of the
      figure-of-eight method of measuring hand edema in the burn patient population. Establishing
      the reliability and validity would enable a more time efficient assessment than the currently
      accepted methods.

    <textblock>
      A prospective study involving 33 burn patients admitted to the US Army Burn Center. Two
      raters will perform three separate blinded measurements for hand edema using the
      figure-of-eight measurement technique. A third rater will then perform two blinded
      measurements using water volumetry. All measurements will be read and recorded by an
      independent recorder. The three measurements of rater 1 and 2 will be analyzed to determine
      intratester reliability. The average of the three figure-of-eight measurements will be
      compared to measure intertester reliability. The two volumetry measurements will be compared
      to determine intratester reliability. The average of the 2 volumetry measurements and the
      average fo the three figure-of-eight measurements will be used to determine concurrent
      validity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female 18-89 years old

          -  Admitted to the United States (U.S.) Army Burn Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or ward with
             burn injury and the presence of bilateral or unilateral hand edema

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject unable to be placed in test position for volumetry testing or the presence of
             a medical condition, as defined by a physician, that precludes the safe use of
             volumetry.

          -  Subject is unable to tolerate his/her hand(s) being immersed in room temperature water
             for volumetry testing.

          -  Subject does not have any of the bony landmarks (due to amputation, previous surgery)
             required to perform the figure-of-eight measurement
