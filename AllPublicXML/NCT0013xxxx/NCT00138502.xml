  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that a subpopulation of patients with
      candiduria are at significant risk for disseminated disease and would benefit from treatment,
      while others are at low risk from complications and therefore require no antifungal therapy.

      This protocol will attempt to generate a detailed clinical profile of patients with funguria
      and identify subgroups of patients with funguria at high risk for candiduria and determine
      the relative risks for obtaining candiduria. In addition, it will look at identifying
      subgroups of patients with funguria at high risk for candidemia and identifying subgroups of
      patients with funguria at high risk for death. Finally, it will attempt to determine if
      funguria independently predicts fungemia or death. Data will be complemented by surveillance
      of a comparable population without funguria.
