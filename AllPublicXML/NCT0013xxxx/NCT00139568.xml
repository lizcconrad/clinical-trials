  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tegaserod is an aminoguanidine indole compound and a member of a new class of
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonists. Activation of 5-HT4 receptors triggers the release of
      neurotransmitters from the enteric nerves which in turn stimulate contractility and
      peristalsis. This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of tegaserod against chronic
      constipation in a Chinese population of adult men and women
