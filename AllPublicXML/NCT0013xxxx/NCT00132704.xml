  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors will take some tissue from the tissue removed during surgery in order to study how
      the blood vessels of the tumor respond to radiation therapy. The tissue obtained will be used
      to determine how these tumor blood vessels respond to radiation therapy delivered to the
      tumor, after it has been removed. This radiation is delivered in the research lab. This
      research is being conducted in order to develop new methods to treat tumors by radiation
      therapy. No additional surgery will be performed to obtain these samples, and only materials
      that remain after all diagnostic testing has been completed will be used.

      The goal of this study is to determine if concepts established in mouse models of the tumor
      microvascular response to ionizing radiation (IR) therapy are applicable to human tumors in
      order to begin to establish that the engagement of the endothelial response is a valid target
      for IR in human tumors. A portion of tumor will be isolated from individuals who have signed
      informed consent for this protocol and are undergoing surgery on the Neurosurgery,
      Colorectal, and Gynecology, Head and Neck, Urology, and Hepatobiliary Services at Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Tumor tissue will be obtained from the surgical sample in
      pathology after adequate specimens have been obtained for diagnostic purposes. Tumor tissue
      will be irradiated ex vivo and the microvascular endothelial response will be determined.
      From specimens of adequate size, a pure tumor endothelial cell population will be isolated
      and the response to IR will be determined.

      Primary Outcomes:

        -  To determine if human tumor microvascular endothelium displays similar dose parameters
           as mouse tumor endothelium.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        -  To determine if tumor endothelium isolated to near homogeneity demonstrates dose
           parameters similar to those used in single dose radiotherapy of brain tumors.

        -  To determine if the microvascular endothelium of tumors of different types behaves in a
           similar fashion in its response to IR.

    <description>Tumors will be sliced into 0.5cm fragments, incubated in culture medium and then irradiated to evaluate the kinetics and dose-dependencies of the endothelial apoptotic response. We will irradiate tumor fragments ex vivo at 0, 7, 13, 15, 17, and 25 Gy.</description>

    <description>Tissue fragments of a total quantity of at least a 4x4x4 cm3 will be required. For each tumor a paraffin block will also be made for routine staining and IHC. Endothelial cell populations (at least 500 cells) will then be exposed to radiation at 0, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 25 Gy and harvested at 4, 5 and 8 hours post IR.</description>
