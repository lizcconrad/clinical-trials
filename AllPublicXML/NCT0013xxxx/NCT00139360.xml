  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy as measured by objective tumor response of first-line treatment of
      metastatic melanoma with bevacizumab monotherapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Norway, cutaneous malignant melanoma is the second most frequent and the most frequent
      cancer type in middle-aged (30-54 years) females and males, respectively, and the incidence
      has six-doubled during the last 30 years. Median survival for patients with metastatic
      melanoma is 6 months.

      Many agents have been investigated for anti-tumor effect in melanoma, but there is no
      accepted standard therapy. Biochemotherapy, combining cytotoxic drugs with Interleukin-2 or
      Interferon alpha, has not been shown to be superior to single agent Dacarbazine (DTIC), which
      is regarded to be the most active agent. Other biological approaches like vaccination are
      currently under investigation, but still no efficient treatment for metastatic melanoma is
      available. DTIC induces objective remission in 20% of the patients, but without significant
      impact on survival.

      The need of a new and effective treatment for the group of melanoma patients is urgently
      needed. This will be the first study to assess response rates of bevacizumab monotherapy in
      first line treatment of metastatic melanoma. In addition there will be a major focus on the
      identification of predictive biomarkers of bevacizumab efficacy.

        LEVEL A (second line): after confirmed progression on standard first line treatment with
        dacarbazine.

        LEVEL B (first line): when objective clinical response is observed in LEVEL A, patients
        will be included for first line treatment with bevacizumab

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic (unresectable) melanoma and with progressive
             disease

          -  WHO performance status 0-2

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Able to undergo outpatient treatment

          -  Recovered from prior chemotherapy

          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to study
             treatment start. Biopsy or fine needle aspiration within 5 days prior to study
             treatment start. Central venous line placement must be inserted at least 5 days prior
             to treatment start.

          -  Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given
             according to national and local regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:
