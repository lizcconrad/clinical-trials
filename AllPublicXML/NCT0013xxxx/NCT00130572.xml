  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether topical applied pimecrolimus will lead to
      improvement of erosive oral lichen planus. This effect will be monitored by reduction of
      erosive mucosal area and reduction of patient's pain symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus is a mucosal inflammatory disease of unknown origin. It can be very
      painful especially if erosions appear on the oral mucosa.

      In this study the efficacy of pimecrolimus compared to placebo in treatment of erosive oral
      lichen planus will be investigated. To this end the subjective pain and the amount of
      affected mucosa will be monitored before and after treatment.
