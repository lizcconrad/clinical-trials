  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether changing antiepileptic medication can reduce
      side effects and improve the quality of life in patients with epileptic seizures that are
      well controlled with antiepileptic drugs.

      Background. The aim of the treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is to achieve seizure
      freedom without causing side effects. Assessment of side effects is difficult. They may start
      insidiously, the patient may not associate certain complaints with the use of AEDs, or the
      treating physician does not take enough time to discuss this topic during the limited time of
      a visit in the outpatient department. We know from clinical trials that side effects occur in
      a substantial group of patients. We do not know whether we deal with this possible
      complication in an adequate way in clinical practice.

      Study objective. To study whether adjustment of medication will reduce the occurrence of side
      effects and improve quality of life.

      Study design. A randomised clinical trial comparing adjustment of treatment in case of
      relevant side effects to continuing treatment unchanged. Relevant side effects are defined as
      at least one moderate or serious problem scored on a questionnaire to assess complaints in
      people with epilepsy.

      Patients who do not report relevant side effects will be followed for 13 months (arm A) in
      which two visits are scheduled, after 7 and 13 months respectively.

      The patients who do report relevant side effects will be randomised to either discussion of
      the questionnaire results and adjustment of treatment if appropriate (arm B) or to ignore the
      results of the questionnaire and continue treatment unchanged (arm C). Investigations will be
      repeated in both groups after 7 and 13 months after the initial visit.
