  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new investigational acute myeloblastic
      leukemia (AML) vaccine and see what effects (good and bad) it has on patients with advanced
      myelodysplasia or acute myelogenous leukemia.

      This study will make use of leukemic myeloblasts harvested by bone marrow aspirate in
      patients with myelodysplasia and acute myelogenous leukemia. These harvested tumor cells will
      be modified by adenoviral mediated gene transfer to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

      Patients will be administered vaccines at one of three dose levels (as determined by total
      cell yield). Vaccinations will be given weekly for three weeks, followed by every other week
      until the vaccine supply is exhausted or when patients are removed from the study.

      The patient will receive a minimum of six vaccinations, but more will be administered if the
      vaccine is available.

      During the course of the study, patients will be tested to see how their immune system is
      reacting to the vaccinations. Testing will include bloodwork evaluating the immune cells in
      the body at monthly intervals. Skin biopsies may also be performed to see if an immune
      reaction is occuring at the injection site.

      During the first course of treatment, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate may be performed
      monthly.

      The length of time on this study depends upon the number of vaccines available and whether or
      not unacceptable side effects occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologically documented myelodysplasia or acute myelogenous
             leukemia.

          -  The patients with myelodysplasia must also have: French-American-British (FAB) subtype

          -  The patients with acute myelogenous leukemia must also: not be candidates for
             myelosuppressive chemotherapy due to age or comorbid disease, or have relapsed acute
             myelogenous leukemia or be refractory to standard therapy and not likely to require
             cytoreductive therapy within 60 days

             glucocorticoid therapy (non-glucocorticoid hormonal therapy allowed).

          -  Greater than 2 months following bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell
             transplantation or treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI).

          -  The patients with myelodysplasia who have either: FAB subtype refractory anemia (RA),
             refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
             (CMML), or the presence of hypocellular bone marrow.

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or systemic steroid therapy within the last
             4 weeks.
