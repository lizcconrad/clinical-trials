  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the purpose of this study to determine the concentration of 3 allergens
      (goldnatriumthiosulphate, methyldibromoglutharonitrile [MDBGN], parthenolide) for diagnosing
      allergic contact dermatitis.

    <textblock>
      The TRUE Test standard panel consists of two tape strips, panel 1 with 11 allergen patches
      and a negative control and panel 2, with 12 allergen patches. TRUE test panel 1 and 2 contain
      23 of the most frequent contact allergens.With these 23 allergens, it is possible to detect
      about 60-70% of contact allergic reactions. Thus, there is a need for expanding the number of
      allergens included in TRUE Test in order to detect more contact allergic reactions. Therefore
      goldnatriumthiosulphate, methyldibromoglutharonitrile and parthenolide are developed for
      inclusion in a third TRUE Test panel. This study is a dose-response study using 3 dilution
      series to detect the optimum concentration of the 3 allergens. A phase-III study will be
      performed afterwards to establish the efficacy and safety of the three allergens.

             test within the latest 5 years or positive Goldnatriumthiosulphate patch test within
             the latest 5 years.

          -  Age more or equal to 18 years.

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:
