      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Seprafilm in reducing the incidence
      of bowel obstruction and to evaluate the incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs)
      associated with the use of Seprafilm occurring within 30 days postoperatively, and the
      incidence of abdominopelvic abscess within 6 months postoperatively.
