  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about vivax malaria in very young children, how
      the growth of children is affected by malaria infections, and how inherited traits protect
      children from getting malaria. Participants will be 266 children 24 months of age or younger
      who live in certain villages in East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, where malaria is very
      common. The study also will find out how malaria spreads in the area. By learning how and
      when a child develops resistance to vivax malaria, researchers can try to find ways to help
      people from getting it. And, they can get a better understanding of how inherited traits
      influence all types of malaria infections. In this study, the parent and child will be
      visited by the study team or health workers every week to check health and bednet use. Every
      2 weeks, the study team will take a small blood sample to check for malaria and take
      measurements to study the child's growth. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years.

      This study specifically seeks to document infection by Plasmodium species parasites in a
      prospective longitudinal study using blood smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/Ligase
      Detection Reaction (LDR) diagnostic techniques and to determine when a child becomes
      susceptible to blood-stage malaria in a cohort of non-immune children from villages where a
      genetic polymorphism that blocks expression of Duffy (Fy) blood group antigen has been
      identified. The goal of this project is to prospectively study the natural history of
      Plasmodium vivax malaria in a malaria-endemic region of Papua New Guinea among a cohort of
      children 24 months of age and older for a period of up to two years. The primary objectives
      of this study are to: 1) determine the mean time to first P. vivax infection, and 2)
      determine the incidence rate of P. vivax infection. The secondary objectives of this study
      are to: 1) assess the impact of recurrent Plasmodium infections on child growth, 2) estimate
      the sensitivity and specificity of blood smear versus PCR-based diagnostic methods for P.
      vivax infection, and 3) evaluate the effect of the FY genotype on P. vivax malaria.
      Cross-sectional malaria prevalence data based on blood smear diagnosis suggest that the risk
      of malaria is extremely low during infancy in this population. Therefore, at the start of the
      study, children 12 months of age and younger will be eligible for the study, and all new
      births occurring over the next 15 months will be added to the cohort ensuring that the last
      newborn will have a minimum of 9 months of follow-up. All children enrolled in this study
      will be followed weekly to detect clinical malaria and biweekly blood samples will be taken
      for the detection of asymptomatic malaria. Follow-up will continue for a period of up to 2
      years until participants reach 24 months of age, or withdraw from the study or until the
      study ends, whichever event comes first.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria are applicable to this study. All three of the inclusion criteria
        must be met.

        &lt; = 12 months of age at the time of eligibility assessment Residence in a designated study
        village Parental / legal guardian consent

        Participants who move outside the study area during the course of the study will be dropped
        from further participation. However, data collected to that point may be included in
        statistical analyses. Parental consent to study is essential. No blood samples or
        measurements will be taken on a child without informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following exclusion criteria are applicable to this study. Any one or more of the
        criteria is sufficient to exclude study participation.

        &gt; 12 months of age at the time of eligibility assessment Chronic illness, severe
        malnutrition, permanent disability, or a congenital malformation that prevents or impedes
        study participation Short-term, temporary residence (less than 6 months) in a designated
        study village Residence in a village outside of the study area Parental refusal to consent
        to study
