  <brief_title>Benefit of Adding Trastuzumab to Second Line Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated With Trastuzumab</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients must receive vinorelbine plus capecitabine, with or without trastuzumab,
      until disease progression or unbearable toxicity. Cycles will be administered every 3 weeks.
      HER2 status must be locally assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All 3+ patients are
      eligible. In 2+ patients, HER2 status must be confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization
      (FISH).

      Principal outcome is clinical benefit (complete + partial responses + stable disease). Sample
      size in each arm has been estimated with the Fleming method. Previous data show a clinical
      benefit rate of vinorelbine plus capecitabine around 50%. The researchers assume trastuzumab
      can increase it by 20%. With an alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power, 37 patients per arm are
      needed.

      This is a randomised phase II trial. With a minimum expected benefit rate of 50%, at least 36
      patients are needed to choose, with a 90% of probability to be right, the best treatment arm,
      providing it increases benefit rate at least by 15%.

      Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, the total number of patients needed is 82, 41 per treatment
      arm.

      Patients will be stratified as per investigational site, and presence of visceral metastatic
      lesion (liver, lung, pleura, heart, peritoneum, suprarenal glands). All patients must receive
      2 cycles. If no disease progression is detected, treatment must continue until progression or
      unbearable toxicity.
