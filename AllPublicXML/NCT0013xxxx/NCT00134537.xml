    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below for participation in
        the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 18-60; male/female.

          -  Diagnosis of mild to moderate degenerative disc disease (DDD), which requires:

               -  back pain of at least 30/100 as measured on a visual analog scale, with or
                  without leg (radicular) pain; and

               -  radiographic confirmation of the following, as determined by computed tomography
                  (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), discography, plain film, myelography
                  and/or flexion/extension films: up to Modic I changes on MRI, with decreased disc
                  height up to 50% of adjacent level, and no significant osteophytes; with or
                  without a contained disc herniation.

          -  Candidate for either surgery with Wallis or aggressive conservative management.

          -  Requires treatment at one or two lumbar levels between L1 and L5.

          -  Experienced symptoms for at least three months without significant resolution.

          -  Has undergone a regimen of at least four weeks of anti-inflammatory medication for the
             current episode of back pain and had exposure to physical therapy.

          -  Minimum baseline Oswestry score of 30% (15/50).

          -  Physically and mentally able to comply with the protocol, including ability to read
             and complete required forms, and willing and able to adhere to the follow-up
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  Voluntarily signs the subject informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant neuroforaminal compression requiring discectomy or foraminotomy

          -  Radiographic evidence of DDD at L5-S1

          -  Radiographic confirmation of severe facet joint disease or degeneration.

          -  History of any lumbar disc treatment intended to remove the disc, e.g. surgery,
             intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET), laser or enzymes such as chymopapain.

          -  Clinically compromised vertebral bodies at the affected level due to current or past
             trauma, e.g., sustained pathological fracture or multiple fractures of vertebrae.

          -  Unwilling to comply with 8 weeks of physical therapy.

          -  Subject refuses to consider epidural or facet injections for leg or back pain.

          -  Active systemic infection or infection at the operative site

          -  Osteoporosis. The Simple Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation (SCORE) questionnaire
             will be used to screen subjects for osteoporosis; subjects whose screening suggests
             risk will undergo a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. Subjects will be
             excluded if the DEXA scan results indicate a T-score equal to or worse than -2.5, in
             accordance with the World Health Organization definition of osteoporosis.

          -  Paget's disease, osteomalacia, or any other metabolic bone disease other than
             osteoporosis, which is addressed above

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or other autoimmune disease

          -  AIDS, HIV, or Hepatitis

          -  Known allergy to titanium, polyetheretherketone, or polyester

          -  Current pathological lesions, such as tumor

          -  Congenital lumbar spinal stenosis

          -  Clinically relevant instability on flexion-extension as determined by the investigator
             by overlaying films.

          -  Cauda equina syndrome

          -  Pregnant at time of enrollment or with plans to become pregnant within the next three
             years

          -  Concomitant conditions requiring steroid treatment or prior steroid usage for more
             than one of the preceding three months

          -  Diabetes mellitus requiring daily insulin management

          -  Extreme obesity, as defined by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Guidelines
             (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 35)

          -  Fusion previously performed at the same or an adjacent level; or other instrumented
             spinal surgery at the operative level.

          -  Prior participation in study of any experimental spinal implant or treatment

          -  Pending litigation against a health care professional

          -  Life expectancy of less than three years

          -  History of any invasive malignancy (except for non-melanoma skin cancer), unless

             surgical correction

          -  Kyphosis requiring surgical correction
