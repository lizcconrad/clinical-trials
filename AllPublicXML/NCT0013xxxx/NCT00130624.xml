  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine whether multidisciplinary assessment of community-based patients,
      who have had at least one previous fall, reduces the rate of further falls and fall-related
      problems. The study also aims to determine whether such an intervention, if effective, is
      best carried out in a primary or secondary care setting.

      BACKGROUND INFORMATION

      At least one in three people aged sixty five and over are reported to fall in the community
      each year and in the very elderly this figure is nearer 40 % (1,2). The morbidity and
      mortality resulting from falls in the elderly is substantial and the costs associated with
      such falls are likely to rise with the predicted growth in the elderly population. The Health
      of the Nation document recognises that falls are an important cause of disability and use of
      the health service in older people (3). More than 50% of accidental deaths in those aged
      sixty five years and over are due to falls, and survivors of falls have a tow-fold increased
      chance of being hospitalised (4). The target of the Health of the Nation is to reduce the
      death rate for accidents among people aged sixty five and over by at least 33% by the year
      2005 (3). Prevention of falls and fall-related injuries will be a major factor in achieving
      such targets. It is therefore wise that approaches which are appropriate and likely to be
      effective are adequately researched and implemented if indicated. There have been a number of
      approaches to studying the prevention of falls, and their sequelae, in the elderly and these
      are explored in the accompanying literature review.

      AIM

      To determine whether multidisciplinary assessment of community-based patients, who have had
      at least one previous fall, reduces the rate of further falls and fall-related problems. The
      study also aims to determine whether such an intervention, if effective, is best carried out
      in a primary or secondary care setting.

      STUDY DESIGN

      A secondary prevention randomised controlled trial of two different settings for the
      multidisciplinary intervention versus “usual care”.

      Randomisation will be done prior to allocation on a cluster basis. This means that the
      principal liaising General Practitioner in each practice will sign consent to volunteering
      their “cluster” involvement in the study (this will also set out their duties to their
      patients). The reason for this type of randomisation is to avoid “contamination” of usual
      care patients which would be likely if a General Practitioner were receiving regular
      information about patients who were in an intervention arm of the trial. Assent to study
      participation would also be sought from all individuals, without their first knowing the
      precise nature of the intervention (5) so as to allow follow up of the control group.
      Subjects recruited to the intervention groups would receive an information sheet outlining
      the study and what the intervention would involve and assent would be sought.

      STUDY SIZE

      It is thought that the trial will involve approximately 516 patients in total. A recent local
      pilot study of a smaller falls related project identified 70 patients in 9 months in a
      practice with a list of 17,000 patients. It is expected that the total population base from
      which patients will be identified will be 60,000. It is likely that the number required to
      participate will be identified over a one year period. Power calculations indicate that to
      provide a good chance of achieving a statistically significant result approximately 150
      individuals will be needed in each of the three arms of the study.

      INTERVENTION

      There are two intervention groups.

      The first intervention group will undergo a multidisciplinary assessment by a physician,
      occupational therapist and physiotherapist (see enclosed assessment form) based in a falls
      clinic at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital (RHCH). All patients will have full blood
      count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, Vitamin D level,
      bone profile, electrocardiogram and urinalysis. Further investigation, treatment modification
      and onward referral will be made as appropriate and relevant to each individual. The
      patient’s General Practitioner will receive written communication regarding the visit,
      outcome and further recommendations.

      The second intervention group will under go a Community-based process. All identified fallers
      will undergo an assessment by a health worker in each participating practice. This
      individual, identified within the practice, and trained in the assessment of fallers by staff
      at the RHCH Falls Clinic, will administer a questionnaire, and make referrals to
      physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and the patients own General Practitioner as deemed
      necessary. Individuals who score particularly highly or are considered appropriate by the
      Primary Care team may still be referred onward to the Hospital Falls Clinic.

      SUBJECTS

      Patients aged over 65 years of age who are identified in the community as having had at least
      one fall in the preceding month and who live in one of the participating areas. Subject
      identification will be opportunistic and also through the ambulance service notifying the key
      worker in a practice when a patient has fallen at home but not been transferred elsewhere.

      A fall is defined as “inadvertently coming to rest on the ground or other lower level with or
      without loss of consciousness and other than as a consequence of sudden onset of paralysis,
      epileptic seizure, excess alcohol intake or overwhelming external force (as per Close et al
      (6)).

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        -  Abbreviated mental test score of less than 7 out of 10

        -  Not living in the participating areas

        -  Planning to move from the area within the next year

        -  Not expected to survive for the follow up period of one year

        -  Non-English speakers who do not have a relative/carer who could interpret

      METHODOLOGY

      Patients will be identified by a key worker in each participating General Practice Surgery. A
      baseline assessment will then be done either in the patient’s own home or the local surgery
      by the key worker (district nurse/practice nurse/health visitor). The assessment will be
      mostly questionnaire based and will seek information on basic demographic data, living
      circumstances, Barthel score, abbreviated mental test score, circumstances of most recent
      (index) fall and injuries sustained, information regarding previous falls in the last year,
      risk factors for osteoporosis, 5 point Geriatric Depression Score, and Elderly Falls Test
      Score score. A timed “get up and go” will also be done. All assessors will be trained in the
      administration of the assessment to reduce inter-assessor variability.

      The patients in the intervention groups will attend for assessment in the Falls Clinic or in
      the primary care setting as described above.

      Those in the conventional management group will receive usual care from their primary care
      team.

      All subjects will be sent a paid reply postcard monthly on which to record any falls and fall
      injuries. If this is not returned the subject will be telephoned (when possible). If a fall
      has been recorded the patient will be contacted by telephone for further details.

      After one year the baseline assessment will be repeated. Data will be analysed on an
      intention to treat basis.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT

        -  Proportion of participants in each group to have at least one further fall during follow
           up year

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

        -  Death

        -  Move to institutional care

        -  Change in Barthel score

        -  Change in “Get up and go” score

        -  Fall related admissions during follow-up period

        -  Fall related fractures

      DISSEMINATION

      It is intended that this trial will be subject to peer review and publication will be sought.
      Dissemination of information to local practices and interested parties via presentations.
