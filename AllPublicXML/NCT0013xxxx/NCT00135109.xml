  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 3 trial is being conducted at approximately 80 sites in the United States (U.S.)
      to investigate whether lacosamide (SPM 927) at different doses reduces pain in subjects with
      diabetic neuropathy. Approximately 455 subjects will be randomized to placebo or to one of
      three doses of lacosamide. To qualify for this trial, subjects with symptoms of painful
      distal diabetic neuropathy ranging in duration from 6 months to 5 years must have an average
      pain intensity of greater than or equal to 4 on an 11-point Likert scale (0-10 scale) during
      the 7 day period prior to the start of treatment.

      To determine what effect lacosamide has on diabetic neuropathic pain, subjects will use a
      diary to record their daily pain intensity (morning and evening; and pain interference with
      sleep (morning) and activity (evening). Use of rescue medication (acetaminophen) and
      subjects' quality of life will be investigated. In addition, the safety and tolerability of
      the different doses of lacosamide will be investigated.
