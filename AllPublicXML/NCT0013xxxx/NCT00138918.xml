      The purpose of this trial is to assess the effects of combined therapy with androgen ablation
      and OGX-011 (an antisense to clusterin) given prior to radical prostatectomy on pathologic
      complete response rates in men with localized prostate cancer and high risk features.

    <textblock>
      Clusterin as an anti-apoptotic cytoprotective chaperone protein upregulated in an adaptive
      cell survival manner that confers resistance to various cell death triggers, including
      hormone-, radiation-, and chemotherapy. In pre-clinical models, inhibition of clusterin
      expression using the second generation antisense OGX-011 can enhance cell death following
      treatment with androgen ablation, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. In phase I clinical trials,
      OGX-011 has been well tolerated and a biologically effective dose has been identified in
      humans.

      Study Design

      This is an open-label, non-blinded, phase II clinical, tissue pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic study of weekly OGX-011 and neoadjuvant hormone therapy prior to radical
      prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate carcinoma and high-risk features.

      Study Objectives

      Primary Objectives

        -  To assess the effects of combined neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) and OGX-011 prior to
           radical prostatectomy on pathologic complete response rates in men with high risk
           localized prostate cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To quantify changes in clusterin expression in residual prostate cancer after treatment
           with NHT and OGX-011.

        -  To measure levels of full length OGX-011 in prostate tissues after 3 months of NHT.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability toxicity of 3 months of OGX-011 and NHT prior to
           radical prostatectomy.

        -  To measure evidence of OGX-011's effect on clusterin expression in patient peripheral
           blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC).

        -  To measure evidence of OGX-011's effect on patient clusterin serum levels.

        -  To assess the effects of combined NHT and OGX-011 on time to PSA nadir.

        -  To determine PSA recurrence rates after combined NHT and OGX-011.

      Key Eligibility Criteria

        1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, previously untreated

        2. Potential candidate for radical prostatectomy

        3. Any one of the following criteria (minimum of 2 positive biopsies):

             -  Clinical stage T3

             -  Serum PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml

             -  Gleason score 7-10

             -  Gleason score 6 and &gt; 3 positive biopsies

        4. ECOG performance status 0-1

        5. WBC ≥ 3.0 x 10^9/L

        6. Hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L

        7. Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

        8. PTT, INR, AST, ALT, creatinine, total bilirubin within normal limits

      Treatment Plan

      Approximately 45 newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients with clinically localized,
      high-risk prostate carcinoma will be entered into this trial. These patients will receive
      neoadjuvant hormone therapy (buserelin 9.9 mg subcutaneously x 1 injection with flutamide 250
      mg orally T.I.D. for the first 4 weeks only) for 12 weeks in combination with OGX-011 (a
      2'MOE phosphorothioate clusterin antisense oligonucleotide) weekly on a 4 week cycle for 3
      courses. For week one, cycle one only, OGX-011 will be given on Days 1, 3 and 5. OGX-011 is
      given at a dose of 640 mg by intravenous infusion over 2 hours. Radical prostatectomy will
      take place within 14 days of the last dose of OGX-011.
