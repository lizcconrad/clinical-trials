      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether topically applied constituents of green
      tea [caffeine or (-)-epigallocatechin gallate; EGCG] have a protective effect on skin exposed

      The purpose of this study is to investigate if topically applied constituents of green tea
      [caffeine or (-) - epigallocatechin gallate; EGCG] have a protective effect on skin exposed
      to ultraviolet light (UV). In the double-blinded study all subjects will receive 311
      nanometer UVB light at a dose that is 0.5-1.5X their individual minimal erythema dose (MED).
      One part of the experiment will involve applying a topical natural product (caffeine or EGCG)
      and placebo to bilateral symmetric sites. The natural product and the placebo will be applied
      immediately after and at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 25
      hours, and 27 hours after exposure to a 0.5-1.5 MED dose of UV light. Another part of the
      study involves performing skin biopsies. One will be done prior to UVB exposure, 2 will be
      done at 24 hours and 2 more will be done at 48 hours.

    <description>The mean change in number of active caspase-3+ apoptotic keratinocytes between 0- and 48-hour time points was calculated for skin biopsy samples of subjects who had been exposed to UVB on symmetrical right and left test sites which were then randomized to receive active test substance (EGCG or caffeine) or placebo (vehicle) at sequential time points after UVB exposure.</description>

Scoring was performed immediately after UVB exposure and at sequential time points thereafter. The mean scores at 48 hr were calculated.</description>

Scoring was performed immediately after UVB exposure and at sequential time points thereafter. The erythema scores at 6, 8, and 24 hr post-UVB were averaged.</description>
