  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tennis elbow is a painful condition that results from repetitive arm movement with overuse of
      muscles, e.g. when playing tennis. A single injection of ALGRX 4975 has the potential to
      reduce pain for a period of weeks to months. This study will test the efficacy and safety of
      ALGRX 4975 in the treatment of patients with tennis elbow.

    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a painful condition that affects 4 to 7 adults per
      1000 annually and tends to involve the subject’s dominant side. It typically results from
      repetitive arm movement with over use of muscles leading to small tears in the tendons
      attaching muscles of the forearm to the epicondyles that may progress to tendonitis. Pain on
      or around the lateral epicondyle may radiate down the subject’s arm. Gripping or extending
      the wrist often intensifies the pain.

      More than 40 possible treatments have been proposed, reflecting a lack of consensus about
      optimal management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat
      tennis elbow, but there are no trials to date that have compared them with other painkillers
      and one study found no clinically important benefit over placebo. Use of corticosteroid
      injections provides mixed results in relief of pain and at times insufficient evidence to
      support their use. Although complications associated with steroid injection are relatively
      uncommon, when a complication does occur, it can result in severe and disabling consequences
      for the subject. A small proportion of subjects fail to respond to only one injection of
      corticosteroid and some subjects who initially improved at four weeks had worse symptoms by
      six months.

      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single soft tissue
      injection of ALGRX 4975 at a dose of 100 µg in comparison to placebo in subjects with acute
      LE.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute lateral epicondylitis (LE) of less than 3 months duration (subjects with
             recurrent acute LE may be included).

          -  A screening and baseline severity of pain on resisted wrist dorsiflexion score of
             moderate or greater intensity.

          -  Lidocaine responsive.

          -  A systolic and diastolic blood pressure not greater than 140 and 95 mm Hg,
             respectively.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant form of joint disease, elbow trauma or neuromuscular
             disorder at the elbow, other than acute LE.

          -  Physiotherapy treatment within the preceding 2 weeks, prior to Visit 1.

          -  Any systemic or local corticosteroids within the preceding 3 months, except nasal or
             inhaled steroids at less than or equal to 1000 mcg/day.

          -  A medical condition other than LE that requires the use of a pain medication.

          -  A peripheral sensory or motor neuropathy involving the upper extremities.
