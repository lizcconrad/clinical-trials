  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to improve nurse skills regarding neuropathic pain
      (NP) assessment, treatment and referral practices through implementation of an evidence-based
      algorithm and to improve selected patient outcomes as a result of algorithm use.

      Neuropathic pain (NP) is defined as pain that arises from injury, disease or dysfunction of
      the central or peripheral nervous system. For the patient focused phase of the project NP
      treatment will be guided via the Peripheral Neuropathy Treatment Algorithm. Patients will
      receive algorithm-specific treatment for 12 weeks.
