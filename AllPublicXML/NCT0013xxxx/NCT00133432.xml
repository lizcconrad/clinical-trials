    <textblock>
      Undernutrition in children less than five years of age is common throughout sub-Saharan
      Africa. Nutritional deficiencies may lead to less ability to fight infectious diseases. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether zinc supplements plus standard antibiotics
      reduce the length of hospitalization in children with pneumonia. Six hundred children aged
      6-36 months diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted to Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Dar
      es Salaam, Tanzania, will participate in this study. Half of the children will receive daily
      supplements of zinc, and the other half will receive placebo tablets (dummy pills containing
      no medication). Each child will be followed for 6 weeks after hospital discharge to check for
      recovery from the illness. All children in both groups will receive antibiotics and
      supportive care to manage pneumonia, according to the standards of care at MNH and Amana
      Municipal Hospital in accordance with the Recommendations of the Ministry of Health,
      Tanzania.

      Undernutrition in children less than five years of age is prevalent throughout sub-Saharan
      Africa and is often associated with multiple micronutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin A
      and zinc. These deficiencies are probably a reflection of the poverty and poor living
      conditions that contribute to the lack of proper nutrition. The potential adverse effect of
      even subclinical deficiency in various micronutrients (including zinc) on optimal
      physiological function may lead to an exacerbation of infectious diseases in children living
      in these parts of the world. The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is to determine whether oral zinc supplementation plus standard
      antibiotics significantly alters the duration of required hospitalization in children with
      radiologically confirmed acute pneumonia. Six hundred children aged six months to 36 months
      diagnosed with radiologically confirmed acute pneumonia and admitted in the general pediatric
      wards of Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, will be recruited. Upon
      enrollment, half of the subjects will receive daily oral supplements of 25 mg of elemental
      zinc and the control group will receive placebo tablets. Children randomized to receive zinc
      supplements will be given a daily dose of 25 mL of reconstituted solution from effervescent
      tablets equivalent to 25 mg of elemental zinc in two divided doses (12.5 mg twice daily) by a
      study coordinator during the hospital phase of treatment for pneumonia. Children randomized
      to the control group will receive placebo effervescent tablets identical in taste and
      appearance to those tablets containing zinc. Compliance to the regimen will be directly
      observed by the study coordinator, and clinical response will be closely monitored throughout
      hospital stay. Each child will be followed for six weeks after hospital discharge to assess
      for recovery from the illness. All children in both groups will receive antibiotics and
      supportive care to manage pneumonia, as deemed appropriate according to the standards of care
      as practiced at MNH and Amana Municipal Hospital in accordance with the Recommendations of
      the Ministry of Health, Tanzania.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age six months to 36 months inclusive.

          2. A primary clinical diagnosis of acute pneumonia, which consists of a child presenting
             with cough or difficulty breathing with the following features:

               1. Tachypnea: Respiratory rate greater than or equal to 50 breaths per minute for
                  children aged 6 months up to 12 months and greater than or equal to 40 breaths
                  per minute for children aged 12 months to 36 months.

               2. Fever: Temperature greater than or equal to 37.5 degrees Celsius with an axillary
                  thermometer.

               3. Any one of the following signs: Flaring of alae nasi, visible indrawing of the
                  lower chest wall muscles on inspiration, central cyanosis, inability to feed,
