  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind placebo-controlled trial is designed to test and to compare the
      cardiovascular profile of paroxetine controlled release (CR) with duloxetine in outpatients
      with depressive symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind placebo-controlled study will test the hypothesis that greater reduction in
      heart rate variability will be associated with duloxetine than paroxetine in outpatients with
      major depressive disorder. We will also examine the relationship between changes in heart
      rate variability to the magnitude of serotonin and norepinephrine transporter occupancy
      produced by each drug.
