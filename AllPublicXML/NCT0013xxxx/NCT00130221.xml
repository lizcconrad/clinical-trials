  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the intensive care unit are at risk for many infections because the severity of
      illness and the procedures necessary to care for them. This study is designed to look at a
      change in bathing procedure as a method to reduce infections. Currently, patients at John H.
      Stroger Hospital are cleansed with soap and water. However, preliminary data from a previous
      study at Rush University Medical Center showed that a chlorhexidine (CHG)-impregnated cloth
      (2% CHG Antiseptic Cloth system, Sage Products, Inc.) decreased skin bacteria and may lessen
      bacteria in the blood stream. The 2% CHG Antiseptic Cloth system is a non-irritating,
      no-rinse, cleansing and moisturizing product that contains 2% chlorhexidine gluconate. The
      goal of this proposed study is to further evaluate the effectiveness of the 2% CHG Antiseptic
      Cloth system compared with soap and water in cleansing the skin and preventing bacteria from
      entering the bloodstream.

      Patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit at John H Stroger Hospital are randomly
      assigned to Unit A or B. Unit B was randomly selected as the intervention unit. For 6 months,
      all patients in Unit B will be bathed with the 2% CHG Antiseptic Cloth system and all
      patients in Unit A will receive soap and water baths. After this 6 month period, there will
      be a 2 to 4 week washout period and the interventions will cross over, with Unit A receiving
      Chlorhexidine baths and unit B receiving soap and water for 6 months.

      Each week, two randomly selected patients will have cultures of the inguinal area,
      neck/subclavian region, and endotracheal aspirates. A comparison of the colonization of the
      skin and sputum will be done between the two intervention groups.

      Daily infection surveillance will be done on all patients in the intensive care unit. A
      comparison of blood stream infections, clinical sepsis, and other nosocomial infections will
      be done between the two intervention groups.
