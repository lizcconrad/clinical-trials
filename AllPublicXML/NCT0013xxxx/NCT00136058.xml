  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if an intervention with a fracture manager to
      arrange bone densitometry after a hip fracture is more effective in diagnosing and treating
      osteoporosis when compared to &quot;usual care&quot;. &quot;Usual care&quot; consists of no intervention to
      arrange bone mineral density (BMD) testing or therapy other than what normally occurs in the
      community. The investigators postulate that a fracture manager will be more effective in
      getting BMD done and in starting appropriate therapy.

      All hip fracture patients in the Edmonton area will be screened for eligibility (mini-mental
      status &gt;20, not on active osteoporosis pharmacologic therapy). All patients will have
      informed consent obtained. Patients will be randomized to 2 groups:

        -  Group 1: Active intervention. The fracture manager will arrange for bone densitometry
           (DEXA) to be done 3-6 months after the fracture. If the patient meets standard criteria
           for osteoporosis, therapy with a bisphosphonate (alendronate or risedronate) will be
           instituted by the study physicians.

        -  Group 2: Usual care. Patients will receive basic information about calcium and vitamin D
           and osteoporosis and told to follow up with their family doctor. At 6 months, patients
           will be contacted to determine if they have had a BMD done or started on active (drug)
           osteoporosis therapy. If not, the fracture manager will arrange the BMD and if
           appropriate therapy will be started by the study physicians.

      All patients will be followed for 1 year. The primary endpoints are the number of patients
      who get a BMD and the number who are started on active osteoporosis therapy.
