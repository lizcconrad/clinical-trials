      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating
      primary dystonia. Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting
      and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. Medical therapies are available, but not all
      patients get adequate relief from the abnormal movements or the pain associated with them.
      DBS is a surgical procedure that interrupts neuronal circuits in the globus pallidus interna
      (Gpi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) - areas of the basal ganglia of the brain that do not
      work correctly in patients with dystonia. This results in decreased movement and therefore
      may lessen patients' symptoms and pain. The study will also examine the physiology of
      dystonia and determine whether the treatment effects of DBS in the Gpi differ significantly
      from DBS of the STN.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with primary cervical dystonia that does not respond to
      medical treatment or botulinum toxin (Botox) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with blood and urine tests, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI, see below) of the brain.

      Each participant undergoes the following tests and procedures:

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging. This procedure is done after implantation of the stimulators
           to verify position of the electrodes. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to
           produce images of the brain. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner
           (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that
           occur during the scanning process. The procedure usually lasts about 45 to 90 minutes,
           during which the patient is asked to lie still for up to 15 minutes at a time.

        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation. This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is
           held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a
           magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the patient may be
           asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation
           may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the patient may hear a click
           and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. During the stimulation,
           electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer, using electrodes attached to
           the skin with tape.

        -  Neurologic evaluation. Before and after DBS, the patient's dystonia is measured with a
           standardized rating scale called the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale
           (TWSTRS).

        -  DBS treatment. Patients are randomly assigned to have electrodes implanted in either the
           Gpi or STN area of the basal ganglia. The electrodes are what stimulate the brain in DBS
           therapy. Before surgery, a frame is secured to the patient's head, and an MRI scan is
           done. DBS involves making two small incisions and two small holes in the skull, opening
           the lining around the brain, locating the Gpi or STN, securing the electrodes in place,
           and connecting them to the pulse generator that is placed under the skin below the
           collar bone. In addition, during the surgery, the patient is asked to move certain
           muscles. The muscle activity is recorded to gain a better understanding of the
           physiology of movement. After surgery, MRI scans are done to confirm placement of the
           electrodes.

        -  Stimulation and evaluation. After surgery, patients' movements are evaluated during and
           after stimulation. The changes in movement and function are videotaped and scored
           according to a rating scale. The optimal stimulation settings are determined and the
           stimulators are adjusted accordingly.

      Neurologic evaluations with the TWSTRS scale are repeated at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after
      surgery, and the stimulators are adjusted as needed. Some of the evaluations are videotaped.

      Objective: For patients with cervical dystonia who have failed medical therapy, stereotactic
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (Gpi) or subthalamic nucleus
      (STN) can provide significant symptom improvement, but it is not known which site provides
      maximum benefit or the physiologic mechanisms by which these improvements may occur. The
      study goals are to determine if DBS of Gpi or STN provides significant clinical improvement
      in patients with primary cervical dystonia, whether the anatomic DBS site (if either)
      provides optimal improvement, and to gain deeper insight into the underlying pathophysiology
      of this disorder.

      Study population: Adult patients with medically refractory primary cervical dystonia will
      make-up the study population. Patients with primary cervical dystonia suffer a wide range of
      symptoms including physical deformity, speech difficulties, swallowing dysfunction, visual
      problems, and intractable pain, which can result in an inability to care for themselves.

      Design: We propose placing DBS electrodes (using microelectrode guidance) bilaterally into
      either the Gpi or STN of medically refractory cervical dystonia patients. Physiological
      studies will be performed and compared with clinical changes to understand the mechanism of
      action of DBS and underlying pathophysiology of cervical dystonia.

      Outcome measures: Clinical effectiveness of DBS of the Gpi or STN will be measured by the
      Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale and monitored over time to determine the
      effectiveness of DBS and if there is an ideal anatomic stimulation site. Electrophysiologic
      outcome measures will be obtained to determine the underlying pathophysiology of cervical
      dystonia, and the mechanism of action of DBS.

             Baclofen must be performed, so that the pump can be taken out.

          -  Patients must have primary (idiopathic) cervical dystonia.

          -  Patients must have a minimum TWSTRS of 20 on optimal medical therapy.
