    <textblock>
      The purpose of DIME is to evaluate the safety (i.e. new onset of diabetes and other metabolic
      adverse events), efficacy and cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment with low dose
      diuretics. The researchers' hypothesis is that use of low dose thiazide diuretics is
      metabolically safe when used with other appropriate antihypertensives, effective in reduction
      of blood pressure and cheaper than treatment without diuretics. Therefore, this study is an
      equivalence trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been substantial evidence from clinical trials to support the rationale of use of
      thiazide diuretics in patients with essential hypertension. Diuretics may be more effective
      in reduction of blood pressure in Japanese patients than Caucasian because of higher salt
      intake. Moreover, given a large number of hypertensive population here, diuretics may be the
      most cost-effective antihypertensive agent. Japanese physicians, however, tend to avoid
      diuretics even in elderly hypertensive patients because of much concern over metabolic
      adverse events including new onset diabetes, which is deemed to increase cardiovascular risk.
      Although it is unlikely that use of low dose (12.5 mg of HCTZ or less) diuretics is
      associated with metabolic adverse events when they are given with any other appropriate
      antihypertensive agents (e.g. Ca antagonist, ACE inhibitor, ARB, K sparing diuretics) other
      than β-blockers, the researchers have to confirm the safety of low dose diuretics in terms of
      new onset diabetes in Japanese, who are assumed to be &quot;diabetes prone&quot; based upon thrifty
      gene hypothesis.
