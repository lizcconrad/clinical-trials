  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see if a special piece of equipment can help burn patients who have been in
      bed for a long time to get out of bed without feeling dizzy or faint.

      To measure stroke volume, cardiac output, arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow
      velocity in human patients while they undergo exposure to head-up tilt that is designed to
      test their tolerance to an orthostatic challenge.
