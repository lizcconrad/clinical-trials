      Objectives are: To confirm the safety and tolerability of 2-dose regimens of 100 g rPA
      vaccines (3 products) administered by the intramuscular (IM) route to healthy adults.To
      describe the immunologic responses to 2-dose regimens of 3 rPA vaccines and to compare the
      responses to those following administration of Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA or BioThraxTM),
      the currently available vaccine. The primary immunologic outcome is the proportion of
      volunteers in each group that mounts an antibody response (defined as a 4-fold or greater
      increase from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination of anti-rPA IgG antibody with a minimal
      concentration of 10 µg/ml as measured by ELISA). Secondary outcomes are time to peak response
      and GMC of anti-PA antibody at peak for each group. In addition, the following immunologic
      assays will be performed: toxin neutralization assay, oral fluid ELISA, antibody avidity, IgG
      subclasses, and B-cell memory,T-cell memory and effector subpopulations.

      Anthrax CVD 3000: A Phase II Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and
      Optimal Primary Schedule of 3 Recombinant Protective Antigen (rPA) Anthrax Vaccines
      Administered in Two Intramuscular Doses to Healthy Adults aged 18 to 50 years. The targeted
      number of subjects is 270.The study objectives are:To confirm the safety and tolerability of
      2-dose regimens of 100 g rPA vaccines (3 products) administered by the intramuscular (IM)

      oral fluid ELISA, antibody avidity, IgG subclasses, and B-cell memory,T-cell memory and
      effector subpopulationsThis is a two center study; in which 270 healthy adults aged 18 to 50
      years are randomly assigned to 1 of 9 groups; knowledge of rPA product received is
      double-masked, but schedule and receipt of AVA are unmasked. The duration of study
      participation is 12 months per volunteer following a screening period of no more than 30
      days: administration over a 1- to 4-week period of two doses of IM rPA or 3 doses of SQ AVA
      with 12-14 follow-up visits. A subset of the approximately 45 volunteers who have agreed to
      participate in the special immunology subgroup (those with continued antibody responses at 1
      year) will be offered extended participation beyond 1 year in which blood is drawn at 18
      months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years for examination of long-term immune responses.

                  on that day to determine accuracy. If the systolic blood pressure exceeds 150 or
                  diastolic blood pressure exceeds 90, the volunteer will be asked to return
                  another day for a repeat test. If, on repeat, either value is again elevated, the
                  volunteer will be excluded, counseled on appropriate health habits to combat
                  hypertension, and counseled to see his or her doctor.

               -  Body Mass Index above 35 or below 18, measured as weight corrected for height
                  (weight in kg/ [height in meters] squared) or weight less than 110 lbs.

               -  Other physical findings that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize
                  the safety of the subject or the evaluation of the study objectives

          4. A current psychiatric condition, including schizophrenia, personality, anxiety, or
             affective disorders, which in the opinion of the investigator will compromise the
             subject's ability to participate in the trial

          5. Known hypersensitivity to a component of one of the vaccines, including kanamycin
             (which may be found in trace amounts in rPA[V]) or other aminoglycoside antibiotics,
             aluminum hydroxide (found in each of the anthrax vaccines), form aldehyde (in AVA), or
             benzethonium chloride (in AVA).

          6. Current drug or alcohol dependence as evidenced by a four-question screening interview
             to determine whether the subject has had medical, occupational, or family problems
             related to alcohol or illicit drug use during the past 12 months. These questions are
             derived from the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST 10) developed by the Addiction
             Research Foundation and recommended by the National Institute for Drug Abuse as a tool
             for family physicians who wish to routinely screen new patients for drug abuse.

          7. History of receipt of anthrax vaccine (licensed or experimental) or history of
             diagnosis of or exposure to any form of anthrax.

          8. Positive serum or urine pregnancy test within the 24 hours prior to each vaccination.

          9. Positive blood test for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or
             syphilis (defined as positive RPR and FTA).

         10. Failure to pass the written exam.

         11. Screening laboratory values that fall outside the acceptable study allowable range as
             delineated in Appendix 1 of the protocol.

         12. Receipt of an experimental vaccine or medication within the 30 days prior to
             enrollment.

         13. Receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine within the 30 days prior to enrollment.

         14. Receipt of a subunit or killed vaccine within the 14 days prior to enrollment.

         15. Receipt of a blood product, including immunoglobulin, in the 90 days prior to
             enrollment.

         16. Donation of a unit of blood within the 56 days prior to enrollment.

         17. Anything that, in the opinion of the investigator, will compromise the participation
             of the volunteer with respect to his/her rights or risks.

         18. Oral temperature &gt; 37.7 degrees C or other acute illness occurring prior to
             inoculation on the day of vaccination. (This circumstance will lead to postponement of
             enrollment, not exclusion from the trial)
