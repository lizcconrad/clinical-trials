    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or
      chronic myelogenous leukemia. Sorafenib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity(s) (DLTs) and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of
      BAY 43-9006 given orally.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary evidence of tumor response to BAY 43-9006 in patients. II. To assess
      the pharmacokinetic profile of BAY 43-9006. III. To characterize the preliminary profile of
      adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters in patients treated with BAY 43-9006.

      IV. To assess effects of BAY 43-9006 on various cellular properties of leukemic blasts
      exposed to drug in vivo and in vitro.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-14 or 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) may be considered for retreatment with sorafenib
      for up to an additional 6 courses upon disease recurrence provided the duration of CR is
      longer than 1 month.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that which 2 of 3 or 2 of
      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for up to 1 year.

             leukemia), acute lymphocytic leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis

          -  The morphologic diagnosis of AML (non-APL), ALL, and CML in blast crisis will be made
             independently by members of the hematologic pathology division; routine staining and
             standard criteria as outlined by the Report of the NCI-Sponsored Workshop will be
             followed

          -  All patients must have been refractory to or relapsed from their most recent therapy
             AND are considered ineligible for potential curative approaches including allogeneic
             stem cell transplant; in addition, patients must be at least:

               -  3 weeks from last cytotoxic chemotherapy (excluding hydroxyurea)

               -  Hydroxyurea may be used for blast count control but must be discontinued within
                  48 hours of the initiation of BAY 43-9006

               -  2 weeks from last radiation therapy

               -  3 week from last biologic therapy (including myeloid growth factors)

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 2 months

          -  Multilineage bone marrow failure due to the subject's underlying leukemia

          -  Total blast count in the peripheral blood &lt; 30,000

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2 mg/dl

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  All women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation; the effects of BAY 43-9006 on the developing
             human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; however, kinase
             inhibitors are known to be teratogenic; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with APL are not eligible for this clinical trial

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more
             than 3 weeks earlier

          -  Patients with rapidly increasing peripheral blood blast counts (increase in the

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with BAY 43-9006

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006; appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

          -  Patients must not have any evidence of bleeding diathesis

          -  Patients must not be on therapeutic anticoagulation; prophylactic anticoagulation
             (i.e. low dose warfarin) of venous or arterial access devices is allowed provided that
             the requirements for PT, INR or PTT are met

          -  Patients must not be taking the cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs
             (phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital), rifampin or St. John's wort
