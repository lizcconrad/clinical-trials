  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a drug called ondansetron (Zofran) controls itching
      from healing burn wounds as well or better than the usual drug used, diphenhydramine
      (Benadryl).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clear mechanism or cause for pruritus in patients recovering from burn has not been
      delineated.

      While the exact mechanisms/pathways for itching are currently unclear, histamine antagonism
      appears to be the most popular treatment. Whether histamine antagonism works predominantly
      via peripheral inhibition or central sedation is uncertain. By treating another intermediary
      in the pruritus cascade, it may be possible that an alternate treatment could be used while
      eliminating some of the unwanted side effects of antihistamine at the same time.
