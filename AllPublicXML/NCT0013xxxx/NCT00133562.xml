      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 7 days supplementation of
      alanyl-glutamine or glycine on the damaged intestinal barrier function, measured by
      lactulose/mannitol test on day 8, in children with persistent diarrhea or malnutrition; on
      diarrhea frequency and duration, weight gain, protein loss, intestinal inflammation, and
      lactoferrin excretion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children ages 3 to 36 months with a history of persistent diarrhea (3 or more unformed
             stools/day) for &gt;2 weeks or height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) less than negative 1, which
             is the median of HAZ score in children at HIAS.

          2. Be an inpatient and willing to stay for 7 nights at HIAS.

          3. Child´s parent or guardian must sign informed consent..

          2. Children who participated in the community study or any other study within the past
             two years (Reason: The children in the community study will have received glutamine.)

          3. Children with suspected other illnesses as indicated by fever &gt;102º F at time of
             screening off antipyretics

          4. Children with suspected systemic disease at the time of screening including but not
             limited to shock, meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, varicella
