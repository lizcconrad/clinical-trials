      The purpose of this study is to compare the change in glycemic control, as measured by
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to study week 24, in subjects receiving insulin
      glulisine as mealtime insulin following a variable bolus insulin regimen (based on
      carbohydrate counting) versus a fixed bolus insulin regimen, with insulin glargine as basal
      insulin in both arms of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least six months; 18 to 70 years of age,
             inclusive.

          -  A1c ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 10% at screening

          -  At least 3 months of continuous insulin and/or insulin analogue therapy (on at least 2
             injections) +/- metformin prior to study entry. (Note: Subjects receiving insulin
             glargine [Lantus] twice a day [split dose] will be considered as being on one
             injection only.)

          -  Willingness of subject to discontinue other anti-diabetic drug treatments and to
             remain off them through the entire study

          -  Negative glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies

          -  Ability and willingness to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) at least
             four times a day, and at least 7 times daily during the 7-point blood glucose (BG)
             profile measurement days

          -  Ability and willingness to adhere to, and be compliant with, the study protocol

          -  Must be able to read English at the sixth grade level in order to complete the
             patient-reported outcomes component of the study.

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects treated with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), or any other oral
             antidiabetic drugs (within the 3 months before study entry) except for insulin and/or
             insulin analogues with or without metformin

          -  Planned pregnancy; or pregnant or lactating females.

          -  For subjects treated with metformin: serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 µmol/L) for
             males or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL (124 µmoL) for females

          -  Serum creatinine ≥ 3.0 mg/dL (266 µmol/L)

          -  Any clinically significant renal disease (other than proteinuria) or hepatic disease

          -  Serum ALT or AST levels greater than 2.5 X the upper limit of normal

          -  Any current malignancy or any cancer within the past 5 years (except for adequately
             treated basal cell skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ)

          -  Diagnosis of dementia or mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand
             the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study

          -  Diagnosis of impaired dexterity or vision rendering the subject unable to administer
             multiple daily injections (MDIs)

          -  Cardiac status New York Heart Association (NYHA) III-IV

          -  Hypersensitivity to Lantus or insulin glulisine (Apidra) or any of their components

          -  Any disease or condition (including abuse of illicit drugs, prescription medicines or
             alcohol) that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, may interfere with the
             completion of the study.

          -  Subject unlikely to comply with protocol, e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to
             return for follow-up visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study

          -  Subject is the investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of
             the protocol.
