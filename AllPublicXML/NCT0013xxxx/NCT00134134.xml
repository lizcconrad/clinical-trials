  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of efalizumab in
      treating hydradenitis suppurativa, and to evaluate the duration of the benefit seen in people
      who respond to treatment with efalizumab, after the medication is stopped.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of subcutaneously administered
      efalizumab in the treatment of refractory, severe hydradenitis suppurativa. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to assess the ability to re-establish disease control after
      discontinuation of drug and allowance for relapse of disease, as well as to assess the safety
      of subcutaneously administered efalizumab in the treatment of refractory, severe hydradenitis
      suppurativa.
