      The purpose of the VENT Cost-Effectiveness Sub-Study is to gather healthcare utilization and
      quality of life information on patients enrolled in the VENT study in order to analyze the
      relative cost-effectiveness of the endobronchial valve implant procedure.

      Therapeutic interventions in health care require the use of resources. Since these resources
      are limited, it is important for clinical decision-makers to have economic information in
      addition to safety and efficacy data. In the economic environment of health care today, the
      incremental costs for a new therapeutic intervention must be offset by the value associated
      with better outcomes such as improved health and health-related quality of life and/or lower
      health care utilization costs over time.

      Questions about the cost and effectiveness of medical care have generated considerable
      attention in medical outcomes research. In 1993, the Department of Health and Human Services
      appointed a multi-disciplinary group to recommend standards for the evaluation of health
      care. The panel's report suggested that standardized outcomes analyses be conducted to
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness of medical care. These analyses require preference-weighted
      measures of health-related quality of life. Such measures are needed in order to adjust
      survival time for health-related quality of life.
