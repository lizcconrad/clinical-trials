  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an 80-week extension to a study to assess the safety and effectiveness of
      vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to rosiglitazone in lowering overall blood glucose
      levels in people with type 2 diabetes who have not previously been treated with drug therapy
      to lower their blood sugar. The purpose of the extension study is to gather data on the
      long-term safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin in people with type 2 diabetes.
