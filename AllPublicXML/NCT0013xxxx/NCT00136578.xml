    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose regimen of Ispinesib in combination with
      carboplatin in patients with solid tumors. Ispinesib is dosed by 1-hour intravenous infusion
      and carboplatin is dosed by 30 minute intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (on the same day). A
      patient may continue to receive treatment as long as they are benefiting from the treatment.
      Blood samples will be taken at specific times to measure the amount of both drugs in your
      body at specific times after the drug is given. Blood samples will also be taken for lab
      tests such as complete blood counts and clinical chemistries. Physical exams will be
      performed before each treatment with Ispinesib. During the treatment phase, the patients will
      undergo regular assessments for safety and clinical response.
