  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled trial of betamethasone
      versus a placebo given prior to the mothers at term and near term gestation (&gt;34 and &lt;40
      weeks of gestation) who are scheduled to undergo a planned Cesarean section. The study design
      is to determine the efficacy and safety of betamethasone in the prevention of breathing
      problems commonly seen in this population.

      In infants born by elective Cesarean section, it is hypothesized that antenatal betamethasone
      treatment will reduce the risk of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission from 11% to
      8% and/or oxygen therapy +/- positive pressure ventilation (PPV) for &gt;30 minutes from 4.5% to
      2.5%.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if antepartum betamethasone given to mothers
      undergoing elective cesarean section (ECS) delivery at term or near term gestation (&gt;34 and &lt;
      40 weeks of gestation) is safe and feasible in reducing neonatal respiratory morbidity and
      the related admissions to neonatal intensive care units (NICU).

      The data from this pilot study will be used to support a NIH application for a multicenter
      randomized trial to determine, if compared to placebo treatment, antenatal betamethasone
      initiated 2-7 days prior to an ECS results in decreased occurrence of respiratory morbidity
      and NICU admissions in the newborn.

      The multicenter protocol was recently reviewed by the NICHD network for clinical trial. The
      reviewers were enthusiastic about the scientific merit and public health importance of the
      study but asked for a pilot study to determine feasibility before launching the national
      trial. Given the rise in the rate of CS deliveries, we project substantial health cost
      savings from this preventive strategy if it were found to be successful in reducing neonatal
      morbidity.
