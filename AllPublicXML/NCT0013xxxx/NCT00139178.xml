  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the long time survival of HIV
      infected individuals. However an increasing number of HIV-patients have developed metabolic
      and morphological alterations including peripheral lipoatrophy.

      The main hypothesis of the study is that switching from thymidine-analogue based HAART will
      reverse lipoatrophy.

      We plan to perform an observational study recruiting up to 100 HIV-infected patients
      receiving Trizivir (zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir).

      The patients will be offered an NRTI or lopinavir/ritonavir instead of zidovudine or they can
      choose to continue with Trizivir.

      The main endpoint is changes in peripheral fat mass as determined by DEXA-scanning.
