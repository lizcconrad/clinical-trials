  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the mobilization of non-haematopoietic mesenchymal and
      haematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow with granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) treatment alone and in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      gene therapy in patients with severe chronic occlusive coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent clinical trials, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) delivered as plasmid DNA
      percutaneously by a catheter-based, intramyocardial approach, have been demonstrated to be
      safe and to be associated with a reduction in angina and an increase in exercise time or an
      improvement in regional wall motion in &quot;no-option patients&quot; with chronic myocardial ischemia.

      It has been demonstrated, that BM-derived stem cells mobilized by cytokines as granulocyte
      colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were capable of regenerating the myocardial tissue, leading
      to improve the survival and cardiac function after myocardial infarction.

      These data suggested that a combination therapy with exogenous administration of gene
      vascular growth factor combined with G-CSF mobilization of bone marrow stem cells might
      induce both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in ischemic myocardium
