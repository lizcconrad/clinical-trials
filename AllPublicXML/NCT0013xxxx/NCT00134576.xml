      The purpose of this study is to design, refine, and test for the effectiveness of a
      computer-based telephone system (Telephone-Linked Communications for Detection of Mental
      Health Disorders in the Workplace; TLC-Detect) that will screen workers for mental health
      distress; educate them about seeking treatment; and follow up with them over a 6 month
      period.

    <description>TLC-Detect will provide subjects in the intervention group with information about each diagnosed mental health disorder. TLC-Detect will then give the Treatment Module and will tell the intervention subjects that it will call back in one month for a follow-up or the next week if a subject is comorbid with other disorders.</description>
