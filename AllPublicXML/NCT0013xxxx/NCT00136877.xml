  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether tonsillectomy is effective in preventing
      further streptococcal pharyngitis episodes in patients with recurrent tonsillitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is widely used worldwide in recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis, but its effect
      remains unknown.

      In this randomized controlled trial, the effect of tonsillectomy (compared to watchful
      waiting) in preventing further culture proven symptomatic streptococcal pharyngitis episodes
      is studied. In addition, symptoms after the operation, side effects, and life quality issues
      are recorded.
