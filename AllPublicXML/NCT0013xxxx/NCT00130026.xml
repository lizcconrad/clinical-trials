  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if caffeine 500 mg intravenously is efficacious
      when added to standard anti-emetic prophylaxis in the prevention of post-operative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery under general anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of caffeine, 500
      mg, intravenously, in addition to standard anti-emetic prophylaxis, in the prevention of
      post-operative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery under general
      anesthesia.

      Consenting patients will be randomized to receive either a single dose of caffeine, 500 mg,
      or saline placebo, administered as a single IV dose approximately 15 minutes before emergence
      from anesthesia. All patients will receive our customary anti-emetic prophylaxis, determined
      by four major risk factors for PONV: female gender, nonsmoking status, history of PONV or
      motion sickness, and perioperative opioid use. Patients at low risk for PONV (no risk
      factors) will receive no prophylaxis; patients at moderate risk for PONV (1 or 2 risk
      factors) will receive dexamethasone 8 mg at induction plus dolasetron 12.5 mg approximately
      15 min before the end of anesthesia; patients at high risk for PONV (3 or 4 risk factors)
      will receive the same treatment as those at moderate risk, plus additional prophylaxis at the
      discretion of the attending anesthesiologist (e.g., scopolamine patch, metoclopramide 10 mg
      IV, or other standard drugs).

      Postoperatively, the presence of PONV will be recorded. If rescue medication is used, the
      amount and time of administration will be recorded. The length of stay in the PACU (Phase I
      and Phase II) will be recorded. Patients will be asked to report any headache, and to rate
      their nausea, pain, alertness, fatigue, and overall satisfaction in the PACU, and again by
      phone 24 hours postoperatively. Amount of pain medication utilized in the PACU will also be
      measured.
