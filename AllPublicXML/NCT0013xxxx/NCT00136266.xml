    <textblock>
      Compared with iron drops, iron sprinkles supplied for 3 months to high-risk children
      beginning at age 5-7 months will increase adherence and reduce the rates of anemia and iron
      deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is the most common known nutrient deficiency and cause of anemia in
      childhood. It is associated with numerous adverse health effects, particularly delayed mental
      and motor development, that may be irreversible. Despite advances of iron nutrition, the
      prevalence of iron deficiency remains high among low-income infants and toddlers. Previous
      studies suggest adherence with iron containing drops is low. Adherence to iron sprinkles
      among children as tested in studies in less developed countries appears high.

      Comparison: Children randomized to ferrous sulfate drops will be compared with children
      randomized to ferrous fumarate sprinkles.
