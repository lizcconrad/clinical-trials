    <textblock>
      Recent findings have suggested that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) substantially reduces cocaine
      drug-seeking behavior in formerly cocaine dependent rats. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the safety, tolerability, and cue reactivity effects of NAC in cocaine dependent
      individuals and non-dependent healthy controls.

      Recent findings have suggested that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) substantially reduces
      cocaine-primed drug-seeking behavior in formerly cocaine dependent rats. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and cue reactivity effects of NAC in cocaine
      dependent individuals and non-dependent healthy controls.

      Participants in this study will include 20 non-treatment seeking cocaine dependent
      individuals and 12 healthy, non-dependent controls. Participants will be recruited via
      word-of-mouth and advertisements. Cocaine dependent participants will undergo two 3-day
      hospital stays. Healthy controls will be followed throughout the study on an outpatient
      basis. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 600 mg of NAC or placebo.
      Medication or placebo will be administered twice each day. Participants will be evaluated for
      side effects throughout the study. After administration of the final dose of medication or
      placebo, participants will undergo cue reactivity testing. This will include a standardized
      protocol of slides demonstrating cocaine acquisition, use of cocaine, and cocaine-related
      paraphernalia. Before, during, and after cue reactivity procedures, standardized behavioral
      and cognitive scales will be used to assess cocaine craving, cocaine seeking, and subjective
      effects of the cocaine &quot;high.&quot; The following week participants will be crossed over so that
      they will receive the other treatment. All study procedures will be performed a second time.
      Participants will be contacted during Week 3 in order to determine if any residual side
      effects or adverse events occurred from the medication and treatment.
