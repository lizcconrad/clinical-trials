      The purpose of this study was to determine the dose-ranging efficacy and safety profile of
      encapsulated Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 in female subjects with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS).

      The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may have a a post-infectious inflammatory
      component, suggesting that altered gut bacterial flora are of relevance and that probiotics
      may be beneficial. This clinical trial examined the efficacy of an encapsulated probiotic in
      subjects with Rome II IBS. After a 2 week baseline, 362 female subjects were randomized to
      placebo or one of three doses of B. infantis 35624 once daily for 4 weeks. IBS symptoms were
      monitored daily and scored according to a 6-point Likert scale; stool frequency and form were
      also monitored daily. The primary efficacy variable was the abdominal pain score; secondary
      efficacy variables included other IBS symptom relief and quality of life.
