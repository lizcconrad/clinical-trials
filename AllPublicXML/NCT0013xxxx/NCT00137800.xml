  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug OSI-774 is less toxic and
      potentially as good as or better than standard chemotherapy drugs, when given to subjects
      with non-small cell lung cancer, who are 70 years of age or older.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive OSI-774 once daily without interruption. There are no pre-determined
      number of cycles or planned dose interruptions. For the purposes of evaluation, toxicity and
      efficacy, a four week (28 day period) will be considered 1 cycle.

      Patients will continue to receive OSI-774 until they develop progressive disease,
      unacceptable side-effects or wish to withdraw from the study.

      Patients will have radiographic evaluations after every two cycles of therapy. After cycle 2,
      patients will also be evaluated by FDG-PET scanning.

      Patients will also be asked to fill out a Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) on the first day
      of each cycle.

      Bloodwork will also be performed on day 1 of each cycle as well as at the end of the study.
