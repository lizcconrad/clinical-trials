  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter phase III trial to assess the efficacy of
      early administration of zoledronate versus observation in delaying bone-related symptoms in
      metastatic breast cancer patients.

      Patients will be randomised to receive 4 mg zoledronate every 3-4 weeks versus observation
      until bone-related symptoms appear, or up to 12 months. One hundred twelve patients per
      treatment arm will be enrolled in the study.

      Once bone-related symptoms appear, study participation is over. During the study, the
      following will be assessed:

        -  quality of life,

        -  performance status,

        -  pain rating,

        -  analgesic administration and

        -  adverse events The principal objective is the delay in bone-related symptoms in those
           patients with early zoledronate administration.
