  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to determine the changes in gene expression induced by IFNb-1a (Rebif)
      and atorvastatin (Lipitor) combination therapy in patients with an isolated clinical syndrome
      suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), to identify markers of therapeutic response, and to
      predict patients' clinical response based on their in vitro response to this combination
      therapy measured by the gene expression levels in activated peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disease, characterized pathologically by
      focal areas of inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and degeneration in the central
      nervous system. MS follows several different disease courses. Approximately, 90% of patients
      have a relapsing form of the disease. We propose that atorvastatin (Lipitor) may enhance the
      immunomodulatory effects of INFb-1a (Rebif) in patients with clinically isolated neurological
      syndrome suggestive of MS. This combination may be more effective in preventing development
      of definitive relapsing-remitting MS if administered early in the course of the disease. The
      study will identify markers of disease activity that are selectively affected by this
      combination therapy. Identified markers may be used in future clinical trials to predict
      patient's clinical response and to monitor the response to treatment as a secondary outcome
      measure.
