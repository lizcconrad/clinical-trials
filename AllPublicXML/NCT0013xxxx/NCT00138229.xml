      RATIONALE: An infusion of a patient's lymphocytes that have been treated in the laboratory to
      remove certain immune cells may be an effective treatment for melanoma. Drugs, such as
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, may suppress the immune system so that the patient's immune
      cells allow the infused lymphocytes to work. Interleukin-2 may help the lymphocytes kill more
      tumor cells when they are put back in the body. Giving cyclophosphamide and fludarabine
      followed by an autologous lymphocyte infusion and interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cyclophosphamide and fludarabine
      followed by an autologous lymphocyte infusion and interleukin-2 works in treating patients
      with refractory or recurrent melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with
           nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide and
           fludarabine followed by autologous CD25-positive-T-regulatory-cell-depleted lymphocyte
           reinfusion and high-dose interleukin-2.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of repopulation of CD25-positive T-regulatory cells in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Apheresis and CD25-positive T-regulatory cell depletion: Patients undergo 1-2 aphereses
           to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CD25-positive T-regulatory cells
           are depleted from the collected PBMC in vitro.

        -  Nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over
           1 hour on days -8 and -7 and fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes on days -6 to -2.

        -  Autologous CD25-positive-T-regulatory-cell-depleted lymphocyte reinfusion: Patients
           receive autologous lymphocytes IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0.

        -  Filgrastim (G-CSF) and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy: Patients receive G-CSF
           subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.
           Patients also receive high-dose IL-2 IV over 15 minutes 3 times daily on days 0-4 and
           14-18. Patients are reevaluated 4-6 weeks after completion of high-dose IL-2 therapy.
           Patients achieving stable disease or a partial response may receive additional high-dose
           IL-2 as above for up to 2 retreatment courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Retreatment begins at least 6 weeks after autologous lymphocyte
           reinfusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks and then every 1-2
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5
      years.
