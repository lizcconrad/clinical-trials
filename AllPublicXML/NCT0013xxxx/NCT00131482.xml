  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Chrysalin, also known as TP508, and to
      determine the effectiveness of four doses of Chrysalin for treating broken wrists in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a medical need for a product that is safe and can accelerate the rate of bone
      healing, leading to a reduction in immobilization time. Chrysalin, also known as TP508, is a
      synthetic peptide (protein) that is an exact copy of part of the human protein thrombin,
      which is a protein that occurs naturally in the body. Chrysalin can be used to mimic part of
      the thrombin response after injury without stimulating any of the events associated with
      blood clotting, and can therefore accelerate the normal process of healing.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Treatment with Chrysalin did not demonstrate benefit compared to placebo.
