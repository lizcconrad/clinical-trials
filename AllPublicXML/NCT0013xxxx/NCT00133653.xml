  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial and lifestyle stressors, such as job strain (JS) and marital factors have
      previously been associated with a sustained increase in blood pressure (BP).

      In a one-year longitudinal follow-up to the Baseline Double Exposure cohort study, we, the
      researchers at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, evaluated whether JS
      and marital cohesion continued to be associated with ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in
      subjects enrolled with normal or untreated high BP.
