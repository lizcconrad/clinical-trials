      This study enrolled patients with measurable metastatic colorectal cancer. Blood was drawn
      prior to the patient receiving a new therapy for his/her cancer and subsequently at 7-14
      days, 3-4 weeks, and when an imaging study was done (~every 6 to 12 weeks). The blood was
      tested to find circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and to count them. The CTC levels were compared
      to the imaging study results to see if the CTC number and the imaging result (progression/no
      progression) were in agreement. Maximum active study participation was 12 months with up to 8
      blood draws being taken. All patients are currently being followed for up to 24 months from
      their off study date for survival. The CTC result will also be used to see if there is a
      difference in survival and progression-free survival for those patients with and without a
      certain number of CTCs.
