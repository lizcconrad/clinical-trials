      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab plus methotrexate
      to infliximab alone for the long-term control of signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD)
      in patients with symptoms that are persistent enough to require corticosteroid therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current approach to the treatment of Crohn's Disease is based on &quot;step care&quot;. This
      strategy is relatively ineffective for the long-term management of patients who require
      treatment with corticosteroids. Although azathioprine, methotrexate and infliximab are
      modestly effective in this high-risk population, long-term corticosteroid-free response rates
      are low. Thus combination therapy is an attractive option to explore. Based on a favourable
      experience with dual therapy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and the demonstrated
      efficacy of methotrexate in corticosteroid-dependent CD, we expect that combination therapy
      with methotrexate and infliximab will be significantly more effective than infliximab
      monotherapy. Furthermore combined therapy is likely to be highly effective in preventing
      formation of the antibodies to infliximab that are an important limitation to the continued
      successful use of this drug.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multi-centre study.
      Subjects who have initiated corticosteroid induction therapy within the preceding 6 weeks
      will be randomized (irrespective of CDAI defined disease activity) in a 1:1 ratio to either
      methotrexate or placebo for a period of 50 weeks in combination with infliximab administered
      for 8 infusions. Randomization will be stratified by:

        -  Treatment with or without Imuran/6-mercaptopurine in the 2-12 months prior to
           randomization;

        -  Prednisone dose &lt;20 mg or ≥20 mg daily at randomization;

        -  CDAI &lt;150 or ≥150 at randomization.
