      The purpose of this study to look at the antibodies (proteins from the body's infection
      fighting system) in the blood of babies delivered by women who are participants in the
      Herpevac Trial for Women, and who were vaccinated with either two or three doses of
      (GlaxoSmithKline) GSK candidate vaccine gD2t/alum-MPL or hepatitis A vaccine. The goal of
      this study is to compare the herpes or hepatitis A antibody levels of the newborns to those
      of their mothers, and to see how much of the antibodies are still present in the baby at two
      and six months after birth. Approximately 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of the mother's blood will be
      collected at the time of delivery or within 15 days before or after delivery. Approximately 2
      teaspoons of blood will be collected from the child's umbilical cord at the time of delivery,
      or 1 teaspoon (3-5 ml) of the child's blood will be drawn within 15 days after birth.
      Optional blood draws from babies may occur 2 and 6 months after birth.

      The primary objective of this study is to quantitate HSV-2 binding and neutralizing antibody
      titers in the sera of newborns delivered by HSV-uninfected women vaccinated with either two
      or three doses of GSK candidate vaccine gD2t/alum-MPL and to compare the HSV-2 binding and
      neutralizing antibody titers of the newborns to those of their mothers. Secondary objectives
      are to: 1) evaluate the durability of HSV-2 binding and neutralizing antibody titers in the
      sera of newborns delivered by HSV-uninfected women vaccinated with either two or three doses
      of GSK candidate vaccine gD2t/alum-MPL; and 2) quantitate hepatitis A binding antibody titers
      in the sera of newborns delivered by women vaccinated with either two or three doses of
      HavrixÂ® hepatitis A vaccine (the control vaccine used in the Herpevac Trial for Women),
      compare hepatitis A binding antibody titers of the newborns to those of their mothers, and
      evaluate the durability of hepatitis A binding antibodies in these newborns. The sample size
      for this study cannot be determined but based on experience is not likely to be more than 50
      women. Optional additional blood will be collected from the mother and her infant at 2 mos
      and 6 mos after delivery.

      Sera obtained from collected blood samples will be used. Ten mL of blood will be collected at
      the maternal blood draw and from the umbilical vein. Three to 5 mL of blood will be collected
      at each infant blood draw

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrolled in the Herpevac Trial for Women.

          2. Has received at least two doses of either the candidate or control vaccine.

          3. Pregnant.

          4. Written informed consent obtained from the participant.

          5. Willing to have her blood collected either at the time of delivery or within 15 days
             before or after delivery. If blood is to be collected by the health care provider who
             will be presiding at the delivery, the participant must be willing to give permission
             for study personnel to contact that health care provider to arrange the collection of
             blood.

          6. Willing to have either umbilical vein blood collected at the time of delivery or blood
             collected from her neonate within 15 days after delivery. If blood is to be collected
             from the umbilical vein, the participant must be willing to give permission for study
             personnel to contact the presiding health care provider to arrange the collection of
             blood.

          7. A participant whom the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements
             of the protocol.
