      The purposes of this study are to better understand how Herceptin causes tumors to become
      smaller and to find out how effective Herceptin, together with chemotherapy, is in treating
      advanced breast cancer.

      We want to determine the effects of Herceptin and to determine its efficacy in women with
      HER-2 overexpressing advanced breast cancer. The end-points will include the comparison of an
      array of histologic and molecular markers from sequential core biopsies of primary breast
      cancers of patients receiving Herceptin.

      The other aim of this study would be to determine clinical response to therapy with Herceptin
      and Taxotere.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must be female.

          -  Informed consent must be signed.

          -  Women with locally advanced breast cancers or primary breast cancers with concomitant
             gross metastatic disease are eligible. Locally advanced cancers must be of clinical
             and/or radiologic size &gt; 4 cm, and/or are deemed surgically inoperable.

          -  Her2/neu overexpressing tumors defined as HercepTest score of 3+, or &gt;/= one-third of
             invasive tumor showing membranous staining, or fluorescence in situ hybridization
             (FISH) positive.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (bHCG) within 7 days of starting study, if of
             child-bearing potential.

          -  Kidney and liver function tests - all within 1.5 times of the institution's upper
             limit of normal.

          -  Performance status (World Health Organization [WHO] scale) &lt; 2 and life expectancy &gt; 6
             months.

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  No metastatic disease without concomitant primary breast cancer.

          -  No previous or current malignancies at other sites within the last 5 years, with
             exception of adequately treated cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri
             and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or unwillingness to use a reliable contraceptive method in women of
             child-bearing potential.

          -  Severe underlying chronic illness or disease.

          -  Cardiomyopathy or baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%.

          -  Patients on other investigational drugs while on study.

          -  Severe or uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure (BP) &gt; 180/100 on three
             separate occasions.

          -  History of congestive heart failure.

          -  History of coronary arterial disease.
