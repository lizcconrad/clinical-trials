  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether Biotene oral care products have a benefit in
      the treatment of xerostomia and mucositis when compared with conventional bicarbonate mouth
      care regimes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grade III and IV mucositis occurs in 30-60% of patients undergoing head and neck irradiation.
      Where mucositis is severe a patient’s ability to swallow may become significantly compromised
      and nutritional requirements may not be met.

      Xerostomia is often an early side effect of treatment. As salivary tissue is very sensitive
      to radiation there is often a change in saliva early in the treatment.

      New products on the market have claimed to alleviate the symptoms of dry mouth and to help
      the body’s natural defenses reduce the harmful oral bacteria. These products contain the
      important salivary enzymes lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, lactoferrin and glucose oxidase.
      Biotene products therefore have the potential to reduce microbial populations which result in
      radiation caries and periodontal disease and in addition provide relief from the discomfort
      of xerostomia.

      Despite the knowledge surrounding xerostomia in the head and neck irradiation population, its
      treatment has not been well documented and the question of patient comfort is not well
      addressed.

      Comparisons: This study aims to compare the different mouth care regimes and determine the
      most effective treatment alternatives during radiotherapy. Patients will be randomised to
      either Biotene or Bicarbonate-based mouth care regimes. Patients will be stratified according
      to whether they are receiving radiotherapy alone or chemo irradiation to ensure equal
      distribution across the different mouth care regimes.
