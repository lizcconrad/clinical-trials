  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this multicenter randomized study is to establish the effectiveness of
      treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), in patients not previously treated with
      anti-arrhythmic drugs, by encircling the pulmonary veins with radiofrequency (RF) ablation,
      using the NaviStar® ThermoCool® catheter and the CARTO™ EP Navigation System. Effectiveness
      will be determined by comparing chronic success of ablation therapy versus anti-arrhythmic
      drug treatment, defined as patients with an absence of atrial tachycardias during 24 months
      of follow-up as determined by 7-days Holter and transtelephonic monitoring, and by 12-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical study that will enroll in its
      first phase 40 patients. The study will be performed in 3 European hospitals. Patients will
      be randomized to either the RF ablation strategy or to the medication arm.

      Hypothesis:

      As first line therapy, catheter ablation improves the long-term success, health-economic
      outcomes and is equally safe compared to the best anti-arrhythmic medication treatment in a
      selected group of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

      Primary endpoint:

        -  long-term success, defined as patients free from any atrial fibrillation during 24
           months after initial study treatment as determined by 7-days Holter and transtelephonic
           monitoring and by 12-lead ECG recordings.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  AF burden: frequency and duration of episodes

        -  health-economic costs over 24 months

        -  serious adverse events

        -  Quality of Life scores, using SF-36 questionnaire

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent obtained

          -  Two or more documented symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes during the
             last 6 months. Episodes should last longer than 30 seconds.

          -  Patients should not be on anti-arrhythmic medication therapy (Class I, III or IV) for
             AF (other than for cardioversion) or are currently on antiarrhythmic drug (AAD)
             therapy for any other arrhythmia

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had a previous ablation for atrial fibrillation

          -  Patients who had presence of severe valvular disease, myocardial infarction and/ or
             cardiomyopathy

          -  Patients with a left atrial size more than 50 mm

          -  Patients who had more than 2 cardioversions

          -  Patients who have a history of AF for less than 3 months or more than one year

             diathesis participants in another investigational clinical or device trial

          -  Patients who are inaccessible for follow-up psychological problem that might limit
             compliance
