  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to figure out what effects (good or bad) the investigational
      drug agent called Tarceva (erlotinib; OSI-774) has on women with previously untreated
      adenocarcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will start taking Tarceva daily by mouth on Day 1 and will continue taking this
      medication daily at home, until participation in the study ends.

      Every 28 days (one cycle) while the patient is taking Tarceva, they will be examined in the
      outpatient clinic (blood test and physical examination) and the doctor will determine if they
      should continue taking Tarceva.

      After every two cycles of treatment (every 8 weeks) standard radiological testing (CT scans,
      MRIs, and/or x-rays) of the cancer site(s) will be done to assess the response to the Tarceva
      treatment.

      While the patient is on this study and at the end of the study, the patient will undergo
      blood and urine tests, medical history evaluation, physical exams including measures of vital
      signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiration), bone scans, tumor biopsy
      sample, and various radiological tests to monitor the cancer and the patients health.

      The length of time on the study depends upon how the cancer responds to Tarceva and whether
      or not the patient experiences unacceptable side effects.
