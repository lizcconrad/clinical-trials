    <textblock>
      This study is for men who have prostate cancer that has spread outside of the prostate gland
      and is no longer responding to hormone removal therapy. This study is designed to determine
      if a new drug combination will help to control the cancer. The medicines being used,
      docetaxel and diethylstilbestrol (DES), have been given to patients with prostate cancer and
      each drug has demonstrated activity in prostate cancer, either used alone or in other
      combinations. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of this drug combination
      on the prostate cancer and its response to disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial of docetaxel and diethylstilbestrol for patients with
      symptomatic stage D3 androgen independent prostate cancer. Patients will receive docetaxel
      weekly for 10 cycles (each cycle consists of treatment for 3 weeks out of every 4) and DES
      daily for 40 weeks or until there is evidence of disease progression, whichever occurs first.
      Patients will be followed to determine PSA and objective response. Additional endpoints
      include time to progression, disease specific survival and overall survival. Disease
      progression will be defined as 2 consecutive increases in PSA and/or tumor growth as
      evidenced by examination or radiologic evaluation. Other secondary objectives will be to
      determine the toxicity, and impact on quality of life of this regimen.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting all of the following criteria are eligible for the trial:

          -  Men 18 years of age or older with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of
             adenocarcinoma of the prostate consistent with stage D3.

          -  Prior therapy with medical or surgical castration and evidence of castrate levels of
             testosterone

          -  Discontinuation of nonsteroidal antiandrogens more than 6 weeks prior to evaluation
             for progression. It is not a requirement that nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy be
             used prior to enrollment.

          -  Androgen independent disease as defined by one of the following after androgen
             ablation and withdrawal from nonsteroidal antiandrogen if initiated (&gt; 6 weeks after
             discontinuation):

               -  PSA must be greater than 5 ng/ml and increasing as demonstrated by two
                  consecutive increasing PSA levels over 5 ng/ml. Each PSA measurement must be
                  taken at least one week apart.

               -  Increase in measurable disease within one month of enrollment

               -  Worsening of bone scan abnormalities within two months of enrollment and greater
                  than four months since initiation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)
                  agonist.

          -  Performance status &lt; 3 by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.
