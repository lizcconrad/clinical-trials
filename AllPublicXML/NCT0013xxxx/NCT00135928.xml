      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of treatment with granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) bone marrow stimulation on circulating stem cells' ability to
      develop new blood vessels in the myocardium after an acute myocardial infarction.

    <textblock>
      Intracoronary infusion of bone-marrow stem cells after a ST elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) seems to improve cardiac function. An alternative strategy is increase of circulating
      stem cells by mobilisation from the bone marrow with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor
      (G-CSF).

      Objective: To determine the short-term (30 days) safety of G-CSF therapy after a STEMI
      treated with acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      Methods: Patients with STEMI treated with PCI &lt;12 hours after symptom onset were randomised
      (1:1) to G-CSF (10 μg/kg/d) or placebo for 6 days in a double-blind design. Other inclusion
      criteria: age 20-70 years, culprit lesion in a large coronary artery, and peak CKMB &gt;100
      microgram/L. Follow-up was done after 1, 5 and 6 months, with an angiogram at 5 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients between 20 and 70 years with STEMI were eligible if they had a successful PCI
             within 12 hours after onset of symptoms.

          -  The target lesion had to be located in the proximal section of the left anterior
             descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX) or right coronary artery (RCA).

          -  Only patients with creatine kinase [CK]-MB &gt;100 microgram/L or development of Q waves
             in the electrocardiogram were included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ventricular arrhythmia after PCI requiring treatment

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Unprotected left main stem lesion

          -  History of prior myocardial infarction

          -  Diagnosed or suspected cancer

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3-4

          -  Known severe claustrophobia

          -  Significant stenosis in another coronary vessel than the acutely treated vessel, that
             might demand treatment with PCI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) prior
             to the last follow-up exam.
