    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether high-dose angiotensin II receptor blocker
      (ARB) monotherapy or combination therapy with ARB and calcium channel blockers is more
      effective in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in Japanese elderly high-risk
      hypertensive patients not adequately controlled by standard dose ARB alone.

    <textblock>
      Hypertension is one of the major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. It is also
      important for elderly hypertensive patients to strictly reduce their blood pressures to
      prevent cardiovascular events. Although angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are
      increasingly used in antihypertensive treatment recently, few studies have been performed in
      Japan to assess the difference between high-dose ARB monotherapy and combination therapy of
      ARB with calcium channel blocker (CCB) in prevention of cardiovascular diseases for patients
      whose blood pressure is not well controlled by ARB monotherapy. OSCAR-study is a multicenter,
      active-controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison, prospective randomized open blinded
      end-point (PROBE) design study. The dose administered is olmesartan medoxomil 20mg/day as ARB
      monotherapy in the 'Step 1' period. If the blood pressure is not adequately controlled and
      treatment is well tolerated then the dose is changed to olmesartan medoxomil 40mg/day in the
      high-dose ARB monotherapy group, or olmesartan medoxomil 20mg/day and a CCB in the
      combination therapy group in the 'Step 2' period. At least 500 patients will be enrolled in
      each group, and the follow-up duration will be 3 years. The primary objective is to compare
      the incidence of a composite of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and all cause
      mortality between the two treatment groups.
