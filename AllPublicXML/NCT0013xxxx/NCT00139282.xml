  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative eye disease of the retina that
      causes a progressive loss of central vision. AMD is the leading cause of blindness among
      adults age 50 or older in the Western world. AMD presents in two different types: &quot;dry&quot; and
      the more severe &quot;wet&quot; form. Wet AMD is caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the
      macula. Squalamine lactate is an investigational drug that may prevent the growth of these
      abnormal blood vessels. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Squalamine
      lactate in the treatment of AMD in patients, the exact number of which will be determined
      based on data from the sponsor's ongoing Phase 2 trials.

      The trial objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of Squalamine lactate
      for Injection administered as intravenous infusions weekly for 4 weeks followed by
      maintenance doses every 4 weeks through week 104 compared with the safety and efficacy in the
      control group.
