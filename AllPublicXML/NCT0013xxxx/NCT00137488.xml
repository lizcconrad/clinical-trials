  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The low grade glioma (LGG) is a type of brain tumor which is generally more common in younger
      age group patients. Most patients with LGG undergo surgery which is mostly incomplete due to
      concern about loss of function. This is an incurable disease. More than half of these
      patients progress to a higher grade with a worse outcome within five years of their diagnosis
      and only one-third survive for up to ten years. Post-operative radiation treatment improves
      local control without survival advantage. Efforts are being made without great success to
      select the patients with a higher risk of progression based on physical characteristics and
      histological features.

      Tumor vascularity is thought to be the key element in tumor progression. Tremendous progress
      has been made in functional imaging by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3-Tesla (3T)
      and in biotechnology which can be used to investigate angiogenic gene profiles in order to
      identify gene signature for these tumors. In this study the investigators are proposing that
      patients of LGG with a higher risk of tumor progression may be selected by functional imaging
      and angiogenic profiles. These higher risk patients may be candidates for post-operative
      radiation in the future with a potential survival benefit.

      Summary: Comprehensive analysis of the angiogenesis-related gene expression profiles and
      tumor perfusion of patients with LGG will provide a novel understanding of subgroup (low and
      high-risk) of LGG. Thus, this study will allow identifying clinically relevant factors
      predictive for tumor progression and to select patients in high-risk group for adjuvant
      radiation therapy.
