    <textblock>
      The treatment of chronic hepatitis C with peginterferon and ribavirin is highly effective but
      is hampered by peginterferon-induced psychopathology.

      Prevention of peginterferon-induced psychopathology with selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRI's) (paroxetine) has been shown to be effective in patients treated with
      interferon for malignant disease. The aim is to study the effects of prophylactic treatment
      with escitalopram (another SSRI) on peginterferon-associated psychopathology in patients
      treated with peginterferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.

      The treatment of chronic hepatitis C with peginterferon and ribavirin is highly effective but
      is hampered by peginterferon-induced psychopathology.

      Prevention of peginterferon-induced psychopathology with SSRI's (paroxetine) has been shown
      to be effective in patients treated with interferon for malignant disease. The aim is to
      study the effects of prophylactic treatment with escitalopram on peginterferon-associated
      psychopathology in patients treated with peginterferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.

      Design: double blind, randomized controlled trial with two arms, maximum 40 patients per arm.
      Patients, starting with peginterferon and ribavirin, will be randomized to receive
      escitalopram therapy 10 mg per day (however, 5 mg in the first two weeks) or placebo.

      Study population and selection: eighty patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys 180
      microgram) and ribavirin (Copegus 400 mg twice daily) will be included in the study.

      Aims of the study:

        1. to asses whether prophylactic treatment with escitalopram avoids significantly the
           occurrence of peginterferon-induced psychiatric disturbance; defined as an increase of
           two points on observer-based rating scales reflecting anxiety (BAS:BriefAnxietyScale),
           loss of concentration, depression and loss of impulse control (Montgomery and Asberg
           Depression Rating Scale: MADRS), and

        2. to assess the frequency of major depression according to DSM IV criteria, in the
           escitalopram and placebo-treated patients.
