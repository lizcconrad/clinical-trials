  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is not being conducted in the United States. This is a 52-week extension to a
      study to assess the safety and effectiveness of two doses of vildagliptin, an unapproved
      drug, in lowering overall blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes who had not
      previously been treated with drug therapy to lower their blood sugar and whose blood sugar
      levels were in a specified range. The purpose of the extension study is to gather data on the
      long term safety and effectiveness of vildagliptin in people with type 2 diabetes.
