  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the safety and efficacy and dose-response relationship
      of three doses of CP-526,555 for 12 weeks compared with placebo for smoking cessation;
      including post-treatment follow-up of smoking status to one year from randomization. A small
      satellite protocol (A3051048) investigated safety of a second course of therapy in subjects
      who did not quit.
