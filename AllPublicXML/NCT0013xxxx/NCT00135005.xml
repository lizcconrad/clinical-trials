    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I dose-escalation study of the combination of
      AMN107 and imatinib (STI571) in patients with imatinib-resistant GIST. This study is designed
      to determine the Phase II dose of AMN107 and imatinib when administered together in patients
      with imatinib-resistant GIST, and to characterize the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of this combination.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

          -  Patients who have had disease progression during imatinib therapy with 800 mg.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior or concomitant malignancies other than GIST with the exception of
             previous or concomitant basal cell skin cancer or previous cervical carcinoma in situ.

          -  A history of impaired cardiac function or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease.

          -  Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent disease that could cause unacceptable safety
             risks such as impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of AMN107.

          -  Currently taking certain medications that could affect an electrocardiogram result.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

        NOTE: Additional inclusion and/ or exclusion criteria may apply.
