    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 trial will investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of fesoterodine
      fumarate (SR) (fesoterodine; SPM 907) in adult male and female subjects with overactive
      bladder syndrome. The trial is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled multicenter
      trial.

      The trial consisted of a 2 week Run-In period, 12 week double-blind Treatment period and 2
      week Safety Follow-Up period. Subjects were randomized to one of 3 treatment arms receiving
      either fesoterodine fumarate 4mg, fesoterodine fumarate 8mg, or placebo during the
      double-blind Treatment period.

      Two primary efficacy variables will be assessed for submission in the United States: change
      in the average number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours and the change in the average
      number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours. For the submissions in the European Union,
      the first primary variable will be the change in the average number of micturitions
      (frequency) per 24 hours and the co-primary variable is the treatment response, based on a
      treatment benefit scale. All continuous variables will be measured as changes from baseline
      to value after 12 weeks of treatment. The following safety variables were observed and
      assessed: adverse events, change in residual urinary volume (mL), change in laboratory
      parameters, change in vital signs, change in electrocardiogram (ECG), change in physical
      examination and change in urological/urogynecological examination.
