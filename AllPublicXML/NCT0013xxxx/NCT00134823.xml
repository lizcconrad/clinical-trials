      This study includes four projects aimed to improve the quality and safety of pediatric care
      through the implementation of four clinical decision support services in the electronic
      health record (EHR). The four projects will measure the effect of each clinical decision
      support feature including: weight-based dosing; smart forms for chronic conditions; guideline
      reminders; and a results manager to track abnormal lab result follow-up.

      Hypothesis: Implementation of the clinical decision support features will decrease medication
      errors and adverse drug events, assist physicians in adhering to clinical practice guidelines
      and protocols for certain chronic illnesses, improve physician follow-up for abnormal lab
      results, and overall improve the safety and quality of pediatric clinical practice.
