    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of palifermin (recombinant
      human keratinocyte growth factor, rHuKGF) in reducing the incidence of severe oral mucositis
      in subjects with locally advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy with concurrent
      chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for their disease.

      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of palifermin administered
      intravenously (IV) in weekly doses (minimum of 7 weekly doses, until RT was complete) in
      reducing the incidence of severe (World Health Organization [WHO] grade 3 or 4) oral
      mucositis in subjects with locally advanced HNC receiving RT concurrent with CT (RT/CT) as
      adjuvant treatment for their disease (postoperative setting). This study will assess the
      safety and tolerability of palifermin at the dose of 120 μg/kg IV administered weekly
      (minimum 7 weekly doses, until RT was complete) in this subject population. This study will
      also evaluate the effect of palifermin on the clinical sequelae of severe OM (eg, average
      subject-reported mouth and throat soreness [MTS] score), and on RT-induced xerostomia in this
      population, as well as the long-term effects of palifermin on disease outcome and survival in
      this population.
