  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cocaine dependent individuals are also diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD). Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is currently approved to treat individuals
      diagnosed with ADHD. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of
      methylphenidate in treating ADHD symptoms in cocaine dependent individuals.

      Methylphenidate (MPH) is commonly used to treat individuals diagnosed with ADHD. The purpose
      of this study is to determine the effectiveness of MPH in treating adult cocaine dependent
      individuals who are also diagnosed with ADHD.

      Participants in this 14-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be randomly
      assigned to receive either sustained-release MPH or placebo. All participants will receive
      individual cognitive behavioral therapy. The trial will last 14 weeks. It will include a
      1-week placebo lead-in phase and a 2-week dose titration phase, followed by 11 weeks on a
      stable dose of MPH. During the titration phase, MPH will be given twice a day, starting at a
      dose of 10 mg/day. The dose will increase by 10 mg each day, until a final stable dose of 40
      mg/day is reached. At this time, sustained-release MPH will be given as two 20 mg doses (one
      in the morning and one in the afternoon). Depending on a participant's tolerance of MPH, the
      dose will be increased to a maximum of 60 mg/day (40 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the
      afternoon). Participants who are unable to tolerate a dose of at least 40 mg/day of MPH will
      be discontinued from the study. Assessments of ADHD symptoms will be completed at weekly
      study visits. In addition, drug use assessments will also be completed and will include
      self-reports and urine toxicology tests.
