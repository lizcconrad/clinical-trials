  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tuberculin skin test (TST) has been the gold standard for diagnosing latent tuberculosis
      for almost 100 years. While this test performs reasonably well in healthy, non-bacille
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated populations, it is believed to perform less well in patients
      who do not have intact cellular immune systems (immunocompromised).

      The investigators hypothesize that a new test, the T-SPOT TB ELISPOT test will provide a more
      accurate measurement of latent infection in immunocompromised people. This study will compare
      the TST to the T-SPOT TB ELISPOT test, and to the results of an expert physician diagnostic
      panel.

      Main Study Question:

      We propose to investigate the correlation between the traditional TST-based method of
      screening for latent tuberculosis infection in specific immunocompromised populations as
      recommended by Canadian and American standards: the T-SPOT TB ELISPOT test: and an expert
      tuberculosis physician panel incorporating the Mantoux test, a risk factor survey, and a
      chest radiograph.

      Secondary Study Question:

      In a subset of patients who have tested positive on both the Mantoux and T-SPOT ELISPOT tests
      prior to undergoing additional immune suppression i.e., patients pre-bone marrow transplant
      and rheumatology patients pre-receipt of anti-TNF alpha therapy or high dose corticosteroids,
      we propose to repeat the T-SPOT ELISPOT and Mantoux after immune suppression to assess the
      development of cutaneous anergy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for the study are broad.

          -  Participants can be enrolled regardless of race, gender, risk of exposure to TB,
             metabolic disorders or coinfection with non-TB agents.

          -  Only participants who have provided written informed consent will be included.

          -  Patients belonging to the four following groups will be considered eligible for
             tuberculosis screening and inclusion in the T-SPOT ELISPOT study:

               -  Patients with end stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal
                  dialysis;

               -  Recipients of solid organ transplants;

               -  Recipients of, or candidates for, an allogeneic stem cell transplant for
                  hematologic malignancies;

               -  Patients with rheumatologic diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE],
                  rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis) who are receiving, or about to receive,
                  immunosuppressive therapy, including corticosteroids and anti-TNF alpha
                  inhibitors.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have not signed an informed consent

          -  Hemophiliacs or individuals who, on the advice of the enrolling physician, may
             otherwise be at increased risk of an adverse reaction to venipuncture or tuberculin
             skin test administration
