  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), the administration of gradually increasing quantities
      of an allergen extract to an allergic patient, is a curative approach which directly treats
      the underlying allergic disease. GrassMATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal
      specific immunotherapy for patients with an allergy to grass pollen (hay fever). The purpose
      of this double-blind Phase IIb study is to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of
      different doses of GrassMATAMPL in volunteers allergic to grasses and rye pollen.

             dermatologic, venereal, neurologic or psychiatric diseases or disorders

          -  Any clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) abnormal laboratory
             value

          -  Perennial allergens: clinically relevant sensitivity against house dust mites, molds,
             and epithelia

          -  Patient has clinically relevant sensitivity against the following summer/autumn season
             flowering plants: plantain, orache, nettle, mugwort, Bermuda grass, or ragweed.
