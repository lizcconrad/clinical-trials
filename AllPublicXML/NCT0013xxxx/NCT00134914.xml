  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine is a treatment for opioid dependence. Naloxone is given in addition to
      buprenorphine in order to limit the abuse potential that is commonly associated with
      buprenorphine. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of buprenorphine/naloxone
      when given through different routes and at different doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine, a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid (or partial agonist), is a safe and
      effective treatment for opioid dependence. However, there is concern that buprenorphine may
      be abused due to its high abuse potential. A sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone combination
      tablet may reduce the risk of abuse associated with buprenorphine alone. The purpose of this
      study is to characterize the effects of buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid-dependent
      individuals.

      This study will last 10 weeks. Participants will stay in a residential research unit, and
      will be maintained on oral hydromorphone (10 mg). During twice-weekly experimental sessions,
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sublingual tablets, intramuscular
      injections, or a placebo. The 15 conditions studied will include: sublingual or intramuscular
      buprenorphine/naloxone (1/0.25 mg, 2/0.5 mg, 4/1 mg, 8/2 mg, and 16/4 mg), 0.25 mg of
      intramuscular naloxone (antagonist control), 10 mg of intramuscular hydromorphone (agonist
      control), sublingual and intramuscular buprenorphine (8 mg), and placebo.
