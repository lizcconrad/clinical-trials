      The purpose of the study is to compare one type of dressing against the current standard
      dressing that is used to cover the unburned area of the skin where a piece of skin is removed
      to cover another part of the body that was burned.

      Hypothesis: The mean healing time for wounds treated with the Dermafill dressing will be less
      than the mean healing time for wounds treated with Xeroform dressing.

      At the time of the procedure, donor sites that are symmetrical in size and shape will be
      selected. The donor sites will be harvested. Once the grafts have been harvested, the wounds
      will be randomized for treatment using either the Dermafill dressing or Xeroform. The wound
      dressings will then be observed at least once a day beginning post op day 2/48hours after
      surgery until healed, which is defined as 90% or more of the wound surface is confluently
      re-epithelized.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older; male or female.

          -  Burn wounds less than 30% of total body surface area (TBSA) with no systemic
             abnormalities

          -  Burns do not involve the harvesting area

          -  Burn wounds require excision and grafting of sufficient extent to justify two donor
             sites of equal and symmetrical size on non-dependent body surface areas

          -  Scheduled excision and grafting procedure is the first such operation for subject
             during this hospitalization

          -  Subject agrees to participate in follow-up evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Critical illnesses requiring ventilator support, systemic infection or hemodynamic
             instability

          -  Major acute or chronic illnesses affecting wound healing (e.g. peripheral vascular
             disease, insulin dependent diabetes, blood clotting disorder)

          -  Subject receiving medications that inhibit/compromise wound healing (e.g.
             anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, oral steroids). The use of anticoagulants does not
             include deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

          -  Cellulitis or other infection of potential donor site

          -  Previously harvested donor site

          -  Subjects with greater than 30% TBSA burns

          -  Pregnancy
