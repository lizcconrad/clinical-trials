  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate PTK787/ZK 222584, a drug that blocks new blood
      vessel growth, in the treatment of patients with non-metastatic androgen independent prostate
      cancer. This study will assess the safety and tolerability of PTK787/ZK 222584, and evaluate
      serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II trial of PTK787/ZK 222584. Patients will receive 750 mg daily
      for one week, 1000 mg daily for the second week, and then 1250 mg per day thereafter.

      Response Assessment: In the absence of toxicity or clinical progression, patients will remain
      in the study until their PSA (Prostate-specific Antigen) has doubled from pretreatment
      baseline.
