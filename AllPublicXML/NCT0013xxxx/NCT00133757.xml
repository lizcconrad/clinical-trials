  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we, the investigators at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, intend to
      explore whether bupropion is able to reduce smokers' responses to cigarette-related
      environmental cues, and craving. Previous studies have indicated that bupropion may be able
      to achieve these outcomes. Therefore, we predict that smokers treated with bupropion for
      several weeks will show reduced reactivity to cigarette cues and craving.

      Current smoking cessation pharmacotherapy paradigms ignore the over-learned behaviour
      associated with smoking, thus contributing to the relatively poor absolute efficacy of
      pharmacotherapy. Chronic nicotine use causes adaptive changes in the brain that differ from
      the acute effects leading to craving when smoking is stopped. This is a key element of
      relapse. Thus, the development of more effective treatments involves a better understanding
      of craving and relapse by exploring the interaction between the psychology and neurobiology
      of nicotine addiction. Bupropion, an amphetamine derivative, has demonstrated efficacy in
      smoking cessation in motivated smokers. Its' mechanism of action is unclear but may be
      mediated by extinction processes. We hypothesize that bupropion will reduce
      cue-responsiveness and subsequent cravings in current smokers who are not consciously
      attempting to quit or cut down on smoking. Fifty smokers (&gt;10 cigarettes/day) of either sex
      will be recruited to take either oral placebo or bupropion 150 mg twice daily for a total of
      42 days. Subjects will attend bi-weekly experimental sessions where cue-responsiveness will
      be measured using physiological and subjective responses to a variety of neutral and
      smoking-related cues. Subjective effects will be measured using the Questionnaire of Smoking
      Urges, the Tobacco Craving Questionnaire and Visual Analog Scales. Subjects will record
      smoking behaviour and subjective experiences daily in a smoking diary. Outcome variables
      include cue responsiveness, daily diary ratings, exhaled end tidal CO levels, plasma cotinine
      levels, and subjective effects. Gender effects will be assessed by using sex as a covariate
      in the analysis. This study will provide preliminary data on pharmacotherapy-assisted
      extinction as a novel approach to smoking cessation.
