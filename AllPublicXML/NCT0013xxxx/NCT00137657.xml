  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least three studies in sub-Saharan Africa have demonstrated a decrease in morbidity or
      mortality among HIV-infected adults who took daily cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim
      sulfamethoxazole) [CTX] prophylaxis. Because of the demonstrated beneficial effect, high
      tolerability and low cost of CTX, the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)
      recommends that HIV-infected persons with symptomatic HIV or depressed CD4 counts receive
      daily CTX. The effect of this recommendation on subsequent development of antimicrobial
      resistance to antifolates among important pathogens needs to be evaluated. The investigators
      measured the change in the prevalence of markers of antifolate resistance among P.
      falciparum, and the change in the prevalence of CTX resistance among S. pneumoniae, and E.
      coli in HIV-infected individuals receiving CTX daily prophylaxis. In addition, the
      investigators measured the change in the prevalence of naso-pharyngeal or oro-pharyngeal
      carriage of CTX resistant S. pneumoniae among children living in households where an
      HIV-infected adult was receiving CTX daily prophylaxis.

      We conducted this study in Kisumu, Kenya where HIV prevalence is high and malaria is highly
      endemic. HIV infected and uninfected adults were assigned to receive daily CTX if CD4 cell
      count was &lt;350, or daily multivitamin if CD4 cell count was &gt;= 350 or if the client was HIV
      negative. All clients were then followed for a total of 6 months. At specified scheduled and
      sick visits, clients received a physical exam, blood smears, nasopharyngeal swabs and stool
      samples or rectal swabs. Samples collected at baseline and during follow-up were used to
      measure the change in CTX resistance among P. falciparum parasites, pneumococcus isolates,
      and commensal E. coli.
