  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CRiALS is an umbrella protocol through which people are recruited to participate in a range
      of research studies being conducted by the ALS Research Collaboration (ARC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research goals include elucidation of the complex relationship between ALS and related
      neurodegenerative disorders, development of both wet and dry biomarkers of disease, and
      delineation of the full course of the natural history of disease from the early
      pre-symptomatic stages through established and even late-stage disease. These goals are
      accomplished through the recruitment and evaluation of patients with ALS and related
      diseases, family members (including people at genetic risk for ALS, but who are not yet
      affected), and healthy controls.

        The CRiALS research program aims to recruit three types of participants:

          -  Individuals affected with ALS or a related neurodegenerative disease

          -  Unaffected individuals from pedigrees in which the genetic cause of ALS is known

          -  Healthy controls
      </textblock>
    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age.

          2. Member of at least one of the following categories:

               1. Individuals affected with ALS or a related neurodegenerative disease (sporadic or
                  familial)

               2. Unaffected individuals from fALS pedigrees, including pre-symptomatic individuals
                  at genetic risk for ALS or individuals from pedigrees of ALS related diseases.

               3. Healthy controls

          3. Able and willing to comply with relevant procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject has a condition or is in a situation which, in the PI's opinion, could confound the
        study finding or may interfere significantly with the individual's participation and
        compliance with the study protocol -- including but not limited to neurological,
        psychological and/or medical conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, neuropathy, myelopathy).
