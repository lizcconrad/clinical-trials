      To establish the safety and efficacy of two dose levels of Ex-vivo Cultured Adult
      HumanMesenchymal Stem Cells (Prochymal) in subjects experiencing acute GVHD, Grades
      II-IV,post HSC transplant.

      Protocol 260 - Subjects will be randomized with equal probability to the treatment arms (2
      million cells/kg of Prochymal or 8 million cells/kg of Prochymal) using a stratified block
      design. The stratification factor is acute GVHD grade. For the purpose of stratification, the
      GVHD grades are II and III-IV. Treatment with investigational agent was administered on study
      Days 1 and 4. Patients were followed for safety and efficacy until Day 28 after initiation of
      treatment with the investigational agent, or until withdrawal or death, whichever occurred
      first.

      Protocol 261 - Subjects were evaluated for safety until 2 years from Day 1 of the preceding
      Prochymal® Protocol No. 260 until withdrawal or death.

             preceding Prochymal® study.

          -  Subject must have completed their participation in a preceding Prochymal® study.

          -  If female and of child-bearing age, subjects must be non-pregnant, not breast-feeding,
