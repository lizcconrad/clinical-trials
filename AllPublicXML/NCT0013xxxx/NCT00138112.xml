  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized 2-arm study to compare two different times of giving the drug
      vancomycin. Half of the patients will begin vancomycin two days before a bone marrow
      transplant. The other half will get it as soon as they have the first fever.

      Streptococci are bacteria that live in one's mouth and gut. These bacteria can escape into
      the blood when the lining of the mouth and gut weakens from cancer therapy. This can make the
      person who is undergoing a bone marrow transplant very sick. All patients who get this
      infection are treated with antibiotics. Vancomycin is one drug that is used to treat this
      bloodstream infection once it is diagnosed. Studies have shown that giving vancomycin before
      a bone marrow transplant seems to prevent this infection. However, giving vancomycin too soon
      may increase the chance that the kidneys will be irritated. It may also increase the chance
      that other bacteria will become resistant to this drug. We, the investigators at Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, do not know if waiting to start vancomycin until the patient
      has a first fever can also prevent this infection.

      The primary objective of this study is as follows:

        -  To compare prophylactic with empirical vancomycin administration for reducing early
           viridans streptococcal bacteremia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
           (HSCT) patients.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To examine the safety and tolerability for each vancomycin administration approach.

        -  To measure the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections for
           patients managed with each of the two vancomycin administration approaches.
