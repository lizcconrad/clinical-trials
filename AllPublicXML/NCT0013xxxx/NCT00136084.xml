  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two multi-agent chemotherapy
      regimens using different dosages of cytarabine to eliminate all detectable leukemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study compares the effectiveness of two doses of cytarabine combined with set doses of
      daunomycin and etoposide as an initial course of chemotherapy to eliminate minimal residual
      disease. Subsequent therapy is tailored according to cytogenetic risk features, assessments
      of minimal residual disease, and availability of a suitable donor for bone marrow transplant.
      Patients with higher risk disease features are given more intense therapy. For higher risk
      groups, transplant is given to patients with suitable donors.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To assess the prognostic value of biological markers in childhood Acute Myeloid leukemia
           (AML).

        -  To compare the amounts of leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow to study minimal
           residual disease(MRD).

        -  To relate non-invasive cardiac evaluation with health-related quality of life in AML
           patients treated with cardiotoxic therapy during and following therapy.

      Detailed Description of Treatment Plan Induction I Patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive induction therapy that consists of daunomycin, etoposide, and high-dose or low-dose
      cytarabine.

      High-Dose Cytarabine (HDAC) arm:

      Cytarabine 3 gm/m2 IV days 1, 3, 5 Daunomycin 50 mg/m2 IV days 2, 4, 6 Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV
      days 2-6

      Low-Dose Cytarabine(LDAC) arm:

      Cytarabine 100 mg/m2 IV days 1-10 (20 doses) Daunomycin 50 mg/m2 IV days 2, 4, 6 Etoposide
      100 mg/m2 IV days 2-6

      Induction II

      Patients who have &lt; 1% MRD after Induction I will receive daunomycin, cytarabine, etoposide
      (ADE):

      Daunomycin 50 mg/m2 IV days 1, 3, 5 Cytarabine 100 mg/m2 IV 1-8 (16 doses) Etoposide 100
      mg/m2 IV days 1-5

      Patients who have ≥ 1% MRD after Induction I will receive daunomycin, cytarabine, etoposide
      (ADE) + gemtuzumab ozogamicin:

      Daunomycin 50 mg/m2 IV days 1, 3, 5 Cytarabine 100 mg/m2IV days 1-8 (16 doses) Etoposide: 100
      mg/m2 IV on days 1-5 Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) 3 mg/m2 IV on day 1.

      Consolidation I (Chemotherapy course 3)

      The chemotherapy administered in course 3 will be based on the participant's response and
      cytogenetic/morphologic subgroup

      MRD+ patients (except those who received ADE + GO) Gemtuzumab ozogamicin 6 mg/m2 IV on day 1

      MRD+ patients who had No response(NR) to induction I

      These patients should proceed to Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) as soon as possible. In cases
      where SCT is delayed (e.g., during searches for unrelated donors), these patients should
      receive chemotherapy according to their cytogenetic or morphologic subtype until the time of
      SCT.

      MRD- patients (i.e., patients who were MRD- after ADE or after GO) will receive risk-based
      intensification (RBI)

      t(9;11) and inv(16) Cytarabine 500 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion for 120 hours Cladribine
      (2CDA) 9 mg/m2: IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days

      Amend 8 M4/M5 without t(9;11) or inv(16): CE Cytarabine 3 gm/m2 IV q12h x 6 doses (days 1-3)
      by continuous infusion for 3 hours. Etoposide 125 mg/m2 IV on days 2-5 by continuous infusion
      for at least one hour

      t(8;21) and others: HAM Cytarabine 3 g/m2 IV x 6 doses (days 1-3) Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 IV
      days 3-4

      Standard-risk patients with matched related donors and high-risk patients will proceed to
      stem cell transplant per institutional practice

      Consolidation II (Chemotherapy course 4):

      Cytarabine 3 gm/m2 IV q12 hours on days 1, 2, 8, 9 (8 doses) L-Asparaginase 6000 Units/m2 IM
      3 hours after 4th and 8th doses of cytarabine

      Consolidation III (Chemotherapy course 5) Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 IV days 1-3 Cytarabine 1
      gm/m2 IV over 2 hours q12 hours on days 1-3 (6 doses)

      Patients who are in first remission are eligible to be enrolled on the St. Jude protocols
      NKAML protocol and receive Natural Killer (NK) cell therapy instead of Consolidation III or
      after Consolidation III. At the discretion of their primary physician, these patients will be
      offered the option of enrolling on NKAML.

      Some patients with biphenotypic leukemia respond poorly to AML-directed therapy, but respond
      quite well to lymphoid-directed therapy. Patients with such markers who have no response to
      induction I or who fail to achieve complete response (CR) after induction II will therefore
      receive lymphoid directed induction therapy. Other biphenotypic patients will continue to
      receive AML-directed therapy as described above

      All patients will undergo lumbar puncture and receive an age-appropriate dose of intrathecal
      (IT) cytarabine at the time of diagnosis.

      Patients without Central Nervous System disease (CNS)(i.e., less than 5 leukocytes per
      microliter of CSF (colony-stimulating factor) will receive one dose of intrathecal (IT)
      methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine (MHA) with each course of chemotherapy beginning
      with induction II.

      Patients with overt CNS leukemia (more or equal to 5 leukocytes per l microliter of CSF and
      the presence of leukemic blast cells on CSF cytospin) will receive weekly IT MHA therapy
      beginning 1 week after the initial dose of IT cytarabine and continuing until the CSF is free
      of blast cells (minimum number of doses, 4). These patients will then receive 4 additional
      doses of intrathecal therapy with methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine (IT MHA)
      (minimum total number of doses, 8) at approximately 1-month intervals (generally given with
      each subsequent course of chemotherapy).

Power calculations indicate that enrollment of a total of 186 MRD-evaluable patients in a 5-stage O’Brien-Fleming group sequential design gives 80% power at the 5% level to detect a change in the MRD-positive proportion from 0.50 to 0.30.

        <description>Clinical response is defined as MRD (minimal residual disease) measured by flow cytometry at day 22. The MRD at day 22 is classified as positive (with MRD) or negative (no detectable MRD). The relation between inhibition of DNA synthesis and MRD was performed by logistic regression. In the model, logit of probability of MRD positive was regressed on inhibition of DNA synthesis.</description>
