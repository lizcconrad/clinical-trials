  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential hypertension is characterized by impaired endothelial function. Data derived from
      normotensive subjects with a genetic predisposition to arterial hypertension suggest that
      endothelial dysfunction is a cause rather than a consequence of the condition. Given that, in
      normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents, impaired endothelium dependent vasodilation
      can be restored by supplementation of the nitric oxide (NO) precursor L-arginine, a defect in
      the L-arginine/NO pathway can be postulated. The investigators at the University of
      Erlangen-Nuremberg, hypothesize that impaired endothelial function in essential hypertension
      is associated with alterations in L-arginine metabolism and transport. This study will
      determine whether metabolism and transport of L-arginine are altered in patients with
      essential hypertension and whether these potential alterations can be targeted
      therapeutically.
