  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators from Cayetano Heredia University and Johns Hopkins University are doing this
      study. They want to see how people and pigs get infected with a parasite, called cysticercus
      (known as &quot;pig triquina&quot;). Cysticercus attacks the meat of pigs and the brains of people. In
      the intestine, the parasite is known as &quot;solitaria&quot;. This study is to see how treatment in
      both people and pigs works to control the disease.

      This is a prospective intervention study to determine the efficacy and persistence of effect
      over time of a single, chemotherapy intervention in both the human and porcine population.
      Four villages will be selected to be treated against T solium adult (in humans) and larval
      forms (in pigs), and two villages will receive no intervention and will serve as control
      villages. Pigs in control villages will be followed during 3 months only, and then the human
      and porcine populations will receive the intervention treatment. The effect of this
      intervention will be measured by the prevalence of infection in pigs and parasitic burden of
      infected pigs at month 3, 6, 9, and 12.
