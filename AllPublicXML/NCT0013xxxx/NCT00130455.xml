  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to establish the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in the
      treatment of depressive episodes of mild to moderate severity in the elderly.

      The study is designed as a mainly naturalistic study including all patients of 65 years of
      age or above that judged by the clinician would benefit from treatment by an antidepressant
      medication. The study is designed as a double-blind, randomised placebo controlled study with
      two groups of active treatment (escitalopram in two doses, 5 or 10 mg daily) in a twelve week
      period.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In- or out-patients of 65 years of age or above fulfilling the International
             Classification of Diseases-Tenth Edition (ICD-10) diagnosis of depressive single
             episode (F32.00-32.11. 32.8 or 32.9), depressive recurrent episode (F33.00-33.11, 33.8
             or 33.9) or organic depressive episode (F06.32).

          -  The depressive state should be mild to moderate and reach a score on HAM-D6 of ≥ 7 and
             ≤ 11

          -  Patients with dementia can be included provided they have a mini mental state exam
             (MMSE) score of ≥ 17

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a current depressive episode of a severity reaching a score of ≥ 12 on
             the HAM-D6-item depression factor. This is to exclude patients with severe or
             psychotic depression

          -  Patients with suicidal thoughts or behaviour

          -  Patients with conditions where treatment with escitalopram is contraindicated: e.g.
             hypersensitivity to escitalopram or other contents of escitalopram tablets,
             concomitant treatment with non-selective, irreversible mono-amine-oxidase inhibitors,
             such as Marplan

          -  Patients who in the current depressive episode have had a failed trial of treatment
             with escitalopram

          -  Co-morbid dementia with a severity corresponding to a score on the MMSE of less than
             17 as these patients will often be without the ability to give informed consent

          -  Patients with sensory defects rendering psychometric assessment impossible, e.g.
             deafness, blindness, severe aphasia

          -  Patients who cannot speak Danish well enough to make psychometric assessment possible
             and meaningful

          -  Patients with congenital or early acquired intellectual deficits
