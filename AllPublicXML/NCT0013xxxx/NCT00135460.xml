  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved the long time survival of HIV
      infected individuals. However an increasing number of HIV-patients have developed metabolic
      and morphological alterations including peripheral lipoatrophy.

      There is limited knowledge about lipodystrophic adverse events in nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing regimens. The hypothesis is that nucleoside analogues
      are responsible for development of lipoatrophy, and, patients receiving an NRTI-sparing
      regimen will have little risk of peripheral lipoatrophy.

      The researchers plan to perform a randomized study recruiting 100 antiretroviral naive
      patients that will be randomized to receive a nucleoside analogue sparing HAART regimen or a
      protease-inhibitor sparing regimen.

      The main endpoint is changes in peripheral fat mass as determined by dual energy X-ray
      absortiometry (DEXA)-scanning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Antiretroviral naïve patients

          -  HIV-1 infection as documented by a licensed HIV-1 antibody ELISA.

          -  Fulfilling the criteria for starting antiretroviral therapy.

          -  Ability to understand and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:
