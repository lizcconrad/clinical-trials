  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has been approved for control of blood pressure in adults, yet
      there are no controlled studies in children. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      efficacy and safety of sodium nitroprusside in children who will be having surgery, and who
      require blood pressure lowering in order to decrease the amount of blood loss during their
      surgery.

      The trial is a multicenter randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging,
      effect-controlled study examining the effects of sodium nitroprusside in pediatric subjects
      requiring relative hypotension during a surgical or medical procedure. The goal is to
      establish the starting and maximum infusion rates that afford optimum blood pressure control
      in children and a safe dosing regimen in children. The objective is to describe the
      relationship between the infusion rate of nitroprusside and changes in blood pressure.

      The specific aims of this trial are:

        1. To define the onset and offset of blood pressure lowering effects of nitroprusside to
           obtain adequate instructions for dose titration in the pediatric population.

        2. To construct a dose-response model that defines the relationship between nitroprusside
           infusion rate and changes in blood pressure in pediatric subjects.

        3. To assess the safety of nitroprusside administration in pediatric subjects requiring
           controlled reduction of blood pressure.

          -  Neonates must be full-term gestation and have a body weight of at least 2.5 kg

          -  Subject requires pharmacologically-induced hypotension for acute blood pressure
             management for surgery or other invasive procedure, e.g., cerebral artery embolization
