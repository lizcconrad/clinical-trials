  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the feasibility and clinical safety and
      efficacy of non-invasive inhaled nitric oxide in infants with PPHN without significant
      pulmonary +-parenchymal disease who would normally receive inhaled nitric oxide only after
      placement of a tracheal tube and the institution of mechanical ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blending low doses of NO gas with oxygen in the inspiratory limb of mechanical ventilators is
      an effective method for reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and decreasing extrapulmonary
      right-to-left shunting at the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale in many patients with PPHN.
      However, in some patients with PPHN, sustained elevations of PVR may occur in the absence of
      or despite improvement in the parenchymal lung disease such that mechanical ventilation is
      not needed for maintaining adequate gas exchange.

      PPN in the absence of pulmonary parenchymal disease or despite improvement in the parenchymal
      lung disease occurs in a significant subset of newborn infants with hypoxemic respiratory
      failure. Inhaled NO can be effectively delivered by non-invasive techniques to newborn
      infants with PPHN, potentially reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation, while safely
      treating the elevation in pulmonary artery pressure and right-to-left.

      A dose of 10-20 ppm measured within the delivery device is sufficient to maintain
      nasopharyngeal concentrations within a range of 1-10 ppm. My co-authors and I have also
      reported a series of eleven infants with pulmonary hypertension treated with low dose iNO
      delivered via nasal cannula after extubation at the 14th Annual CNMC Symposium on ECMO &amp;
      Advanced Therapies for Respiratory Failure, Keystone, CO, 1998.
