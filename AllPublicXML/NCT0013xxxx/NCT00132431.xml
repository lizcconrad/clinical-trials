    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the effects and safety of Sensipar approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients with kidney failure who are being treated with
      dialysis and have uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT).

      The purposes of this study are: - To assess the effectiveness of a treatment algorithm that
      includes Sensipar on bio-intact parathyroid hormone (biPTH), adjusted serum calcium (Ca),
      serum phosphorus (P), and calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P) levels in the management of
      SHPT in CKD subjects on dialysis by determining achievement of National Kidney Foundation
      Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Guideline targets. - To assess the use of
      vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders when Sensipar is incorporated in the treatment of
      SHPT. - To assess the safety and tolerability of Sensipar.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects with chronic kidney disease who have received dialysis for
        at least one month before the first dose of study medication and are clinically stable. -
        Adults at least 18 years of age who have given written informed consent. - Out of target
        PTH values, defined as the most recent historical measurement of biPTH &gt; 160 pg/mL within 3
        months prior to informed consent signature. - Serum calcium &gt;/= 8.4 mg/dL within one month
        prior to informed consent signature. Exclusion Criteria: - Unstable medical condition,
        defined as having been hospitalized within 30 days before Day 1, or otherwise unstable in
        the judgement of the investigator. Hospitalization solely for dialysis vascular access
        revision does not qualify as an unstable medical condition. - Parathyroidectomy in the 3
        months before Day 1. - Current gastrointestinal disorder that may be associated with
        impaired absorption of orally administered medications or an inability to swallow tablets.
        - Use of investigational drug or device or participation in trial of investigational drug
        or device (except experimental dialysis machines) within 30 days of enrollment into the
        study. Any investigational procedures. - Females of child-bearing potential who are
        pregnant (e.g., positive serum pregnancy test) or are breast feeding. Females of child
        bearing potential who refuse to use highly effective contraceptive measures (as determined
        by the investigator) throughout the study. - Hypersensitivity to Sensipar or any of its
        components. - Previously participated in this or any other Sensipar study, or received/is
        receiving Sensipar as a commercially available product. - Disorder that would compromise
        the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study
        procedures.
