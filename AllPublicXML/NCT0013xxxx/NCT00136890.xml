  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women. Although overall
      survival remains poor, early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is potentially curable.
      Improved staging has led to stage-specific therapies such that patients with early stage
      NSCLC are potential candidates for surgical resection, and those with more advanced disease
      are spared the morbidity and risk of mortality from thoracotomy and pulmonary resection.
      Despite contemporary staging techniques, 25-50% of patients who appear to have limited
      disease amenable to surgical resection go on to die from metastatic lung cancer. If occult
      micro-metastatic disease that becomes evident later could be detected reliably during the
      pre-operative assessment, patients harboring such disease could be spared a non-curative
      thoracotomy. PET imaging has the potential to detect mediastinal and extrathoracic metastatic
      disease not detected by conventional imaging modalities.

      This prospective, multicenter trial will enroll patients with biopsy-proven clinical stage
      I-IIIA NSCLC who are considered to be candidates for surgical resection with curative intent.
      Preoperatively, patients will be randomized to conventional staging for metastatic disease
      (CT liver/adrenals, total body bone scan, and CT with contrast or MRI with gadolinium of the
      brain) versus whole body PET or PET-CT and brain CT or MRI with contrast/gadolinium.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological proof of NSCLC

          -  Stage I, II, or IIIA NSCLC based upon clinical staging

          -  The primary lesion appears technically appropriate for surgical resection, based on
             information from the chest x-ray (CXR) and CT thorax.

          -  Age over 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor pulmonary function precluding radical surgery (inadequate pulmonary reserve for
             radical surgery) with predicted post-resection forced expiratory volume in 1 second
             (FEV1) &lt; 0.8 liter or &lt; 40% predicted, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon
             monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 40% predicted

          -  Poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 3-4)

          -  Significant concurrent medical problems (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, active cardiac
             problems, significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) making the patient unfit
             for surgery

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Unable to lie supine for imaging with PET

          -  Patients with previously treated cancer other than non-melanotic skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, unless disease-free for 5 years or greater

          -  Patients who, at the time of the initial evaluation, have already undergone a whole
             body PET/PET-CT, CT brain, MRI brain, total body bone scan or mediastinoscopy within 8
             weeks prior to randomization will be excluded. However, patients who have had a CT
             scan of the thorax with abdomen are not excluded.
