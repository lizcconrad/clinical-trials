  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STA-5326 is an experimental drug that has been shown to block the release of interleukin-12
      from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Given this activity on the immune system, STA-5326
      mesylate is a potential treatment for various autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease,
      that are mediated by the inappropriate expression of Th1 cytokines.

      This study is evaluating the use of STA-5326 mesylate in patients with moderate to severe,
      active Crohn's disease. Study visits include a screening visit, 9 treatment period visits
      over 6 months and a follow-up visit that will occur 30 days following the end of treatment.
      Study drug treatment will continue for up to 6 months.
