  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III clinical trial for patients with potentially completely resectable
      primary retroperitoneal sarcoma. Patients who take part will be divided into two groups, a
      radiation therapy plus surgery group and a surgery alone group.

      Patients in the radiation therapy plus surgery group will receive radiation treatments as an
      outpatient. Surgery to try to remove the remaining tumor will be done after the radiation
      treatments are completed.

      Patients in the surgery alone group will have surgery to try to remove all tumor.

      Primary Objective: To ascertain whether patients with completely resected (R0 + R1), primary
      retroperitoneal sarcoma who are randomized to pre-operative IMRT and surgery have a longer
      recurrence-free survival compared to patients randomized to treatment with surgery alone.

      Secondary Objectives: To ascertain whether patients with completely resected (R0 + R1),
      primary retroperitoneal sarcoma randomized to pre-operative IMRT and surgery have longer
      overall survival compared to patients randomized to treatment with surgery alone.

        -  To compare the resectability rate between the two arms

        -  Determine the variability of NMR biochemical profiles and the variability of expression
           for genes/proteins involved in adipocyte differentiation, cell cycle control and
           apoptosis within different regions of the primary retroperitoneal sarcoma in patients
           treated with surgery alone and pre-operative radiotherapy.

        -  Analyze NMR biochemical patterns and expression patterns for genes/proteins involved in
           adipocyte differentiation, cell cycle control and apoptosis to identify markers that can
           provide an objective measure of sarcoma differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

        -  Predict the response of sarcoma to radiation therapy and the risk of local recurrence,
           based on data derived from NMR biochemical and gene/protein expression patterns in
           patient tumors that recurred compared to those without recurrence.

        -  Determine if diffusion-weighted MRI early in course of radiation therapy can predict the
           ultimate pathologic response of sarcoma following resection and the risk of local
           recurrence.

        -  Analyze plasma levels of VEGF, FGF, Ang-1, Ang-2 and endostatin prior to and following
           therapy and correlate with treatment response, local and distant recurrence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with primary retroperitoneal/pelvic soft tissue sarcoma.

          -  Gross total resection (RO or R1) must be feasible.

          -  No prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy is allowable.

          -  Patients should be over 18 years of age and capable of providing informed consent
             indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this trial, in keeping with
             hospital policy.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 70 %

          -  No other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy is allowable.

          -  Adequate organ function defined as follows: absolute granulocytes &gt;= 1,500/mm 3,
             platelets &gt;= 150,000/mm 3, serum bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 mg/dl, serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5
             mg/dl.
