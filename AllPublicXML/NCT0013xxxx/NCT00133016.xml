  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy of early amniotomy on
      reducing both the duration of labor and the frequency of dystocia in nulliparous women
      undergoing an induction of labor. This research project is a prospective, parallel clinical
      trial, in which subjects are randomized into one of two treatment groups: those who undergo
      early amniotomy and those who do not undergo early artificial rupture of the amniotic
      membranes.
