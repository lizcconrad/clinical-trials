  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery after major abdominal surgery can be longer than other types of surgery. This is
      because often after abdominal surgery, the bowel does not work normally. When this happens,
      patients are unable to pass gas. This can lead to bloating, pain, nausea and vomiting. These
      symptoms are called postoperative ileus.

      We, the researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), are doing this study
      to compare two methods of treating pain during and after major gynecological surgery. The two
      methods are called patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) and patient-controlled
      intravenous analgesia (PCA). PCA is the standard of care for women having major gynecological
      surgery. We are going to compare PCEA to PCA to see if PCEA will improve recovery after major
      gynecologic surgery.

      PCEA is a well established method used to ease pain in many settings such as during
      childbirth and bowel surgery. There have been several studies showing that PCEA is as good as
      and sometimes better for pain relief than PCA. PCEA may help the bowel work better by
      preventing ileus after surgery. However, this has never been looked at in women having major
      gynecologic surgery. This study will also look at whether preventing this ileus will lead to
      patients going home or returning to regular activities sooner.

      The objective of this study is pain at rest and coughing in addition to determine the effect
      of intraoperative and postoperative thoracic patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA)
      compared to postoperative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on postoperative
      recovery parameters, such as time to potential discharge and resumption of intestinal
      function after major open gynecologic surgery. The population included in this study will be
      women undergoing a laparotomy for major abdominal or pelvic surgery by the gynecology
      service. There will be a total of 240 women recruited for this study, with an accrual rate of
      5 to 10 patients per month. This study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial.
      Subjects will be randomized to either general anesthesia with postoperative intravenous
      patient controlled analgesia (control group) or general anesthesia with intraoperative
      thoracic epidural anesthesia and postoperative thoracic patient-controlled epidural analgesia
      (treatment group). This study will not be blinded because of the ethical issues with placing
      a &quot;sham&quot; epidural catheter in half of the study participants. These patients will be followed
      prospectively and relevant postoperative parameters will be measured in both groups and
      compared. This study will address the potential benefits of epidural analgesia on multiple
      measurements of postoperative recovery. This study will address the potential benefits of
      epidural analgesia on multiple measurements of postoperative recovery. The primary outcome of
      interest in this study is pain at rest and when coughing. The secondary outcome is the time
      to potential discharge.

    <description>patient-controlled epidural analgesia PCEA involves having an epidural catheter placed before surgery.The epidural catheter will be used during surgery to give drugs, such as morphine and a local anesthetic bupivacaine, which will help control pain. After surgery, a constant flow of pain-reducing medicine, such as morphine, will be given through the catheter. This is controlled by the patient.</description>
