      This is a comparison of radiotherapy fractionation schemes for brain metastasis.

      Untreated brain metastases are usually fatal within a few weeks. The standard treatment for
      brain metastases is whole brain irradiation. This results on average in an increase in
      survival by 2 to 4 times compared to withholding irradiation. The majority of patients
      experience improvement in the level of functioning as a result of irradiation. None-the-less
      approximately half of patients die because of progression of the brain metastases and their
      quality of life is often dominated by the effects of brain metastases.

      Various different dosages of radiation have been assessed and we wish to further investigate
      this by comparing a less intense schema with a more intense schema. Both of these fall within
      the range of published experience but have not been directly compared. The more intense
      schema may have more effect on the tumour but previous variations of dose intensity have not
      shown significant differences in survival. Differences in control of the metastases in the
      brain have been suggested but there have been no good comparisons of quality of life.
      Obviously when survival is measured on average in only 3 to 6 months, this is an important
      parameter for comparison.

      Comparisons: Stratification is by diagnosis either excision or biopsy/clinical. Patients will
      be randomised to receive either 40Gy 20#bd or 20Gy 4#daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 2.

          -  Brain metastasis. Brain biopsy not obligatory if known previous malignancy and
             multiple lesions typical on computed tomography (CT) scan of brain. Solitary lesions,
             if suitably located, should be biopsied and preferably excised.

          -  Extracranial disease stable or absent (i.e. no progression over 2 months) OR
             concurrent presentation of brain metastasis and extracranial disease at time of
             initial cancer diagnosis.

          -  Able to consent

          -  Life expectancy exceeds 2 months
