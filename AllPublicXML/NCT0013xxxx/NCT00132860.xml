    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate,﻿ in patients with moderate to severe chronic
      obstructive lung disease, whether intermittent antibiotic treatment leads to:

        -  A slower rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1);

        -  A reduction in the frequency and severity of exacerbations;

        -  Fewer hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);

        -  Lower mortality;

        -  An improved quality of life as compared to a group of placebo treated patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients above 50 years of age, with a current admission for exacerbation of COLD or
             at least one admission within the previous two years.

          -  Current or ex-smoker

          -  Postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 60% in stable condition (&gt; 4 weeks after hospitalisation)

          -  &lt; 300 ml bronchodilator reversibility in FEV1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with end-stage COLD, who are not expected to survive for 3 years (typically
             bedridden patients being dyspnoeic in rest).

          -  Patients with known other respiratory tract infection, e.g. tuberculosis or
             aspergillosis, in whom the intervention is known to be inefficient.

          -  Patients with pulmonary malignancy

          -  Patients with other pulmonary diseases than COLD.

          -  Patients with immunodeficiency. However, COLD patients treated with steroids can be
             included.

          -  Patients with known hereditary disposition to lung infections such as
             alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia.

          -  Patients receiving longterm antibiotic treatment ( e.g. recurrent cystitis).

          -  Patients with known allergy or intolerance to azithromycin

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  Manifest heart, liver or renal insufficiency

          -  Patients that, for reasons not stated above, are unlikely to be able to participate in
             a study period of 3 years.
