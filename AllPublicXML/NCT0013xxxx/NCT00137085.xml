  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the investigators at Queen's University, propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind,
      feasibility trial comparing low-dose ketamine versus fentanyl as adjuncts to Emergency
      Department procedural sedation with propofol. The outcomes of interest will be safety, with
      respect to hemodynamic and respiratory adverse effects, as well as efficacy, with respect to
      adequacy of sedation and analgesia, recovery profiles and patient/physician satisfaction. Our
      hypothesis, based on a review of existing anesthesia literature, is that low-dose ketamine
      may be a safer and more efficacious alternative to fentanyl when used as an adjunct to
      propofol-assisted procedural sedation.

      This initial, single-centre feasibility study will have the following specific objectives:

        -  Comparison of low-dose ketamine with fentanyl as adjunct to propofol-assisted emergency
           department procedural sedation, with respect to safety and efficacy parameters;

        -  Pilot of a blinded emergency department sedation and analgesia protocol, including drug
           doses, concealment techniques, and data collection tools, to determine the feasibility
           of a subsequent larger, multi-centre trial;

        -  Determination of the true incidence of the primary outcome measures in the study
           population, using the study drug administration doses and protocol, such that an
           accurate sample size may be estimated for a future, adequately-powered, multi-centre
           trial;

        -  Validation of a newly-developed ordered, categorical rating scale for the reporting of
           respiratory and hemodynamic adverse events occurring during emergency department
           procedural sedation and analgesia.
