  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, long-term extension study in male and female patients with
      mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) who must have completed one of the following
      studies: AAB-001-201 or AAB-001-102. All patients enrolled in Study AAB-001-251 will receive
      infusions of AAB-001 (bapineuzumab), including patients randomized to placebo in Study 201
      and 102. Approximately 30 study sites in the US will be involved. Each patient's
      participation may vary from 3 months up to 84 months depending on the date of enrollment in
      this study.

      AAB-001 (bapineuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and potentially
      clears beta amyloid peptide, and is designed to provide antibodies to beta amyloid directly
      to the patient.

             subject's caregiver in accordance with the local regulations.

          2. Subjects must have completed Study 201 Visit 22 (Week 78), or Study 102 Visit 11 (Week
             16).

          3. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of sufficient quality for the Radiologist to evaluate
             subject safety from Study 201 Visit 21 (Week 71), or Study 251 Screening Visit for
             subjects from Study 102.

          4. Lives at home with appropriate caregiver capable of accompanying the subject on all
             clinic visits, or community dwelling with caregiver capable of accompanying the
             subject on all clinic visits and visiting with the subject approximately five times
             per week for the duration of the study.

          5. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject and the caregiver will be compliant.
