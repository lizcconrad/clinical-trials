  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of this study may or may not establish useful baseline data, which will help us
      understand how bone marrow derived adult liver stem cells behave in normal healthy
      adults/volunteers (the control group), and in patients undergoing liver surgery. The bone
      marrow is located within your bones and is the organ which is responsible to produce blood
      cells and stem cells. Bone marrow derived adult liver stem cells are normal cells in your
      bone marrow. These liver stem cells have the capacity to regenerate or in other words to
      rebuild the liver after liver surgery, a process called liver regeneration. These cells are
      very important for the liver to regrow its tissue after liver surgery. These cells are
      thought to be activated in times of need by the liver.

      Situations like liver surgery are one of these occasions when the liver will need the &quot;extra
      help&quot; from these stem cells.

      The results of this study will establish the baseline data necessary for the understanding of
      how to harness the ability of these stem cells in times of liver surgery. Improvements in the
      ability of the liver to regrow after surgery is thought to decrease complications related to
      liver surgery. Harnessing this unique ability of stem cells may be utilized in the future to
      enhance the regrowing process of liver tissue after liver surgery, called liver regeneration.

    <description>At the time of preoperative testing, patients will have two extra test tubes (5cc blue top) of blood drawn for determination of pre-operative base line levels of bone marrow derived liver stem cells in peripheral blood. Intraoperatively, blood will be drawn after liver resection (two tubes of 5cc blue top). Two extra tube of blood will be drawn at the same time of routine postoperative blood drawing to determine levels of bone marrow derived liver stem cells in peripheral blood on post-operative days #1, and #3.</description>
