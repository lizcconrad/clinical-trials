  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior preclinical and clinical studies have shown that tumors from patients with advanced
      melanoma contain tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with anti-tumor reactivity. These TIL
      can be expanded in the laboratory to large numbers, and reinfused to the patient. Using a
      chemotherapy regimen that selectively kills lymphocytes, a single institution Phase II study
      of 35 patients showed a 51% objective response rate to TIL and interleukin-2 injection. In
      the present trial we would like to investigate whether we can achieve similar results in a
      Hadassah Phase II study, and to determine the feasibility of applying this approach to
      patients with advanced melanoma who currently have few treatment options.

    <description>Patients will have a melanoma metastasis resected and cultured in IL-2 in vitro. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from these cultures will be assessed for tumor reactivity and those with such activity will be further expanded and adoptively transferred. Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day x2 days IV)and fludarabine (25 mg/mE2/day IV x5days). Following this regimen, patients will receive an intravenous adoptive transfer of at least 10E9 tumor-reactive lymphocytes followed by high dose IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg/dose IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses).</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tumor/TIL Harvest Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Less than 4 weeks has elapsed since any prior systemic therapy or less than six
                  weeks since prior nitrosourea therapy

               -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the potentially dangerous
                  effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant.

               -  Life expectancy of less than three months.

               -  Patients who have received prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody will be
                  excluded unless a post anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment colonoscopy was normal with
                  normal colonic biopsies.

               -  Patients who require immediate active treatment for symptomatic CNS lesions will
                  not be eligible until after treatment of their symptomatic lesions.

          -  Cell Infusion Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Less than 4 weeks has elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the
                  patient receives the preparative regimen, or less than six weeks since prior
                  nitrosourea therapy. All patients' toxicities must have recovered to a grade 1 or
                  less or as specified in the eligibility criteria. Patients may have undergone
                  minor surgical procedures or focal palliative radiotherapy (to non-target
                  lesions) within the past 4 weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered to
                  grade 1 or less or as specified in the eligibility criteria.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
                  potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or
                  infant.

               -  Life expectancy of less than three months.

               -  Requirement for systemic steroid therapy.

               -  Any active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major
                  medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as
                  evidenced by a positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial
                  infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.

                  competence after chemotherapy or radiation therapy as evidenced by normal ANC &gt;
                  1000/mm3 and absence of opportunistic infections. (The experimental treatment
                  being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who
                  have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the experimental
                  treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seropositive for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune competence and thus are less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C will be excluded.

                  symptoms of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias and have a LVEF &lt; 45% on a cardiac
                  stress test (stress thallium, stress MUGA, dobutamine, echocardiogram or other
                  stress test)

               -  Similarly, patients who are 50 years old or greater with an LVEF &lt; 45% will be
                  excluded

               -  Patients who have a prolonged history of cigarette smoking or symptoms of
                  respiratory dysfunction will be excluded if they have an abnormal pulmonary
                  function test as evidenced by a FEV1 &lt; 60% predicted.

               -  Patients who have received prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody will be
                  excluded unless a subsequent colonoscopy was normal with normal colonic biopsies
                  (to rule out colitis).

               -  Patients who require immediate treatment for symptomatic CNS lesions will not be
