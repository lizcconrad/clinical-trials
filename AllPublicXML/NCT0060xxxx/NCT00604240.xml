  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first few weeks after leaving the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can be a difficult
      transition time for caregivers of a previously hospitalized infant. To help ease this
      stressful period, doctors and nurses give caregivers a large amount of information prior to
      their infant leaving the NCIU. How much caregivers remember about medications, follow-up
      appointments, and general well-child care has not been studied. Caregivers who choose to
      participate will receive a phone call 2-7 days after discharge where they will be asked
      questions pertaining to the information that was discussed with them at the time of
      discharge. The purpose of the study is to determine how much information caregivers retain
      after leaving the NICU.
