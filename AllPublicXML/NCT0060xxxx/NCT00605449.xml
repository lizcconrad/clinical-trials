    <textblock>
      This study is a 3-period crossover drug interaction study between GSK376501 and simvastatin
      in healthy adult subjects. This study will examine if repeat doses of GSK376501 affects the
      pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and if repeat doses of simvastatin affects the
      pharmacokinetics of GSK375601.

             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator considers that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential,

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Demonstrates an average QTc interval &lt; 450 msec (or &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle
             Branch Block), an average PR interval &lt; 200 msec, and a QRS duration &lt; 110msec (manual
             or machine read) at screening or baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Previous exposure to GSK376501.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they experience symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmia of
             any clinical significance during screening.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen and is unwilling to abstain
             from 72 hours prior to dose until follow-up. A minimum list of drugs that will be
             screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and
             benzodiazepines.

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or use of tobacco or
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Has a history of alcohol abuse or dependence within 12 months prior to the study.
             Alcohol abuse is defined as an average consumption of greater than 7 drinks per week
             for women or greater than 14 drinks per week for men. One alcohol drink is defined as
             the equivalent of 12 g of alcohol as follows: 5 oz/150 ml wine, 12 oz (360 ml) beer or
             1.5 oz (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

             is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the
             first dose of study medication and is unwilling to abstain from use of these
             medications until the last pharmacokinetic sample has been collected, unless in the
             opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere
             with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  Use of caffeine- or xanthine-containing products for 24 hours prior to the start of
             dosing until collection of the final pharmacokinetic and sample of each study period.
