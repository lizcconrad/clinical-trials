  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physicians often have an ambivalent relationship to placebo interventions. On the one hand
      they know of the intriguing effect of sugar pills or saline infusions but on the other hand
      they mostly feel constrained to adopt scientifically proven, specific therapies for ethical
      reasons. Against the background of international literature one can assume that also Swiss
      general practitioners use several forms of placebo interventions in a significant part of
      their patients.

      The aim of the project is to ascertain to which extent and in which way Swiss general
      practitioners make use of placebo interventions. Furthermore knowledge of the mode of action
      of placebo interventions and the perceived moral and lawful permissibility of placebo
      interventions and the presumed attitudes of the patients will be investigated.

      The empicical core of the study is a questionnaire survey of general practitioners in urban
      and rural areas of Switzerland. The results and conclusions of the survey will be discussed
      during a workshop with interested GPs, researchers and ethicists.

      The obtained data will lead to a better understanding of the application of placebo
      interventions in the general practice in Switzerland (how often and in which manner,
      accompanied by what information, for which diseases and for which patient groups placebos are
      applied). Moreover the study will help to articulate potential moral ambiguities of
      physicians using placebo interventions.
