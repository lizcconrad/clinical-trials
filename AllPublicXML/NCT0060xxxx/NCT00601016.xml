  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemangiomas of infancy, the most common benign tumors of infancy, are congenital or early
      infancy lesions characterized by a rapid postnatal growth, with high expression of angiogenic
      stimulators for 9-18 months, followed by slow regression for 5-9 years. Current therapies for
      the hemangiomas are usually restricted to more severe forms due to the risks of adverse
      effects, inconvenience and cost. Nevertheless, a substantial amount of the psychological
      discomfort and morbidity can be caused by untreated hemangiomas, especially those in the
      face.

      Recently, Imiquimod 5% cream has emerged as a safe an effective drug for several skin
      conditions that benefit from modulation of the activity of the immune system, such as common
      warts and various forms of the skin pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions. Small case reports
      series have suggest that it could also be useful in hemangiomas, possibly through the
      inhibition of the angiogenesis by local IFN production.This is a small, open label study of
      16 patients to document the efficacy of the Imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of hemangioma
      of infancy (primary outcome). IFN and plasma drug levels, as well as clinical examinations
      and blood studies, will be carried out to evaluate safety of the treatment (secondary
      outcome). bFGF and VEGF will be measured in blood and urine in order to study the diagnostic
      and predictive value of these pro-angiogenic factors in the response of hemangiomas to the
      treatment with Imiquimod (secondary outcome).

      The study is a phase II clinical trial of a once a day application of Imiquimod 5% cream, 3
      to 7 times per week for a maximum of four months. The study held at the Dermatology Clinic of
      Sainte-Justine Hospital, and was completed within a 20 months timeframe after IRB approval.
