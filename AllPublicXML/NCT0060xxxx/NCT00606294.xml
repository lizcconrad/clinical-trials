    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate low oxygen areas called hypoxia within tumors.
      These low oxygen areas are thought to be the reason why tumors are more resistant to
      chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

      An imaging technique using a hypoxia tracer called fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) can detect low
      oxygen areas within a tumor. This imaging technique, called a PET scan, uses positively
      charged particles to detect slight changes in the body's biochemistry and metabolism. FMISO
      PET scans have been performed in patients with head and neck cancer and have shown the
      ability to detect low oxygen areas within tumors.

    <description>There will be no change or intervention in a patient's treatment regime using chemoradiation where both the primary and the neck nodes receive 70Gy if the tumors are not associated with HPV or if there is no resolution of hypoxia on their repeat 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan. This is currently one accepted standard of care. Patients in Cohort 1 with tumors that are positive for HPV who exhibited no evidence of hypoxia on their baseline 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan or whose tumors have early resolution of hypoxia on their repeat early response 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan will undergo an alternative treatment where the primary tumor site receives 70Gy while the neck nodes receive 60Gy followed by a planned FDG PET/CT scan and observation.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Cohort 2 HPV+ tumors that demonstrate no evidence of hypoxia on an 18F-FMISO PET scan will receive 30Gy to the surgical bed and neck lymph nodes concurrent with standard chemotherapy followed by a 3-month post-treatment neck dissection. In patients who exhibit a complete response with this method of treatment, no further treatment is necessary. For patients within this select group who still have pathologic nodal disease, further standard chemoradiation will be given. All other patients in this cohort (i.e. those who are not in the select HPV+ tumor group outlined above) will receive standard of care treatment following their surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 :

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of head and neck carcinoma (excluding nasopharynx,
             paranasal sinus, salivary, and thyroid malignancies)Any unknown primary squamous cell
             carcinoma of head and neck with gross nodes is allowed (2002 AJCC)

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Must not have received prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy for this diagnosis.
             Patients who have had their primary site tumor removed by surgery but still present
             with grossly enlarged lymph nodes are eligible for this study.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70.

        Exclusion Criteria for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2:

          -  all nasopharyngeal, paranasal sinus, salivary cancer, and thyroid malignancies

          -  prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within the last three years

          -  patients that underwent previous surgical resection for the same disease (except for
             biopsy or surgery removing primary site tumor but still present with grossly enlarged
             lymph nodes)

          -  any prior radiotherapy to the head and neck region

        Subject Exclusion Criteria for Optional Contrast MRIs - Cohort 1 Only

        • Subjects with a known contraindication to the standard MRI contrast agent (Gadavist, a
        gadolinium-based contrast agent) and/or a recent estimated glomerular filtration rate
        (eGFR) of 30 or less will be excluded from all DCE-MRIs, and will instead receive
        non-contrast MRIs at the DCE-MRI time points.
