  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the gentamicin-collagen sponge is safe and
      effective in preventing sternal wound infections in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who
      are at a greater risk of developing sternal wound infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sternal wound infection (SWI) is a significant problem in cardiac surgical subjects,in
      particular in those with risk factors such as diabetes and obesity. There is a long unmet
      need for an intervention that can reduce the incidence and severity of SWIs in high-risk
      subjects.

      Gentamicin is an antibiotic that is effective in treating certain kinds of infection.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The gentamicin-collagen sponge is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and containing gentamicin. When
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and the gentamicin is released at the
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of antibiotic at the
      surgical site may prevent an infection at the surgical site.

      Outside of the United States more than 3,500 subjects have received treatment in clinical
      studies with the gentamicin-collagen sponge, primarily for orthopedic, intraabdominal, and
      cardiothoracic surgeries or wound infections following surgical procedures or traumatic
      events.

      In this study, all subjects will be given treatment that is normally given to prevent
      surgical infections. For subjects randomly assigned to the gentamicin-collagen sponge
      treatment group, 2 sponges will be placed between the sternal halves during surgery.
      IMMEDIATELY before insertion of the sponge the surgeon should wet the sponge with saline as
      shown in the training/certification document. This wet sponge SHOULD BE INSERTED INTO THE
      STERNUM WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 15 SECONDS (AFTER THIS TIME IT MAY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT TO
      HANDLE). All subjects will be followed for 90 days after surgery to determine whether they
      develop a sternal wound infection.
