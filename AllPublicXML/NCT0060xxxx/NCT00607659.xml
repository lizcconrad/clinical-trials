  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis infections are a widespread public health concern
      due to their prevalence and potentially devastating reproductive consequences, including
      pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. The goal of this study is to
      evaluate the risk factors for adverse outcomes following genital tract infection with
      Chlamydia trachomatis and to evaluate whether or not the presence of C. trachomatis in the
      rectum act as a reservoir for infection.

      Sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis infections are a widespread public health concern
      due to their prevalence and potentially devastating reproductive consequences, including
      pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. The goal of this study is to
      evaluate the risk factors for adverse outcomes following genital tract infection with
      Chlamydia trachomatis and to evaluate whether or not the presence of C. trachomatis in the
      rectum act as a reservoir for infection. Our target population will be adolescent females age
      11-21 evaluated at the ACH Adolescent Center who are undergoing pelvic examinations or urine
      screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Laboratory specimens obtained will
      include cervical and rectal swabs, urine and blood specimens, as well as, chart review and
      comprehensive subject interviews in the initial data collection with follow-up evaluations at
      3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months for qualifying subjects

    <description>Adolescent females, 11-21 years old, evaluated for pelvic examinations or STI screening will be asked to participate in this study. Participants are being asked to give us permission to collect:additional cervical or vaginal swabs, rectal swabs, blood draws where three tablespoons of blood, a urine pregnancy test, and a comprehensive health history. You may be asked to provide a urine specimen at the initial visit instead of having a cervical swab. The study team will obtain a cervical swab when you come back for your follow-up appointments. If your culture is positive for Chlamydia, you will be asked attend 3 additional follow-up appointments after 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years .</description>
