      Primary:

      To compare the efficacy of Rasburicase versus allopurinol in controlling tumor lysis-related
      hyperuricemia in Chinese patients with leukemia or lymphoma.

      Secondary:

      To compare the efficacy and safety of Rasburicase versus allopurinol in Chinese patients
      stratified according to disease (leukemia or lymphoma ).
