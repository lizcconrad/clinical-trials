    <textblock>
      MDS Nordion's TheraSphere, Yttrium-90 glass microspheres has been approved as a Humanitarian
      device authorized by federal(USA)law for use in radiation treatment or as a neoadjuvant to
      surgery or transplantation in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)who can
      have placement of appropriately positioned hepatic arterial catheters. Outcomes of this
      treatment protocol will be monitored and reported to the Carolinas HealthCare System
      Institutional Review Board.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to provide supervised access to treatment with TheraSphere
      to eligible patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma of the liver who are not surgical
      resection candidates and to evaluate patient experience, toxicities and overall survival
      associated with TheraSphere treatment.

      This is an observational treatment use protocol that will provide Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) oversight and documentation of the clinical experience of patients undergoing treatment
      for liver carcinoma using TheraSphere. Participation involves no investigational or research
      procedures. Patients will be followed for treatment-related adverse experiences and will be
      monitored in accordance with institutional practices. Approximately 60 patients will be
      enrolled in a treatment protocol and the number may be expanded following completion of the
      first cohort. The total number of patients to be treated will be determined based on clinical
      experience and patient outcomes. There are no control subjects in this treatment protocol.

      The duration of the protocol will depend on patient experience with this treatment. An
      initial one year approval is sought at this time. Patient experience will be evaluated
      continuously and if the clinicians find that the treatment provides benefits to patients,
      renewal of the approval will be sought after the first 12 months.

        Eligible patients will be selected from the population of patients with unresectable cancer
        in the liver who are referred by surgeons and medical oncologists of CarolinasHealthCare
        System and by other referring physicians in the geographic area for regional therapy for
        liver cancer. Patients to be considered for treatment under this protocol will have been
        referred to one of the clinicians.

             criterion may be waived in patients with a radiographically identifiable liver mass,
             known laboratory or clinical risk factors for cancer or elevated tumor markers such as
             alpha feta protein (AFP) markers (clinical diagnosis).

          -  The cancer must be unresectable.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Score 0-2

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18

          -  Able to comprehend and provide written informed consent in accordance with

             granulocyte count less than or equal to 1,500/ul, platelet count less than or equal to
             45,000/ul, serum creatinine greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl, serum bilirubin
             greater than or equal to 4.0 mg/dl

          -  Any of the following contraindications to angiography and selective visceral

             narcotics, sedatives, or atropine; bleeding diathesis, not correctable by usual forms
             of therapy; severe peripheral vascular disease that would preclude catheterization

          -  Portal hypertension with portal venous shunt away from the liver

          -  Evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 milliCurie (mCi) or 30 gray (Gy)
             absorbed dose of radiation to the lungs on either 1) first TheraSphere administration
             or 2) cumulative delivery of radiation to the lungs &gt; 30 Gy over multiple treatments.

          -  Evidence of any detectable Tc-99m microaggregate albumin (MAA) flow to the stomach or
