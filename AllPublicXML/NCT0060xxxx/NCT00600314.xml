  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to show that the MedGem indirect calorimetry measurement device will be
      feasible to use in children with GVHD. Also, it aims to show that children with chronic GVHD
      will have elevated REE that is not adequately predicted by standard equations.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow and hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.
      In adults, it has been shown that patients with acute or chronic GVHD have an increase in
      their resting energy expenditure (REE), likely as a result of chronic systemic inflammation.
      These studies have not yet been performed in children. This study's objective is to determine
      the REE of pediatric patients with acute and chronic GVHD after hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT).
