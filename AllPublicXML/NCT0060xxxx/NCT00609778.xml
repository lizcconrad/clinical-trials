    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to show superiority in survival of the modified method with the
      LUCAS Chest Compression System, compared to the conventional manual resuscitation method in
      patients suffering from out of hospital sudden cardiac arrest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year 300 000 to 400 000 people suffer from sudden cardiac arrest outside of the
      hospital in Europe. Only 5 - 7 % of these patients survive and are discharged from hospital.
      In spite of massive education, research and new methods the survival rate has not improved.
      In the latest international guidelines for CPR, published in 2005, there is a strong emphasis
      on chest compressions with as little interruptions as possible. Manual chest compressions
      during CPR result in only 20-30% of normal blood flow and are difficult to perform for a long
      period of time. Mechanical chest compressions with the LUCAS device have shown increased
      blood flow in experimental studies. Defibrillation during ongoing mechanical compressions is
      a new method of treatment that showed promising results in increased short time survival in
      out of hospital cardiac arrest in a recently completed pilot study.

      The LINC trial is a prospective randomised multicenter study where LUCAS according to a
      concept will be used with simultaneous defibrillation compared to manual chest compressions
      according to 2005 guidelines for advanced CPR. The study will be conducted in first tier
      systems, where LUCAS always will be placed in the first arriving ambulance.
