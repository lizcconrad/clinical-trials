    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of duloxetine and see what effects
      (good and bad) it has on the subject's binge eating disorder and comorbid depressive disorder
      (depression occurring with binge eating disorder) compared to placebo (inactive pill).

    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      flexible-dose study of duloxetine 60-120 mg/day in patients with BED and comorbid depressive
      disorders. Patients will be randomly assigned to either duloxetine 30 mg capsules or matching
      placebo at the baseline visit. The initial dose of study medication will be one 30 mg
      duloxetine capsule/day or placebo with a planned increase to 60 mg/day (2 X 30 mg) or
      matching placebo at the end of week 1. Further dose increases of 30 mg up to 120 mg/day will
      be allowed after the end of week two based on the investigators' assessment of efficacy and
      tolerability. Dosing will be either once per day or twice a day depending on tolerability.
      Patient visits will occur at screening and baseline and at the end of weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
      10, and 12. Study drug will be tapered by 30 mg every 3 days at the end of the study.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects must provide written informed consent of their own free will.

          -  Male or female outpatients.

          -  Age 18-65 years, inclusive.

          -  Subject must meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder (major
             depression, dysthymia, minor depression, or brief recurrent depression) for a duration
             of at least 1 month preceding and during the screening period.

          -  Subjects must meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of binge eating disorder (BED)
             for at least the last 6 months. The DSM-IV criteria are as follows:

               1. Recurrent episodes of binge eating.

               2. The binge eating episodes are associated with at least three of the following:
                  eating much more rapidly than normal; eating until uncomfortably full; eating
                  large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of
                  being embarrassed by how much one is eating; feeling disgusted with oneself,
