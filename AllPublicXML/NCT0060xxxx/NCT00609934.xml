    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a new anti-angiogenic drug called
      sorafenib, in combination with radiotherapy, for renal cell cancer that has spread to the
      bone and is causing significant pain. The study will find a safe dose of sorafenib for this
      combination study treatment, look at side effects, and test if the study treatment is
      effective in controlling the pain experienced from this type of renal cell cancer. . There
      will be two parts or phases to this study

      The purpose of the first phase is to find the highest dose of sorafenib that can be given
      safely to patients, when combined with radiotherapy. We will also see what kind of effects
      the study treatment has on you and your cancer. Participants in this phase will receive a
      dose of sorafenib that has shown to be well-tolerated in humans. If the side effects are
      tolerable for this dose of sorafenib when combined with radiotherapy, new patients will be
      asked to join the study and will receive a dose of sorafenib higher than the last study
      participant.

      In the second phase, new study participants will receive the dose of sorafenib that was
      determined to be safe in the first phase. Side effects will continue to be looked at and the
      effectiveness on controlling pain symptoms from this type of cancer, will also be looked at.

        Eligibility Criteria

          1. Eligible patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic RCC
             that is judged to be incurable with standard therapy.

          2. Patients must have at least one radiographically-evident symptomatic (&gt; 2/10 on the
             Brief Pain Inventory) bone metastasis that is amenable to palliative radiation.
             Multiple symptomatic bone metastases may be irradiated at the same time. However, if
             more than one symptomatic bone metastasis is identified, one will be chosen as the
             index lesion for reporting purposes.

          3. No planned change in analgesic medications.

          4. No planned increase in regular analgesic medications.

          5. No prior surgery to the index lesion, although previous surgery for other metastatic
             disease is permissible if &gt; 4 weeks prior to study registration.

          6. Patients may have had up to two previous lines of systemic treatment for metastatic
             RCC, including prior treatment with sorafenib or another similar multi-targeted
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor, if completed &gt;4 weeks prior to study registration.

          7. Patients may not have had previous radiotherapy to the index lesion. Patients may have
             had previous radiotherapy to other metastases if completed &gt; 4 weeks prior to study
             registration. Patients must have recovered from the acute side effects of radiotherapy
             prior to study registration.

          8. Age &gt;18 years.

          9. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

         10. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt; 60).

             i. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1.5 x109 /L ii. Platelet count &gt;75 x109 /L iii. Total
             bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN iv. AST (SGOT) / ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 Ã— institutional ULN or &lt; 5 x
             institutional ULN if liver metastases v. Creatinine &lt;1.7 x ULN or vi. Creatinine
             clearance &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 vii. International Normalized Ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 viii.

             normal values (range of 5-208 U/L) xi. Serum amylase, normal values (range 30-110 U/L)

         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

         13. The effects of sorafenib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
             Effective methods of birth control would include a barrier method (e.g. condoms,
             diaphragm) combined with spermicide, or an intrauterine device (IUD). Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Serious medical condition that might be aggravated by treatment, including but not
             limited to: myocardial infarction within 6 months, congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina, active cardiomyopathy, unstable ventricular arrhythmia, uncontrolled
             hypertension, uncontrolled psychotic disorders, serious infections, active peptic
             ulcer disease, active liver disease, or cerebrovascular disease with previous stroke.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent concurrently or within 4
             weeks of study registration. Patients receiving other molecularly-targeted treatments
             for RCC off of study, including inhibitors of angiogenesis or mTOR, will be eligible
             for this study after a 1 week wash-out period.

          3. Patients with clinical or radiological evidence of spinal cord compression are
             ineligible.

          4. Patients who are at high risk of pathologic fracture and appropriate for surgical
             intervention are ineligible.

          5. Patients who are planned for palliative surgical intervention to the index lesion or
             adjacent bone are ineligible.

          6. Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because the safety of
             sorafenib has not been established in these circumstances.

          7. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with sorafenib.

          8. Patients with other active malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer are
             excluded.

         11. Patients with any bleeding or clotting disorder

         12. Patient taking greater than 325mg of aspirin per day

         13. Patients with diabetes mellitus will be ineligible for the PET-CT components of the
