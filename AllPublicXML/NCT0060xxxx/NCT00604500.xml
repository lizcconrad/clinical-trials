  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, multiple-dose, study of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate (MF/F)
      metered dose inhaler (MDI) 100/10 micrograms (mcg) twice daily (BID) (2 puffs of MF/F MDI
      50/5 mcg, administered twice a day approximately 12 hours apart) in participants 12 years of
      age or older, with a diagnosis of persistent asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) of at least 12 months. The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate the
      performance of the MF/F MDI integrated dose counter under normal patient handling conditions.

    <measure>Overall Discrepancy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>Overall discrepancies refer to the difference between the participant-recorded number of actuations and the participant-recorded dose counter readout across the 4-week Treatment Period. The Overall Discrepancy Rate was calculated as 100 multiplied by the total number of discrepancies across all participants who used at least 90% of the labeled actuations divided by the total number of actuations in the same participant population (Completer Population).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Quartile Discrepancy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>Quartile discrepancies refer to the difference between
the participant-recorded number of actuations and the participant-recorded
counter readout at each of the 4 weekly visit intervals [ie, quartiles] to
evaluate whether there was any difference in agreement over the life of
the inhaler. The Quartile Discrepancy Rate was calculated as 100 multiplied by the total number of discrepancies per Quartile across all participant who used at least 90% of the labeled actuations divided by the total number of actuations per Quartile in the same population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Discrepancy Size</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>Discrepancy Size refers to the magnitude of the discrepancy between the dose counter readout and the number of recorded actuations (definition of discrepancy). Overall Discrepancy Size was calculated as 100 multiplied by the sum of the absolute values from each Dose Counter Discrepancy Size across all participants who used at least 90% of the labeled actuations divided by the total number of recorded actuations in the same participant population.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>End of Use Agreement: Number of Inhalers With an End of Use Agreement of 0 (Completer Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in the final MDI dose counter readout and the total number of recorded actuations at the end-of-use. Dose Counter end-of-use agreement was calculated as the sum of the absolute difference between the final dose counter readout and the number of recorded actuations across all participants who used at least 90% of the labeled actuations (excluding participants who used the inhaler beyond the labeled number of actuations) divided by the total number of participants in this population. No participant used more than two inhalers during the treatment period.</description>

        Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion:

          -  A participant must have been at least 12 years of age, of either sex, and of any race,
             with a diagnosis of persistent asthma or COPD of at least 12 months.

          -  A participant must have been able to demonstrate correct use of an MDI without a
             counter at the Screening Visit.

          -  A participant must have demonstrated at least 90% compliance with completion of the
             e-diary, use of the counterstrip, and use of the study medication over the 2-week
             Screening Period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a serious uncontrolled medical disorder, which in the judgment of
             the investigator, could have interfered with the study, or required treatment which
             might interfere with the study.

          -  Participants who in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor had a significant
             recent or current, repetitive strain injury (RSI) that may have impacted their ability
             to effectively participate in the full duration of the study.

        <title>Overall Quartile Discrepancy Rate</title>
        <description>Quartile discrepancies refer to the difference between
the participant-recorded number of actuations and the participant-recorded
counter readout at each of the 4 weekly visit intervals [ie, quartiles] to
evaluate whether there was any difference in agreement over the life of
the inhaler. The Quartile Discrepancy Rate was calculated as 100 multiplied by the total number of discrepancies per Quartile across all participant who used at least 90% of the labeled actuations divided by the total number of actuations per Quartile in the same population.</description>
