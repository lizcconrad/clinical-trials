  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing cells of the
      pancreas. The investigators have discovered the specific autoimmune cells responsible for
      destroying the insulin-producing cells in an animal model of type 1 diabetes, and the means
      of destroying those cells.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are now aiming to use a similar strategy (vaccination with BCG, the vaccine
      used world-wide to protect against tuberculosis) in human type 1 diabetes to see if the
      abnormal immune cells can be depleted. This is the first step in trying to cure established
      type 1 diabetes.
