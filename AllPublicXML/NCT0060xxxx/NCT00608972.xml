      The purpose of this research study is to look at the effectiveness of a combination of doxil,
      carboplatin and bevacizumab on metastatic breast cancer. The type of breast cancer being
      studied is negative for a protein called HER2/neu and for estrogen receptors (ER) and
      progesterone receptors (PR). HER2/neu, ER and PR are part of a family of receptors found on
      both cancer and normal cells. This family of receptors is important for cell growth and is
      found in many tumor types.This study is being conducted for the following research purposes:·
      To find out what effects, if any, the study drug has on metastatic breast cancer. For
      instance, will the study drug cause the tumor(s) to shrink or stop growing?· To test the
      safety of the study drugs and to see what affects it has. For instance, are there any side
      effects? If so, what kind of side effects does the study drug cause? How severe are the side
      effects, and how often do they occur?· To see if the study drugs have any effect on keeping
      the disease from getting worse.
