      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as perillyl alcohol, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of abnormal cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. It is not yet known which dose of topical perillyl alcohol is more effective in
      stopping the development of cancer in sun damaged skin.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying high-dose topical perillyl alcohol to see
      how well it works compared with low-dose topical perillyl alcohol in treating patients with
      sun damaged skin and actinic keratoses.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if topical administration of perillyl alcohol (POH) cream can reverse
           actinic damage as evidenced by normalization of quantitative skin histopathology scores
           in skin tissue biopsy samples from patients with moderate to severe sun damage.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if topical POH can be administered safely to the forearms of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

        -  Placebo: Patients apply a placebo cream topically to each dorsal forearm twice daily for
           3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Low Dose: Patients apply perillyl alcohol (POH) cream (0.3%) topically to each dorsal
           forearm twice daily for 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  High Dose: Patients apply POH cream (0.76%) as in arm II. Patients undergo tissue
           sampling of the right or left dorsal forearm and of physician-selected representative
           actinic keratoses (AK) at baseline and after completion of study therapy. Tissue samples
           are assessed for changes in patterns of biomarker expression (i.e., p53, apoptosis,
           c-Fos histopathology) and karyometry. After completion of study therapy, patients
           undergo tissue sampling of the opposite forearm as well as blood sample collection to
           determine perillyl alcohol (POH) levels in blood and biopsy samples. Urine is also
           collected and analyzed for safety at the end of treatment. Digital photographs of the
           forearms and hands are obtained at baseline and after 3 months of study treatment.
           Optical coherence tomography imaging is also performed on pre- and post-biopsy sites to
           quantify the effect of POH on sun damage and AK in skin.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly.

    <description>The histopathologic scoring for skin biopsies from sun-damaged skin to assess the following seven characteristics: 1- atypia (levels 0, 1 &amp; 2), 2- inflammation (grades 0, 1 &amp; 2), 3- hyperkeratosis (loss of basket weave pattern of stratum corneum), 4- parakeratosis (present when there were &gt;3 characteristic nuclei per 40:1 field in stratum corneum), 5- dyskeratosis (focal presence of cells with homogenous, pink cytoplasm n pyknotic nuclei), 6- epidermotropism (lymphocytes migration of &gt;3 cells into epidermis, 7- loss of granular layer. All assessments were done using a 40:1 objective.</description>
