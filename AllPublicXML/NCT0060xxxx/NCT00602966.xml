  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oocyte cryopreservation has been studied for many years without much success in refining a
      method that has consistent, reliable results in producing viable embryos and clinical
      pregnancies. In 1986 the first baby was born from an embryo created from a frozen oocyte;
      however, since then there have been less than 150 births from frozen eggs. To date, there are
      no reportable adverse outcomes in the children born from frozen oocytes. The research
      continues to look at different methods of oocyte cryopreservation. Many smaller studies have
      been conducted with some success but larger clinical trials are needed to replicate these
      findings. The conventional cryopreservation technique has been slow cooling with differing
      methods of freezing; however, vitrification is now being researched as the potential
      cryopreserving method that holds some promise for the future.

      Our hypothesis is the use of vitrification (quick freezing) to cryopreserve oocytes in
      patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization will be more successful than slow freezing in
      oocyte survival, fertilization rate with ICSI and subsequent embryo development, implantation
      rate and pregnancy rate.

      Cryopreservation of oocytes is desirable because it: 1) would allow infertility patients to
      store excess oocytes instead of embryos, eliminating some of the ethical and religious
      concerns that accompany embryo storage; 2) permit storage of donor oocytes to avoid
      donor-recipient synchronization difficulties; and 3) can help women who may face
      sterilization due to chemotherapy or radiation. Oocyte cryopreservation is therefore gaining
      in popularity as an option for infertility treatment as well as fertility preservation.

      Oocyte cryopreservation using conventional slow-cooling methods has not had much success;
      however more recent results have provided more optimism (Boldt et al., 2003; Porcu et al.,
      1997; 2000; 2002; Yang et al., 1998; 1999; 2002; Winslow et al., 2001). Vitrification has
      also been employed (Hong et al., 1999; Kuleshova et al., 1999; Yoon et al., 2000, 2003; Chung
      et al 2000; Wu et al., 2001: Kuwayama et al., 2005) with increased oocyte survival rate and
      live births. Vitrification is performed by suspending the oocytes in a solution containing a
      high concentration of cryoprotectants and then plunging them directly into liquid nitrogen
      (Rall and Fahy, 1985). The advantage of this technique is to prevent the formation of ice
      crystals within the oocyte. However the toxic effect of the high concentration of the
      cryoprotectant media has been a concern. New vitrification techniques which attempt to
      accelerate the cooling rate by decreasing the cryosolution volume and concentration, may
      reduce the potential toxicity. In addition, a more rapid cooling rate results in reduced
      chilling injury (Vajta et al., 1998).
