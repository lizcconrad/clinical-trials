      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      fluorouracil, capecitabine, and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. External-beam
      radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Panitumumab may also stop the
      growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor and make tumor cells more
      sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving panitumumab together with chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving panitumumab together with
      chemotherapy and external-beam radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the 1-year survival rate in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
           treated with panitumumab and continuous infusion fluorouracil administered concurrently
           with external-beam radiotherapy followed by gemcitabine and panitumumab.

      Secondary

        -  To determine overall survival, time to disease progression, confirmed response rate,
           duration of response, and time to treatment failure in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To determine adverse events in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Panitumumab and chemoradiotherapy : Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once
           daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38. Patients also receive
           panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29 and fluorouracil IV continuously over
           24 hours daily OR oral capecitabine twice daily beginning on day 1 and continuing
           through the last day of radiotherapy.

        -  Panitumumab and chemotherapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of panitumumab and
           chemoradiotherapy, patients receive panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 and
           gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
           3 courses. Patients then proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.

    <description>A confirmed tumor response is defined to be a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

        <title>Confirmed Response Rate</title>
        <description>A confirmed tumor response is defined to be a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 4 weeks apart according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.
A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions.
A partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesion from baseline.
Confirmed tumor response will be evaluated using the first 6 cycles of treatment.</description>
