      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how a new study agent works inside the body.
      The study agent is a protein called 64Cu-trastuzumab. This is a radioactive tracer that was
      developed at MSKCC to target HER2 protein on cancer cells. A radioactive tracer is a small
      amount of radioactive dye that follows something else that is not radioactive In this study
      the study agent, 64Cu-trastuzumab, is the tracer and what's being followed is trastuzumab
      (Herceptin™). By giving you this tracer after you have treatment with trastuzumab
      (Herceptin™), we will be able to use PET scans to show us which parts of your body and tumor
      sites the Herceptin goes to. This will help us to understand better how Herceptin works in
      the body to fight cancer.
