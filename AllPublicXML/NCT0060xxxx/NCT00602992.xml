  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a non-invasive technique for the delivery of a single, high dose
      of radiation to an intra-cranial target. MRI has an established and central role in the
      treatment planning process and assessment of response to intracranial radiosurgery.
      Increasing the field strength of MRI from 1.5T to 3T promises to improve the signal, and in
      turn the quality of images. However, the technology also introduces new limitations, and the
      role and safety of 3T MRI in the management of patients receiving radiosurgery has not yet
      been reported. In this pilot study, we will explore the spatial integrity, and incremental
      image-guidance utility of 3T MRI in patients receiving radiosurgery. The preliminary data
      acquired in this study will be instrumental to the judicious design and conduct of subsequent
      definitive clinical trials. Up to fifty patients will be enrolled in this study.
