      The goal of this research is to investigate a potential CSF biomarker of NPH as a new tool
      for both the diagnosis of NPH and prognosis of VPS placement. Transforming growth factor-b1
      (TGF-b1) is a signaling molecule involved in three fundamental activities; suppression of
      cell proliferation, immunosuppression, and deposition of extracellular matrix through
      promotion of synthesis and inhibition of degradation.8 Previously, TGF-b1 had been implicated
      in the development of communicating hydrocephalus secondary to pre-term infant
      intraventricular hemorrhage9 and adult aneurysmal sub-arachnoid hemorrhage.10, 11 Recently,
      an investigation demonstrated elevated levels of TGF-b1 in patients with shunt-responsive NPH
      compared to non-NPH patients.12

      The specific aims of this research proposal are to:

        1. Correlate CSF levels of TGF-b1 with the clinical response of patients diagnosed with NPH
           to VPS placement.

        2. Correlate CSF levels of TGF-b1 with optimal VPS pressure settings.
