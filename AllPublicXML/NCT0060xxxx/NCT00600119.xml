    <textblock>
      Study (07-IN-NX003) is a Phase 2, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized,
      dose-escalation trial. It is designed to investigate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of
      NKTR-118 (PEG-naloxol) in patients with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and other clinical
      manifestations of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD). The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety, effectiveness and pharmacokinetics of NKTR-118 at 4 different doses.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Spontaneous Bowel Movements (SBMs) Per Week During Week 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in SBMs/week during Week 1 was defined as SBMs/week during the first week of double-blind study medication (between Visit 4 and Visit 6) minus baseline SBMs/week. Baseline was defined as the average SBMs/week during the 2-week OIC screening period. An SBM was defined as a BM without the use of laxatives in the previous 24 hours as recorded in the e-diary.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in SBMs/Week Across the 28-day Double-blind Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 28</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in SBMs/week across the 28-day double-blind period was calculated as SBMs/week during 28-day double-blind study treatment period minus baseline SBMs/week. Baseline was defined as the average SBMs/week during the 2-week OIC screening period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 28</time_frame>
    <description>The PAC-QOL scale is a 28-item self-report instrument designed to evaluate the burden of constipation on patients' everyday functioning and well-being in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely).The instrument can be used to generate an overall score, but is also reported to assess 4 specific constipation-related domains including: 1) worries and concerns (11 items), 2) physical discomfort (4 items), 3) psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and 4) satisfaction (5 items). Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items. The range is 0 (response is 'not at all' for each item) to 4 (response is 'extremely' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 28</time_frame>
    <description>The PAC-SYM questionnaire is a 12-item questionnaire that evaluates the severity of symptoms of constipation in 3 domains (stool, rectal, and abdominal symptoms) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe) in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items (ie, symptoms). The range is 0 (response is 'absent' for each item) to 4 (response is 'very severe' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in SBMs/Week Across the 28-day Double-blind Period</title>
          <description>Change from baseline in SBMs/week across the 28-day double-blind period was calculated as SBMs/week during 28-day double-blind study treatment period minus baseline SBMs/week. Baseline was defined as the average SBMs/week during the 2-week OIC screening period.</description>
          <population>The MITT analysis population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of double-blind study treatment, had a baseline value and Visit 6 evaluable data (where Visit 6 was the Week 1 visit during the double-blind study treatment period).</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The PAC-QOL scale is a 28-item self-report instrument designed to evaluate the burden of constipation on patients’ everyday functioning and well-being in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely).The instrument can be used to generate an overall score, but is also reported to assess 4 specific constipation-related domains including: 1) worries and concerns (11 items), 2) physical discomfort (4 items), 3) psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and 4) satisfaction (5 items). Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items. The range is 0 (response is 'not at all' for each item) to 4 (response is 'extremely' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The PAC-SYM questionnaire is a 12-item questionnaire that evaluates the severity of symptoms of constipation in 3 domains (stool, rectal, and abdominal symptoms) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe) in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items (ie, symptoms). The range is 0 (response is 'absent' for each item) to 4 (response is 'very severe' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Days 1 through 28</time_frame>
        <population>The MITT analysis population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of double-blind study treatment, had a baseline value and Visit 6 evaluable data (where Visit 6 was the Week 1 visit during the double-blind study treatment period).</population>
