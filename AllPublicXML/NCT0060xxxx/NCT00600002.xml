  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of immunotherapeutic strategies that target the most potent antigen
      presenting cell, the dendritic cell (DC), are likely to substantially increase the magnitude
      of the anti-tumor immune response. Although there are issues of activation state and antigen
      load, mechanisms to increase the number of DCs available to the immune system are among the
      first steps in development of affective DC based immunotherapeutic strategies. The Central
      Hypothesis of our study is: Administration of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating
      Factor (GM-CSF) to patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma will result in enhance recruitment
      of DCs to the sentinel lymph node, into the peripheral blood, and/or tumor site. We propose
      performing a phase I, dose escalation, clinical trial of systemic and intra-tumoral GM-CSF
      administration for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This trial will be designed to
      assess toxicity and immunologic effects, principally dendritic cell recruitment. Patients
      with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma by clinical staging criteria will be eligible for
      enrollment.

      The trial we propose is a phase I clinical trial of the addition of GM-CSF as a biological
      adjuvant to standard care for patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histological proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with potentially
             resectable disease based upon clinical staging.

          -  Expected survival must be greater than three (3) months.

          -  A Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) must be 70 or greater.

          -  Patients must be &gt;18 years of age. Because LeukineÂ® is a &quot;Pregnancy Category C&quot; drug,
             female patients must be not be lactating and must be surgically sterile (via
             hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), postmenopausal, or using acceptable methods
             of contraception if they are of child bearing potential. Female patients of
             childbearing potential must also have a negative serum pregnancy test.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and sign an informed consent form, which must
             comply with U.S. regulations (U.S. 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50) and
             International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Availability of
             alternative curative treatment must be fully explained to the patient and documented
             in the informed consent form.

          -  Eligible patients must meet the following laboratory parameters:

          -  White blood cell (WBC) &gt;3,000/mm3
