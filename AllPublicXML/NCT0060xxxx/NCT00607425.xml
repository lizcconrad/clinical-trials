      This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of using gene expression from saliva to
      identify patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The primary objective of this study is to compare gene expression profiles from saliva from
      healthy controls and patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

      To be eligible, patients with non-small cell lung cancer, must not yet have received
      treatment for their cancer (surgical removal, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy). Health
      control participants may participate if they meet eligibility criteria listed below.

      Eligible enrollees will be asked to submit a one time saliva sample and complete a study
      questionaire.

        Untreated, clinical stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and matching
        healthy control subjects will be recruited to participate in this study.

        Untreated patients have not yet had either complete surgical removal of their lung cancer,
        any chemotherapy, or any radiation therapy to treat their lung cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with untreated stage I-II NSCLC OR Healthy control subjects: with a &gt; 20 pack
             year history of cigarette smoking OR Never smokers (defined as less than 100
             cigarettes over subject's lifetime)

               -  The investigators recognize that pathologic confirmation is not always available
                  prior to surgical resection of a lung mass. To account for this, subjects with a
                  suspicious lung mass concerning for lung cancer, can be enrolled on this trial,
                  and submit a saliva sample prior to surgical resection (ideally within 45 days of
                  planned surgery).

          2. Adults age 40-79

          3. Ability to understand the investigational nature of the study and sign the informed
             consent in accordance with institutional and FDA guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No active pulmonary infection, i.e. bronchitis or pneumonia for 6 months

          2. No use of steroid inhalers for &gt; 6 months

          3. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancers from which the patient has
             been disease-free for 5 years
