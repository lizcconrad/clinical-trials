          <title>Number of Participants With Objective Response</title>
          <description>Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. Confirmed CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study ≥4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all participants who met all of the following criteria; 1) Those who were diagnosed with NSCLC, 2) Those who received at least one dose of the study treatment, and 3) Those who had efficacy data after the start of the study treatment.</population>
