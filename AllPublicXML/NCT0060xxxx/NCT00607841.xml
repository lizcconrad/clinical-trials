    <textblock>
      Phase I is a dose-escalation study designed to assess safety and tolerability in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer. Phase II will measure response rate in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I dose-escalation portion of the trial will determine the Dose Limiting Toxicities
      (DLT) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Ispinesib (SB-715992) monotherapy when administered
      as a one-hour infusion on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle in female patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The Phase II regimen will evaluate the MTD determined
      in Phase I in chemotherapy-naïve female patients with measurable, locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer. Phase II will assess the overall response rate (ORR) derived from
      individual patient assessments of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable
      disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST, as determined by independent
      review.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic
             (Stage IV) adenocarcinoma of the breast. Staging is determined according to the
             American Joint Committee on Cancer, Cancer Staging Manual, Sixth Edition

          2. Has not received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer and is not currently
             receiving other anti-cancer therapy, including trastuzumab or other cytostatics,
             hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or investigational agent(s).

             Note: Prior therapy does not include (a) previous surgery and/or radiotherapy (if less
             than 25% of pelvic bone marrow), (b) adjuvant and/or palliative hormonal therapy, (c)
             gefitinib (Iressa®) or trastuzumab (Herceptin®) given as monotherapy.

          3. Phase I only: Patients who have previously received anthracycline therapy in either
             the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting may participate, provided a minimum of one year
             has elapsed since last treatment.

          4. Phase I only: Must have evaluable, but not necessarily measurable disease by imaging.

          5. Phase II only: Must have at least one unidimensionally measurable lesion evaluable by
             RECIST criteria. The lesion(s) must be documented by photography, radiography, direct
             measurement, or palpation.

          6. ECOG Performance Status of 0-1.

          7. Female patients, 18 years of age or older.

          8. A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:
