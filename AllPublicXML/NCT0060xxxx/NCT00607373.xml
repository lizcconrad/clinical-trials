  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mipomersen (ISIS 301012)
      in subjects with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia on lipid-lowering therapy.

      This study consisted of a 26-week treatment period and a 24-week post-treatment follow-up
      period. Following treatment and Week 28 evaluations, participants could elect to enroll in an
      open-label extension study (301012-CS6; NCT00694109). Participants who were not eligible or
      elected not to enroll in the open-label extension study or who discontinued during the
      28-week treatment period were followed in this study for 24 weeks from administration of the
      last dose of study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of lipoprotein
      metabolism characterized by markedly elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL), premature onset
      of atherosclerosis and development of xanthomata. Patients with homozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) have a severe disease that presents in childhood with total
      cholesterol typically in the 650 to 1000 mg/dL range.

      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, which consisted of a 4-week
      screening period, 26 weeks of treatment, and a 24-week post- treatment follow-up period (with
      the exception of patients who enrolled in the open-label extension study, Study 301012-CS6;
      NCT00694109). Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 200 mg mipomersen
      or matching volume placebo subcutaneous (SC) injections weekly. Patients who weighed &lt;50 kg
      received a lower dose of 160 mg mipomersen or matching volume of placebo SC injections
      weekly. Patients were to have been on a stable (&gt;=12 weeks) regimen of allowed lipid-lowering
      therapies at screening, and were required to remain on the same dose and regimen throughout
      the study.

      Patients returned to the study center for clinical evaluation every other week during the
      first 4 weeks of treatment, once every 4 to 5 weeks for the remainder of the treatment
      period, and monthly during the post-treatment evaluation (follow-up) period. The primary
      endpoint assessment was at Week 28. Following treatment and Week 28 evaluations, eligible
      patients who tolerated the study drug could elect to enroll in the open-label extension study
      (Study 301012-CS6; NCT00694109). Patients who did not participate in the open-label extension
      study were required to return to the study center for clinical evaluation at least twice
      during the post-treatment follow-up period, including an end-of-study termination visit at
      the end of this 24-week period.

    <time_frame>Baseline (the average of the screening and Day 1 pre-treatment assessments) and the Primary Efficacy Time point (PET) up to week 28</time_frame>
    <description>LDL-C was measured in mg/dL. Samples were taken following an overnight fast. For patients with triglycerides &lt;400 mg/dL, LDL-C was obtained using Friedewald's calculation; and for patients with triglycerides &gt;=400 mg/dL, LDL-C was directly measured by the central laboratory using ultracentrifugation. Baseline was defined as the average of the screening and Study Day 1 (pre-treatment) assessments. An assessment was not included in this calculation if it was associated with a non-fasting blood draw or was drawn more than 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1. If the Study Day 1 and screening LDL-C values were &gt;12% different (relative to the maximum value), then the screening value was not used, because the Study Day 1 value represents the best estimate of the patient's condition at the beginning of study drug administration. The PET was the post-baseline visit, for which LDL-C was assessed, closest to 14 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) at Primary Efficacy Time Point</title>
        <description>LDL-C was measured in mg/dL. Samples were taken following an overnight fast. For patients with triglycerides &lt;400 mg/dL, LDL-C was obtained using Friedewald’s calculation; and for patients with triglycerides &gt;=400 mg/dL, LDL-C was directly measured by the central laboratory using ultracentrifugation. Baseline was defined as the average of the screening and Study Day 1 (pre-treatment) assessments. An assessment was not included in this calculation if it was associated with a non-fasting blood draw or was drawn more than 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1. If the Study Day 1 and screening LDL-C values were &gt;12% different (relative to the maximum value), then the screening value was not used, because the Study Day 1 value represents the best estimate of the patient's condition at the beginning of study drug administration. The PET was the post-baseline visit, for which LDL-C was assessed, closest to 14 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Total Cholesterol at Primary Efficacy Time Point (PET)</title>
        <description>Total cholesterol was measured in mg/dL. Samples were taken following an overnight fast. Baseline was defined as the average of the screening and Study Day 1 (pre-treatment) assessments. An assessment was not included in this calculation if it was associated with a non-fasting blood draw or was drawn more than 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1. The PET was the post-baseline visit, for which LDL-C was assessed, closest to 14 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>

        <description>LDL-C and HDL-C were measured in mg/dL. Samples were taken following an overnight fast. Baseline was defined as the average of the screening and Study Day 1 (pre-treatment) assessments. An assessment was not included in this calculation if it was associated with a non-fasting blood draw or was drawn more than 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1. The PET was the post-baseline visit, for which LDL-C was assessed, closest to 14 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>
