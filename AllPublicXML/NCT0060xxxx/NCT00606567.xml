  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter
      defibrillators (ICD), compared with quarterly device interrogations in clinic, will improve
      patients' outcomes and satisfaction and will reduce health care costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD), usually due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia, is the most common
      cause of death in the United States. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has
      been shown to improve the survival of patients with a history of a heart attack and a weak
      heart (functioning at 30% or less) and those with symptomatic congestive heart failure
      symptoms (hearts functioning at 35% or less). Thus, the number of patients who will require
      ICD therapy is expected to rise exponentially over the next several years. To facilitate the
      follow-up of patients with ICDs, device companies have launched systems for remote monitoring
      of these devices. One such system is the Medtronic Carelink Monitor. Although this system has
      been proven in a multicenter, prospective study to be easy to use, it is not known whether
      this monitor results in improved patients' outcomes and satisfaction and in reduced
      healthcare costs.

      Comparison: Patient outcomes, costs, and satisfaction will be evaluated, comparing patients
      assigned to follow-up using the Medtronic Carelink Monitor versus quarterly visits to an
      outpatient clinic.
