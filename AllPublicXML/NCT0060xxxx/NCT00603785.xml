  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to study the effects of Xolair on patients with chronic sinusitis with or without
      nasal polyps. Because of the similarities between the inflammatory processes found in asthmas
      and rhinitis to those found in chronic sinusitis, we hypothesize that sinusitis should
      respond to Xolair, just as asthma.

    <textblock>
      We propose to study the effects of Xolair on patients with chronic sinusitis with or without
      nasal polyps. Since Xolair has been shown to be effective in asthmatic subjects with evidence
      of atopy and elevated IgE, we will limit our study to patients with chronic sinusitis and
      these parameters. The primary objective is to determine if Xolair decreases mucosal thickness
      on CT scan after 6 months of treatment.
