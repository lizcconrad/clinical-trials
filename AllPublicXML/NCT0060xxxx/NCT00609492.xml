  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a
      booster dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals´ pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      co-administered with a booster dose of DTPa-IPV/Hib (Infanrix-IPV/Hib) in preterm born
      children at the age of 16-18 months. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome
      measures of the booster phase. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are
      presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number =NCT00390910 ). Subjects participating
      in this study should have received three doses of pneumococcal vaccine in the primary study.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.
