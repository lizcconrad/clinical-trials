    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the performances of normally developing children and
      children with Language Impairment (LI) in three different experimental settings designed to
      promote vocabulary acquisition. This comparison will also provide evidence to support
      different intervention approaches designed to increase vocabulary abilities, which has been
      proved to be one of the major deficits of young children with LI.
