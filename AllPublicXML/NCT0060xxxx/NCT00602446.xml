      RATIONALE: Deferasirox may be effective in treating iron overload caused by blood
      transfusions in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well deferasirox works in
      treating patients with iron overload after donor stem cell transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety of deferasirox given over 6 months in reducing liver iron
           concentration in patients with transfusional iron overload after undergoing allogeneic
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of deferasirox in reducing liver iron overload in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral deferasirox once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks.

             Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

          -  Underwent prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using either
             myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning at least 12 months ago
