      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of 100-110 grams of almonds (about Â¾
      cupful) daily on the lipoprotein profile when given to patients on a statin drug. The study
      will compare the effects on the lipoprotein profile to patients who eat almonds and those
      patients not eating almonds.

      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the changes in the lipid profile
      [LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol], LDL-C particle size, and the emerging risk
      factor Lp(a) when 100-110 g of almonds daily are added to statin therapy. Also, all subjects
      will receive Step I dietary counseling.
