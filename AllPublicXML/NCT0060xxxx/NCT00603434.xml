      This is a human inpatient clinical pharmacology study to assess potential interactions
      between intravenous (i.v.) methamphetamine infusion and oral osmotic release methylphenidate
      (OROS-MPH). The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of the OROS-MPH
      concurrent with i.v. d-methamphetamine infusions of 15 mg and 30 mg. Safety outcome measures
      include cardiovascular responses [heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and
      electrocardiograph (ECG) measurements], oral temperature, adverse events (AEs), and clinical
      laboratory analyses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be volunteers who meet DSM-IV criteria for methamphetamine abuse or dependence
             determined using a Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and be
             non-treatment seeking at time of study and have a positive urine test for
             methamphetamine (greater than or = to 500 ng/mL) during screening.

          -  Be able to verbalize understanding of consent form, able to provide written informed
             consent, and verbalize willingness to complete study procedures.

          -  Have a negative urine test for methamphetamine and other drugs of abuse (opiates,
             cocaine, and benzodiazepines) after clinic intake before the first infusion session.

          -  Have a history and physical examination that demonstrate no clinically significant
             contraindication for participating in the study, in the judgment of the admitting
             physician and the site Principal Investigator

          -  Have vital signs as follows: resting heart rate between 45 and 100 bpm, systolic BP
             below 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg.

          -  Have electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3) and hematocrit that is clinically normal (+/- 10%
             of laboratory limits).

          -  Have liver function tests (total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) less
             than three times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Have kidney function tests (creatinine and BUN) less than twice the upper limit of
             normal.

          -  Have an ECG performed that demonstrates sinus rhythm between 45 and 100 beats per
             minute (bpm), normal conduction, and no clinically significant arrhythmias.

          -  Be able to swallow whole tablets of OROS-MPH due to the controlled release
             formulation.

          -  If female, have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use one of the following
             methods of birth control, or be postmenopausal, have had a hysterectomy or have been
             sterilized. Birth control must be in effect starting at least 7 days (14 days for
             hormone-based methods used alone) prior to clinic intake, and should extend at least
             until the last follow-up visit.
