    <textblock>
      Genes expressing inflammatory cytokines (TNF- alpha, IL1 etc) and genes involved in apoptosis
      (Caspase 3, Bax, Bcl-2, Fas) are dysregulated in the skeletal muscles of the patients who
      have muscle wasting and decreased exercise capacity with CHF.

      Patients who show benefit from CRT may also show reversal of the inflammatory/apoptotic
      cascade that accompanies CHF and these patients may be the ones who benefit the most from CRT

      1. The general objective of this study is to:

        1. To identify the molecular pathways that may be altered in the blood and skeletal muscles
           of the patients undergoing CRT by using transcriptional analysis of the blood and
           skeletal muscle in these patients

        2. To identify objective measurable molecular signals, using gene expression profiling,
           that correlate with clinical improvement in patients undergoing CRT.

        3. To identify the molecular profile of patients who are most likely to benefit from CRT
           with improvement of exercise capacity and reversal of cardiac cachexia.

        4. To identify biochemical pathways involved in cardiac cachexia.

        5. To identify genes involved in positive remodeling and reversal of apoptotic cascade in
           the skeletal muscle.

      Serum TNF alpha, IL-1, IL6, CRP, uric acid, albumin, BNP, IGF-1 and growth hormone at
      baseline and at 6 months.

      50 ml of blood will be collected at baseline and at 6 months. It will be divided into
      aliquots as follows; 10 ml in Pax-gene tubes for mRNA extraction, 20 ml for various other
      biomarkers, 10 ml for proteomics and 10 ml will be stored for any future use.

      Approximately a 5x5 - 7x7mm muscle biopsy will be obtained from the mid thigh region of each
      subject at baseline and at six months
