    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether computer-driven protocolized weaning is
      superior to physician-directed non-protocolized weaning in over-24-hours-ventilated surgical
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The main hypothesis was that weaning duration differs
      between both methods. Secondary hypotheses were that reintubation rate, duration of
      mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and workload for physicians
      and nurses differ between both methods.

    <textblock>
      Since long-term mechanical ventilation is affiliated with a bunch of complications, weaning
      affected patients from ventilation as soon as possible is a crucial point. In this context
      automated computerized systems have become a torchbearer. These systems are expected to
      expedite the weaning process, reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of
      stay of a given patient in comparison to conventional physician-directed weaning. A
      multicenter randomized trial by Lellouche et al supported these theories, using a
      computer-driven system to regulate Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). This system is now
      commercially available as SmartCare/PS (Draeger Medical AG &amp; Co. KG, Luebeck, Germany).

      The purpose of the study on hand was to find out whether the results reported before could be
      repeated in a broad, surgical ICU patient group. Study design was chosen similar. In addition
      we investigated the workload for physicians and nurses in both study arms which has not been
      conducted before.
