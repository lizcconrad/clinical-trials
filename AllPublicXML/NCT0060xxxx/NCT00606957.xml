  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for doing this study is to learn whether raising a person's vitamin D level from
      below normal to normal levels will improve his or her body's ability to use sugar. Vitamin D
      is well known to be an important vitamin for the development and maintenance of bones.
      Recently, scientists have learned that vitamin D may have a role in the prevention of cancer,
      diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. The investigators are specifically interested in studying
      this question in the overweight/obese population as they are at greater risk for both vitamin
      D deficiency and impaired ability to metabolize sugar (glucose intolerance).

      Primary Hypotheses:

      Vitamin D repletion (increasing the serum 25(OH)D level from ≤ 20 ng/ml to ≥ 30 ng/ml) will
      improve insulin sensitivity in individuals who are overweight/obese and insulin resistant.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

      1.Vitamin D repletion will improve biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and inflammation
      (directly altering macrophage cytokine production and/or indirectly as a result of
      improvement in insulin sensitivity.) 2.30,000 IU (0.25 mg) weekly of cholecalciferol (vitamin
      D3) will raise serum 25(OH)D levels from ≤ 20 ng/ml to ≥ 30 ng/ml overweight/obese
      population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Nonsmoking men and women, ages 18-65

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m² and within 10% of maximum weight

          -  Serum 25(OH)D level ≤ 20 ng/ml

          -  Serum insulin level ≥ 7.2 mU/l

          -  Willingness to maintain current body weight for the duration of the study

          -  Willingness to maintain baseline lifestyle activities and routines for the duration of
             the study

          -  Willingness to avoid the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS),
             including low-dose daily aspirin, for at least ten days prior to each admission (due
             to the potential effects of these agents on inflammatory markers.)

          -  Willingness to avoid the use of all over-the-counter or prescription vitamins, dietary
             supplements, and herbal products during the study, with the exception of a basic
             multivitamin supplement.

          -  If of childbearing potential, willingness to use highly effective contraception for
             the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current tobacco smoking

          -  History of bleeding or coagulation disorders

          -  Gastrointestinal disease resulting in significant gastrointestinal dysfunction or
             malabsorption

          -  History of diabetes, or diagnosed during screening OGTT

          -  Current treatment with hypertensive medications

          -  History of cardiovascular disease

          -  Renal disease, as evidenced by a serum creatinine above the upper limit of normal on
             more than one screening visit

          -  History of kidney stones

          -  History of chronic hepatitis, or liver enzymes (AST or ALT) more than 2.5 times the
             upper limit of normal

          -  Primary hyperparathyroidism or baseline hypercalcemia from any cause

          -  Current treatment with over-the-counter or prescription weight loss medications, such
             as orlistat or sibutramine

          -  History of bariatric surgery

          -  Current treatment with any cholesterol-lowering medications, such as statins, niacin,
             fibrates, or ezetimibe

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to cholecalciferol

          -  Participation in an investigational drug study within one month of screening

          -  History, physical, or laboratory findings suggestive of any other medical or
             psychological condition that would, in the opinion of the principal investigator, make
