  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and document appropriate clinical safety and
      performance of the Remon CHF Implantable Pressure Sensor including the corresponding delivery
      system, the Remon CHF Home Unit, the Remon CHF Clinic System devices and associated
      application software. It is a small clinical trial to determine the feasibility of the
      device. The primary outcome measure relates to feasibility and not to health outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective feasibility, non-randomised, singlearm, multi-centre,
      interventional clinical investigation performed at 4 international sites. Patients were
      implanted with the Remon CHF Implantable Pressure Sensor utilizing the corresponding
      delivering system. Measurements were taken with the Remon CHF Home Unit and the Remon CHF
      Clinic System. Follow-up visits took place at one, three and six months after implant.

      Per protocol, a minimum of 30 patients was required to demonstrate safety of the device.

      The study was conducted in accordance with ISO 14155:2003 (parts I and II), the Declaration
      of Helsinki and all applicable local and national regulations in the countries of submission.
