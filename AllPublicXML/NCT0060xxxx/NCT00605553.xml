  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate if SYN115 has an effect on Parkinson's disease as
      measured by clinical symptoms and brain images using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when a
      function test is administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study in which each
      patient will act as their own control. Each patient enrolled will receive both SYN115 (20 mg
      or 60 mg) and placebo separated by a minimum of one week washout between periods. An adaptive
      design will be used to determine if SYN115 elicits effects relevant to PD in the fewest
      number of patients by performing interim analyses in successive cohorts of patients receiving
      60 or 20 mg.
