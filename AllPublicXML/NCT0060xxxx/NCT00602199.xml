      RATIONALE: ABT-510 may stop the growth of melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving ABT-510 works in treating patients
      with metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Examine the safety profile of ABT-510 in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

        -  Examine the antitumor activity (i.e., time to progression and response rates) in
           patients treated with ABT-510.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of ABT-510 and its potential impact on immune cell
           function in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ABT-510 subcutaneously twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are obtained at baseline, before treatment on day 1 of cycles 2 and 3, and then
      every other course thereafter for pharmacological and ancillary studies. Samples are
      evaluated for EC enumeration, expression profiling, circulating tumor cell quantification,
      analysis of T-cell functions (i.e., immunophenotyping for NK-, T- and B-cell phenotypes as
      well as ELISPOT analysis against common environmental pathogens and T cell spectratyping),
      and angiogenesis bioassays. Patients also undergo ultrasound-guided core tumor biopsies for
      histological analysis of microvascular density (CD38 and von Willebrand Factor
      immunohistochemistry) at baseline and before treatment on day 1 of courses 3 and 5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.
