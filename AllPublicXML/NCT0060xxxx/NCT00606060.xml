    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C &lt;/=1%)

          -  No history of FVIII inhibitor formation and no current evidence of inhibitor antibody
             (Bethesda Assay &lt; 0.6 BU)

          -  Elective major surgery requiring at least 6 days of rFVIII-FS therapy

          -  Subjects should have been previously treated with FVIII concentrates for at least 150
             exposure days. Previous treatment could have been with any type of rFVIII or with
             plasma-derived FVIII concentrate or cryoprecipitate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &gt;1.3 mg/dL)

          -  Any treatments, which may change the clearance of FVIII (dialysis, plasma exchange)

          -  Anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11 g/dL)

          -  Known AIDS (HIV seropositive patients may be enrolled)

          -  Active liver disease (transaminases &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal)

          -  History of severe reaction to FVIII concentrates

          -  Interferon treatment within the last 3 months

          -  Thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100,000 platelets/mm3) or other known hematological/bleeding
             problems other than hemophilia A

          -  Intake of other investigational drugs within 1 month prior to study entry

          -  Need for pre-medication for FVIII infusions (e.g. antihistamines)

          -  Diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm/Hg, which could not be controlled with
             antihypertensive medications
