  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our target population will have been adequately treated with one of three selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; escitalopram, citalopram, or sertraline) for at least 8-12 weeks
      and continue to experience symptoms of depression that have prompted them to seek additional
      treatment. Escitalopram, citalopram, and sertraline were selected for use in this study
      because they are among the most commonly selected SSRIs and they are associated with a
      reduced likelihood of drug-drug interactions with aripiprazole. After completion of the
      screening process, eligible participants will be augmented with aripiprazole (5, 10, or 15
      mg) for 6 weeks. Participants will continue SSRI treatment with their prescribing physician,
      in conjunction with study participation. Symptom severity will be assessed on a weekly basis,
      and cognitive and psychosocial function will be assessed at pre- and post-augmentation. We
      hypothesize that aripiprazole augmentation will be associated with reductions in symptom
      severity, and with improved performance on measures of psychosocial and cognitive function.

    <measure>Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) Mean Initial Thinking Time for 3-move Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SOC is part of the CAmbridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and is an executive function task based on the Tower of London test that assesses spatial planning for problems with 2, 3, 4, or 5 moves. The Mean Initial Thinking Time for 3-move problems is the time (in milliseconds)taken to plan a problem solution for trials requiring 3 moves. Higher numbers indicate poorer performance. Time reported is the difference between baseline and 6 weeks post-treatment.</description>

    <measure>Spatial Working Memory (SWM) Between Errors for 6-move Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SWM task is part of the CANTAB neruopsychological test battery and is an executive function task assessing retention and manipulation of items in working memory, with the ability for assessment of perseverative (redundant) errors. Between errors are times the subject revisits a box in which a token was previously found; errors are calculated for 4-, 6-, and 8-box trials. Higher numbers indicate poorer performance. Errors reported are the difference between baseline and 6 weeks post-treatment.</description>

    <description>The SWM task is part of the CANTAB neruopsychological test battery and is an executive function task assessing retention and manipulation of items in working memory, with the ability for assessment of perseverative (redundant) errors. The Strategy score represents the number of times a participant begins a search with the same box for 6- and 8-box problems. Minimum score is 8 and maximum score is 56. Higher numbers indicate poorer performance. Score reported is the difference between baseline and 6 weeks post-treatment.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Q-LES-Q general activities is designed to measure subjective satisfaction and enjoyment, as opposed to function, in various domains including physical health, feelings, work, household duties, school/course work, leisure time activities, social relations, and general activities. The raw score is converted into a percent of the maximum possible score and range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater enjoyment and satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The HRSD 17-item scale is a clinician-administered rating scale designed to assess the severity of symptoms in patients diagnosed with depression. Scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression severity.</description>

          <description>The SOC is part of the CAmbridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and is an executive function task based on the Tower of London test that assesses spatial planning for problems with 2, 3, 4, or 5 moves. The Mean Initial Thinking Time for 3-move problems is the time (in milliseconds)taken to plan a problem solution for trials requiring 3 moves. Higher numbers indicate poorer performance. Time reported is the difference between baseline and 6 weeks post-treatment.</description>

        <title>Spatial Working Memory (SWM) Between Errors for 6-move Problems</title>
        <description>The SWM task is part of the CANTAB neruopsychological test battery and is an executive function task assessing retention and manipulation of items in working memory, with the ability for assessment of perseverative (redundant) errors. Between errors are times the subject revisits a box in which a token was previously found; errors are calculated for 4-, 6-, and 8-box trials. Higher numbers indicate poorer performance. Errors reported are the difference between baseline and 6 weeks post-treatment.</description>
