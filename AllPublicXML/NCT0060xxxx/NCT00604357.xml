      Background:

      Patients undergoing liver transplantation with preexisting renal dysfunction are prone to
      further renal impairment with the early postoperative use of Calcineurin-inhibitors. However,
      there is only little scientific evidence for the safety and efficacy of de novo CNI free
      regimens in patients with impaired renal function undergoing liver transplantation. The
      objective of the study is to evaluate a de novo calcineurin-inhibitor-free immunosuppressive
      regimen based on induction therapy with anti-CD25 monoclonal anti- body, mycophenolate
      mofetil (MMF/MPA), and mTOR-inhibition to determine its safety and to investigate the
      preliminary efficacy in patients with impaired renal function at the time of liver
      transplantation. Methods/Design: Patients older than 18 years with renal impairment at the
      time of liver transplantation due to hepatorenal syndrome, eGFR &lt; 50 ml/min and/or serum
      creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 mg/dL will be included. Patients will receive a combination therapy
      with antiCD25-monoclonal antibodies, MMF, steroids and delayed sirolimus (day 10) and will be
      evaluated with regards to the incidence of steroid resistant acute rejection within the first
      30 days after liver transplantation as the primary endpoint. The study is designed as
      prospective two-step trial requiring a maximum of 29 patients. In the first step 9 patients
      will be included. If 8 or more patients show no signs of biopsy proven steroid resistant
      rejection, additional 20 patients will be included. If in the second step a total of 27 or
      more patients reach the primary end-point the regimen is regarded to be safe and efficient.
      The follow up period will be one year after transplantation. The aim is to obtain safety and
      efficacy data for this new and innovative therapy regimen that might be the basis for a large
      prospective randomized multicenter trial in the future.

      Objectives of this study The objective of the study is to evaluate a de novo CNI-free
      immunosuppressive regimen based on induction therapy with anti-CD25 monoclonal anti- body,
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF/MPA), and delayed mTOR-inhibition. The primary endpoint is defined
      as the incidence of steroid-resistant acute rejection within the first 30 days after liver
      transplantation.

      Secondary objectives include the incidence of acute rejection(s), the number and the timing
      of acute rejections per patient within the first year after transplantation. A critical
      secondary endpoint will be the development of renal function at 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months
      after liver transplantation. This includes information on the number of patients requiring
      renal replacement therapy and its duration. During follow-up of 1 year liver allograft
      function, infectious complications, treatment failures defined as introduction of CNIs as
      well as side-effects affecting the hematopoetic system, tolerability, impaired wound-healing,
      the incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis and mortality will be explicitly documented and
      investigated.

      Trial population The collective we are aiming at are patients older than 18 years with a
      preexisting renal impairment at the time of liver transplantation. Patients will be eligible
      if the eGFR &lt; 50 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault) and/or their serum creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 mg/dL.

      Follow-Up Every patient will be followed up for 1 year after transplantation. The primary
      end-point will be at 30 days after transplantation (Steroid resistant acute rejection).
      During the first 30 days after transplantation there will be 9 visits where laboratory values
      (liver, renal and metabolic function, sirolimus trough levels), adverse events and rejection
      episodes will be recorded. Additionally there will be an ultrasound on day 1 after liver
      transplantation and on day 10 prior to the initiation of sirolimus to exclude hepatic artery
      thrombosis.

      Between day 30 and 1 year after liver transplantation the patient will be followed up to
      evaluate the long time outcome and secondary objectives of the trial.

    <description>Prior to reperfusion 500 mg Prednisolone will be administered i.v.. After the transplantation, a combination of anti-CD25-mAB (basiliximab 20 mg on day 0 and day 4 after the procedure), and MMF 2 g/d, 2 applications per day i.v., later conversion to oral intake) will be applied. Earliest, on day 10 after LT Sirolimus will be introduced aiming at 24 hours trough-levels for Sirolimus between 4 and 8 ng/mL. Steroids will be started on day 1 after transplantation with 1mg/kg BW and will be tapered every 2 days for 5 mg to a dosage of 20 mg and for 2.5 mg every two days to 7.5 mg. Thereafter the dosage will be reduced to 5 mg and 2.5 mg for 1 week each and eliminated thereafter. Additionally, every patient with risk constellation will receive cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii infection during the first 3 months after liver transplantation.</description>
