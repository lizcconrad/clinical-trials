  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate a psychotherapy for PTSD and substance use disorders
      among women who have experienced domestic violence. The hypothesis is that women who receive
      present-focused, integrated treatment will have greater PTSD symptom reduction and have less
      substance use after treatment than women in the control condition who will receive supportive
      therapy based on a 12-step approach.
