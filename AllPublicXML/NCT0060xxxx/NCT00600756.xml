  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to assess the long term subjective well-being in schizophrenic
      outpatients treated with quetiapine XR (extended release) or oral risperidone at flexible
      dose in a naturalistic setting over a period of one year. Secondary outcome measures have
      been selected for helping in the differentiation of the compared atypical antipsychotics. The
      primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of quetiapine XR to
      risperidone assessed at month 6 in terms of responder rate using the self-report instrument
      SWN-K

    <measure>Responder Rate at Month 6 in the Per Protocol Population Using the Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptics Scale, Short Version (SWN-K) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SWN-K is comprised of 20 questions, rated on a 6-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 6 (very much). Scores range from 20 to 120, with higher scores implying higher subjective well-being. A responder is defined as a subject with an increase of 10 points or 20% from baseline in SWN-K total score (non-inferiority limit of -9.7% in responder rate)</description>

          -  Patient with first episode of the above mentioned disease (item 3) or patient
             requiring a medication change for clinical reasons (effectiveness, tolerability,
             compliance, patient preference), i.e. switch from typical to atypical neuroleptics,
             switch from other atypical neuroleptics, excluding patients treated with risperidone
             or quetiapine at the time of enrolment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a baseline SWN-K total score of &gt;75

          -  Patients with previous treatment with risperidone or quetiapine may be enrolled if

Scores range from 20 to 120, with higher scores implying higher subjective well-being.

The subscores are rated using a 6-point scale (the higher the grade, the better the response). Possible subscores range from 4 to 24.</description>
