  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that sleep homeostasis, also known as
      sleep pressure or sleep drive, is different in healthy older and younger individuals.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an inpatient study of healthy individuals to determine whether homeostatic &quot;sleep
      drive&quot; effects on sleep change with healthy aging. Sleep, performance, and mood were studied
      on individuals sleeping different lengths of time and during wake periods of different
      durations.
