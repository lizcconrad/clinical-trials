    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and clinical status of
      pediatric patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Particular attention will be
      directed to recording safety outcomes reported in association with infliximab and other
      prescribed IBD therapies. In addition, information on disease status and quality of life will
      be collected.

      This registry study will include volunteer pediatric patients: approximately 2,000 pediatric
      patients with Crohn's Disease who have been treated with infliximab and approximately 2,000
      pediatric patients with Crohn's Disease who have received therapies other than infliximab.
      Approximately 1,000 pediatric patients with Ulcerative Colitis or Indeterminant Colitis will
      also be enrolled. All patient treatments for IBD will be decided by the treating physicians
      in consultation with their patients based on usual clinical practice. Patient information
      will be collected at the time of enrollment and every 6 months for approximately 20 years.
      Data collection will include disease characteristics, IBD medications, safety assessments to
      include adverse events. Patients will also be asked to complete a brief questionnaire
      describing school and/or work attendance in order to assess quality of life. Some patients
      may be asked to participate in a substudy that will evaluate blood levels of formation of
      proteins that may develop after treatment with infliximab. A small amount of additional blood
      may be taken at the time of a routine blood draw that is part of a patient's routine medical
      care as determined by a treating physician. There are three studies as part of the post
      marketing requirement for IBD - C0168Z02, REMICADEPIB4002 and REMICADEPIB4003. There is one
      combined database for these protocols and analyses are performed using the aggregate data.
      All reports and publications will be generated from the combined database. No study agents
      will be administered in this registry. All patients will receive standard-of-care treatments
      prescribed by the patient's physician.

        This is a registry of pediatric patients with IBD (e.g., CD, UC, or IC in C0168Z02 and CD
        in REMICADEPIB4002 and REMICADEPIB4003) who were treated with infliximab and/or other
        medical therapies for IBD. Information will be collected on patient demographics, disease
        characteristics, clinical status, quality of life, medications, and dose and frequency of
        administration of infliximab, other biologics, and immune modulators.
