      This research study involves studying the genes that may affect how ill you become during
      respiratory infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is a virus that often
      causes common colds.

      Cytokines are chemicals that are naturally made by your body. Cytokine levels are increased
      in some people when they have common colds or wheezing caused by respiratory syncytial virus
      (RSV). The purpose of this study is to study the genes that may control cytokine levels
      during infection with RSV in the elderly population.
