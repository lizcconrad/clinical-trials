      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium contains a radioactive substance that kill cancer
      cells. Peripheral blood stem cell transplant using stem cells from the patient may be able to
      replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and radioactive drugs used to kill
      cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of samarium Sm 153
      lexidronam pentasodium when given together with high-dose melphalan in treating patients with
      multiple myeloma undergoing stem cell transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To find the maximum tolerated dose of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium when given
           with fixed high-dose melphalan as a conditioning regimen for autologous peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. (Phase I)

        -  To assess the response rates of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium
      followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium IV once between days
           -14 and -10. Patients also receive melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF)
           subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium at the MTD determined
           in phase I .

      Blood samples are collected periodically to determine clearance of samarium Sm 153 lexidronam
      pentasodium and bone marrow dosimetry.
