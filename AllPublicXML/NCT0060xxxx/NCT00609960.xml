    <textblock>
      This study wants to test the hypothesis that trained clowns can reduce anxiety in children
      undergoing general anesthesia. We will compare the effect of the clowns to the commonly used
      anti-anxiety medication we commonly use

      The perioperative environment, often anxiety-provoking for adults, may be quite frightening
      for children. The detrimental effects of preoperative anxiety are not confined to the
      preoperative period. Anxiety during induction of anesthesia is correlated with increased
      distress early in the postoperative period, (Holms Knud, Kain) and maladaptive behavior will
      follow for the first 2 weeks following surgery in up to 54% of children.

      Many preoperative systems allow parental, pharmacologic, and anticipatory interventions to
      facilitate a relaxed perioperative environment for children. Unfortunately, scheduling
      conflicts, side effects, and limited resources conspire to limit their usefulness. For
      example, only 10% of respondents in a recent survey used parental presence during induction
      of anesthesia (PPIA) for a majority of their patients. This may be due to the belief by some
      that parental anxiety may in fact increase children's anxiety. (Bevans) According to the same
      survey, only 50% of children undergoing surgery receive sedating premedication. (Kain).
      Distraction techniques, such as the use of toys or video games, may also decrease
      perioperative anxiety, however their effectiveness during induction of anesthesia is not well
      characterized. The efficacy of toys and video games is somewhat dependent upon the child
      reaching certain developmental milestones. Anesthesiologists continue to search for an easy
      and comprehensive method for anxiety reduction in the pediatric surgical population. We
      propose that specially trained professional clowns may allay preoperative anxiety and result
      in a smooth anesthetic induction.
