    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancer and are schedule to receive standard radiation therapy
      known as IMRT to treat cancer

      In this study, we will plan additional measurements of the position of the patient's organs
      weekly during radiation treatment. We will analyze these measurements in order to evaluate
      whether we need to adjust our treatment procedures for the remainder of the treatments. We
      might adjust the dose of radiation received to specific organs in order to try to minimize
      the amount of radiation the healthy tissue receives.
