    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an intravenous (IV) antiplatelet medication is
      as safe and effective at preventing clot formation in your stented artery as compared in
      people who have stopped clopidogrel prior to surgery.

      Stent thrombosis continues to be associated with a high rate of death or myocardial
      infarction. While this risk has been ameliorated through the use of the oral antiplatelet
      agent clopidogrel, there is a small but important subset of patients who will require
      discontinuation of clopidogrel due to unplanned or emergency surgery. These patients are
      exposed to a high risk of stent thrombosis during this time period. It is not known whether a
      strategy of intravenous antiplatelet therapy to &quot;bridge&quot; these patients is effective at
      preventing the morbidity related to stent thrombosis in the perioperative period. We intend
      to assess, in a prospective observational manner, the clinical course of patients who have
      undergone stent implantation less than 6 months prior to a surgical procedure requiring
      discontinuation of clopidogrel therapy and the efficacy of intravenous antiplatelet therapy
      to prevent morbidity related to stent thrombosis.
