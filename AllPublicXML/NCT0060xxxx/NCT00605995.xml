  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to determine whether the cholesterol-lowering drug
      simvastatin is effective in the treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia. The primary
      hypothesis is that patients with schizophrenia receiving add-on treatment with simvastatin
      will improve clinically (as measured mainly by symptom severity) compared with patients
      receiving placebo, and that this improvement will be accompanied by concomitant reduction in
      peripheral inflammatory markers.

  <detailed_description>

      The identification of alternative therapies with the capacity to dampen inflammatory
      processes and reduce serum cholesterol takes on additional significance given independent
      concerns about heightened cardiovascular risk in schizophrenia patients, through exposure to
      antipsychotic drugs, increased cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome and obesity, and
      smoking.
