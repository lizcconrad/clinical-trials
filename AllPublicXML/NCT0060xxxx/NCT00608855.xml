      RATIONALE: Percutaneous cryoablation may help relieve pain caused by bone metastases.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well percutaneous
      cryoablation works in treating patients with painful bone metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To confirm the safety of percutaneous cryoablation in the palliative treatment of
           patients with painful bone metastases.

        -  To determine the benefits of cryoablation of painful bone metastases by assessing pain
           intensity using a standardized Cleeland Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and quality of life
           using a standardized SF-8 both before and after treatment.

        -  To determine the secondary benefits of cryoablation of painful bone metastases by
           assessing change in analgesic use following therapy.

        -  To determine the level of anesthesia required for cryoablation with a baseline level of
           conscious sedation planned for each treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo percutaneous cryoablation to one or two sites of metastatic disease using
      the Endocare Cryocare system. Patients with a good initial response to treatment (≥ 2
      decrease in pain intensity rating on the Brief Pain Inventory) who develop recurrent pain at
      the same site or a new painful site ≥ 1 month after initial treatment may undergo one
      additional cryoablation treatment.

      Patients complete pain and quality of life questionnaires periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic solid tumor involving or abutting
             bone (index lesion)

               -  If the nature of the metastatic disease has been previously documented, index
                  lesion to be treated does not require further documentation (i.e., biopsy)

          -  Pain either refractory to standard care (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or
             analgesics) or patient is considered a poor candidate for conventional therapies

               -  Radiation oncology consult is required if the patient is considered clinically to
                  be a candidate for conventional palliative radiotherapy

               -  Surgical oncology consult is required if the patient is considered clinically to
                  be a candidate for conventional surgical treatment or is considered at risk for
                  complications resulting from potential fracture

          -  Initial pain score ≥ 4 on a scale of 0-10 for the question &quot;Please rate your pain by
             circling the one number that best describes your pain at its worst in the past 24
             hours&quot; on the Cleeland Brief Pain Inventory

               -  Pain from ≤ 2 sites of metastatic disease

          -  No lesions with evidence for impending fracture involving a weight-bearing bone (&gt; 50%
             loss of cortical bone at the site)

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 2 months

          -  Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm³

          -  ANC &gt; 1,500/mm³ (for patients who have recently been treated with chemotherapy)

          -  INR ≤ 1.2

          -  Not pregnant or nursing

          -  Negative pregnancy test

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  More than 3 weeks since prior radiotherapy

          -  More than 3 weeks since initiation of a new chemotherapy regimen, including
             bisphosphonates

          -  More than 7 days since prior antiplatelet medications or clopidogrel

          -  More than 3 days since prior acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), ibuprofen, or other
             NSAIDs

          -  No prior treatment of the portion of a lesion within 0.5 cm of the spinal cord or
             brain, within 0.5 cm of a large abdominal vessel such as the aorta or inferior vena
             cava, or within 1 cm of bowel or bladder

          -  No prior radiofrequency ablation for pain palliation of the same lesion

          -  No concurrent regular or low molecular weight heparin or other anticoagulants
