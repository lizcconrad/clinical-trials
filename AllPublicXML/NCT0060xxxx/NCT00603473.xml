  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Ratio of Gabapentin in Japanese Pediatric Patients With Partial Seizures</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Response Ratio calculated by the following equation was assessed as the primary endpoint: R Ratio = (T−B) / (T+B) where T is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 12-week treatment period, and B is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 6-week baseline period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Responder Rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with a 50% or greater reduction in the seizure frequency per 28 days for the 12-week treatment period in comparison with the frequency per 28 days for the 6-week baseline period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change in Seizure Frequency (PCH)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PCH calculated by the following equation was assessed as secondary endpoint: PCH = 100 (T−B) / B where T is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 12-week treatment period, and B is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 6-week baseline period.</description>

Subjects aged 13 to 15 years received gabapentin 600 mg/day on Day 1, 1200 mg/day on Day 2 and 1200 or 1800 mg/day from Day 3. After Day 3, the dose was adjusted if necessary within the range of maintenance doses.

        <description>The Response Ratio calculated by the following equation was assessed as the primary endpoint: R Ratio = (T−B) / (T+B) where T is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 12-week treatment period, and B is seizure frequency per 28 days (i.e., the number of seizures per 28 days) calculated from the total number of seizures for the 6-week baseline period.</description>

            <description>The dosage of oral solution for subjects aged 3 to 12 years was calculated based on their body weight. The dose was titrated for the first 3 days of the treatment period. Subjects aged 3 to 4 years received gabapentin 10 mg/kg/day on Day 1, 20 mg/kg/day on Day 2 and 40 mg/kg/day from Day 3. Subjects aged 5 to 12 years received gabapentin 10 mg/kg/day on Day 1, 20 mg/kg/day on Day 2 and 25 to 35 mg/kg/day from Day 3. Subjects aged 13 to 15 years received gabapentin 600 mg/day on Day 1, 1200 mg/day on Day 2 and 1200 or 1800 mg/day from Day 3. After Day 3, the dose was adjusted if necessary within the range of maintenance doses. The maximum daily dose was 600 mg for Day 1, 1200 mg for Day 2, and 1800 mg for Day 3 and thereafter.</description>
