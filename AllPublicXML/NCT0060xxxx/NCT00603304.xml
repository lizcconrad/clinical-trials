  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CAMUS trial will test Saw palmetto in about 369 men. Men who decide to be part of the
      CAMUS trial will be given one out of two possible treatments at random. One out of every two
      men would get an inactive placebo treatment. One out of every two men would get Saw palmetto
      pills.

      This kind of scientific study is the best way to find out if the plant extracts really work
      to prevent men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from getting worse. During the study,
      men will not know which of the two treatments they are assigned to. They will be followed
      very closely by a study team every 12 weeks to see how they are doing. Men in the CAMUS trial
      will be studied over 72 weeks. Tests and all medications needed as part of the study will be
      provided at no charge to the participant. Participants will be responsible for all other
      costs not associated with the study tests and medications. All information on study
      participants will be held in the strictest confidence and no one would have access to patient
      information other than the required authorized health care and research personnel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAMUS trial is studying the outcomes using herbal therapy for benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH).

      BPH is a common problem for older men. With BPH, the prostate grows larger. Over time, this
      growth can cause bothersome urinary symptoms. These symptoms can include frequent and/or
      urgent urination during the day or at night. Men with BPH can also have a weak urine stream,
      a stream that stops and starts, a feeling of not emptying the bladder all the way, and/or a
      need to strain to get urination started. BPH is NOT the same as prostate cancer.

      A number of natural products (extracts of different plants) seem to be able to reduce the
      bothersome symptoms of BPH with very few side effects over a few months. One of the plant
      extracts comes from the dwarf palm tree (Saw palmetto). The investigators do not know whether
      these plant extracts will reduce the symptoms of BPH over a longer period of treatment.

    <measure>Mean and Standard Deviation of the Participant American Urological Association (AUA)Symptom Score Between Baseline and Week 72 for CAMUS Participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 72 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the mean difference in the AUA Symptom Score between baseline and 72 weeks between the saw palmetto and placebo groups. The AUA Symptom Score index is a seven item questionnaire assessing the frequency of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The questions are scored on a scale of zero to five, with zero being never, one to four being one to four accordingly, and five equaling five or more times. A Symptom Index is determined by adding the scores. The lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 35, which would represent the highest level of pain and discomfort.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome was the mean difference in the AUA Symptom Score between baseline and 72 weeks between the saw palmetto and placebo groups. The AUA Symptom Score index is a seven item questionnaire assessing the frequency of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The questions are scored on a scale of zero to five, with zero being never, one to four being one to four accordingly, and five equaling five or more times. A Symptom Index is determined by adding the scores. The lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 35, which would represent the highest level of pain and discomfort.</description>

The IIEF is a multidimensional scale for assessment of erectile dysfunction. The six item self administered questionnaire is scored on a scale from 0 to 5, with zero being no sexual activity, one being never or almost never, two being a few times (much less than half the time), three being sometimes (much less than half the time), four being most times (much more than half the time), and five being always or almost always. The lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 30, which represents less dysfunction.</description>
