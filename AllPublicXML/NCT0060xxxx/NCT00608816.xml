    <textblock>
      Epinephrine is one of the important hormones in the defense of hypoglycemia. We will test the
      hypothesis that antecedent hypoglycemia will blunt the metabolic, neuroendocrine and
      cardiovascular effects of subsequent epinephrine infusion in Type 1 DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a person had previously experienced bouts of low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, his or
      her counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia would be weakened. This is especially true
      and important for a person with Type 1 diabetes, because it will cause him or her to be
      vulnerable to another bout of hypoglycemia, and cause hypoglycemia unawareness, which can
      lead to serious or even life-threatening consequences. Epinephrine is one of the important
      hormones in the defense of hypoglycemia. We will test the hypothesis that antecedent
      hypoglycemia will blunt the metabolic, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular effects of
      subsequent epinephrine infusion in Type 1 DM.
