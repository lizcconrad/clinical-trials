  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot clinical study is to test a methodology for using high-resolution
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging to guide vacuum-assisted core biopsy of breast
      abnormalities identified on PET. In order to implement the PET guidance, the study uses the
      Stereo Navigator accessory to the high-resolution organ-specific PET scanner (PEM Flex™ PET
      Scanner, Naviscan PET Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA). The Stereo Navigator is an
      investigational device intended for guiding biopsy needles toward lesions in breasts
      identified by a physician on a high resolution PET image. The study will evaluate the
      clinical utility of the Stereo Navigator in guiding the vacuum-assisted core biopsy of breast
      abnormalities, following the example of prior studies of breast biopsy guided by magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will invite participation from human subjects with newly diagnosed or suspected
      breast cancer who have one or more breast abnormalities moderately suspicious or highly
      suggestive of malignancy on breast imaging and requiring biopsy (the lesion(s) of interest).
      Prospective subjects will be asked to sign IRB-approved consent forms, explaining the use of
      PET imaging for guiding biopsy of suspicious lesion(s). Up to 30 patients will be recruited
      in the study. The study will be terminated after approximately 20 subjects undergo PET-guided
      interventional procedures. In the course of the study, a subject will be injected with
      18F-FDG and imaged using the PEM Flex PET scanner. Once an abnormality requiring biopsy is
      identified on the PET scan, the physician conducting the procedure will use the PET image to
      plan the biopsy trajectory using the Stereo Navigator Software Module, and use the Stereo
      Navigator Needle Guide Holder to guide insertion of the introducing stylet toward the lesion.
      The sampling will be performed using commercially available core biopsy tools routinely used
      for MRI-guided biopsy.Immediately after the PET-guided biopsy, conventional biopsy markers
      will be inserted at the biopsy site(s) for correlation with other imaging modalities.
      Placement of the biopsy marker will be documented using mammography, as per standard clinical
      practice. Histopathologic results will be correlated with imaging findings. The procedure may
      be repeated for additional lesions identified on PET at the investigator's discretion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             specifically:

               -  Individuals who have a breast abnormality(ies) moderately suspicious for or
                  highly suggestive of malignancy on imaging with mammography, ultrasound, or MRI
                  (as per ACR BIRADS™ 4C or 5) and requiring biopsy confirmation OR o Individuals
                  with known breast cancer who have additional imaging abnormality(ies) suspicious
                  for malignancy detected on a high-resolution FDG PET scan

               -  Individuals who had recent conventional imaging work-up including x-ray
