    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) and
      rituximab with or without lenalidomide or cyclophosphamide work in treating patients with
      symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine
      phosphate and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in different
      ways by targeting certain cells. Lenalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different
      ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving fludarabine phosphate and rituximab together
      with lenalidomide or cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) after remission induction with
      four different chemo-immunotherapy combinations for patients with untreated, symptomatic,
      lower-risk and high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to decide which of the four arms,
      if any, to take forward into a randomized phase III trial.

      II. To determine the induction response to fludarabine phosphate and rituximab (FR) and
      fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in each of these arms, along
      with the consolidation response to lenalidomide in patients with CLL.

      III. To determine the toxicity from these four chemoimmunotherapy combinations and that of
      consolidation therapy with lenalidomide.

      IV. To determine the induction response and toxicity of FCR in patients with deletion (del)
      (11q22.3) along with consolidation response, 2-year PFS and toxicity of lenalidomide in this
      specific genetic group.

      V. To determine the effect of pretreatment biologic characteristics on clinical outcomes,
      such as attaining a complete response to induction therapy and progression-free survival.

      VI. To collect relapse samples to determine the frequency of clonal evolution among patients
      with immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) mutated and unmutated disease and to
      study mechanisms of resistance to chemoimmunotherapy.

      VII. To determine if flow cytometry-negative status immediately post-therapy and at 24 months
      after study entry is an effective surrogate marker for prolonged progression-free survival
      and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms (Arms A, B, or C). Patients on Arm
      A or B who are found to be del (11q22.3) positive are assigned to Arm D beginning with course
      2 of induction therapy.

      ARM A (remission-induction [RI] therapy with fludarabine phosphate and rituximab):
      Participants receive induction therapy (every 28 days for up to 6 cycles) of: rituximab
      intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on days 1 (50 mg/m^2), 3 (325 mg/m^2), and 5 (375 mg/m^2)
      of course 1 and on day 1 (375 mg/m^2) of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive
      fludarabine phosphate 25 mg/m^2/day IV over 30 minutes or orally (PO) on days 1-5.

      ARM B (RI therapy with fludarabine phosphate and rituximab followed by
      remission-consolidation [RC] therapy with lenalidomide): Participants receive induction
      therapy (every 28 days for up to 6 cycles) of: rituximab IV over 1-4 hours on days 1 (50
      mg/m^2), 3 (325 mg/m^2), and 5 (375 mg/m^2) of course 1 and on day 1 (375 mg/m^2) of all
      subsequent courses. Patients also receive fludarabine phosphate 25 mg/m^2/day IV over 30
      minutes or PO on days 1-5. Participants without progression receive consolidation therapy:
      lenalidomide 5mg/day cycle 1, 10 mg/day cycles 2-6 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of 28 day
      cycle.

      ARM C (RI therapy with fludarabine phosphate, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide): Participants
      receive induction therapy (every 28 days for up to 6 cycles) of: rituximab IV over 4 hours on
      days 1 (50mg/m^2) and 3 (325 mg/m^2) of course 1 and on day 1 (500 mg/m^2) of all subsequent
      courses. Patients then receive fludarabine phosphate (age &lt; 70: 25 mg/m^2/day; age &gt;= 70: 20
      mg/m^2/day) IV piggyback over 30 minutes or PO (32 mg/m^2/day) followed by cyclophosphamide
      (age &lt; 70: 250 mg/m^2/day; age &gt;= 70: 150 mg/m^2/day) IV piggyback over 30 minutes on days
      1-3.

      ARM D (RI therapy with fludarabine phosphate, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide followed by RC
      therapy with lenalidomide): Patients receive the first course of induction therapy as in Arm
      A or B before being re-assigned to Arm D. Beginning in course 2, patients receive rituximab
      IV (500 mg/m^2) on day 1 and fludarabine phosphate (age &lt; 70: 25 mg/m^2/day; age &gt;= 70: 20
      mg/m^2/day) IV piggyback over 30 minutes or PO (32 mg/m^2/day) and cyclophosphamide IV (age &lt;
      70: 250 mg/m^2/day; age &gt;= 70: 150 mg/m^2/day) piggyback over 30 minutes on days 1-3.
      Participants without progression receive consolidation therapy: lenalidomide 5mg/day cycle 1,
      10 mg/day cycles 2-6 PO QD on days 1-21 of 28 day cycle.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for up to 15 years.
