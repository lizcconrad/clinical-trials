  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned research will adapt an intervention of known efficacy to target a new outcome of
      significant importance to public health. Specifically the Community Reinforcement and Family
      Training (CRAFT) procedures will be adapted, from reinforcing treatment entry, to reinforcing
      treatment retention and HIV risk behavior reduction in persons with opioid dependence who
      receive a Buprenorphine taper detoxification. The research plan includes three phases: 1)
      development of a manual guided therapy, 2) development of therapist training and fidelity
      measures and 3) a randomized pilot evaluation with 52 patients receiving either the new CRAFT
      treatment or treatment as usual.

    <description>The Community Reinforcement and Family Training for Treatment Retention and HIV Risk Reduction treatment (CRAFT-T) was be developed in phase 1 and 2 of the current study and consists of twelve manual-guided weekly one-hour individual sessions for the concerned significant other and 2 one hour sessions for the identified patient. The intervention also allows for up to two additional sessions (total of 14 visits) to help arrange re-entry into substance abuse treatment when needed. The identified patient receives this intervention in addition to the usual services at the drug treatment program (Maryhaven).</description>
