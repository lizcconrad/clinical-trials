    <textblock>
      Prove the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with bioflavonoids will diminish the
      recurrence rate of colonic neoplasia, we will implement a clinical trial comparing
      bioflavonoids and placebo in a double blind randomized clinical trial. To use a standardised
      supplementation of bioflavonoids, a commercially available preparation (Flavo-Natin®) will be
      used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The preparation contains a mixture of 200mg chamomile and tea (green tea) extract which
      contains naturally occurring bioflavonoids (2%) together with vitamins and folic acid. This
      flavonoids mixture will be applied for 3 years and the compliance and effects of this
      treatment will be determined by measuring the serum concentrations of apigenin and EGCG of
      the patients.
