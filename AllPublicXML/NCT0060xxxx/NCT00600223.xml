  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the nature and quality of speech after removal of
      the voice box and all or part of the swallowing tube.

      The study is evaluating which type of surgery provides patients with the best speech and
      voice.

      These data will be used to help surgeons to design better ways to restore voice function
      after removal of the voice box. Information about disease, its treatment, quality of life,
      and physical and vocal function will be collected. An audio recording of vocal tasks will
      also be done. All of this information will be analyzed and the two different subject groups
      will be compared to see if there are differences.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have undergone removal of the larynx and the entire pharynx by either
             traditional reconstruction or more advanced reconstructive techniques, which involve
             the use of tissue, such as skin or bowel, from other parts of the body. There is no
             time frame for reconstruction. All subjects who have previously undergone
             reconstruction are eligible.

          -  Subjects who use the tracheoesophageal puncture method of voice restoration as their
             primary communication technique.

          -  &gt; or equal to 18 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Do not have functional voice restoration.

          -  Do not speak English as a functional language.
