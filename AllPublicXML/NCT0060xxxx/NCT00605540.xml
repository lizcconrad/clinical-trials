  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to verify the association between the changes in markers of disease and
      patient´s prognosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study, 133 COPD patients were followed-up during the period of one-year.
      Analyses of the association between baseline characteristic and the occurence of disease
      exacerbation was performed. In this study, the patients included in the previous research
      will be contacted and invited to participate in a complete evaluation after a three-year
      period. The association of the changes in dyspnea perception, spirometry variables, body
      composition, quality of life and exercise tolerance measures with disease prognostic will be
      studied.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in the First Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after three years</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 values were measured by Spirometry using the KOKO Spirometer, before and 15 minutes after the inhalation of 400mcg of salbutamol.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after three years</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerance exercise was evaluated by six-minute walking distance(6MWD)according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines.Patients were instructed to walk, attempting to cover as much ground as possible within 6 min. A research assistant timed the walk, and standardized verbal encouragement was given.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after three years</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition was evaluated by Body Mass Index (BMI), which is dividing weight in kilograms by height in square meters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after three years</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea was evaluated by Medical Research Council scale (MRC). MRC scale consists of only five items and it is based on activities that cause dyspnea. The patient reports the degree of dyspnea by choosing a value between 1 and 5. A higher number indicates greater sensation of dyspnea.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after three years</time_frame>
    <description>Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)was used to evaluate patient's health status. SGRQ includes three domains: symptoms, activities and impact of the disease. Each domain has a minimum score (zero) and maximum (662.5, 1209.1, and 2117.8, respectively). A total score is also calculated based on the results of three domains, with a score maximum of 3989.4. The total score is referred to as the percentage achieved by the patient related to this maximum score. Minimum score means there is no impairment in the health status and high score means maximum dysfunction.</description>

          <description>Tolerance exercise was evaluated by six-minute walking distance(6MWD)according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines.Patients were instructed to walk, attempting to cover as much ground as possible within 6 min. A research assistant timed the walk, and standardized verbal encouragement was given.</description>

        <description>Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)was used to evaluate patient's health status. SGRQ includes three domains: symptoms, activities and impact of the disease. Each domain has a minimum score (zero) and maximum (662.5, 1209.1, and 2117.8, respectively). A total score is also calculated based on the results of three domains, with a score maximum of 3989.4. The total score is referred to as the percentage achieved by the patient related to this maximum score. Minimum score means there is no impairment in the health status and high score means maximum dysfunction.</description>
