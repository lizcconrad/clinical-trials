    <textblock>
      Locomotor training is a new exercise modality that emphasizes task specificity to promote
      learning and neural plasticity. It has been reported to improve walking in patients with
      stroke, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy. In this study, 40 patients with impaired
      ambulation due to Multiple Sclerosis will be randomized to receive 36 sessions of either
      locomotor training or an standard resistive exercise intervention.The locomotor training will
      be accomplished via a robotic device, the Lokomat, which will move the patient's legs on a
      treadmill while they are suspended in a harness.

      In this study, subjects with confirmed diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis were randomized into
      one of two treatment arms. Subjects in the Lokomat arm trained on the Lokomat with a
      supervising physical therapist for 20-30 minutes/session 3 times/week. The Lokomat is a
      robotic exoskeleton which enables the subject to step on a moving treadmill. Subjects were
      suspended in a harness while in the Lokomat with full to partial body weight support as
      needed. After the training in the Lokomat, they practiced overground walking for 10 minutes.

      The other treatment arm had subjects engage in resistance training with weights and
      resistance elastic bands matched to the Lokomat group for intensity, duration and frequency.
      they did not practice overground walking.

      Primary outcome measure was speed to accomplish 25' timed walk.

The Lokomat device is a robotic exoskeleton which fits over the patient's legs while they are suspended in a harness over a standard treadmill. the patient is suspended over a treadmill while their legs are in the Lokomat, which moves the legs on the treadmill. Patient had to be ambulatory with or without an assistive device. The amount of body weight support is gradually increased or decreased as needed.Partients were also given feedback by the physical therapist while they were walking on the treadmill. Patients trained for 30-40 minutes per session, for 3X/week. The average speed of training was 2.4km.hr. After lokomat training, the patients practiced over ground walking with the therapist for 15 minutes after each session.</description>

This group trained for the same amount of time as the Lokomat group, i.e.3X/week for 30-40 minutes per session. they used resistive weights and /or theraband resistive bands to accomplish training. Exercises were done in supine, lying sitting and standing positions. Large muscle groups in both upper and lower extremities were trained. Patients completed 3 sets of 8-12 reps of each exercise, and performed 8-10 different exercises in each session.</description>

It is scored from information obtained the neurologic exam and goes from 0-10. O is &quot;normal &quot;and 10 is &quot;dead&quot;. A higher number therefore connotes worse physical disability.</description>

          <title>Lokomat Training Using Body Weight Support on a Treadmill</title>
          <description>Locomotor training using body weight support on a treadmill, using robotic device to provide locomotor training. Locomotor training will be done using the Lokomat device. The Lokomat device is a robotic exoskeleton which fits over the patient's legs while they are suspended in a harness over a standard treadmill. the patient is suspended over a treadmill while their legs are in the Lokomat, which moves the legs on the treadmill. Patient had to be ambulatory with or without an assistive device. The amount of body weight support is gradually increased or decreased as needed.Partients were also given feedback by the physical therapist while they were walking on the treadmill. Patients trained for 30-40 minutes per session, for 3X/week. The average speed of training was 2.4km.hr. After lokomat training, the patients practiced over ground walking with the therapist for 15 minutes after each session.</description>

          <title>Resistive Training</title>
          <description>resistive training using weights and therabands
This group trained for the same amount of time as the Lokomat group, i.e.3X/week for 30-40 minutes per session. they used resistive weights and /or theraband resistive bands to accomplish training. Exercises were done in supine, lying sitting and standing positions. Large muscle groups in both upper and lower extremities were trained. Patients completed 3 sets of 8-12 reps of each exercise, and performed 8-10 different exercises in each session.</description>
