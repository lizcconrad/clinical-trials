        <title>Change From Baseline in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHDRS) Total Score - Parent Version at Week 16 Endpoint</title>
        <description>Measures the 18 symptoms contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Individual item scores range from 0 (none/never or rarely) to 3 (severe/very often). Total scores range from 0-54. Least Square mean of change from baseline in ADHDRS is from a restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed model repeated measures analysis which includes the effects of treatment, investigative site, baseline, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Woodcock-Johnson III Scores at Week 16 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement has a Standard Battery (Tests 1-12) of a broad set of scores and an Extended Battery (Tests 13-22) on specific academic strengths and weaknesses. Tests associated with reading skills (1, 2, 7, 9, 13, 17, 20) were administered. Scores for each individual test can range from 0 to over 200 where anything 69 and below is very low and anything 131 and above is very superior. Higher scores indicate better reading skills.</description>

        <description>The CTOPP assesses phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid naming and is appropriate for ages 7 to 24. The test contains six core subtests. The composite scores are 1) Phonological Awareness, comprised of the standard scores of the Elision and Blending Words; 2) Phonological Memory, comprised of standard scores for Memory for Digits and Non-word Repetition; and 3) Rapid Naming, comprised of standard scores for Rapid Digit Naming and Rapid Letter Naming. Standard scores range from 1-20, and composite scores range from 35-165. Higher scores are better.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Gray Oral Reading Test-4 (GORT-4) at Week 16 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The GORT-4 is a norm-referenced test of oral reading rate, accuracy, fluency, and comprehension valid for individuals aged 6 to 18 years old. The test has two parallel forms, Form A and Form B, that are administered in an alternating fashion (e.g. Week 0-Form A, Week 16-Form B, Week 32–Form A.) with each containing 14 separate stories and 5 multiple-choice comprehension questions for each story. GORT-4 yields the following scores: rate, accuracy, fluency, comprehension, and overall reading ability. Standard scores range from 1-20. Higher scores indicate better reading skills.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) at Week 16 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The TOWRE is a measure of an individual’s ability to pronounce printed words accurately and fluently and is appropriate for individuals aged 6 to 24 years old. The TOWRE contains two subtests: Sight Word Efficiency (SWE) which assesses the number of real printed words that can be accurately identified within 45 seconds and Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (PDE) which measures the number of pronounceable printed non-words that can be accurately decoded within 45 seconds. Scores range from 45-146. Higher scores indicate higher reading proficiency.</description>

        <description>LPS-C is a short (24 item, 0-3 points per item) parent-rated scale that is designed to assess changes in adaptive functioning related to treatment for ADHD. This scale measures improvements in social, emotional, cognitive, educational, and affiliative (family, friends) functioning, which indirectly reflect improvements in executive functioning. Happy/social subscores range from 0-18, and self-control subscores range from 0-54. Total scores range from 0-72. Higher scores are better for LPS.</description>

Tests associated with reading skills (1, 2, 7, 9, 13, 17, 20) were administered. Scores for each individual test can range from 0 to over 200 where anything 69 and below is very low and anything 131 and above is very superior. Higher scores indicate better reading skills.</description>

          <description>The Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement has a Standard Battery (Tests 1-12) of a broad set of scores and an Extended Battery (Tests 13-22) on specific academic strengths and weaknesses. Tests associated with reading skills (1, 2, 7, 9, 13, 17, 20) were administered. Scores for each individual test can range from 0 to over 200 where anything 69 and below is very low and anything 131 and above is very superior. Higher scores indicate better reading skills.</description>

        <description>The CTOPP assesses phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid naming and is appropriate for ages 7 to 24. The test contains six core subtests. The composite scores are 1) Phonological Awareness, comprised of the standard scores of the Elision and Blending Words; 2) Phonological Memory, comprised of standard scores for Memory for Digits and Non-word Repetition; and 3) Rapid Naming, comprised of standard scores for Rapid Digit Naming and Rapid Letter Naming. Standard scores range from 1-20, and composite scores range from 35-165. Higher scores are better.</description>

        <description>The GORT-4 is a norm-referenced test of oral reading rate, accuracy, fluency, and comprehension valid for individuals aged 6 to 18 years old. The test has two parallel forms, Form A and Form B, that are administered in an alternating fashion (e.g. Week 0-Form A, Week 16-Form B, Week 32-Form A.) with each containing 14 separate stories and 5 multiple-choice comprehension questions for each story. GORT-4 yields the following scores: rate, accuracy, fluency, comprehension, and overall reading ability. Standard scores range from 1-20. Higher scores indicate better reading skills.</description>

        <description>The TOWRE is a measure of an individual's ability to pronounce printed words accurately and fluently and is appropriate for individuals aged 6 to 24 years old. The TOWRE contains two subtests: Sight Word Efficiency (SWE) which assesses the number of real printed words that can be accurately identified within 45 seconds and Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (PDE) which measures the number of pronounceable printed non-words that can be accurately decoded within 45 seconds. Scores range from 45-146. Higher scores indicate higher reading proficiency.</description>

        <description>LPS-C is a short (24 item, 0-3 points per item) parent-rated scale that is designed to assess changes in adaptive functioning related to treatment for ADHD. This scale measures improvements in social, emotional, cognitive, educational, and affiliative (family, friends) functioning, which indirectly reflect improvements in executive functioning.

          <description>LPS-C is a short (24 item, 0-3 points per item) parent-rated scale that is designed to assess changes in adaptive functioning related to treatment for ADHD. This scale measures improvements in social, emotional, cognitive, educational, and affiliative (family, friends) functioning, which indirectly reflect improvements in executive functioning. Happy/social subscores range from 0-18, and self-control subscores range from 0-54. Total scores range from 0-72. Higher scores are better for LPS.</description>
