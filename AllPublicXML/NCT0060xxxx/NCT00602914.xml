      The purpose of this study is to compare glucose pharmacokinetics and insulin pharmacodynamics
      injected via the MicronJet in comparison with a conventional needle.

    <textblock>
      Administration of insulin to the skin has many potential advantages including improved
      kinetics and reduced pain. Today, insulin is injected to the SQ space, using, in most cases,
      various devices incorporating standard metal needles and usually causing considerable pain
      and discomfort to the patients. NanoPass has developed a microneedle based needle substitute
      for intradermal injections. This device requires minimal expertise and is expected to cause
      minimal or no pain during injections.

      The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      insulin Novorapid® (Novo Nordisk) injected via the MicronJet device intradermally, to a
      conventional needle injected to the SQ space.
