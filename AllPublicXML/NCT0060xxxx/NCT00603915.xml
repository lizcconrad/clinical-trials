  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin or Carboplatin will be given on day 1 every 21 days for 6 cycles; Gemcitabine will
      be given on day 1 and day 8 every 21 days for 6 cycles. Those patients that do not progress
      on GC after 6 cycles of chemotherapy will be started on erlotinib daily until disease
      progression. A cycle of erlotinib will be 28 days. Patients who progress on GC will be
      offered erlotinib as well,in order to evaluate its activity as a single-agent in the
      second-line setting.

      Patients previously treated with GC have reported a progression-free survival (PFS) of 9
      months. We would anticipate an extension of PFS to 12 months in patients treated with GC
      followed by maintenance erlotinib. Furthermore, we hypothesize that patients who achieved
      benefit from GC therapy would have further response when treated with maintenance erlotinib,
      such that this strategy may increase the likelihood of attaining long-term survival.

    <description>Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumour.
Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of measured lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute progressive disease.</description>

             non-keratinizing carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma) NPC.

          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. At least one site of
             disease must be unidimensionally measurable as follows:

               -  X-ray, physical exam &gt; 20 mm

               -  Spiral CT scan &gt; 10 mm

               -  Non-spiral CT scan &gt; 20 mm

          -  Investigations including chest x-ray or CT scan of chest, CT or MRI of head and neck
             (for patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent disease) and other scans as
             necessary to document all sites of study disease have been performed within 28 days
             prior to randomization. (Exceptions will be made only for patients who have negative
             examinations within 35 days prior to registration; exceptions for bone scans will be
             made for negative examinations within 60 days prior to registration.)

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0,1 or 2 (see Appendix II).

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Previous Therapy:

               -  Chemotherapy: Advanced Disease: Patients may not have had prior therapy for
                  recurrent or metastatic disease.

               -  Curative Therapy: Patients may have had prior chemotherapy (including cisplatin/
                  carboplatin based regimens) in the neoadjuvant, concurrent and adjuvant setting
                  for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma provided that 4 weeks have elapsed
                  since treatment and any residual treatment related neuropathy or ototoxicity is &lt;
                  grade 1 for cisplatin dosing on this trial. Patient with neuropathy or

                  fraction was given at least 4 weeks prior to registration and all toxicities have
                  resolved. If radiotherapy was delivered to the only site of measurable disease,
                  then progression must have been documented in that site after completion of
                  radiotherapy and prior to registration.

          <description>ECOG Performance Status is a scale and criteria to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. A lower ECOG indicates a better outcome.

Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of measured lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute progressive disease.</description>
