      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dasatinib in treating patients
      with solid tumors or lymphomas that are metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Dasatinib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dasatinib in patients with varying degrees
      of hepatic impairment.

      II. To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of this drug in patients with varying
      degrees of hepatic impairment.

      III. To assess the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicities (if any) of dasatinib in
      patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe any antitumor efficacy associated with dasatinib administration in patients
      with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

      II. To examine whether the pharmacokinetic clearance of dasatinib correlates with hepatic
      function as assessed by Child-Pugh Criteria, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Organ
      Dysfunction Working Group Criteria, or other assessments of liver function.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.

    <measure>Liver dysfunction data</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Child-Pugh classification (CPC), NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group (ODWG) Stratification Criteria for all patients will be collected at baseline and correlated to the toxicities and pharmacokinetic data seen with dasatinib in an exploratory analysis. Clearance estimates for each liver impairment group based upon the NCI ODWG Criteria, CPC Scheme, will be correlated with drug clearance. Ultimately, the predictive value of these various different methods of grouping organ dysfunction patients will be compared to determine if any method is better able to predict dasatinib clearance.</description>

               -  Patients with any cardiopulmonary symptoms of unknown cause (e.g. shortness of
                  breath, chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with
                  or without stress test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule
                  out QTc prolongation; the patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the
                  discretion of the principal investigator; patients with underlying
                  cardiopulmonary dysfunction should be excluded from the study

             in the manner deemed appropriate by the treating physician

          -  Patients with abnormal liver function are eligible and will be grouped according to
             the criteria; no distinction will be made between liver dysfunction due to metastases
             and liver dysfunction due to other causes; for patient registration, liver function
             tests (total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/alanine aminotransferase
             [ALT], prothrombin time [PT]/international normalized ratio [INR] and partial
             thromboplastin time [PTT], and alkaline phosphatase) must be performed within 14 days
             prior to registration; for patient stratification, liver function tests must be
             performed within 72 hours of anticipated starting time of protocol treatment; patients
             must be stratified and treated based on the liver function tests performed within 72
             hours prior to treatment; the South West Oncology Group (SWOG) Data Operations Center
             must be notified in writing in cases where the patient's cycle 1 pre-treatment liver
             function tests result in stratification to a dysfunction group different from how the
             patient was classified at registration

          -  Patients with biliary obstruction for which a shunt has been placed are eligible,
             provided the liver function tests have stabilized (two measurements at least two days
             apart that put the patient in the same hepatic dysfunction stratum will be accepted as
             evidence of stable hepatic function); there must be no evidence of biliary sepsis and
             at least 2 weeks must have elapsed after the placement of a biliary shunt

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing; women/men of reproductive potential must
             have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method; since interaction with dasatinib
             and oral contraceptives is possible, a barrier method should be used and oral
             contraceptives are not permitted; a negative pregnancy test is required within 72
             hours prior to starting therapy for women of reproductive potential; a woman is
             considered to be of &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had menses at any time in the
             preceding 12 consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods,
             &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to
             prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation; however, if at any
             point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the
             time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is
             responsible for beginning contraceptive measures

          -  Patients who have experienced any of the following within the 12 months prior to
             starting protocol treatment are not eligible: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable
             angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure,
             cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack, or significant pulmonary
             embolus

          -  Patients with ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade &gt;= 2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or QTc interval &gt;

             effusion are not eligible; patients with a history of pleurodesis and previous pleural
             effusion (malignant or non-malignant) may be eligible but treated with caution;
             patients with previous history of ascites may be treated

          -  Patients with uncontrolled serious intercurrent medical illness including, but not
             limited to ongoing or serious active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled diarrhea or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements are not eligible

          -  Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive are not eligible;
             however, patients will not routinely be screened for HIV

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo pharmacokinetic sampling

          -  Patients or their legally authorized representative must be informed of the
             investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent
             in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and
             identification (ID) number must be provided to the Statistical Center in order to
             ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval
             for this study has been entered into the data base
