      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well temozolomide works in treating patients
      with invasive pituitary tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the effect of temozolomide on pituitary tumor growth in patients with invasive
           pituitary tumors.

        -  To assess the effect of temozolomide on pituitary tumor response and the duration of
           tumor response in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effect of temozolomide on pituitary tumor hormone secretion in these
           patients.

        -  To assess the effect of temozolomide on other aspects of pituitary function in these
           patients.

        -  To assess the overall safety and tolerability of temozolomide in these patients.

        -  To assess the overall quality of life of patients treated with temozolomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of 12 courses, patients achieving a complete or partial tumor response may
      continue to receive temozolomide at the investigator's discretion in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected periodically to assess methylation status of the
      methyl-guanine methyl-transferase promoter (MGMT) gene and to quantitate immunocytochemical
      expression of the tumor suppressor proteins p53, p16, and p27. Tissue samples are also
      analyzed by microarray and proteomics to determine a genetic &quot;signature&quot; of invasive vs
      non-invasive pituitary tumors and to determine if this signature correlates with response to
      temozolomide. Blood samples are also periodically for biomarker laboratory studies.

      Patients complete a quality of life questionnaire periodically.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 28 days.
