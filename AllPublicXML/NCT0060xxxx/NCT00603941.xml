  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I/II study will be conducted as an open label, multiple center study of CS-7017, an
      experimental drug and paclitaxel chemotherapy in subjects with advanced anaplastic thyroid
      cancer. Biopsies will be obtained from patients with accessible tumor at baseline, two-weeks
      after the first CS-7017 dosage (prior to the start of combination therapy) and at the end of
      the first study cycle (week 3 of combination therapy), in order to evaluate the effects of
      the study drug alone and in combination with the chemotherapy agent on the tumor. Treatment
      will continue until disease progression or the development of intolerable toxicities.

    <description>At Phase 1, CS-7017 will be tested in combination with paclitaxel at the following dosage levels: 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, and 0.50mg BID. At Phase 2, CS-7017 will be administered at the RP2D. Commercially available paclitaxel will be administrated as IV infusion over 3 hours once every 3 weeks.</description>
