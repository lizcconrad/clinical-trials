      The purpose of our study is primarily to evaluate the effects of 5mg finasteride on hematuria
      and hematospermia commonly associated with prostate biopsies. We hypothesize that 5mg of
      finasteride daily for two weeks preceding TRUS prostate biopsy and one week following will
      reduce hematuria and hematospermia commonly seen as complications following prostate biopsy.
      We also hypothesize that reducing complications will decrease concern among subjects and make
      for a more tolerable overall procedure than compared with subjects treated with placebo.

      Study Purpose:

      The purpose of our study is primarily to evaluate the effects of 5mg finasteride on hematuria
      and hematospermia commonly associated with prostate biopsies. We will also examine how
      effective the dosing of finasteride administered two weeks prior to biopsy and one week
      following. We will also use the subject questionnaire to assess subject's attitudes and
      concerns about hematuria and hematospermia. We will examine the overall subjective
      tolerability of the biopsy procedure, concerns about sexual function, anxiety surrounding
      prostate cancer, and urination following the procedure. Questionnaires will use a 10 point
      visual analog scale to gauge subject's attitudes and concerns. We will examine for any
      statistically significant correlations between these parameters and the complications we are
      monitoring. We will also monitor side effects of subjects, in an effort to gauge the
      potential risks associated with short term usage of finasteride compared to any benefits
      afforded by finasteride on reducing hematuria and hematospermia.

      Hypotheses:

      Based on the previous research into the molecular mechanisms of finasteride, we hypothesize
      that 5mg of finasteride daily for two weeks preceding TRUS prostate biopsy and one week
      following will reduce hematuria and hematospermia commonly seen as complications following
      prostate biopsy. We also hypothesize that reducing complications will decrease concern among
      subjects and make for a more tolerable overall procedure than compared with subjects treated
      with placebo.

      Objectives:

      To determine the effectiveness of 5mg finasteride administered two weeks prior to prostate
      biopsy and one week following on reducing hematuria and hematospermia following biopsy.

      To gauge subject's concerns relating to hematuria, hematospermia, and transmitting prostate
      cancer to partners following TRUS prostate biopsy.

      To examine subject's subjective sexual function and urination in relation to their treatment
      group.

      To demonstrate benefits of finasteride in relation to the safety and tolerability of
      treatment.

      Endpoints:

      Differences in rate and severity of hematuria and hematospermia among subjects in treatment
      and placebo groups.

      Differences in complications following biopsies, such as hospitalization and requirement for
      blood transfusion, between treatment and placebo groups.

      Differences between placebo group and finasteride treatment group in: overall subjective
      experience of biopsy procedure, concern relating to hematuria and hematospermia, sexual
      function, and urination following prostate biopsy.

      Monitor side effects between placebo and finasteride when administered for three weeks total
      duration.

      Research design:

      The study we plan to conduct will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to
      determine the effects of 5mg finasteride on the rate/severity of hematuria and hematospermia
      following TRUS prostate biopsy.

      A total of 50 subjects will be randomized into one of two groups. One group will receive 5mg
      of finasteride orally for two weeks prior to TRUS biopsy, and one week after the biopsy.
      Another group will receive a placebo orally for two weeks prior to the procedure and one week
      following the biopsy. Patients will be identified for participation by existing indication
      for TRUS prostate biopsy, and subsequently enrolled. Subjects will receive the current
      standard of care in addition to participating in this study.

      The study is designed to investigate the effects of finasteride compared to placebo on
      hematuria and hematospermia following prostate biopsy. Subjects will be assigned to treatment
      groups using a randomization process to eliminate selection bias, and to ensure that any
      differences between the two study groups are due to random chance. The study has been
      designed as placebo controlled and double blinded to ensure that investigator and subject
      ascertainment biases are minimized. As there is no current prophylactic or other treatment to
      decrease the rate/severity of hematuria and hematospermia following prostate biopsies, this
      does not raise any ethical concerns in the placebo group.

      Subject recruitment will be done on an ongoing basis.

      Statistical analysis plan:

      We will perform statistical analysis on the data collected from this study. We will examine
      whether there is a statistically significant difference in the rates of hematuria and
      hematospermia between placebo and finasteride treatment groups. We will also examine for any
      statistically significant relationships between study groups (placebo versus finasteride) and
      concern regarding hematuria/hematospermia, satisfaction with/tolerability of the biopsy,
      concern with prostate cancer transmission, sexual/urinary function, and side effects.

      Research Procedures:

      Subjects will be identified as potential participants for this study in the office of Dr.
      Pommerville. Dr. Pommerville will identify subjects from within his urology practice as
      needing a TRUS biopsy out of medical necessity for reasons unrelated to enrollment in this
      study. The indications for prostate biopsy are usually based on clinical suspicion using a
      combination of digital rectal examination and prostate specific antigen blood testing. Once
      identified as potential candidates for participation in this study, Dr. Pommerville will give
      the potential subject a detailed explanation of the study and will explain the content in the
      informed consent form. Once the patient has read the consent form and understands what the
      study entails, they will make a decision whether or not to enroll in this study. Once
      informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be assigned a unique identification number,
      which will not be used for any other purposes. This identification code will have features
      that allow the code to be broken in an emergency situation. At this time, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to the placebo or treatments groups in a double blind fashion.

      Subjects will be given a three week supply of 5mg of finasteride or placebo and detailed
      instructions on how they are to take their medication/placebo. They will be instructed to
      take their medication/placebo, one tablet (5mg) of finasteride/placebo orally each day for
      two weeks prior to biopsy and one week following. This will be in addition to the standard of
      care that is normally given with prostate biopsy (antibiotics, enema). They will be given an
      appointment to undergo prostate biopsy in two weeks. Subjects will be instructed that if they
      decide to withdraw from this study, they may do so at any time, and return the unused
      medication to Dr. Pommerville's office at follow up

      Subjects will then undergo TRUS prostate biopsy two weeks later as part of their standard
      medical care at either the Royal Jubilee Hospital or Victoria General Hospital. Equipment and
      procedures will not differ between these sites. Patients will be followed up at this point by
      Dr. Pommerville on their participation and adherence to study protocol. If subjects have not
      been compliant with the protocol, they will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects will
      receive repeat instructions on taking their medication and released as would be expected as
      part of the standard of care for prostate biopsies. They will be given an appointment for two
      weeks from the TRUS biopsy to see Dr. Pommerville in his clinic. They will be reminded to
      come to the clinic approximately 20 minutes prior to their appointment time so that Nathan
      Hoag (Medical student) may administer a questionnaire in accordance with what was described
      to them by the informed consent form.

      Subjects will present for their scheduled two week follow up appointment to Dr. Pommerville's
      office. This practice is in accordance with the normal standard of care. Nathan Hoag will
      administer the subject questionnaire at this point. Questionnaires will be administered prior
      to subjects seeing Dr. Pommerville for biopsy results in an effort to minimize emotional
      influence on the results of the questionnaire. This is the last visit in the standard medical
      care for prostate biopsy. Subjects are instructed to follow up with Dr. Pommerville or their
      family physicians should they have additional concerns. At this time, subjects will be
      reminded that they are to return to Dr. Pommerville's office in an additional two weeks,
      where the medical student will administer the questionnaire for a second time to monitor any
      ongoing changes (4 weeks since procedure).

      In addition to the patient questionnaire, previously described grading systems will be used
      to quantify the incidence and severity of hematuria and hematospermia among subjects at two
      and four weeks.18,19 Hematospermia grading systems quantify hematospermia as mild (less than
      7 days), moderate (7 to 14 days), and severe (more than 14 days). Hematuria is defined as
      grossly passing blood or blood clots in the urine. Hematuria is stratified using minor
      episodes (lasting 24 hours or less), moderate episodes (lasting more than 24 hours, but not
      requiring hospital admission), and severe episodes (clot retention and hospital admission).
      Hematuria will then be graded according to the following system: grade 0 (no gross
      hematuria), grade 1 (up to 2 minor episodes or 1 moderate episode), grade 2 (more than 2
      minor episodes or 1 moderate episode), grade 3 (1 or more severe episodes).

      This will be the conclusion of the study for subjects. They will be reminded that they are
      free to contact Nathan Hoag should they have any concerns or questions. They will also be
      reminded that they may follow up with Dr. Pommerville or their family physicians should they
      need to.
