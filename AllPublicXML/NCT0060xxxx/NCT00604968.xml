    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin (Caelyx) in elderly patients who are to receive first-line chemotherapy for
      metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, not amenable to surgery.

    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (Defined as Progression of Disease [According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or World Health Organization (WHO) Criteria] or Unacceptable Toxicity Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment or Death).</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity leading to discontinuation of treatment or death, assessed every 12th week until end of treatment (study planned to continue until all participants ended treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure was defined as progression of disease (according to the RECIST or WHO criteria) or unacceptable toxicity leading to discontinuation of treatment or death. Progressive Disease according to RECIST response criteria: &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the Longest Diameter of target lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute progressive disease. Progressive Disease according to WHO response criteria: Increase in size of existing lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Stable Disease (SD) as Best Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until treatment discontinuation, assessed every 12th week until end of treatment (study planned to continue until all participants ended treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Response was calculated according to RECIST criteria except for bone metastasis where WHO criteria was used. For patients with skeletal disease only, WHO criteria was used. For patients with measurable disease according to RECIST as well as bone metastasis, both RECIST &amp; WHO were used.
RECIST response criteria for SD required steady state of response of at least 9 weeks duration. There may be no appearance of new lesions.
WHO response criteria for SD required no significant change for at least 8 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Partial Response (PR) as Best Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until treatment discontinuation, assessed every 12th week until end of treatment (study planned to continue until all participants ended treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Response was calculated according to RECIST criteria except for bone metastasis where WHO criteria was used. For patients with skeletal disease only, WHO criteria was used. For patients with measurable disease according to RECIST as well as bone metastasis, both RECIST &amp; WHO were used.
RECIST PR criteria required &gt;=30% decrease in certain target lesions &amp; no increase in size of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions
WHO PR criteria required partial decrease in size of lytic lesions, recalcification of lytic lesions, or decreased density of blastic lesions for &gt;=4 wks</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Progressive Disease (PD) as Best Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until treatment discontinuation, assessed every 12th week until end of treatment (study planned to continue until all participants ended treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Response was calculated according to RECIST criteria except for bone metastasis where WHO criteria was used. For patients with skeletal disease only, WHO criteria was used. For patients with measurable disease according to RECIST as well as bone metastasis, both RECIST &amp; WHO were used.
RECIST PD criteria required &gt;=20% increase in certain target lesions OR progression of non-target lesions, or appearance of new lesions
WHO PD criteria required increase in size of existing lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients Requiring Dose Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until treatment discontinuation (study planned to continue until all participants ended treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>The protocol contains instructions to reduce the Caelyx dose according to specific schedules, in cases necessary due to reasons such as hematological toxicity, non-hematological toxicity, cardiotoxicity, or other toxic side-effects of treatment reducing quality of life etc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until response, assessed every 12th week until end of treatment (study planned to continue until all participants ended treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Response can be partial (&gt;=30% decrease in the sum of Longest Diameter of target lesions, determined by two observations not less than 4 weeks apart; no unequivocal increase in the size of non-target lesions or the appearance of new lesions may occur) or complete (disappearance of all clinical evidence of tumor determined by 2 observations not less than 4 weeks apart), whichever status is recorded first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until treatment discontinuation, assessed every 12th week until end of treatment (study planned to continue until all participants ended treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time span from the first evaluation that shows response until the first evaluation that shows progression. Where patients did not show progress, duration of response was measured from the first evaluation that showed response until they discontinued the study.
Response can be partial or complete (as previously defined), whichever status is recorded first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until progression, assessed every 12th week until end of treatment (study planned to continue until all participants ended treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>Progression is defined as the first evaluation that shows progression (either by RECIST or WHO criteria):
Progressive Disease according to RECIST response criteria: &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the Longest Diameter of target lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute progressive disease.
Progressive Disease according to WHO response criteria: Increase in size of existing lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of treatment until death, up to the time that all participants ended treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were followed with regards to survival even after they left the trial (ie after End of Treatment visit). Deaths that occurred after patient participation ended were collected all the way through to the overall end of the trial which took place on Oct 31, 2009. These deaths were used to calculate overall survival.</description>

        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time span from the first evaluation that shows response until the first evaluation that shows progression. Where patients did not show progress, duration of response was measured from the first evaluation that showed response until they discontinued the study.
Response can be partial or complete (as previously defined), whichever status is recorded first.</description>
