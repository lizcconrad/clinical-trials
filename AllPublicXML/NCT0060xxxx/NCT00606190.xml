      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate two standard approaches of supplying blood
      and oxygen to your brain during open heart surgery.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the best method of protecting the brain during
      long periods of circulatory arrest. The significance of this project will be to determine
      which method of brain protection (1) retrograde brain perfusion or (2) perfusion of the right
      subclavian artery with antegrade perfusion of the brain protects against brain injury after
      total arch replacement. Thus reducing the risk of stroke or neurocognitive deficits in
      patients undergoing this critical surgical procedure.

    <description>Pt may be randomized to retrograde brain perfusion when having a repair of the ascending aortic artery (aorta) including the aortic arch. This is one of the standard methods used while the body and the brain are cooled down to sub-normal levels (hypothermia). This will take place while on the heart-lung machine.</description>
