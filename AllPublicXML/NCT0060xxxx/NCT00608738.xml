      RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with cancer and cancer-related conditions may
      help doctors learn more about a patient's needs and help doctors plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a whole-person-care guide works in
      identifying patient needs in patients with cancer or complications from cancer treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine what patient needs are detected from NEST13+ interviews of cancer patients
           and their caregivers.

        -  To determine the concordance among patient, caregiver, and team goals.

        -  To determine palliative care services provided.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned sequentially to 1 of 2 intervention groups.

        -  Group 1 (NEST13+): Patients and caregivers undergo NEST13+ interviews at the time of
           admission to Northwestern Memorial Hospital (caregivers answer the NEST13+ interviews
           from the patient's perspective). A NEST13+ care plan is then derived from both patient
           and caregiver responses. Research MD or RN presents patient's NEST13+ findings and
           recommended interventions for integration with actual care. On the day of discharge,
           patients and caregivers undergo a second NEST13+ interview.

        -  Group 2 (control): Patients and caregivers undergo a sham interview at the time of
           admission to Northwestern Memorial Hospital. On the day of discharge, patients and
           caregivers undergo a NEST13+ interview as in group 1.

      Medical charts for all patients are reviewed by a member of the research staff to document
      needs assessments in domains covered by NEST and to document palliative care-related
      decisions. Abstracted chart review by blinded experts is also performed to evaluate
      palliative care quality based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients and 250 caregivers will be accrued for this study.
