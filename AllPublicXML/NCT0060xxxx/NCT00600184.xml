      The AMES device a investigational device which cyclically rotates the ankle while muscle
      vibrators stimulate sensory receptors in the muscles opposite to the joint being rotated. In
      effect, the device provides assisted movement of a joint and enhanced sensation of that
      movement. The purpose of this study is to determine whether stroke survivors who remain
      unable to move normally more than one year after their stroke will be able to walk and move
      their affected leg significantly better after treatment with a new robotic therapy, the AMES
      device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, more that 600,000 U.S. citizens survive a major stroke. Following acute treatment,
      30-40% of these survivors sustain permanent motor disabilities. Within weeks of the stroke,
      surviving patients begin physical therapy to restore motion to affected limbs. Some recover
      completely, but many do not. There are over 5 million stroke survivors in the U.S. who did
      not recover completely and many are severely incapacitated for the remainder of their lives.

      The hypothesis underlying stroke rehabilitation with AMES is that, in many stroke victims,
      the damage to the brain disrupts one or more feedback loops that connect the proprioceptive
      receiving areas of the primary somatosensory cortex to the primary and pre-motor cortex.
      Without proprioceptive information feeding into the motor output center, the brain cannot
      &quot;locate&quot; the muscles needed for movement to occur. The hypothesis behind AMES rehabilitation
      is that synchronous and repetitive activity of the input and output areas of the cortex
      stimulate the reorganization of brain pathways, thereby closing the feedback loop disrupted
      by the stroke.

      Our research objective is to develop procedures to rehabilitate those stroke patients who,
      through conventional therapies, were not brought to a level of maximal recovery. The aim of
      the study is to obtain a set of data from a total of 16 chronic stroke subjects, all with
      lower extremity disability, between the ages of 18-75, using the AMES robotic device in a
      rehabilitation clinic. Each subject will participate in 10 weeks of therapy, 3 days per week,
      30 minutes per day. The data collected will be analysed to quantify the extent to which a
      combination of robot-assisted exercise and muscle vibration induce secondary recovery from
      stroke in the lower extremity.

    <description>The AMES device is a investigational device which cyclically rotates the ankle while muscle vibrators stimulate sensory receptors in the muscles opposite to the joint being rotated. Each subject will be tested before and after the 10-week treatment period. Treatment sessions will occur 3 times per week and last approximately 30 minutes per treatment. The device will measure 3 of the functional tests prior to each treatment session.</description>
