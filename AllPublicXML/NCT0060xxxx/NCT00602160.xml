  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of allergic diseases in westernized countries poses a significant
      health problem and a tremendous burden on quality of life and healthcare expenditure. Food
      allergy affects as many as 6% of young children and 3% to 4% of adults. While the majority of
      children outgrow their allergy to milk, egg, wheat and soy, allergies to peanut, tree nuts,
      fish and shellfish are often life-long. Currently, there are no treatments that can cure or
      provide long-term remission from food allergy. Based on our preliminary studies, we
      hypothesize that our investigational botanical drug, FAHF-2TM, will be a safe and effective
      herbal therapy for food allergy. We are enrolling those age 12-45 yrs old with allergies to
      peanut, tree nuts, sesame, fish, and/or shellfish.

      To address our hypothesis, we propose the following aims:

      Aim #1: To investigate the efficacy of FAHF-2TM for food allergy (in addition to current food
      allergen avoidance).

      Aim #2: To characterize the immunomodulatory effects of FAHF-2TM on food allergic patients

    <description>We propose to test 10 tablets administered orally three times daily (t.i.d.) for 6 months in the Phase II study. The subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups; FAHF-2 or Placebo group.
Both groups will undergo physician supervised Double-blinded placebo controlled food challenges, once during screening before starting treatment and again after 6 months of therapy.</description>
