  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving erlotinib may help
      doctors learn more about the effects of erlotinib on hormone levels.

      This clinical trial is looking at hormone changes in women with stage IIIB or stage IV
      non-small cell lung cancer receiving erlotinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergo a dermatology evaluation and complete the Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)
      research study questionnaire once. Blood samples are collected after an overnight fast.
      Samples are analyzed for circulating levels of total and bioavailable testosterone,
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex hormone binding globulin. Serum luteinizing hormone,
      follicle stimulating hormone, fasting glucose, and insulin levels are also assessed.
