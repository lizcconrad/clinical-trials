      RATIONALE: Eating a diet high in vegetables may lower the risk of some types of cancer.
      Brassica vegetables (such as cabbages, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower) and
      indole-3-carbinol (a substance found in cruciferous vegetables) may help lower the risk of
      prostate cancer recurrence.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well Brassica
      vegetables work compared with indole-3-carbinol in treating patients with PSA recurrence
      after surgery for prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of Brassica vegetable intake and indole-3-carbinol supplement
           use in patients with prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence
           after prostatectomy.

        -  Identify adverse events in these patients.

        -  Quantify the effects of each intervention on PSA in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by pretreatment prostat-specific antigen (PSA) growth rate
      (low [0.00-0.15] vs medium [0.16-0.30] vs high [&gt; 0.30]). They are randomized to 1 of 3
      treatment arms, and randomization status to arms II and III is double-blinded.

        -  Arm I (Brassica vegetables): Patients consume Brassica vegetables at least 2 servings (½
           cup/serving) daily for 6 months. Patients meet one-on-one with the study dietician, and
           are instructed on the potential health benefits of Brassica vegetables and purchase and
           preparation of the vegetables. Patients undergo telephone counseling periodically in
           months 1-5, to monitor their progress and identify barriers to adherence and to develop
           solutions to overcome these barriers.

        -  Arm II (Placebo): Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 6 months.

        -  Arm III (Indole-3-carbinol supplement): Patients receive oral indole-3-carbinol
           supplement (capsules) once daily for 6 months.

      Blood and urine samples (for urinary isothiocyanate levels) are collected at baseline and at
      2, 4, and 6 months. Patients complete questionnaires assessing demographics, family cancer
      history, and health history and measuring changes in medications, lifestyle, adverse events,
      and health. Medical records are reviewed for prostate cancer-related information, surgical
      dates, dose and type of radiation, and PSA history.
