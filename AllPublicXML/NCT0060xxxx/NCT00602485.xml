  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot study of the effect of an Action Control-based intervention (ACBI) on
      adherence to prescribed diet and exercise programs after cardaic rehabilitation. The purposes
      of this study are to:

        1. determine if an ACBI has an effect on adherence to prescribed home exercise and diet
           regimens for individuals 6 weeks after participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program

        2. examine whether there is a difference in response to the ACBI between state-oriented
           individuals and action-oriented individuals.

        3. test the interaction effect between action-orientation disposition and the intervention.

    <textblock>
      Patients with cardiac problems are burdened with complex lifestyle changes involving
      medication, diet and exercise. Non-adherence to prescribed treatment protocols is a major
      contributor to morbidity and mortality for these indiviudals. Rehabbilitation programs
      provide the necessary education and supervision needed to promote health, however,
      non-adherence occurs even for those indiviudals with appropriate resources and motivation.
      Most of the research up to this point deals with preparing indiviudals to be adherent. Action
      Control theory is focused on the mental processes that occur between the time an individual
      makes a decision to adhere and the moment when the appropriate activty either occurs or does
      not occur.

      This interventions tudy will compare rates of adherece between indivudals who receive an
      action control based educational intervention and those who do not.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be a convenience sample of English literate men and women over the
             age of 21 enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program and accessible by phone for
             follow-up. All participants are referred to rehabilitation by their physician. Being
             enrolled in the program indicates the participants have experienced a serious cardiac
             event, either myocardial infarction and/or coronary surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:
