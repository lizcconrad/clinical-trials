    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine brain
      structure, function and chemistry in people with bipolar disorder who are being treated with
      either quetiapine or lithium. Both of these medicines are FDA-approved to treat mania in
      adults and lithium is also FDA approved in children; quetiapine is commonly used in children
      with mania, but is not FDA approved for this indication in this age group.

        You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have been diagnosed
        with bipolar disorder and are currently experiencing mania. Mania is identified by periods
        of extreme elation or irritability, excessive energy, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping,
        poor judgment and/or reckless behavior. Bipolar disorder is an illness in which people
        experience mania as well as mood swings into depression. To participate in this study you
        must be at least 12 years old and no older than 35.

        Inclusion Criteria - First-episode manic bipolar patients (N=100; 15-20 patients/year):

          1. Patients meet DSM-IV criteria for type I bipolar disorder, manic or mixed.

          2. Patients have an index Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)70 total score &gt;20.

          3. Patients have &lt;3 months of lifetime anti-manic or anti-depressant medication exposure,
             including no active psychotropic medication in the one weeks prior to the index
             admission. Importantly, patients will NOT be taken off medications for this study;
             this criterion is to exclude subjects receiving active treatment at the time of
             admission to support the 'first-episode' criterion.

          4. Patients have no more than two prior episodes of major depression.

          5. Patients are between 12 and 35 years old; subjects &lt; 18 yrs old have a Tanner greater
             than or equal to 4

        Exclusion criteria: All subjects will be excluded from participation for the following
        reasons.

          1. Any chemical use disorder within 3 months.

          2. Any medical or neurological disorder that could influence fMRI and MRS results.

          3. A history of mental retardation or an estimated IQ total score &lt;85.

          4. An MRI scan is contraindicated in the subject.

          5. The patient cannot attend follow-up visits.

          6. A positive urine pregnancy test (in women).
