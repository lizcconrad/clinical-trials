  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will provide islet cell transplantation to two separate populations in need of
      a pancreas transplant:

      Group I: Islet Cell Transplantation in Type I Diabetics without Kidney Problems

      Group II: Islet Cell Transplantation in Type I Diabetics Who Have a Stable Functioning Kidney
      Transplant

      The targeted patients have very brittle diabetes or dangerous hypoglycemic unawareness and
      may benefit from transplantation over continuing insulin therapy, even though chronic
      immunosuppression is required. We believe that in these patients, the islet transplant
      procedure promises enough potential benefit to justify subjecting patients who have not
      previously had a transplant to the risk of immunosuppression.

      In patients who are already subject to the dangers of chronic immunosuppression for other
      reasons, i.e. to prevent rejection of a kidney allograft, the islet transplantation procedure
      itself is the principal additional risk and this risk should be minimal. In these patients
      (our Group II), the potential benefit from improved glycemic control is that it promises to
      slow or even reverse diabetic complications, such as vascular problems leading to kidney
      damage. It is this rationale that has made pancreas transplantation a widely accepted option
      in patients with renal failure, despite the risks associated with whole pancreas
      transplantation. Islet cell transplantation aims to provide a potentially lower risk
      procedure that has similar relief from diabetic complications.
