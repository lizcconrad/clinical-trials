  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease primarily
      affecting women of childbearing age, and associated with severe morbidity and mortality of
      its victims. The existing therapy, however, is not specific and its inevitable side effects
      may themselves be fatal. Therefore, it is a widely recognized need for, and it would be
      highly advantageous to have a safe, specific rapidly effective and well-defined treatment of
      SLE, devoid of the disadvantages.

      We have shown that VRT101 a peptide present in the extracellular laminin is a target for
      pathogenic lupus autoantibodies. Using this peptide we have developed the LupusorbTM - an
      immune-adsorption column which specifically binds pathogenic antibodies from monoclonal
      cultures as well as from patients` plasma. The investigational product named LupusorbTM
      Column is a sterile medical device for single use and can be classified into category IIb
      (synthetic ligands, peptides) according to Annex IX of the European Medical Device Directive
      42/93/EEC.

      The proposed study, a pilot non-randomized open label study, will test the safety,
      Tolerability and short term efficacy of a single immunoadsorption procedure in SLE patients.
