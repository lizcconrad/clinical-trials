      Primary objective:

      To assess the effect of xaliproden hydrochloride (xaliproden) 1 mg per oral daily on the rate
      of complete resolution of peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) at 6 months, following
      randomization, after the completion of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for colon
      cancer.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To assess the effect of xaliproden on patient-reported outcomes using the Functional
           Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity scale (FACT/GOG
           NTX-12 subscale).

        -  To assess the effect of xaliproden on the rate of at least partial recovery of grade &gt; 2
           PSN at 6 months

        -  To assess the effects of xaliproden on the time to complete recovery from PSN

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of xaliproden

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have completed an oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen post complete surgical
             removal of primary colon tumor no later than 6 weeks before randomization;

          -  Have Grade ≥ 1 PSN, as defined by the NCI-CTCAE version 3.0

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤2;

          -  Blood tests within 14 days prior to randomization: (a) AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤2 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN); (b) serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN; (c)HbA1c ≤7%; (d)
             neutrophils ≥1.5x10^9/L ; (e) platelets ≥50x10^9/L; (f) Serum D-dimer within normal
             limits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy prior to treatment with oxaliplatin

          -  Receiving any further anti-cancer treatment

          -  History of any recent (≤1 year) thrombo-embolic events and current clinical evidence
             of thrombo-embolism

          -  Unstable cardiac disease

          -  History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including dementia or
             seizures,

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Active disseminated intravascular coagulation

          -  Other serious underlying medical conditions which could impair the ability of the
             patient to participate in the study;

          -  Use of antidepressant/antiepileptic medication (for the treatment of PSN), unless
             commenced before informed consent form signed. The addition of these medications (for
             the treatment of PSN) once the patient has consented is not allowed

          -  Concurrent treatment with any other experimental drugs

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women;

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be protected by effective contraceptive methods

             months to be considered as having non-childbearing potential

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule. Those conditions
             should be assessed with the patient before registration in the trial.
