      The study will evaluate PK and safety of two dose levels of Micafungin (FK463) as Antifungal
      prophylaxis in children and adolescents undergoing HSCT
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, repeat-dose pharmacokinetic study that
      contains two treatment (micafungin 1.0mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg) dose groups. Subjects will be
      enrolled according to age and stratified by weight to receive either 1.0mg/kg (weight &gt; 25kg)
      or 1.5mg/kg ( weight &lt; 25kg) micafungin.

      Children (4 months to &lt; 2years, 2 to 5 years and 6 to 11 years) and adolescents (12 to 16
      years) undergoing HSCT who require antifungal prophylaxis will be enrolled
