  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cooperation with Merck &amp; Co, Inc. we will identify and form a database of 35 patients who
      have developed osteochemonecrosis of the jaws related to oral bisphosphonate use. We will
      study the triggers, associated medical conditions and medications, location of the lesion(s),
      and patient outcomes.

      This study is an observational study, and not a comparative trial. The major outcome is
      represented by the fraction of subjects with long term healed lesions.
