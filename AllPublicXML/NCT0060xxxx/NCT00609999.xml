      Primary:

      To determine maximum tolerated dose &amp; dose limiting toxicity of dasatinib when combined w
      erlotinib among pts w recurrent MG

      Secondary:

      To further evaluate safety &amp; tolerability of dasatinib + erlotinib To evaluate
      pharmacokinetics of dasatinib when administered w erlotinib among recurrent MG pts who are on
      &amp; not on CYP-3A enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs To evaluate for anti-tumor activity with
      this regimen in this patient population

      Tarceva administered on continuous oral dosing schedule at 150 mg/day for pts not on EIAEDs &amp;
      450 mg/day for pts on EIAEDs. Starting dose level of dasatinib will be 100 mg once day via
      continuous oral daily dosing. Dasatinib will be increased in successive cohorts of enrolled
      pts. Pts will remain on treatment until excessive toxicity, progressive disease, withdrawal
      of consent/death.

      Pts have confirmed diagnosis of recurrent/progressive WHO gr IV MG / WHO grade III MG. Phase
      I 3+3 dose escalation design w 2 independently escalated stratum: stratum A-pts not on
      CYP3A-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs; stratum B-pts on EIAEDs. Assessment of safety
      will be based mainly on frequency of adverse events, particularly adverse events leading to
      discontinuation of treatment &amp; on number of significant lab abnormalities.

    <description>You will begin study drug regimen on day 1 of cycle 1 w Dasatinib. If you are undergoing Dasatinib pharmacokinetic blood analysis, Dasatinib will be taken alone until initial PK assessments are collected. Erlotinib will be begin after initial Dasatinib PK assessments are collected &amp; will continue to be administered w Dasatinib on continuous daily dosing schedule. Initial Dasatinib PK assessments will be collected over 24hrs between days 3-7 of cycle 1 &amp; at end of cycle 1. If you are not undergoing Dasatinib PK collections you will begin both Dasatinib &amp; Erlotinib together on day 1 of cycle 1. Both drugs will be given in continuous daily oral manner. Cycle is defined as Dasatinib &amp; Erlotinib given daily for 28 days for purpose of scheduling evaluations.</description>
