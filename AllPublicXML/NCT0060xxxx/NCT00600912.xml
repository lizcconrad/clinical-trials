  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipid emulsions are an essential part of parenteral nutrition, both as a part of energy
      supply, and as a source of essential fatty acids. It has been shown that the fatty acid
      composition of cell membranes is influenced by the fatty acid profile of dietary lipids, and
      may therefore be responsible for modulation of immune response. The aim of this study was to
      assess the effects of a new lipid emulsion based ob soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides,
      olive oil and fish oil compared with a lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil on the
      inflammatory response and hepatic function in postoperative intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatty emulsions are an indispensable part of parenteral nutrition, because they deliver
      energy and essential fatty acids. Furthermore, lipids are involved in the structure and
      function of cell membranes and receptors, modifying gene expression, and modulating the
      inflammatory and immune response. In addition, fatty acids are precursors of prostaglandins
      and other eicosanoids and have therefore important metabolic functions.A promising substrate
      in the development of lipid emulsions can be seen in fish oils containing solutions. With
      regard to the current literature, fish oil have a potential benefical influence on the
      pathophysiological response to endotoxins and exert important modulations on eicosanoid and
      cytokine biology.

      However, there are no studies avaibale comparing fish oil containing fatty emulsions to a
      lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil with regard to inflammatory response and
      hepatic function.

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a new lipid emulsion based ob
      soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil and fish oil compared to a lipid emulsion
      based on olive and soybean oil on the inflammatory response and hepatic function in
      postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
