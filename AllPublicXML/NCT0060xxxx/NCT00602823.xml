  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of psoriasis has evolved from epidermal hyperproliferation to immune
      dysregulation in recent years. A Th1 cytokine profile is universally found is psoriasis.
      Biologics targeting the immune system have become the focus of study. Raptiva (Efalizumab) is
      one of biologics indicated for the treatment of psoriasis, and is the first biologic approved
      for use in psoriasis in the EU (EMEA). In USA, it is the second biologic drug (after Amevive)
      for psoriasis. Raptiva is a humanized chimeric antibody of CD11a (LFA-1), which blocks the
      interaction of CD11and ICAM─1, thus preventing lymphocyte trafficking. It is used for
      moderate to severe chronic plaque type psoraisis. The first clinical trial of Raptiva in
      Asians iscurrently done in the department of Dermatology, National Taiwan University Hospital
      and the incidence of psoriatic arthritis (either de novo or aggravation of preexisting
      psoriatic arthritis) is significantly higher than previously reported in Western
      countries（30％ versus 7%，and personal communication with doctors in Hong-Kong and Singapore
      also reveals a similar safety profile. It seems likely that a racial difference is present.
      Monocytes play a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis. It is thus
      intriguing to study the pathogenesis of Raptiva-induced aggravation of psoriatic arthritis by
      comparing the difference of monocyes response in the presence of Raptiva between patients
      with and without Raptiva-induced psoriatic arthritis. In further study, the CD11a genomic
      polymorphism will also be investigated. The suudy can provide us with important information
      on how a novel monoclonal antibody like Raptiva can have both therapeutic and detrimental
      actions on psoriasis. The short term benefit of the study will be in pharmacogenomics and
      pharmacoeconomics, finding the best candidates for the expensive drug. The long term goal
      will be the clarification of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
