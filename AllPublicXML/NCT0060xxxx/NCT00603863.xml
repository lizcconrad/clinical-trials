  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to test whether different doses of 90Y-hPAM4 are safe to give in combination
      with gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated pancreatic cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive a 4-week treatment cycle with once-weekly 30-minute gemcitabine infusions
      beginning one week prior to the first 90Y-hPAM4dose and continuing during the 3 consecutive
      weeks over which once weekly 90Y-hPAM4 doses are given. Depending on toxicity, patient
      cohorts will receive one of several possible 90Y and gemcitabine dose combinations.
      Post-treatment evaluations conducted until instituting another 90YhPAM4 treatment cycle,
      maintenance gemcitabine or for a maximum period of 12 weeks.
