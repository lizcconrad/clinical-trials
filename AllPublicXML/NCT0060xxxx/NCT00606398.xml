  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of combined surgical resection for patients with both intra- and
      extra-hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. The primary objective is to determine the
      two-year disease free survival (DFS) of patients who undergo surgical resection of both
      intra- and extra-hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. The secondary objectives are to
      determine the overall survival rate (OS), patterns of treatment failure, treatment efficacy
      (R0 resection rate), peri-operative morbidity and mortality rates, health related quality of
      life, and hospital length of stay.

    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical study will examine the outcomes of surgical therapy for patients with
      both intra- and extra-hepatic CRC metastases.

      The treatment protocol includes surgical resection of metastases from Colorectal cancer.
      Multi-modality co-interventions such as chemotherapy (neo-adjuvant, or post-operative),
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and/or portal vein embolization (PVE) will be permitted.

      The eligibility criteria include: patients with both intra-hepatic and extra-hepatic
      metastases from colorectal cancer, the number of extra-hepatic metastases must be three or
      less on pre-operative imaging, all metastatic deposits must be resectable with R0 intent,
      there must be no contra-indications to major surgery and an ECOG performance status of 0, 1
      or 2.
