    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the response of adult stems cells, also referred to as
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), to tissue injury resulting from thermal burns. The study will
      consist of a one time collection of a patient's blood, about one teaspoon, on the third day
      following the initial burn. MSCs in the blood will then be quantitated and identified using
      according to unique proteins found on their cell surface using flow cytometry. The results of
      flow cytometry analysis will then be compared to the patients characteristics (age, sex,
      race, etc.), their past medical history (hx of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc.)
      and to the patient outcome (length of hospital stay, mortality, etc.).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic and non-traumatic disease processes result in varying tissue injury that can
      culminate in organ failure and death. Current literature has demonstrated that adult stem
      cells (ASCs) are mobilized into peripheral circulation as a heterogeneous population of cells
      following tissue injury. The significance of this heterogeneity has not yet been defined.
      Other studies have shown ASCs augment tissue repair under appropriate conditions. This
      proposal will begin to elucidate the mechanism of ASC activation, mobilization and
      localization to sites of injury. This study will use flow cytometry to identify subsets of
      ASCs mobilized in response to tissue injury and compare this response to the patient's
      demographics, comorbidities, in hospital morbidities, and mortality. Patients with thermal
      burns will be used as a model of tissue injury given the quantity of tissue injured and the
      robust signal generated from this injury. ASCs are currently being investigated as adjuncts
      to tissue repair involving a host of tissues, including cardiac, neural, and renal. The
      identification of a specific subset of ASCs selectively mobilized in response to tissue
      injury would alter all studies involving ASCs in tissue repair and necessitate the
      identification and targeting of subsets selectively mobilized in response to injury to each
      particular tissue.
