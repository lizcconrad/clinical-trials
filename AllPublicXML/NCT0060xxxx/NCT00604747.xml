      Background: The literature indicates that, in relation to motor learning, healthy subjects
      benefit more from random practice than from constant practice. However, this effect is not
      well known in post-stroke patients. Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the
      effects of practice structure on motor learning in post-stroke patients. Methods:
      Participants included an experimental group (EG) of post-stroke patients: 17 males and
      females; and a control group (CG) of healthy individuals: 17 males and females. At the
      acquisition phase, all participants performed 30 trials of a coincident timing task. Nine
      individuals from each group practiced constantly (C) at a stimulus propagation speed of 3
      mph, and eight from each group practiced randomly (R) at speeds of 2, 3, and 5 mph.
      Subsequent phases included: 1) transfer, 2) retention after 15 minutes, and 3) retention
      after 3 days. Each of these phases included 20 trials: 10 at a speed of 1 mph, and 10 at a
      speed of 4 mph. Intra- and inter-group comparisons were made employing an alpha level of 0.05
      (5%).

      Utilized was Bassin's anticipation timer (Lafayette Instruments #50575), which is comprised
      of a control screen, one 1.52 m gutter with 32 diodes placed on it linearly, and a response
      button. The screen has a digital display, with commands that permit the operator to control
      the stimulus propagation speed and the preparatory interval speed. Once activated, the screen
      exhibits an alert signal, and, after the preparatory interval, it initiates the propagation
      of a luminous stimulus, lighting the 32 diodes successively. The task required participants
      to press the response button simultaneously with the illumination of the last diode. The
      digital display showed the error measure (em): that is, the difference between the
      illumination of the last diode and the response.
