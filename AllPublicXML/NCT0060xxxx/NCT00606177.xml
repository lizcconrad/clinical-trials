      To investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term administration of aripiprazole by
      performing extended administration of the treatment administered in the preceding
      multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group-comparison trial of
      aripiprazole in patients with bipolar disorder experiencing a manic or mixed episode (Study
      031-06-003, hereafter &quot;Study 003&quot;) in a double-blind manner to those patients who complete
      Study 003 and demonstrate drug efficacy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) , Day 154 or at discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>Using LOCF datasets, descriptive statistics of actual values for changes of YMRS total scores from baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) to endpoint (Day 154) was calculated for each treatment group.
YMRS is composed of 11 evaluation items with 5 rating levels each. Items rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (comprising 5 rating levels of one point each) are 1) levated mood, 2) increased motor activity/energy, 3) sexual interest, 4) sleep, 7) language-thought disorder, 10) appearance, and 11) insight. Items rated on a scale of 0 to 8 (comprising 5 rating levels of two points each) are 5) irritability, 6) speech (rate and amount), 8) content, and 9) disruptive-aggressive behavior.
YMRS ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 60 (worst possible outcome).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness (Mania)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 of preceding study), Day 154 or at discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>Using LOCF datasets, descriptive statistics of actual values for change of CGI-BP severity of illness score (mania) from baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) to endpoint (Day 154) were calculated for each treatment group.
CGI-BP severity of illness is a scale for overall evaluation of the severity of bipolar disorder; it comprises 3 components—mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness.
CGI-BP severity of illness score (mania) ranges form 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill).</description>

        <title>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</title>
        <description>Using LOCF datasets, descriptive statistics of actual values for changes of YMRS total scores from baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) to endpoint (Day 154) was calculated for each treatment group.
YMRS is composed of 11 evaluation items with 5 rating levels each. Items rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (comprising 5 rating levels of one point each) are 1) levated mood, 2) increased motor activity/energy, 3) sexual interest, 4) sleep, 7) language-thought disorder, 10) appearance, and 11) insight. Items rated on a scale of 0 to 8 (comprising 5 rating levels of two points each) are 5) irritability, 6) speech (rate and amount), 8) content, and 9) disruptive-aggressive behavior.
YMRS ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 60 (worst possible outcome).</description>
