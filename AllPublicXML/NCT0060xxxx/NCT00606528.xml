  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess whether a recently-developed bioassay for the
      protein FGL2 can be used to predict the progression and/or response to treatment of Hepatitis
      C Virus disease in patients with chronic HCV infection. The hypothesis is that increased
      levels of FGL2 and increased numbers of T regulatory cells are associated with a failure to
      respond to treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current therapy for chronic Hepatitis C Virus infection leads to a sustained viral
      response in only 50% of treated patients. Evidence suggests that a poor response to treatment
      may be the result of a dysfunction of immunoregulatory mediators including T regulatory cells
      (Tregs) which secrete FGL2. The aim of this study is to test whether serum FGL2 levels can
      serve as a biomarker for clinical progress and treatment response in patients undergoing
      anti-viral therapy for chronic HCV infection.

      This study will measure the blood Treg and FGL2 levels of patients with chronic Hepatitis C
      as they undergo antiviral therapy and will compare those levels to their pre-treatment and
      post-treatment levels. Treg and FGL2 expression levels will also be measured in patients'
      liver biopsy tissue when available.

      Additionally, this study will examine the main form(s)of Fc Receptor expressed in these
      patients. The Fc receptor is the hypothesized binding partner of FGL2, and the form expressed
      in a given patient may determine the downstream effects of FGL2's binding. These data along
      with clinical, biochemical and virological data will be used to determine whether there is a
      correlation between FGL2 levels and disease outcome and/or treatment response.

      The study will also recruit a group of normal healthy volunteers to give blood samples on two
      occasions so that the baseline range of FGL2 levels in healthy individuals can be established
      for comparison.
