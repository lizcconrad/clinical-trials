    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single-arm, multi-center study, with a safety review component, designed
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab in approximately 44 patients with
      recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) following one previous regimen for their
      disease. Patients must be diagnosed with radiologically verified recurrent diffuse intrinsic
      pontine glioma that is measurable in at least two dimensions. Patients are eligible without
      histologic confirmation. Treatment regimen will consist of two phases-induction and
      consolidation.
