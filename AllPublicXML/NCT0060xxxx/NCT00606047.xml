  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoroacetabular hip impingement syndrome is a newly recognized cause of early arthritis of
      the hip. In this condition a variation in the shape of the upper thigh bone causes it to
      repeatedly come in contact with the hip socket leading to cartilage damage and arthritis. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate whether patients without hip pain have variations at
      the hip joint such as those seen in hip impingement syndrome.

      Participation in this study will involve coming to the hospital after regular work hours for
      an MRI of the hip joints. Arrangements will be made to cover the cost of parking on the day
      of your MRI. Prior to your MRI, a physician will check how your hip moves. The MRI will take
      approximately 20 minutes during which you will have to lie still in a closed space. You will
      receive a letter which can be forwarded to your family doctor if your MRI has any abnormal
      findings including signs of hip impingement.
