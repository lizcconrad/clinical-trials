      The purpose of this research study is to determine if omiganan 1% gel (the investigational
      medication in this research study) is effective and safe when compared to chlorhexidine 2%
      (an FDA approved medication) for killing bacteria (germs) that live on the surface of the
      skin. Both of the study medications are applied topically (on the surface of the skin).

      The study is comprised of 2 parts with approximately 20 subjects participating in each part.

      Subjects eligible for Part 1 will have omiganan 1 % gel applied to 6 sites across the chest
      and/or abdomen and chlorhexidine 2% solution will be applied to 6 matching sites on the
      contralateral side.

      Subjects eligible for Part 2 will each have omiganan 1% gel applied to 6 sites across the
      upper chest or abdomen.In addition,subjects in Part 2 will have 2 peripheral catheters
      inserted, one in each arm.One catheter insertion site will be treated with omiganan 1% gel
      (following treatment with isopropyl alcohol) and the other site will be treated with
      chlorhexidine 2%/isopropyl alcohol.
