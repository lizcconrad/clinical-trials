  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer genetic counseling (CGC) has been found to have &quot;substantial&quot; benefits for individuals
      with breast cancer and their family members; it has been deemed by multiple organizations as
      &quot;standard of care&quot; for women with breast cancer and their relatives. Unfortunately, there is
      a disparity in access to CGC, especially among women who live in rural and underserved areas.
      In North Carolina, only two cancer genetic counselors practice in rural clinics - each only
      for a few days per month. Therefore, in an effort to make CGC more widely available in a
      timely manner, we propose to test provision of counseling through telemedicine (TM), in which
      a patient and health care provider communicate with each other using videoconferencing. In 4
      rural oncology clinics, we will implement low-cost TM and compare satisfaction and
      cost-effectiveness between groups of women designated to have their CGC session by TM or FTF.
      We'll use a validated measure to assess satisfaction by a phone survey one week after the CGC
      appointment; cost-effectiveness will be measured at project's end by calculating length of
      wait time for appointment and costs of equipment, labor, and mileage. Study hypothesis: TM is
      as satisfactory as FTF counseling and is a more cost-effective way to provide this beneficial
      service.
