      Rationale: Bladder tumours are often not visible on X-ray based image-modalities during
      planning and treatment of Radiotherapy.

      Purpose: To determine if a single contrast (Lipiodol) demarcation of the bladder tumour
      before treatment is feasible and visible on multiple X-ray based image-modalities during
      Radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To exploit the potential of modern Radiotherapy (RT), it is important to localize and follow
      the target precisely during treatment. Since the bladder tumour can usually not be identified
      on conventional CT-scan, a fiducial or contrast marking system is warranted.

      The iodized oil, Lipiodol is a well-known contrast media used mainly for lymphography and
      Hysterosalpingography. Local Lipiodol demarcation has been used for localisation of tumours
      in the lung, prostate and seminal vesicles visualised on Computed Tomography (CT) and
      fluoroscopy.

      Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of tumour demarcation using the contrast agent Lipiodol
      in adaptive Image-guided RT of bladder cancer. Visibility on CT, Cone-Beam CT, MRI and
      on-board imaging will be evaluated.

    <description>1-3 drops of Lipiodol Ultra Fluid (iodine 38%W/W) will be injected into the submucosa on 4 locations around the bladder tumour. The procedure is done once during a planned cystoscopy approximately a week before the planning CT.</description>
