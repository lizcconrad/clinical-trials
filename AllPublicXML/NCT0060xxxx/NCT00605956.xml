    <textblock>
      Photoallergic reactions are assumed to be due to a delayed cell-mediated hypersensitivity
      response that requires the presence of ultraviolet irradiation. The predictive procedure is,
      therefore, based on modification of the Repeated Insult Patch Test (Kaidbey, 1991). Duplicate
      sets of patches of test articles are used with exposure of only one set to UV radiation and
      subsequent evaluation of both sets for skin reactions in order to compare irradiated versus
      non-irradiated test sites.

      The study consists of of following phases: screening, induction, rest, challenge, and
      re-challenge (if necessary). The study will be conducted as a randomized, evaluator-blind
      test design.
