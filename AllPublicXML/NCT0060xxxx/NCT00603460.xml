    <textblock>
      Subjects with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma or primary peritoneal cancer, who have
      previously undergone vaccination in clinical study UPCC-11807 with DCVax-L, an autologous
      vaccine with DC loaded in vitro with autologous tumor lysate.

      Phase I Subjects enrolled in this study will receive leukapheresis; followed by
      cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-induced lymphodepletion; followed by adoptive transfer of ex
      vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated vaccine-primed peripheral blood autologous T cells; followed by a
      single DCVax-L vaccination, to establish feasibility and safety of this approach.

      Primary Objectives of Phase I

      To determine the feasibility and safety of administering vaccine-primed, ex vivo
      CD3/CD28-costimulated autologous peripheral blood T cells in combination with DCVax-L
      vaccination, following lymphodepletion with high dose cyclophosphamide/fludarabine.

      Phase II

      Twenty-two additional subjects will be randomized to receive either:

        -  ARM-IIA: maintenance DCVax-L vaccination, in combination with oral metronomic
           cyclophosphamide, or

        -  ARM-IIB: leukapheresis, followed by cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-induced
           lymphodepletion, followed by adoptive transfer of ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated
           vaccine-primed peripheral blood autologous T cells, followed by maintenance DCVax-L
           vaccination, plus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide.

      Primary Objective of Phase II

      To assess the distribution of progression-free survival at 6 months for patients treated with
      maintenance DCVax-L vaccination plus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide as well as patients
      treated with ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated vaccine-primed peripheral blood autologous T cells
      after lymphodepletion with high dose cyclophosphamide / fludarabine, followed by DCVax-L
      boost vaccination and metronomic oral cyclophosphamide.

      Description of treatment for Phase I:

        -  Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration
           of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

        -  If subjects have not received DCVax-L vaccination within the last 3-4 weeks, and if
           DCVax-L is available, subjects have the option of receiving one dose of DCVax-L after
           enrolment, to boost the frequency of vaccine-primed T cells.

        -  Subjects will receive a single course of outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
           intravenous cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/d for 3 days) and intravenous fludarabine (30
           mg/m2/d for 3 days) both administered on days 8 to 10.

        -  Ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated lymphocytes will be infused ~2 days after last day of
           fludarabine infusion.

        -  Patients will receive DCVax-L vaccine ~24-48 hrs after T cell infusion.

        -  Subjects will be contacted every 6 months for 5 years for survival.

      Description of treatment for Phase II:

      In ARM-IIA:

        -  Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration
           of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

        -  Subjects will receive intradermal vaccinations with DCVax-L every 8 weeks, for four
           cycles total. The first vaccine will be administered on day 0, which can be no sooner
           than 4 weeks from previous DCVax-L vaccination related to clinical study UPCC-11807.

        -  Subjects will receive oral cyclophosphamide at metronomic schedule and dose (50 mg
           daily) every other week, starting ~3 weeks after DCVax-L in every vaccine cycle.

        -  Patients will be offered (with the right to refuse) CT-guided needle biopsy or needle
           aspiration of malignant effusion after the second vaccine.

      In ARM-IIB:

        -  Patients will be offered, if medically indicated, tumor resection or needle aspiration
           of malignant effusion in order to make additional doses of DCVax-L vaccine.

        -  Subjects will undergo ~10-15 liter leukapheresis to derive vaccine-primed peripheral
           blood lymphocytes (PBL) on day 0. The apheresis material will be transferred to the Cell
           and Vaccine Facility at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn CVPF) for T cell
           manufacturing.

        -  If subjects have not received DCVax-L vaccination within the last 3-4 weeks, and if
           DCVax-L is available, subjects have the option of receiving one dose of DCVax-L after
           enrolment, to boost the frequency of vaccine-primed T cells.

        -  Subjects will receive a single course of outpatient lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
           intravenous cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/d for 3 days) and intravenous fludarabine (30
           mg/m2/d for 3 days).

        -  Ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated lymphocytes will be infused ~2 days after last day of
           fludarabine infusion.

        -  Patients will receive DCVax-L vaccine boosts every 8 weeks for a total of four vaccines.
           The first DCVax-L will be given ~24-48 hrs after T cell infusion.

        -  Following DCVax-L, subjects will receive oral cyclophosphamide at metronomic schedule
           and dose (50 mg daily) every other week x 3 cycles, starting ~3 weeks after DCVax-L in
           every vaccine cycle.

        -  Patients will be offered (with the right to refuse) CT-guided needle biopsy or needle
           aspiration of malignant effusion ~1-2 weeks after the second vaccine
