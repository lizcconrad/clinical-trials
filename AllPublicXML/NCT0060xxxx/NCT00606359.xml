      Primary Objective:

      To describe the immunogenicity of an injection of the investigational inactivated,
      split-virion influenza vaccine 21 days after vaccination in 18 to 60 years old renal
      transplant subjects identified as non-responder to previous vaccination with the IM reference
      vaccine (Vaxigrip®).

      Secondary Objective:

      To describe the safety of an injection of the investigational inactivated, split-virion
      influenza vaccine in 18 to 60 years old renal transplant subjects identified as non-responder
      to previous vaccination with the IM reference vaccine

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in renal transplant subjects aged 18
      to 60 years who are non-responders to vaccination with the reference vaccine. Subjects will
      be randomized to receive either the 2007-2008 15 µg investigational vaccine or the 2007-2008
      IM reference vaccine.
