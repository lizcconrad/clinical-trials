  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      radiation therapy together with cisplatin and fluorouracil may kill more tumor cells. It is
      not yet known whether radiation therapy and cisplatin are more effective with or without
      fluorouracil in treating patients with head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and cisplatin to
      compare how well they work with or without fluorouracil in treating patients with stage III
      or stage IV head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To compare the relapse-free survival of patients treated with radiotherapy and cisplatin
           with vs without fluorouracil.

        -  To compare the overall survival, local control without surgery, and patterns of failure
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To compare the acute and long-term toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To prospectively collect biopsy material, mucosal scrapings, and serum in an effort to
           generate hypotheses for future correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy
      schedule (once daily vs twice daily) and radiotherapy planning (2D vs 3D vs
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo full-dose radiotherapy once or twice daily 5 days a week for up
           to 7 weeks and receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22, and 43 of radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I and receive fluorouracil IV and
           cisplatin IV continuously on days 1-4 and 22-25 of radiotherapy.

      Patients with biopsy-verified residual disease at the primary site or local recurrence after
      achieving a complete response to chemoradiotherapy may undergo salvage surgery 12 weeks after
      the completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients complete questionnaires periodically to assess late toxicity and quality of life.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

    <description>Patients with any new evidence of cancer after achieving a complete response are considered to have recurrent disease.

Disease recurrence will be characterized as either local, regional(nodal) or distant recurrence. Patients may have more than one kind of recurrence.</description>

    <description>Twelve weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy, a formal evaluation for response will be made, to include a careful evaluation by the head and neck surgeon, medical and radiation oncologists, and, as appropriate, a radiologic and an endoscopic examination. Patients will be considered to have achieved either a clinical complete response (i.e. complete disappearance of all clinically and radiologically detectable tumor) or to have clinical persistent disease.</description>

    <description>A Pathological, or final response will be assigned to subjects after any salvage surgery is performed for clinical persistent disease, and after planned neck dissection in those achieving a clinical complete response. If no surgery is performed after chemoradiotherapy, the clinical and pathological (final) response will be the same. Patient will be coded as having either a pathologic complete response, or as having pathologic persistent disease. A pathologic complete response will be defined as the total disappearance of all clinically and radiologically detectable tumor.</description>
