      This study will measure antibody levels in the blood of people with bleeding or swelling in
      the retina who have or have not been treated with bevacizumab (Avastin[Trademark]or
      ranibizumab (Lucentis[Trademark]). These drugs have been useful in reducing retinal bleeding
      and swelling in people with eye diseases that cause these symptoms, but the drugs' effects
      usually wear off and they have to be given repeatedly. In some patients, the benefits become
      less and less. It is possible that over time, patients taking these drugs may produce
      antibodies that act against the drugs, thus neutralizing their effects and preventing them
      from working properly.

      People 18 year of age and older who are participating in a current NEI protocol and meet the
      following criteria may be eligible for this study:

        -  Are receiving injections of bevacizumab or ranibizumab for bleeding or swelling in the
           retina, but the treatment is becoming less effective

        -  Are receiving injections of bevacizumab or ranibizumab for bleeding or swelling in the
           retina and the treatment is still effective

        -  Have bleeding or swelling in the retina, but have never received either bevacizumab or
           ranibizumab

      Participants have blood samples drawn once when they start the study, once in the middle of
      the study, and once at the end of the study. They are asked permission for study researchers
      to review the results of their eye examinations at NIH.

      Objective

      Over the past two years, the field of ophthalmology has witnessed a dramatic paradigm shift
      in the treatment of exudative and hemorrhagic diseases affecting the retina. This has been
      due largely to the introduction of two agents, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, into the clinical
      setting. These agents are humanized monoclonal antibodies which target vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF). We have observed that, in some patients, a diminished response to these
      agents occurs with time. One possible explanation for this is the emergence of neutralizing
      antibodies in patients who have become refractory to bevacizumab or ranibizumab.

      Study Population

      We will recruit patients from the National Eye Institute (NEI) who are currently receiving
      treatment with bevacizumab or ranibizumab for various exudative or hemorrhagic disease of the
      retina. We will also recruit patients with recently diagnosed exudative or hemorrhagic
      disease of the retina who are na ve to these medications and are going to be treated with
      them.

      Design

      This will be a prospective, observational study.

      Outcome Measures

      The main outcome measure will be the titer of neutralizing antibodies which is measured in
      patient sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This will be compared between
      three groups of patients: 1) 10 patients treated with long term (greater than 1 year)
      bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab in which decreased drug efficacy has been documented; 2) 10
      patients treated with long term (greater than one year) bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab in
      which decreased drug efficacy has not been documented; and 3) 10 patients who are na ve to
      treatment with bevacizumab and ranibizumab.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subjects will include adults being treated for exudative AMD, or macular edema
             secondary to DR or venous occlusion. The 3 clinical categories, which will each be
             composed of 10 subjects, are:

               1. Category 1: Patients treated with long term (greater than 1 year) with
                  bevacizumab or ranibizumab in which decreased drug efficacy has been documented.
                  They must have received at least one treatment in the prior 3 months.

                  Decreased drug efficacy will be defined as follows: Presence of a therapeutic
                  response (reduction in macula fluid as determined by optical coherence tomography
                  (OCT) or reduction in extent of leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA)) in the
                  first 3 injections, followed by a subsequent decrease in response as evidenced by
                  persistence of intraretinal cysts and/or subretinal fluid on OCT and/or leakage
                  on fluorescein angiography (FA).

               2. Category 2: Patients treated with long term (greater than 1 year) bevacizumab or
                  ranibizumab in which decreased drug efficacy has not been documented. They must
                  have received at least one treatment in the prior 3 months.

                  The presence of continued drug efficacy will be defined as follows: Patients who
                  are being treated with bevacizumab or ranibizumab and are demonstrating a good
                  clinical response as demonstrated by the presence of a fluid-free macula on OCT
                  and/or the absence of leakage on FA after treatment.

               3. Category 3: Patients who are na ve to treatment with bevacizumab and ranibizumab

        When possible, patients in the 3 categories will be matched by underlying retinal disease
        type, race, gender, and age.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients in the following categories will be excluded from participating in this study:

          1. Patients who are currently receiving any form of systemic immunosuppressive or
             immunomodulatory therapy, including corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive medication
             could lower the titers of neutralizing that are present in a given patient, and this
             could give the false impression that such a patient has little to no immune response
             against bevacizumab or ranibizumab.

          2. Patients who have autoimmune or rheumatologic disease. Patients with autoimmune
             diseases tend to have various autoantibodies in their serum. These naturally present
             autoantibodies in this patient group could cross-react with bevacizumab or
             ranibizumab. This would give the false impression that these patients have developed
             neutralizing antibodies against bevacizumab or ranibizumab, when in fact these
             naturally occurring cross-reactive autoantibodies were present in the patient all
             along and are not related to bevacizumab or ranibizumab exposure.

          3. Patients with evidence of active systemic infection. Patients with active systemic
             infection could have various antibodies in the serum, and some of these could
             cross-react with bevacizumab or ranibizumab. This would give the false impression that
             these patients have developed neutralizing antibodies against bevacizumab or
             ranibizumab, when in fact these cross-reactive antibodies were present in the patient
             secondary to the presence of active systemic infection and are not related to
             bevacizumab or ranibizumab.
