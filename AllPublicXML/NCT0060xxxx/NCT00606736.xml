  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the occurrence of idiopathic right
      ventricular outflow tract(RVOT) arrhythmia is relative to sex hormone levels in different
      stages of female menstrual cycle

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The predilection site of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia is right ventricular outflow tract
      ,which is called idiopathic RVOT arrhythmia , a retrospective study reported the females are
      susceptibility to this kind of arrhythmia and another questionaire survey of triggers for
      RVOT-VT initiation indicated that women have RVOT-A initiation with recognized states of sex
      hormonal flux , but few researches were made to study the exact relation between this kind of
      arrhythmia and sex hormone levels, this is the aim of our study .40 females with regular
      menses(20 females with RVOT arrhythmia ,20 healthy volunteers) will be screened, the
      Participants will undergo ECG monitoring and their blood samples will be collected at various
      times throughout the study.
