    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and efficacy of long-term administration of aripiprazole by performing
      extended administration of aripiprazole in combination with mood stabilizer (lithium or
      valproate) in an unblinded manner to those patients who completed the preceding multicenter,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group-comparison trial of aripiprazole in patients
      with bipolar disorder experiencing a manic or mixed episode (Study 031-06-003, hereafter
      &quot;Study 003&quot;) but whose condition worsened or remained unchanged or who discontinued Study 003
      between Day 14 and Day 21 due to lack of drug efficacy.

    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (Day 1 of preceding study), Day 154 or at discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>YMRS is composed of 11 evaluation items with 5 rating levels each. Items rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (comprising 5 rating levels of one point each) are 1) levated mood, 2) increased motor activity/energy, 3) sexual interest, 4) sleep, 7) language-thought disorder, 10) appearance, and 11) insight. Items rated on a scale of 0 to 8 (comprising 5 rating levels of two points each) are 5) irritability, 6) speech (rate and amount), 8) content, and 9) disruptive-aggressive behavior. YMRS ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 60 (worst possible outcome). Using LOCF datasets, descriptive statistics of actual values for changes of YMRS total scores from baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) to endpoint (Day 154) was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Bipolar Version (CGI-BP) Severity of Illness (Mania)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) , Day 154 or at discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-BP severity of illness is a scale for overall evaluation of the severity of bipolar disorder; it comprises 3 componentsâ€”mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness. CGI-BP severity of illness score (mania) ranges form 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill).
Using LOCF datasets, descriptive statistics of actual values for change of CGI-BP severity of illness score (mania) from baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) to endpoint (Day 154) was calculated for each treatment group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Trial subjects will be men and women of age 18 or above and below the age of 65 who

             have signed the informed consent form based on a full understanding of the trial.

          -  Subjects who meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for manic or mixed episodes and have been
             diagnosed as having &quot;296.4x Bipolar I Disorder in which the most recent episode was
             manic&quot; or &quot;296.6x Bipolar I Disorder in which the most recent episode was mixed&quot;

          -  Subjects who were enrolled in and have completed or withdrawn from Study 003 and who
             meet the following criteria

               -  Subjects who show exacerbation of condition or no change in condition: Those
                  subjects who completed Study 003, and whose score for CGI-BP Change from
                  preceding phase (mania) on Day 21 (completion of Study 003) was between 5
                  (Minimally worse) and 7 (Very much worse) (subjects showing exacerbation of
                  condition), or whose score was 4 (No change) (subjects showing no change in
                  condition)

               -  Subjects who discontinued due to lack of drug efficacy: Those subjects who

        <title>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</title>
        <description>YMRS is composed of 11 evaluation items with 5 rating levels each. Items rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (comprising 5 rating levels of one point each) are 1) levated mood, 2) increased motor activity/energy, 3) sexual interest, 4) sleep, 7) language-thought disorder, 10) appearance, and 11) insight. Items rated on a scale of 0 to 8 (comprising 5 rating levels of two points each) are 5) irritability, 6) speech (rate and amount), 8) content, and 9) disruptive-aggressive behavior. YMRS ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 60 (worst possible outcome). Using LOCF datasets, descriptive statistics of actual values for changes of YMRS total scores from baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) to endpoint (Day 154) was calculated.</description>

        <description>CGI-BP severity of illness is a scale for overall evaluation of the severity of bipolar disorder; it comprises 3 componentsâ€”mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness. CGI-BP severity of illness score (mania) ranges form 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill).
Using LOCF datasets, descriptive statistics of actual values for change of CGI-BP severity of illness score (mania) from baseline (Day 1 of preceding study) to endpoint (Day 154) was calculated for each treatment group.</description>
