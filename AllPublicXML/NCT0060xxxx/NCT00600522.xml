    <textblock>
      Major hepatectomies have not negligible morbidity and mortality. However, when tumors invade
      middle hepatic vein (MHV) at caval confluence major surgery is usually recommended.
      Ultrasound-guided hepatectomy might allow conservative approaches. We prospectively check its
      feasibility in a series of patients carriers of tumors invading the MHV at the caval
      confluence.

    <textblock>
      Major hepatectomies have not negligible morbidity and mortality. However, when tumors invade
      middle hepatic vein (MHV) at caval confluence trisectionectomy (TS) is generally performed,
      and central hepatectomy or mesohepatectomy (MH) (Segments 4, 5 and 8), is considered by some
      authors to be the conservative alternative to the previously cited approach. Between these
      two surgical interventions there is not, up to now, any evidence that one of them should be
      clearly preferred; anyway both are mojor resections. We previously reported that a surgical
      approach based on ultrasound-guided hepatectomy might minimize the need for major resection,
      whose rates of morbidity and mortality are not negligible. This policy could be useful also
      for disclosing new, more conservative, and better tolerated approaches for tumors invading
      the MHV at caval confluence in alternative to MH and TS. This study analyses the feasibility,
      safety and effectiveness of ultrasound-guided resections applied to these patients enrolled
      prospectively from a cohort of consecutive patients who undergo hepatectomy for tumors.

    <description>After laparotomy and staging by intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS), anterior surface of the hepatocaval confluence is exposed. Than, compression by means of the surgeon's finger-tip is applied at the MHV caval confluence verifying at color-Doppler IOUS the disappearance of the blood flow in the MHV or its inversion. Then, MHV clamping itself is carried out, and parenchymal sparing resection would be selected if at least one of these 3 findings is confirmed:
Reversal color-Doppler IOUS flow direction in the peripheral portion of the MHV, which suggests the drainage through collateral circulation in the RHV/LHV depending on the side of the MHV branch with reversal flow.
Detectable shunting collaterals at color-Doppler IOUS with RHV or LHV.
Hepatopetal flow in P5-8 and/or P4inf portal branches. If none of these finding is confirmed and in particular hepatofugal flow direction in the P5-8 and/or P4 inf is detected the hepatectomy has to be extended.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients carriers of HCC or colorectal cancer liver metastases (CLM) who have
             macroscopic signs of vascular invasion (preoperative imaging and/IOUS) of the MHV
             close to the hepato-caval confluence (within 4 cm) demanding for that MHV resection.

        Minimum follow-up for patients' inclusion was established at 6-months from surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients carriers of tumors occupying entirely the right paramedian section and the
             segment 4, for whom at least a MH would have been compulsorily carried out.
