  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug Courts were developed as a therapeutic alternative to incarceration of drug-involved
      offenders by providing 'judicially supervised' drug abuse treatment and probation for
      nonviolent offenders in lieu of criminal prosecution and incarceration. Outcome studies have
      shown that drug courts have modest effects on participation in drug abuse treatment, drug
      use, and employment. The Therapeutic Workplace intervention is an effective employment-based
      treatment that integrates abstinence reinforcement contingencies in a work setting, intended
      to treat individuals with histories of drug addiction and chronic unemployment. Under this
      intervention, drug abuse patients are hired and paid to work. To promote abstinence, patients
      are required to provide drug-free urine samples to gain and maintain daily access in the
      workplace. In this way, patients can work and earn salary, but only as long as they remain
      drug abstinent. Patients using drugs and lacking job skills participate in an initial
      training phase to initiate abstinence and establish computer data entry skills. Once
      abstinent and skilled, patients are hired into an income-producing Therapeutic Workplace data
      entry business. Given that many drug court participants suffer from long histories of drug
      addiction and unemployment, the Therapeutic Workplace could be ideal for this population.
      This proposes of this clinical trial is to evaluate the Therapeutic Workplace intervention in
      a Drug Court.
