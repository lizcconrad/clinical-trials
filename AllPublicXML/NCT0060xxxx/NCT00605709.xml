      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of pharmaceutical
      compound 31510 in a topical cream when applied to in situ cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
      and to obtain preliminary efficacy data for the treatment of in situ cutaneous squamous cell
      carcinoma by Compound 31510 topical cream.
