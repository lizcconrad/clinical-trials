  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitral regurgitation (MR), also known as mitral insufficiency, is a condition in which the
      heart's mitral valve, located between two of the heart's main chambers, does not firmly shut,
      allowing blood to leak backwards within the heart. Improper functioning of the mitral valve
      disrupts the proper flow of blood through the body, resulting in shortness of breath and
      fatigue. When mild, MR may not pose a significant danger to a person's health, but severe MR
      may be associated with serious complications, such as heart failure, irregular heart rhythm,
      and high blood pressure. Although there are treatments for MR, including medication and
      surgery, more information is needed on the effectiveness of these treatments in people with
      significant MR. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of corrective surgery
      added to optimal medical treatment (OMT) versus OMT alone in treating people with significant
      MR caused by an enlarged heart.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that approximately 4 out of 10 people with an enlarged heart due to heart
      failure develop MR, referred to as secondary MR. This type of MR is caused by enlargement of
      the left ventricle (LV), one of the heart's main chambers. In turn, the enlargement leads to
      stretching of certain heart muscles around the mitral valve and of the valve itself. Symptoms
      of secondary MR may include shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, swollen feet, cough, and
      heart palpitations. Mitral valve repair or replacement surgery is sometimes considered as a
      treatment option to restore proper heart function in people with secondary MR. Surgical
      repair with placement of an artificial ring around the mitral valve can help to tighten the
      valve and add benefit to non-surgical treatments for MR. However, although surgical placement
      of the ring improves mitral valve function in most people, it is not known whether this
      surgery helps people live longer and healthier lives. This study will compare the safety and
      effectiveness of surgical mitral valvuloplasty with placement of an annular ring (SMVR) added
      to optimal medical treatment (OMT) versus OMT alone in non-ischemic heart failure patients
      with significant secondary MR.

      Participation from baseline through follow-up in this study will last 18 months. All
      potential participants will initially undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram to confirm the
      presence of an abnormal mitral valve. Eligible participants will then undergo a number of
      baseline tests, which will include cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing, a chest wall
      echocardiogram, blood draw, 6-minute walk test, medical questionnaires, and a physical exam.
      Next, participants will be randomly assigned to receive immediate open heart surgery with the
      placement of a mitral valve ring, delayed surgery at least 18 months later, or OMT.
      Participants assigned to receive immediate surgery will undergo the surgery 2 weeks after
      baseline testing. Participants assigned to receive OMT will receive treatment with any of the
      following medication regimens: combination of vasodilator therapy and diuretics, nitrates and
      nifedipine, and beta-adrenergic blocker therapy. Follow-up visits for all participants will
      occur at Months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 and will include repeat baseline testing. Long-term
      survival status data may be collected beyond 18 months for some participants.

    <description>Participants will undergo open heart surgery to mechanically reduce mitral regurgitation (MR). A complete rigid or semi-rigid annular ring will be placed unless specifically contraindicated by intraoperative findings. The ring size will be between 24 mm and 27 mm in the anteroposterior diameter. Annular ring sutures will be placed circumferentially approximately 1 mm off the hinge point between the leaflet and the atrial tissue. The total number of sutures will vary between 4 and 7 sutures anteriorly, while 8 to 12 sutures will be utilized for the posterior segment of the annulus. Additional repair of the mitral apparatus itself will be based on intraoperative findings. Leaflet repair will be performed for significant prolapse. Submitral apparatus repair will be performed for ruptured or significantly elongated chordae as well as significant chordal tethering.</description>

Optimal medical therapy (OMT): Optimal medical therapy can include, but is not limited to, any of the following treatment regimens: combination of vasodilator therapy and diuretics, nitrates and nifedipine, and beta-adrenergic blocker therapy.</description>
