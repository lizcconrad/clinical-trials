  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this surveillance is to collect information for panic disorder patients
      about 1) adverse drug reactions not expected from the LPD (unknown adverse drug reactions),
      2) the incidence of adverse drug reactions in this surveillance, and 3) factors considered to
      affect the safety and/or efficacy of this drug.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with panic disorder to whom an investigator prescribes the first sertraline
      hydrochloride should be registered consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target
      number in order to extract patients enrolled into the investigation at random.
