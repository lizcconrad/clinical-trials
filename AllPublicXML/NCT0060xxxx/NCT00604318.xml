  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate quality of life in patients after 10 days pause of thyroid medication
      (Liothyronine) compared to treatment with recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) before radioiodine
      uptake and treatment in a double-blinded, randomised cross-over design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a thyroid follicular or papillary cancer referred to radioiodine treatment in
      oncological department . The patients after thyroidectomy will be treated with Liothyronine
      and this treatment will be paused 10 days before radioiodine. As a routine these patients
      will be re-evaluated with iodine uptake 4 months later.

      The patients will be randomised to either T3 pause related to the first radioiodine treatment
      and Thyrogen injection (recombinant TSH) related to the second treatment/uptake - or Thyrogen
      related to the first treatment and T3 pause related to the second treatment /uptake.

      All medication given in the 10 days period right before radioiodine treatment/uptake will be
      delivered to the patients and marked with a protocol number. In the period with T3 pause the
      patients will be given placebo tablets and an injection of saline (instead of Thyrogen)
      before treatment/uptake at the similar time as given the Thyrogen injection. A nurse
      otherwise not involved in the study will give the injection.

      Patients will be evaluated by VAS, SF-36, and Eortc QLC30 (version 2.0) before radioiodine
      treatment and 3 weeks after treatment.
