  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects (effectiveness and safety) of an
      intranasal corticosteroid (fluticasone furoate nasal spray [FFNS]), with a placebo nasal
      spray for the treatment of perennial (year-round) allergic rhinitis.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline Over the Entire Treatment Period in Daily Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily; Baseline through End of Study (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS is the sum of symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing (each scored on a scale of 0 [none] to 3 [severe]; total possible score of 0 to 12). The rTNSS (performed in the morning [AM] and evening [PM]) was a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The daily rTNSS was the average of the AM rTNSS and PM rTNSS assessments. Change from baseline is calculated as the score at the end of study minus the score at baseline.</description>

        <description>The AM, pre-dose iTNSS is the sum of the 4 individual nasal symptom score assessments for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing performed at the moment immediately prior to taking the daily dose; each symptom is scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Change from baseline is calculated as the score over the entire treatment period minus the score at baseline. TNSS: Total possible score ranges from 0 to 12.</description>

        <description>TNSS is the sum of symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing (each scored on a scale of 0 [none] to 3 [severe]; total possible score of 0 to 12). The rTNSS (performed in the morning [AM] and evening [PM]) was a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The daily rTNSS was the average of the AM rTNSS and PM rTNSS assessments. Change from baseline is calculated as the score at the end of study minus the score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Total Nasal Symptoms: Mean Change From Baseline Over the Entire Treatment Period in AM rTNSS</title>
        <description>TNSS = the sum of symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing (each scored on a scale of 0 [none] to 3 [severe]; total possible score of 0 to 12). The rTNSS (performed in the morning [AM] and evening [PM]) is a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours. Change from baseline is calculated as the score at the end of study minus the score at baseline.</description>

        <description>The rTOSS is a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hrs. and was performed in the AM (AM rTOSS) and PM (PM rTOSS). Each symptom is scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), with a total possible score of 0 to 9. Change from baseline is calculated as the score at the end of study minus the score at baseline.</description>

Each question is scored from 0 (not impaired at all) to 6 (severely impaired), with higher scores indicating more impairment on quality of life. RQLQ(S): Possible score ranges from 0 to 6.
