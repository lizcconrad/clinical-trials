    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and immunogenicity of a GSK Biologicals' candidate TB
      vaccine administered at 0, 1 months to healthy adults living in a TB-endemic region. The
      Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the Investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  A male or female between, and including, 21 and 40 years of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to any study procedure.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before enrolment into the study.

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, or if she is of
             childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to
             vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for 2 months
             after completion of the vaccination series.

          -  No evidence of pulmonary pathology as confirmed by chest X-ray.

          -  Clinically normal laboratory values for creatinine, ALT, AST and complete blood count.

          -  Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1).

          -  No history of extrapulmonary TB.

          -  Subjects must have the appropriate PPD skin reactivity (induration measured at 48 to
             72 hours after PPD skin test administration).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of vaccine, or planned use
             during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6
             months prior to the first vaccine dose.

          -  History of previous administration of experimental Mycobacterium tuberculosis
             vaccines.

          -  History of previous exposure to experimental products containing MPL or QS21.

          -  Administration of any immunoglobulins, any immunotherapy and/or any blood products
             within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccination, or planned
             administrations during the study period.

          -  Participation in another experimental protocol during the study period.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency. Subjects who describe a
             first-degree relative with clearly documented autoimmune disease will be excluded

          -  History of any acute or chronic illness or medication that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the
             vaccine.

          -  Any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period, with the exception
             of vitamins and/or dietary supplements, birth control pills, anti-histamines for
             seasonal allergies, SSRIs.

          -  History of any neurologic disorders or seizures.

          -  History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to previous immunisations.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse which in the investigators
             opinion would put the subject at risk.

          -  Major congenital defects.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive
