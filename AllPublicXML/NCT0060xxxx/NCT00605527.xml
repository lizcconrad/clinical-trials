    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI)/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung condition
      that causes respiratory failure. This study will examine if differences in genes and
      biomarkers involved in the blood clotting process may affect the severity of and recovery
      from ALI/ARDS in children hospitalized with the condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALI/ARDS is a life-threatening condition that involves inflammation of the lungs and fluid
      accumulation in the air sacs, which leads to low blood oxygen levels and respiratory failure.
      Common causes include pneumonia, sepsis, and lung trauma. Symptoms, including breathing
      difficulty, low blood pressure, and organ failure, usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of
      the original injury or illness. Most patients require immediate care in an intensive care
      unit, and the main form of treatment is mechanical ventilation, which delivers oxygen and a
      continuous level of pressure to the damaged lungs. Although progress has been made in
      understanding how ALI/ARDS develops, it is still unknown why recovery outcomes differ among
      people. Differences in the genetic basis of protein C and fibrinolysis pathways, which both
      play a role in preventing blood clots, may be a factor in determining the severity of and
      recovery from ALI. The purpose of this study is to analyze plasma and DNA from children with
      ALI/ARDS to identify biomarkers and genetic variations that may be related to clinical
      outcomes.

      This study will enroll children who are hospitalized with ALI/ARDS. Participants' medical
      records will be reviewed to gather information about symptoms, physical exam findings,
      mechanical ventilator settings, and laboratory test results. A blood collection will occur on
      Days 1 and 3. Study researchers will analyze plasma biomarkers and use high throughput DNA
      sequencing technology to analyze participants' DNA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized and requiring supplemental oxygen

          -  Meets the American-European consensus definition of ALI/ARDS, defined as partial
             pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio of
             less than 300 mm Hg, bilateral opacities on a chest radiograph, and either a pulmonary
             wedge pressure of less than 18 mm Hg or the absence of clinical evidence of left
             atrial hypertension

          -  Acute pulmonary parenchymal disease (i.e., onset of bilateral infiltrates on chest
             radiograph within 48 hours of screening)

          -  PaO2/FiO2 less than or equal to 300 mm Hg, regardless of the mean airway pressure

          -  At least one arterial blood gas confirming partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of
             inspired oxygen (PO2/FiO2) ratio less than 300 mm Hg or Fi02/Sao2 on pulse oximetry of
             less than 320

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical signs of left ventricular failure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater
             than 18 mm Hg, or evidence, such as echocardiography, suggesting a cardiac basis for
             the pulmonary edema

          -  Presence of right-to-left intracardiac shunt
