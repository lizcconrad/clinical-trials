      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill
      tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy, surgery,
      and radiation therapy works in treating patients with locoregionally advanced cancer of the
      esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or stomach.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the feasibility and tolerability of induction chemotherapy comprising
           epirubicin hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil (EOF), followed by surgical
           resection and postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising fluorouracil and
           cisplatin in patients with locoregionally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus,
           gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the rate of complete and partial response to three courses of EOF induction
           chemotherapy.

        -  To compare the recurrence-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen vs historical controls at this institution.

        -  To compare patterns of failure in patients treated with this regimen vs historical
           controls at this institution.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV over 3-15 minutes
           and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-21.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Surgery: Four weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients with
           locoregionally confined disease (T0-4, N0-1, M0-1a) undergo transthoracic
           esophagogastrectomy or total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy, depending
           on the location and extent of the tumor at the time of surgery.

        -  Postoperative chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 6-10 weeks after surgery, patients undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6 weeks. Patients also receive fluorouracil
           IV continuously and cisplatin IV continuously over 96 hours in weeks 1 and 4 of
           radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 3 years.

    <measure>Feasibility of resectability rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 cycles</time_frame>
    <description>Prior experience at this institution suggests a resectability rate after induction chemoradiotherapy of 85-90%, primarily based on disease extent at the time of surgery. Resectability below 75% will suggest that this induction regimen is not feasible.
Similarly, prior experience suggests that post-operative chemoradiotherapy can be given to between 70-80% of resected patients. If adjuvant chemoradiotherapy cannot be given to at least 65% of the resected patients on this trial, the feasibility of this schedule will be in doubt.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 cycles</time_frame>
    <description>Experience with the EOF regimen in patients with advanced disease suggests a response rate of 40%. This is a difficult endpoint in patients with only loco-regional disease. A pathological response rate (pathologic downstaging compared to initial clinical stage) of less than 30% will suggest that this regimen is insufficiently active.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of study</time_frame>
    <description>A 3-year survival of less than 35% will suggest inefficacy of this treatment protocol. A survival rate greater than 50% would suggest efficacy and justify further study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Locoregional control and distant metastatic control</measure>
    <time_frame>3 cycles</time_frame>
    <description>A distant metastatic control rate of greater than 55 % would suggest efficacy for this treatment protocol. A locoregional control rate of less than 75% would suggest inefficacy.</description>

    <description>Between 6-10 weeks after surgery patients will begin postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Daily radiation therapy fractions of 180-200 cGy will be given to the esophago-gastric bed and draining lymphatic regions to a total dose of 50-55 Gy (60 Gy in the event of an R1 or R2 resection). Concurrent with this radiation, two cycles of chemotherapy will be given, during the first and fourth weeks of the radiation</description>

    <description>Three weeks after discontinuing the fluorouracil (12 weeks after study entry) patients will be fully restaged to assess for a clinical response, and to ensure that there is no contraindication to surgical resection, which will be scheduled for approximately one week later (13 weeks after study entry).
Surgery will consist of a transthoracic esophagogastrectomy or a total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy depending on the location and extent of the tumor at surgery. An appropriate lymphadenectomy will be performed. Immediate reconstruction is anticipated if possible.</description>
