    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Trough (Pre Bronchodilator and Pre Dose) FEV1 on Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL) and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second. Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. If one of these two assessments was missing then Baseline is defined as the single pre-dose FEV1 value at Day 1. The trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24-hours after dosing on Day 28 and the Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was calculated as the value on Day 29 minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) with covariates of baseline, sex, age, smoking status (at screening), reversibility stratum, and treatment (trt).</description>

    <measure>Time-adjusted Area Under the Curve (AUC) (i.e. Weighted Mean Change From Baseline) for 24 Hour Serial FEV1 on Days 1 and 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Weighted mean was derived by calculating the AUC, and then dividing by the relevant time interval. The weighted mean change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 24 hour serial FEV1 measures on Day 1 and Day 28 minus the Baseline value. Serial FEV1 measurements were taken on Day 1 and Day 28 (post-dose FEV1 after 5, 15, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 23 and 24 hours). AUC was calculated only when there was at least 3 non-missing values between 0 and 24 hours and must have a value at 23 or 24 hours. Analysis performed used a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, baseline, sex, age, smoking status (at Screening), reversibility stratum, Day (nominal), day by Baseline, and day by treatment interactions.</description>

    <measure>Time to &gt;= 12% Increase From Baseline in FEV1 (0-4 Hours Post-dose)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a measure of lung function defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second. Time until participants achieved a &gt;=12% increase from Baseline FEV1 (0-4 hours post-dose) are presented. Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. If one of these two assessments was missing then Baseline is defined as the single pre-dose FEV1 on Day 1.Time to &gt;= 12% increase from Baseline (on Day 1) is defined as the time when the first post-dose FEV1 (on Day 1) is &gt;=12% above Baseline FEV1. Time to &gt;= 12% increase from Baseline was assessed over the 0-4 hour time period and only used lung function data recorded up to 6 hours post the Day 1 dose.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to &gt;= 100 Milliliter (mL) Increase From Baseline in FEV1 (0-4 Hours Post-dose)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second. Time until participants achieve &gt;=100 mL increase from Baseline FEV1 (0-4 hours post-dose) are presented. Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. Time to &gt;= 100mL increase from Baseline (on Day 1) is defined as the time until the first post-dose FEV1 (on Day 1) is &gt;= 100mL above Baseline FEV1. Time to &gt;= 100mL increase from Baseline (on Day 1) was calculated only if there was at least one non-missing FEV1 value recorded within the first hour of dosing. Time to &gt;= 100mL increase from Baseline was assessed over the 0-4 time period and only used lung function data recorded up to 6 hours post the Day 1 dose. Participants who did not achieve &gt;= 100mL increase from Baseline over this time period were censored.</description>

          -  COPD Diagnosis: Subjects with an established clinical history of COPD in accordance
             with the following definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory
             Society [Celli, 2004]: COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterised by
             airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually
             progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to
             noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD
             affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic consequences.

          -  Tobacco Use: Must have current or prior history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette
             smoking. [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years
             smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20
             years]. Previous smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6
             months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Severity of Disease:

          -  Subjects with a measured post-salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of ≤0.70 at Visit 1
             (Screening).

          -  Subjects with a measured post-salbutamol FEV1 ≥35 and ≤70% of predicted normal values
             calculated using NHANES III reference equations at Visit 1 (Screening).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study:

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Asthma: Subjects with a primary diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if COPD is currently their primary diagnosis)

          -  a1-antitrypsin deficiency: Subjects with a1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying
             cause of COPD.

          -  Other Respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer,
             bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung
             disease or other active pulmonary disease.

          -  Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the previous 12
             months.

          -  Chest X-ray: Chest X-ray (or CT scan) reveals evidence of clinically significant
             abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A chest x-ray must be
             taken if a chest x-ray or CT scan is not available within the 6 months preceding the
             Screening Visit. For sites in Germany, if a chest x-ray (or CT scan) is not available
             in the 6 months preceding the Screening (Visit 1), the subject will not be eligible
             for the study.

          -  Hospitalization: Subjects who are hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 12
             weeks of the screening visit.

          -  Poorly controlled COPD: Subjects with poorly controlled COPD, defined as the
             occurrence of any of the following in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1:

          -  acute worsening of COPD that is managed by subject with corticosteroids or
             antibiotics, or

          -  acute worsening of COPD that requires treatment prescribed by a physician

          -  Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with clinically significant cardiovascular
             neurological, psychiatric, renal, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled
             diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled.

          -  Lower Respiratory Tract Infection: Subjects with lower respiratory tract infections
             which required the use of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to visit 1.

          -  12-Lead ECG: An abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
             that results in an active medical problem. For the purposes of this study, an abnormal
             ECG is defined as a 12-lead tracing which is interpreted with (but not limited to) any
             of the following:

          -  Clinically significant conduction abnormalities (e.g., left bundle branch block,
             Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)

          -  Clinically significant arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation, ventricular
             tachycardia)

        The investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and
        determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. However, the following
        predetermined ECG abnormalities are considered clinically significant and will result in
        exclusion of a subject:

          -  A mean QTc(B) value at screening &gt;450msec, or uncorrected QT&gt;600msec or an ECG that is

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Trough (Pre Bronchodilator and Pre Dose) FEV1 on Day 29</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second. Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. If one of these two assessments was missing then Baseline is defined as the single pre-dose FEV1 value at Day 1. The trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24-hours after dosing on Day 28 and the Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was calculated as the value on Day 29 minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) with covariates of baseline, sex, age, smoking status (at screening), reversibility stratum, and treatment (trt).</description>

        <description>Weighted mean was derived by calculating the AUC, and then dividing by the relevant time interval. The weighted mean change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 24 hour serial FEV1 measures on Day 1 and Day 28 minus the Baseline value. Serial FEV1 measurements were taken on Day 1 and Day 28 (post-dose FEV1 after 5, 15, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 23 and 24 hours). AUC was calculated only when there was at least 3 non-missing values between 0 and 24 hours and must have a value at 23 or 24 hours. Analysis performed used a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, baseline, sex, age, smoking status (at Screening), reversibility stratum, Day (nominal), day by Baseline, and day by treatment interactions.</description>

        <description>Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a measure of lung function defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second. Time until participants achieved a &gt;=12% increase from Baseline FEV1 (0-4 hours post-dose) are presented. Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. If one of these two assessments was missing then Baseline is defined as the single pre-dose FEV1 on Day 1.Time to &gt;= 12% increase from Baseline (on Day 1) is defined as the time when the first post-dose FEV1 (on Day 1) is &gt;=12% above Baseline FEV1. Time to &gt;= 12% increase from Baseline was assessed over the 0-4 hour time period and only used lung function data recorded up to 6 hours post the Day 1 dose.</description>
