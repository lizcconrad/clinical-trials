      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Evaluate how the body reacts to sorafenib when taken daily in combination with
           paclitaxel and carboplatin,

        2. Measure the blood levels of sorafenib, paclitaxel and carboplatin at specific times
           after taking the medication, and

        3. To determine the safety of sorafenib.
