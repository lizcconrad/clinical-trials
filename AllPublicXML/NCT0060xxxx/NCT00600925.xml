      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the gentamicin-collagen sponge is safe and
      effective for preventing surgical wound infections in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical wound infection (SWI) is a significant problem in colorectal surgery. Despite the
      use of routine bowel preparation and prophylactic antibiotics the incidence of SWI is at
      least 15% in patients undergoing colorectal surgical procedures.Therefore, there is a long
      unmet need for an intervention that can reduce the incidence and severity of SWIs in patients
      undergoing colorectal surgery.

      Gentamicin is an antibiotic that is effective in treating certain kinds of infection.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The gentamicin-collagen sponge is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and containing gentamicin. When
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and the gentamicin is released at the
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of antibiotic at the
      surgical site may prevent an infection at the surgical site.

      Outside of the United States more than 3,500 subjects have received treatment in clinical
      studies with the gentamicin-collagen sponge, primarily for orthopedic, intraabdominal, and
      cardiothoracic surgeries or wound infections following surgical procedures or traumatic
      events.

      In this study, all subjects will be given treatment that is normally given to prevent
      surgical infections. For subjects randomly assigned to the gentamicin-collagen sponge
      treatment group, 2 sponges will be inserted into the surgical wound immediately before the
      surgeon closes it. The control group will receive no collagen sponge.

             or device study, or currently participating in a study in which the administration of
             investigational drug or device within 60 days is anticipated.

          -  Surgeon does not believe that it will be possible to insert 2 sponges above the fascia
             in the patient (e.g. in a very thin patient planned to have a small incision)

          -  Patients with anterior abdominal wall mesh that is not planned to be completely
             removed during the planned procedure.
