    <textblock>
      The accuracy and/or performance of the GE DINAMAP noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitors
      may be improved with modifications in software and/or hardware monitoring techniques and/or
      accessories. When changes are being made to the GE Monitor, testing can be done to evaluate
      performance of the investigational devices during and/or after product development.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Ability to single or dual monitor NIBP, ECG, and/or SpO2, whether or not already being
             monitored for any or all of these parameters.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Any subject deemed too unstable, at the clinician's discretion, to participate in the
             study

          -  Any subject with a cardiac anomaly that would cause a disparity between aortic
             pressures and the periphery.

          -  Any subject who cannot tolerate, in the opinion of the clinician, multiple blood
             pressure measurements

          -  Known disease state or medical condition that A) compromises circulation to the
             extremity (ies), B) compromises musculo-skeletal integrity, or C) otherwise
             contraindicates use of a NIBP cuff and/or SpO2 sensor on an extremity or ECG patches
             on skin

          -  Excessive movement or excitability causing false values or no determinations (SP10
             accuracy study only)
