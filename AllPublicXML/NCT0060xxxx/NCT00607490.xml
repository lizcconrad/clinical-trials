      Many treatments used for women with vulvodynia are based solely upon expert opinion. This
      randomized trial aimed to test the relative efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      and supportive psychotherapy (SPT) in women with vulvodynia. Of the 50 participants, 42 (84%)
      completed 10-week treatments and 47 (94%) completed one-year follow-up. Mixed effects
      modeling was used to make use of all available data. Participants had statistically
      significant decreases in pain severity (p's&lt;.001) with 42% of the overall sample achieving
      clinical improvement. CBT, relative to SPT, resulted in significantly greater improvement in
      pain severity during physician examination (p=.014), and greater improvement in sexual
      function (p=.034), from pre- to post-treatment. Treatment effects were well maintained at
      one-year follow-up in both groups. Participants in the CBT condition reported significantly
      greater treatment improvement, satisfaction and credibility than participants in the SPT
      condition (p's&lt;.05). Findings from the present study suggest that psychosocial treatments for
      vulvodynia are effective. CBT, a directed treatment approach that involves learning and
      practice of specific pain-relevant coping and self-management skills, yielded better outcomes
      and greater patient satisfaction than a less directive approach.
