      Our null hypothesis states that the two techniques (Sitzmarks radioopaque markers and
      SmartPill) are equivalent and is demonstrated if the study population shows a correlation of
      0.7 or higher.

      The purpose of the study is to measure total gastrointestinal transit time using SmartPill GI
      Monitoring System with pH.p Capsule and compare the transit time determined by capsule
      transit to the conventional radioopaque marker technique.

      Both techniques are simultaneously applied in normal and constipated adult populations.
