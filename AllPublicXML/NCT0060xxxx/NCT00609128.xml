  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to determine which inflammatory substances are involved in
      causing allergic symptoms in the eye. Allergic conjunctivitis is a common problem with
      symptoms of temporary redness, itching, tearing, and swelling of the eyes. Substances
      released by cells in the affected tissues cause allergic reactions in the eye and elsewhere
      in the body.

    <textblock>
      Ocular allergies are extremely common, affecting up to 80 million people in the USA. Our
      research question is:

      Are there differences in inflammatory mediators and cell surface activation markers in
      patients undergoing seasonal allergic conjunctivitis compared to those with sight threatening
      disease such as Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and will the use of the anti-allergy eye
      drop, PATANOLÂ® (olopatadine hydrochloride) affect these parameters?

      Experimental Design:

      Ocular surface cells (by impression cytology) and tears (via capillary tube) are collected
      from allergic, non-allergic, and AKC subjects undergoing an reaction induced either by
      seasonal allergen or topical allergen provocation (specificity and dose determined via skin
      testing). Ocular surface cells are evaluated for surface activation markers. Tears are
      evaluated for mediator content. Tears are also incubated with peripheral blood eosinophils
      and lymphocytes to see effects on adhesion to conjunctival epithelial cells.
