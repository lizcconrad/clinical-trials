  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dextromethorphan (DM), an ingredient widely used in antitussive remedies, had been reported
      to reduce the inflammation-mediated degeneration of neurons. We recently found that DM can
      prevent vascular remodeling and neuron injury in animal models of carotid ligation and
      cerebral ischemia injuries, respectively. It was believed that its action was through the
      anti-oxidant and NADPH pathway to protect brain cells. However, the mechanism and actual
      effect on human vascular protection remained unclear.

      To test the hypothesis that DM could have anti-inflammatory effect and thus achieve vascular
      protection effect on heavy smokers, this prospective study will be conducted to treat
      subjects with heavy smoking history with DM or not and evaluate the anti-inflammatory and the
      improvement of endothelial function.
