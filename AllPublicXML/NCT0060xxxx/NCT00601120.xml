  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of a procedure called radiofrequency
      ablation on kidney tumors from patients who are undergoing antiangiogenic treatment.
      Antiangiogenic treatment is a type of treatment that inhibits formation of new blood vessels
      that are required for tumor growth. Radiofrequency ablation (RF ablation) involves inserting
      a needle into tumor tissue and administering heat to the tumor tissue that is sufficient to
      kill the tumor cells.

      -  Participants will undergo a RF ablation procedure of one or more of their tumors that
           have not gone away while they have been undergoing antiangiogenic treatment. The RF
           ablation procedure will be performed in the operating room at one of the
           Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center hospitals and will be performed under general
           anesthesia.

        -  Blood will also be drawn 2-4 weeks before the procedure, at the time of teh procedure
           and 2-4 weeks after the procedure.

        -  The RF ablation procedure will be performed at specified times in relation to the
           participants antiangiogenic treatment (sorafenib or sunitinib): a) If the participant is
           taking sorafenib, they will be asked to stop taking it 2-5 days prior to the RF ablation
           procedure; b) if the participant is taking sunitinib, they will be asked to stop taking
           it 4-7 days prior to the RF ablation procedure.

        -  Participants will have an MRI or a CT scan of their tumor(s) within 2-4 weeks of the
           procedure and 2-4 weeks after the procedure. The MRI or CT will scan the tumor(s) to
           determine how much blood flow is going to them.

        -  At the time of RF ablation, participants will have a biopsy of their tumor(s) and will
           receive a CT scan in the area the ablation was performed after the procedure to assess
           for any bleeding. They will also be monitored for 4 hours after the RF ablation
           procedure.
