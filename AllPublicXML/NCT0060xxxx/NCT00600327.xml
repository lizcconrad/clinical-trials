      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the NexStent for
      treatment of carotid artery lesions undergoing stenting with adjunctive use of the FilterWire
      distal embolic protection device. The rates will be compared to an Objective Performance
      Criterion (OPC) derived from historic data from high-risk patients undergoing surgical
      intervention with Carotid endarterectomy. Patients included in this study are those at higher
      risk for complications associated with CEA.
