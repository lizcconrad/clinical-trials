    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer.

      Each cycle will be 4 weeks in length. Patients will receive Abraxane weekly for 3 weeks.
      Patients will not receive Abraxane during week 4 (rest week). Nexavar will be given
      continuously.

      Patients will be radiologically evaluated every 8 weeks for response. Patients will continue
      to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             postmenopausal for at least 12 months.

         17. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive measures
             during study treatment and for a reasonable time thereafter.

         18. Patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and
