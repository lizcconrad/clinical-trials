    <textblock>
      A Descending Thoracic Aneurysm is a bulge in the aorta. The aorta is a large blood vessel
      that carries blood away from your heart to organs in the rest of your body. Your aneurysm is
      caused by a weakening in the artery wall. If left untreated, this bulge may continue to grow
      larger and may ultimately rupture (break open) or extend in size to seriously affect other
      major arteries in the area. In this Research Study a device will be placed inside your aorta
      to block the weakened part of the artery wall from the circulatory system. Information will
      be collected on the performance for the device for 5 years.

        Talent Captivia Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patient is at least 18 years of age.

          2. Patient is a surgical or non-surgical candidate

          3. Patient has a:

               1. Fusiform focal TAA AND / OR

               2. Focal saccular TAA or penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer.

          4. Subject's anatomy must meet all of the following anatomical criteria:

               1. iliac/femoral access vessel morphology that is compatible with vascular access
                  techniques, devices, and/or accessories

               2. non-aneurysmal aortic diameter in the range of 18-42mm; and

               3. non-aneurysmal aortic proximal and distal neck lengths =/&gt;20mm

          5. Thoracic aortic lesion is confirmed, at a minimum, by diagnostic contrast enhanced
             computerized tomography (CTA) with optional 3-D reconstruction, and/or contrast
             enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) obtained within the previous three (3)
             months prior to the implant procedure.

          6. Subject or subject's legal representative understands and has signed an Informed
             Consent approved by the Sponsor and by the IRB for this study.

          7. Patient must be able and willing to undergo follow-up imaging and examinations
             postoperatively up to 6 months.

        Talent Captivia Exclusion Criteria

          1. Planned placement of the COVERED (top edge of fabric) portion of the stent graft
             requires implant to occur in zones 0 or 1

          2. Pregnant female

          3. Patient has a connective tissue disease (e.g Marfan's syndrome, medial degeneration).

          4. Patient has a mycotic aneurysm or is suspected of having systemic infection.

          5. Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, or refuses blood
             transfusions.

          6. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device clinical trial
             that would interfere with the Talent Captivia protocol endpoints or follow-up.

          7. The patient has known allergy or intolerance to the device components.

          8. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants or
             contrast media, which is not amenable to pre-treatment.

          9. The patient has another medical condition, which may cause them to be non-compliant
             with the protocol, confound the data interpretation, or limited life expectancy of
             less than 6 months.
