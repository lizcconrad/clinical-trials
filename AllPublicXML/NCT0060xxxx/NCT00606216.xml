  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about possible changes in brain anatomy and in thinking
      abilities, such as memory skills, in patients with cancer who receive treatment with
      chemotherapy alone or in combination with total body radiation before undergoing stem cell
      transplantation.
