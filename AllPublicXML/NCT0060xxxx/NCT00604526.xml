  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is a form of radiation treatment using temporary
      radioactive seeds. This is done by placing very tiny catheters or tubes into the prostate and
      then inserting temporary radioactive seeds, called Iridium 192, through these catheters. HDR
      brachytherapy gives precise radiation to the prostate with less radiation given to the normal
      tissues near the prostate. For patients who have been treated with external beam radiation to
      the prostate before, HDR brachytherapy can give radiation again to the prostate without
      exposing the normal tissues around the prostate to significantly more radiation. This may be
      safer than giving external beam radiation again. The purpose of this study is to test the
      safety of high dose rate temporary brachytherapy (HDR) for prostate cancer that has come back
      after external beam radiation. We want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the
      treatment has on you and your recurrent prostate cancer.
