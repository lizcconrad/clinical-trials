    <textblock>
      The present study intends to investigate the use of fractional doses of sanofi pasteur's
      IMOVAX Polio injected intradermally. The primary objective will be to demonstrate the
      non-inferiority of fractional doses of IMOVAX Polio administered intradermally versus full
      doses of IMOVAX Polio administered intramuscularly, in terms of seroprotection rates (polio
      types 1, 2 and 3) one month after the three-dose primary vaccination administered at 6-10-14
      weeks of age.
