  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies comparing on-pump and off-pump operating strategy did only partially
      demonstrate benefits of the off-pump myocardial revascularisation.In primary end-points (MI,
      death, renal failure, and so on) there was no significant difference, but in secondary
      end-points we observed benefits resulting for patients. We would like to show the benefit of
      the method without extracorporeal circulation in patients with higher and hight operation
      risk, coming from EuroSCORE classification system (6 points and more).
