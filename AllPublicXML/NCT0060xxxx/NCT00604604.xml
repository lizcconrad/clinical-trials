      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of peer (mother-to-mother)
      support on the prevention of postpartum depression among mothers identified as high-risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many new mothers from diverse cultures experience postpartum depression (PPD), a serious form
      of maternal morbidity with well documented health consequences for the mother, child, and
      family. While the cause of PPD remains unclear, research consistently demonstrates the
      importance of psychosocial variables. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to
      evaluate the effect of peer (mother-to-mother) support on the prevention of PPD among mothers
      identified as high-risk. Public health nurses using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
      (EPDS) screened mothers who were less than 2 weeks postpartum in the regions of Toronto,
      Peel, Halton, York, Windsor, Sudbury, and Ottawa. Eligible and consenting mothers were
      randomized to either a control group (usual postpartum care) or experimental group (usual
      postpartum care plus telephone-based support from an experienced mother who has participated
      in a 4-hour training session). Diverse study outcomes, including depressive symptomatology
      and health service utilization, were assessed at 12 and 24 weeks postpartum. The results from
      this trial will make substantive contributions in six areas: (1) develop the body of
      knowledge concerning the effectiveness of peer support in the prevention of PPD among at-risk
      mothers; (2) advance our understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of using peer
      volunteers as a complementary form of health care; (3) provide an economic evaluation of a
      peer support intervention; (4) offer a detailed analysis of peer support interactions
      including supportive functions provided, types of relationships developed, and health
      benefits perceived; (5) investigate the utility of screening at-risk mothers using the EPDS
      in general public health nursing practice; and (6) present valuable information regarding PPD
      among a multicultural Canadian population.

    <description>Mothers allocated to the peer support group had access to all of the standard community postpartum services in addition to having received telephone-based support from a peer volunteer (a mother who has previously experienced, and recovered from, postpartum depression and has participated in a 4-hour training session). Telephone contact with a new mother was initiated within 48 to 72 hours of trial enrolment and then as frequently as the dyad deemed necessary; a minimum of four contacts were required.</description>
