  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subject with Cystic Fibrosis have increased clearance of many drugs. Based on pre-clinical
      data SB656933 was found to have low clearance and high bio-availability. This study will
      characterize the PK profile of a single dose of SB656933 in patients with Cystic Fibrosis.
      There will be two groups of subjects. The first group of subjects will receive a single dose
      of 50mg SB-656933. The second group of subjects will receive a single dose of up to 300 mg
      SB-656933. Subjects will first be screened for eligibility related to cystic fibrosis
      history. Safety evaluations will be undertaken and plasma samples for pharmacokinetic
      analysis will be collected. Additional blood samples will be taken for the pharmacodynamic
      endpoints CD11b and GAFS. Subjects are not required to stay overnight after their 12 hour PK
      sample collection on Day 1, although they may do so if they wish. On Day 2 and 3, they will
      return for collection of additional safety measurements, and further plasma and blood samples
      will be taken for 24 and 48 h pharmacokinetics and 24h CD11b/GAFS measurements, respectively.

      A follow up visit (Visit 3) will be made 4-7 days after the treatment period. Subjects will
      be enrolled in the study for approximately 3to 7 weeks (from screening to follow-up).
