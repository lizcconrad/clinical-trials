  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AMES device is designed to produce functional cortical changes by:(1) assisting the
      subject as he/she attempts to move the limb (assisted movement) and (2) enhancing movement
      sensation by vibrating the muscles during movement (enhanced sensation). The primary
      hypothesis is that the combination of assisted movement and enhanced sensation from muscle
      vibration can increase the amount of motor recovery in individuals disabled by a stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 700,000 U.S. citizens have a stroke each year with about half ending up with
      significant motor disabilities. There are an estimated 5 million stroke survivors in the
      U.S., making strokes the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S.. Existing
      rehabilitation therapies have not been effective in returning all stroke survivors to full
      motor recovery.

      The AMES device was designed to be able to provide therapy for the ankle joint and the hand
      (fingers/wrist). Subjects may qualify for one or two limbs. In this 18 treatment sessions,
      double-blinded, control study, AMES therapy will be provided in addition to the usual
      physician-ordered rehabilitation during the sub-acute period following a stroke. Those
      control subject who complete the Phase 1 placebo sessions will have the opportunity to
      cross-over to participate in a AMES treatment group for a Phase 2.
