      This pilot study will attempt to test the effects of this non-invasive procedure on a small
      sample of insomnia patients and also determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining
      participants during the trial for such treatments in the United States.

      A prospective case series design will be adopted. Due to the small sample size and the
      preliminary nature of the study, a single case study or case series are classified under
      Observational Descriptive Studies. The investigators will seek local Institutional Review
      Board (IRB) approval. Ten volunteers who respond to the recruitment efforts will be enrolled
      into the study. Successful enrollment is based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Brahmi oil (sesame oil processed with Bacopa monieri and other herbs) will be used to perform
      Shirodhara. Each participant will be treated for 40 minutes for five consecutive days.
      Outcome measures data will be collected at baseline, third day and fifth day and a week after
      the treatment is over. Additionally, demographic data will be collected at baseline as well.
      Participants will be asked to record any adverse events or side effects they observe during
      the study period.
