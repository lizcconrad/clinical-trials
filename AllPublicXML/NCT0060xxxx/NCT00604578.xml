  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos (Registered Trademark)
      Registered Trademark) is effective for treating patients with asthma who do not respond to
      standard therapy. Experiments have shown that this drug, which is used to treat patients with
      diabetes, may be effective for treating asthma.

      People between 18 and 75 years of age who have had asthma for at least a1 year and whose
      symptoms are not well controlled with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids with or without
      long-acting bronchodilators may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with
      breathing tests, an allergy skin test, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram
      (ultrasound test of the heart), blood tests, and DEXA scan (an x-ray to measure bone
      thickness) to make sure they are eligible for the study.

      Then, participants undergo tests and procedures in the following study phases:

      Phase 1

      Participants are given a device to measure and record their lung function and asthma symptoms
      at home each morning and night for 4 weeks before starting the study medication. Lung
      function is also measured at clinic visits before and after inhaling a bronchodilator
      medicine. Before starting the study medication, participants have a sputum induction (sputum
      collection test). For this test, the participants inhale a salt-water mist and are asked to
      collect sputum into a plastic cup.

      Phase II

      Participants are randomly selected to receive either pioglitazone hydrochloride or placebo (a
      look-alike pill with no active ingredient) once a day for 10 weeks. They return to the clinic
      after 2 weeks to repeat the tests done in Phase 1 and to monitor any reactions to the study
      drug or placebo. If there are no problems, the amount of medication is increased once, and
      then they return for follow-up evaluations every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Pulmonary function
      tests, sputum collection and DEXA scan are repeated after 10 weeks on medication.

      Phase III

      Patients return for follow-up 1 month after stopping the medication or placebo to monitor
      their asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New therapies are needed for patients with asthma who are suboptimally controlled by standard
      measures. Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos [R]) is a highly selective and potent agonist for
      the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma). Studies in murine models
      of allergic asthma have shown that PPAR gamma-agonists down-regulate allergen-mediated airway
      inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This protocol is a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group (phase II) pilot study of the efficacy and
      safety of pioglitazone for the treatment of patients with allergic asthma and reversible
      airflow obstruction who are persistently symptomatic despite therapy with high doses of
      inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting Beta 2-agonists. The primary end-point
      for this study will be the change in airflow obstruction, as measured by the
      post-bronchodilator FEV1. Secondary end-points will include indices of airway inflammation,
      airflow obstruction, airway hyperreactivity, and asthma symptoms.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be between 18 and 75 years of age, male or female, with a diagnosis of asthma
        for at least one year.

        Patients must have reversible airflow obstruction as defined by a positive methacholine
        bronchoprovocation challenge or a positive response to inhaled bronchodilators.

        Patients must be treated with EPR-3 Step 5 therapy (high dose (great than or equal to 440
        ucg/day) fluticasone inhaler or equivalent dose of another inhaled corticosteroid) with or
        without an inhaled long-acting beta-2-agonist) for at least 3 months.

        Patients must meet the EPR-3 criteria for not well controlled asthma. The EPR-3 definition
        for not well controlled asthma includes any of the following features in a week (unless
