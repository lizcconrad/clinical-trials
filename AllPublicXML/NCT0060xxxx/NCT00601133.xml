      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the change in functional tests of postural control of cancer patients who have
      completed acute inpatient rehabilitation or complete rehabilitation through mobile team from
      discharge at 21-60 days (+/- 3) after discharge.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the correlations between the functional tests of postural control, the balance test
      and the amount of exercise per week.

      To be enrolled in this study, you must be able to walk with or without an assistant device
      (such as a cane or a walker).

      Study Procedures:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will do a combination of
      walking and balance tests twice, once on the day you leave the rehabilitation center or
      hospital, and again at a return visit 21-60 days (+/-3) later. For the first test, you will
      get up from a chair and walk 10 feet as quickly, but as safely, as possible. You will then
      return to the chair and sit again. For the second test, you will walk 25 feet, turn around,
      and walk back to the starting point as fast and as safely as you can. Both tests will be
      timed by the study staff.

      You will also do a balance test on a machine. You will stand on a platform with a rail to
      hold on to. You will shift your weight and try to keep your balance and center of gravity,
      which will be shown on a screen.

      You will be given a diary to record any physical exercise you are doing from the time you
      leave the rehabilitation center to your return visit 21-60 days (+/-3) later. You will be
      asked to record what kind of exercises (home exercise, home health therapy, or outpatient
      therapy treatment) you do and for how many hours. It should take about 5 minutes to fill out
      the diary each time.

      You will complete a questionnaire that asks you about your symptoms, such as pain. You will
      complete it when you leave the rehabilitation program and again at the study visit 21-60 days
      (+/-3) later. It should take about 5 minutes to complete the questionnaire.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after you complete the second questionnaire.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 58 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
