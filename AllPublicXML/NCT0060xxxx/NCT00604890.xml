      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of pharmaceutical
      compound (API 31510) topical cream topically applied to superficial basal cell carcinomas to
      obtain preliminary efficacy data for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas by
      API 31510 topical cream. The study population will include one hundred and sixty (160)
      otherwise healthy male or female adults with one or more histologically confirmed superficial
      basal cell carcinoma lesions. One target lesion with an area of less than one inch will be
      designated for study treatment.
