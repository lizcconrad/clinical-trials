  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years several reports have documented that Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors
      induce neoplastic cells to undergo growth arrest, differentiation and/or apoptotic cell
      death. Recently, inhibitors of HDACs has also been shown to inhibit endothelial cell
      proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo. Several HDAC-inhibitors are currently in clinical
      trials as novel anticancer agents. Among these agents, ITF2357 has most recently been shown
      to be a potent inhibitor of the autonomous proliferation of haematopoietic cells from
      patients with myeloproliferative disorders carrying the JAK2 V617F mutation. The aim of the
      present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ITF2357 in the treatment of
      polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF)
