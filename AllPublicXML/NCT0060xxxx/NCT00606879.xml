  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SGX523 is a drug which acts by blocking the function of an enzyme called MET. MET activity
      may be important in growth and survival of some types of cancer. This Phase I trial is
      studying the safety, side effects, and best dose of SGX523 when given to patients with
      advanced cancer, and how well it inhibits MET activity in tumors.

          -  Pathologic evidence of solid tumor

          -  Failed standard therapy and deemed by the Investigator to be suitable for
             participation into the trial

          -  Laboratory values (obtained within 10 days prior to enrollment): ANC: &gt;= 1.5 × 109/L;
             Platelets: &gt;= 100 × 109/L; Hemoglobin: &gt;= 10.0 g/dL (without transfusions); Bilirubin:
             within normal range; AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase: &lt;= 2.5 x ULN without tumor

          -  Have a known active infection with HIV, hepatitis B or C

          -  Have psychiatric or seizure disorders that would require therapy or interfere with
             study participation

          -  Have other severe concurrent nonmalignant disease that could compromise protocol
             objectives, including malabsorptive conditions

             categorized as strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and A5 and drugs known to have a high
             potential risk of liver toxicity

          -  Have known allergy to SGX523 formulation or its excipients (croscarmellose sodium,
             lactose monohydrate and magnesium steareate)

          -  Patients receiving anti-coagulant therapy
