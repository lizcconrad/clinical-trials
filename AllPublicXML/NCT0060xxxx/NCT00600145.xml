      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if Mirtazapine will produce a decrease in
      interest in the drug, a decrease in mood elevation, and/or a decrease in reward when given
      before methamphetamine compared to placebo.

      Participants will be screened with a psychiatric interview, medical history and physical,
      laboratory tests, drug of abuse screen and, if female, a urine pregnancy test. They will be
      provided written informed consent. They will be studied in a within-subjects examination of
      the subjective mood responses of mirtazapine and methamphetamine. Interactions between
      methamphetamine and mirtazapine will be assessed by pharmacokinetic studies. Each participant
      will be introduced to rating scales and cognitive tasks described below. Participants will
      remain in the research unit for 5 hours on each day that they receive study medication or
      placebo. They will spend five days in total on the research unit, one day separated by at
      least one day; then in two day blocks separated by at least one day from another two day
      block. A venous catheter will be placed for blood draws. Blood pressures and heart rates will
      be recorded and assessed. Participants will be randomized and double blinded to receive
      either placebo or mirtazapine orally two hours prior to the administration of randomized and
      double blinded methamphetamine or placebo in order to have the peak effects of the drugs
      overlap. VAS-mood, ARCI, GRS, POMS and POMS-E, neurocognitive tasks Trails A and B and Symbol
      digits modalities test will be administered prior to the mirtazapine or placebo dose, and
      repeated after the administration of methamphetamine or placebo. After the administration of
      methamphetamine or placebo, vital signs will be assessed every 15 minutes and the measures
      will be repeated until 120 minutes have passed from the initial dose of methamphetamine or
      placebo. Blood will be drawn at one, three and four hour marks for pharmacokinetic testing.
      This will be repeated on each testing day.

    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine dependence is a major health problem in the US. Methamphetamine's reinforcing
      effects associated with its abuse liability depend upon activation of the cortico-mesolimbic
      dopamine (CMDA) system. Medications that antagonize CMDA function might have therapeutic
      potential Mirtazapine appears to affect this pathway. Mirtazapine works through serotinergic
      (5-HT) mechanisms 5HT 2 and 3, alpha 2 and H1 antagonist and has been noted to decrease
      excitatory responses in methamphetamine challenged animals. Mirtazapine increases dopamine
      release in the prefrontal cortex by 5HT receptor activation. Additionally, in a randomized,
      placebo controlled trial; individuals taking mirtazapine for amphetamine detoxification were
      found to have significant improvements in hyper arousal and anxiety subset score when
      discontinuing the stimulant. Methamphetamine has been given safely to healthy human
      volunteers in other studies.

      We propose to conduct the first preliminary human laboratory study to determine if
      mirtazapine 15 mg diminishes methamphetamine (20 mg) induced positive subjective interest,
      mood elevation and reinforcing value. This dose of methamphetamine has been used by other
      investigators in healthy volunteers.

      This preliminary trial is the first in a sequence of studies to characterize the dose
      dependent effects of mirtazapine as a treatment agent for methamphetamine dependence. If this
      study is successful, it would afford us a scientific platform and rationale for progressing
      with testing efficacy for mirtazapine among methamphetamine dependent individuals both in the
      human laboratory and in clinical trials. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate
      systematically the neurobehavioral basis and dose-response effects of mirtazapine acutely on
      methamphetamine-induced interest, mood elevation and reward. This study employs a
      well-validated, state-of-the-art, human laboratory technique to determine the extent to which
      mirtazapine blocks methamphetamine induced euphoria, reinforcement, and cue craving in
      healthy volunteers tested in a controlled hospital environment under medical supervision.
