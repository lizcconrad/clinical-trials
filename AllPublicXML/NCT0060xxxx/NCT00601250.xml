    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      BI 1356 (5 mg once daily) compared to placebo given for 24 weeks as add-on therapy to
      metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient glycaemic control
