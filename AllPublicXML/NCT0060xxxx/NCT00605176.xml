  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether imiquimod creams are effective in treating
      Actinic Keratoses when applied to the face or balding scalp.

      Actinic keratosis (AK) is a skin condition that shows up on skin routinely exposed to the
      sun, such as the face, scalp, shoulders, chest, back, arms, and hands. The active ingredient
      contained in the study cream for this study is the same as that of the approved product
      Aldara, which has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of AKs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study that compared the
      efficacy and safety of 2.5% imiquimod cream and 3.75% imiquimod cream with that of placebo in
      the treatment of typical visible or palpable AKs of the face or balding scalp. Subjects were
      scheduled for a total of 9 visits (1 prestudy screening visit and 8 on-study visits).
      Subjects determined to be eligible during the screening phase were randomized in a 1:1:1
      ratio to 2.5% imiquimod cream, 3.75% imiquimod cream, or placebo cream. The creams were
      applied daily for 2 treatment cycles. The first treatment cycle consisted of 2 weeks of daily
      treatment followed by 2 weeks of no treatment, and the second treatment cycle consisted of an
      additional 2 weeks of daily treatment followed by 8 weeks of no treatment. The investigator
      selected the treatment area for the study (either the entire face or the entire balding
      scalp, but not both). Subjects applied a thin layer of cream to the treatment area (up to 2
      packets, or 500 mg of product, per application), avoiding the periocular areas, lips, and
      nares. Study medication was applied prior to normal sleeping hours and removed approximately
      8 hours later with mild soap and water. Ears were excluded from both assessment and
      treatment. Rest periods from daily treatment were instituted by the investigator as needed to
      manage local skin reactions (LSRs) or application site reactions, with resumption of
      treatment upon adequate resolution as determined by the investigator.

      The duration of each subject's study participation was approximately 18 weeks, including a
      4-week maximum screening period and a 14-week study period.

    <description>Subject status with respect to complete clearance of AK lesions at End of Study (EOS), ie, the Week 14 visit. Complete clearance was defined as the absence of clinically visible or palpable AK lesions in the treatment area. All lesions within the identified treatment area were included in the count, even if the lesion was a new lesion or 'subclinical' lesion that had not been identified at Baseline.</description>

    <description>Six local skin reaction (LSR) signs were predefined and were assessed for presence and intensity at each study visit. These included: Erythema, Edema, Weeping/Exudate, Flaking/Scaling/Dryness, Scabbing/Crusting and Erosion/Ulceration. The LSRs were scored as 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Mean scores were summated over time (14 weeks) to yield a mean LSR AUC (area under the curve)</description>

        <title>Local Skin Reactions</title>
        <description>Six local skin reaction (LSR) signs were predefined and were assessed for presence and intensity at each study visit. These included: Erythema, Edema, Weeping/Exudate, Flaking/Scaling/Dryness, Scabbing/Crusting and Erosion/Ulceration. The LSRs were scored as 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. Mean scores were summated over time (14 weeks) to yield a mean LSR AUC (area under the curve)</description>
