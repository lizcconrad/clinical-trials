      Milatuzumab (hLL1, IMMU-115), a humanized anti-CD74 monoclonal antibody. Dose escalation will
      utilize 4 planned dose regimens with 4.0 or 8.0 mg/kg doses administered intravenously either
      twice weekly (days 1 and 4) or thrice weekly (days 1, 3 and 5) for 4 consecutive weeks. The
      four planned dose regimens will be labeled as dose level 1 to 4 corresponding to increasing
      levels of the total dose of milatuzumab.
