      We conduct a randomized study comparing the safety and effectiveness of two interventional
      ablation techniques for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: the segmental pulmonary
      vein ablation approach, (1) with empiric isolation of all pulmonary veins or (2) Segmental
      Isolation of the arrhythmogenic pulmonary vein(s)

      BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ablation procedures typically involve isolation of all
      pulmonary veins (PVs), yet the need for such an extensive ablation strategy in all patients
      is unclear.

      OBJECTIVE:

      We conduct a randomized study comparing the safety and effectiveness of two interventional
      ablation techniques for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: the segmental pulmonary
      vein ablation approach, (1) with empiric isolation of all pulmonary veins or (2) Segmental
      Isolation of only the arrhythmogenic pulmonary vein(s). The single-blind interventional,
      randomized study will include 106 patients in each arm.

      A reablation procedure, with the use of the same technique as the first ablation, will be
      offered to the patient in case of a symptomatic atrial fibrillation recurrence beyond the
      third month after the ablation procedure.

      Follow-Up After discharge, patients w ill be scheduled for repeated visits in the arrhythmia
      clinic at 3 and 6 months after the first ablation. At each of these visits, intensive
      questioning for arrhythmia-related symptoms (fatigue, dizziness, and nausea) since the last
      follow-up visit was performed, especially for those that the patient had experienced before
      ablation. At every follow-up visit, 7-day Holter monitoring w ill be performed. Multislice CT
      or MRI of the pulmonary vein w ill be obtained before and 3 months after the ablation
      procedure for evaluation of the pulmonary vein anatomy and for detection of radiofrequency
      ablation-induced pulmonary vein stenosis .

      Study End Points and Definitions The primary end point of the study will be freedom from
      atrial tachyarrhythmias (of &gt; 30-second duration) including atrial fibrillation and atypical
      atrial flutter documented by 7-day Holter monitoring performed at the 6-month follow-up. Two
      secondary study end points will be chosen. The first will be freedom from arrhythmia-related
      symptoms during the 6-month follow-up. Because early recurrences of atrial tachyarrhythmias
      within the first month after ablation may be a transient phenomenon, this time interval was
      excluded from analysis. Second, a composite of periprocedural pericardial tamponade,
      thromboembolic complications, and pulmonary vein stenosis with &gt; 50% lumen loss (main vessel
      or first branching) was defined as a safety end point
