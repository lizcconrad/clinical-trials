    <description>Vomiting was defined as the forceful expulsion of gastrointestinal contents through the mouth or nose. Retching was defined as the labored, spasmodic, rhythmic contraction of the respiratory and abdominal muscles in an attempt to vomit, that is not productive of gastrointestinal contents (also known as dry heaves). If a participant took rescue medication but there was no evidence of vomiting or retching, then the participant was considered as not having vomited. Percentage of participants who vomited and/or retched during the first 120 hours of the first cycle of chemotherapy are presented.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Whose Daily Life Activities Were Impacted in the Overall Phase of Cycle 1, Assessed by Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 120 hours in the first cycle of chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>FLIE questionnaire specifically addresses the impact of nausea and vomiting on daily activities (physical, social and emotional function, ability to enjoy meals). It consists of 18 items with questions divided into two domains: Nausea (questions 1-9) and Vomiting (questions 10-18). Each item is scored on a VAS with 7 hatch marks. The scale is anchored at 1 (Not at all) and 7 (A great deal). For questions 1,2,4,5,7,8-10,12-14,16 and 17 the final score was calculated by subtracting the initial score from 100 for questions 3,6,11,15 and 18 the final score was the one provided in the dataset. The score for the nausea domain: ([sum of nausea item scores] ÷ [Number of items answered] x 9) and for vomiting domain: ([sum of vomiting item scores] ÷ [Number of items answered] x 9). The total score was the sum of the nausea and vomiting domain scores. Higher scores indicate less impairment on daily life as a result of nausea or vomiting.</description>

    <measure>Severity of Nausea in the Overall, Acute, and Delayed Phases of Cycle 1 Assessed by a Categorical Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours, 24 to 120 hours and 0 to 120 hours in the first cycle of chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate the level of nausea he/she experienced over the previous (24 hours for a period of 120 hours following the administration of MEC), by placing a vertical mark on a VAS. The severity of nausea and was calculated by using a 0 - 100 VAS where 0 = No Nausea and 100 = Nausea as bad as it can be. The categorical scale assessed the participants severity of his/her nausea using the following: mild: Queasiness/upset stomach that is manageable and minimally (if at all) affects daily activities, moderate: increased queasiness, sometimes with the feeling of having to vomit/throw up (but not vomiting), that has significant negative effect on the daily activities (for example, being unable to work, eat and drink, prepare food, care for children or others) and severe: feeling sick and vomiting or feeling like you are going to vomit, and unable to perform most daily activities. Higher scores indicated worst outcome.</description>

        Creatinine clearance must be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:

        Clcreat (ml/min) = (140-age [yr]) x body wt [kg] 72 x serum creatinine [mg/dl] For females:
        multiply creatinine clearance by a factor of 0.85. OR Clcreat (ml/min) = K x (140-age [yr])
        x body wt [kg] serum creatinine [µmol/L] K=1.05 for females K=1.23 for males

          -  Liver enzymes must be below the following limits:

          -  Without known liver metastases: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN.

          -  With known liver metastases: AST and/or ALT ≤5.0 x ULN.

               -  Is willing and able to complete daily components of the Subject Diary for Cycle 1
                  and Cycle 2 without assistance from others.

               -  A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

                    1. non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
                       pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal. For purposes of this
                       study, postmenopausal is defined as one year without menses)

                    2. child-bearing potential: must have a negative serum pregnancy test result or
                       negative urine dipstick pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first
                       dose of investigational product on Cycle 1 Day 1. Women of childbearing
                       potential must also commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable
                       method of birth control. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when used
                       consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the
                       instructions of the physician, are as follows:

          -  male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is
             the sole sexual partner for that female subject;

          -  oral contraceptives (e.g., oral, injectable, or implantable) with double-barrier
             method of contraception consisting of spermicide with either condom or diaphragm for a
             period after the trial to account for a potential drug interaction (minimum of six
             weeks);

          -  double-barrier method of contraception consisting of spermicide with either condom or
             diaphragm;

          -  intra-uterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year;

          -  complete abstinence from intercourse for two weeks before exposure to the
             investigational product throughout the clinical trial, and for a period after the
             trial to account for elimination of the drug (minimum of 3 days);

          -  if subject indicates they will remain abstinent during the period described above,
             they must agree to follow GSK guidelines for the consistent and correct use of an
             acceptable method of birth control should they become sexually active.

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 89 centers (55 centers in Europe, 30 in North America and 4 in Korea) in 11 countries from 10-March-2008 to 13-April-2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants received ondansetron and dexamethasone as background antiemetic therapy. To assure adequate blinding, placebo to match casopitant was used. Participants were screened within 14 days of first dose of study anti-emetics and were randomly assigned to either single dose intravenous (IV) (90 mg casopitant) or control (placebo).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Complete Response in the Overall Phase (0-120 Hours) Following Initiation of the First Cycle of an Oxaliplatin Based Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC) Regimen</title>
        <description>Complete response was defined as no vomiting, no retching and no use of anti-emetic rescue medication. Participants who vomited or retched or received rescue medication in the acute phase (0- 24 hours) following administration of oxaliplatin were also considered as complete response failures in the subsequent delayed (24-120 hour) time period, irrespective of actual response in the delayed phase. However, participants who vomited or retched or received rescue medication in the delayed (24-120 hours) phase were not considered as failures in the acute (0-24 hours) phase.

          <title>Maximum Nausea Score, Assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</title>
          <description>VAS was used to assess severity of nausea. The participants rated the severity of nausea by marking a line on a 100 millimeter (mm) (0 to 100 mm) long scale. A line placed on the extreme left, that is 0 mm indicated no nausea and extreme right that is 100 mm indicated nausea as bad as it can be. This scale has no subscales. The participant perception of their symptoms was measured using the VAS.</description>

        <description>VAS was used to assess severity of nausea. The participants rated the severity of nausea by marking a line on a 100 mm (0 to 100 mm) long scale. A line placed on the extreme left, that is 0 mm indicated no nausea and extreme right that is 100 mm indicated nausea as bad as it can be. This scale has no subscales. The participant perception of their symptoms was measured using the VAS.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Whose Daily Life Activities Were Impacted in the Overall Phase of Cycle 1, Assessed by Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>FLIE questionnaire specifically addresses the impact of nausea and vomiting on daily activities (physical, social and emotional function, ability to enjoy meals). It consists of 18 items with questions divided into two domains: Nausea (questions 1-9) and Vomiting (questions 10-18). Each item is scored on a VAS with 7 hatch marks. The scale is anchored at 1 (Not at all) and 7 (A great deal). For questions 1,2,4,5,7,8-10,12-14,16 and 17 the final score was calculated by subtracting the initial score from 100 for questions 3,6,11,15 and 18 the final score was the one provided in the dataset. The score for the nausea domain: ([sum of nausea item scores] ÷ [Number of items answered] x 9) and for vomiting domain: ([sum of vomiting item scores] ÷ [Number of items answered] x 9). The total score was the sum of the nausea and vomiting domain scores. Higher scores indicate less impairment on daily life as a result of nausea or vomiting.</description>

        <title>Severity of Nausea in the Overall, Acute, and Delayed Phases of Cycle 1 Assessed by a Categorical Scale</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to rate the level of nausea he/she experienced over the previous (24 hours for a period of 120 hours following the administration of MEC), by placing a vertical mark on a VAS. The severity of nausea and was calculated by using a 0 - 100 VAS where 0 = No Nausea and 100 = Nausea as bad as it can be. The categorical scale assessed the participants severity of his/her nausea using the following: mild: Queasiness/upset stomach that is manageable and minimally (if at all) affects daily activities, moderate: increased queasiness, sometimes with the feeling of having to vomit/throw up (but not vomiting), that has significant negative effect on the daily activities (for example, being unable to work, eat and drink, prepare food, care for children or others) and severe: feeling sick and vomiting or feeling like you are going to vomit, and unable to perform most daily activities. Higher scores indicated worst outcome.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were obtained during Cycle 1 at the following times relative to the investigational product administration: pre-dose, end of infusion, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours after the end of infusion. A final PK sample was collected between 30 and 48 hours after the investigational product infusion had completed. The actual time each sample was collected was captured to the nearest minute in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Following unblinding, only those participants who had been randomized to receive casopitant were included in the PK analyses.

        <description>Blood samples were obtained during Cycle 1 at the following times relative to the investigational product administration: pre-dose, end of infusion, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours after the end of infusion. A final PK sample was collected between 30 and 48 hours after the investigational product infusion had completed. The actual time each sample was collected was captured to the nearest minute in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Following unblinding, only those participants who had been randomized to receive casopitant were included in the PK analyses. (Cmax) for casopitant and metabolites GSK525060, GSK517142 and GSK631832 are presented.</description>

        <title>Single-dose Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Clearance (CL) for Casopitant</title>
        <description>Blood samples were obtained during Cycle 1 at the following times relative to the investigational product administration: pre-dose, end of infusion, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours after the end of infusion. A final PK sample was collected between 30 and 48 hours after the investigational product infusion had completed. The actual time each sample was collected was captured to the nearest minute in the eCRF. Following unblinding, only those participants who had been randomized to receive casopitant were included in the PK analyses. CL for casopitant is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g. study treatment, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK product was recorded from the time a participant consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Hematology Toxicity Grade Shifts From Baseline to Toxicity Grade 3 and 4</title>
        <description>Grade shifts from Baseline were assessed as shift from any Grade to Grade 3 or Grade 4 in any cycle. Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE), version 3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. The NCI-CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each toxicity based on the following general guideline: Grade 1: Mild AE, Grade 2: Moderate AE, Grade 3: Severe AE, Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling AE and Grade 5: Death related to AE. It was assessed on Baseline (Day 1), during Day 6-10 and end of cycle. Hematology parameters assessed were hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, total neutrophils and white blood cell count. Data has been presented for the number of participants with hematology toxicity grade shifts from Baseline to toxicity grade 3 and 4 for all cycles in a consolidated format.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Chemistry Toxicity Grade Shifts From Baseline to Toxicity Grade 3 and 4</title>
        <description>Grade shifts from Baseline were assessed as shift from any Grade to Grade 3 or Grade 4 in any cycle. Toxicities were graded according to the NCI-CTCAE, version 3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. The NCI-CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each toxicity based on the following general guideline: Grade 1: Mild AE, Grade 2: Moderate AE, Grade 3: Severe AE, Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling AE and Grade 5: Death related to AE. It was assessed on Baseline (Day 1), during Day 6-10 and end of cycle. Clinical chemistry parameters assessed were alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), chloride, glucose, potassium, sodium and total bilirubin. Data has been presented for the number of participants with chemistry toxicity grade shifts from Baseline to toxicity grade 3 and 4 for all cycles in a consolidated format.</description>

        <title>Time to First Anti-emetic Rescue Medication</title>
        <description>Time to first rescue medication was defined as the length of time from initiation of oxaliplatin till the first reported use of a rescue medication. Participants withdrawing prematurely during the 120 hour assessment period without having received a rescue medication were assumed to have done so and the time of rescue medication was set to 0 hours. The first quartile for time to use of anti-emetic rescue medication was evaluated when 25th percentile of participants of MITT population reported use of anti-emetic rescue medication. Similarly, median and 75th percentile of participants of MITT population was planned to be reported. If, less than 25th percentile of participants reported use of anti-emetic rescue medication at the end of the 120 hour time period, then the observation was censored for the purpose of this analysis and in such case the data was planned to be reported as not evaluable (NA).</description>
