  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will begin to define these critical determinants for patients undergoing
      procedures in the hybrid interventional cardiology/cardiac surgery suite. In future studies,
      the data obtained from this study will be used to prospectively stratify patients in terms of
      bleeding verses thrombotic risk to design studies to optimize anticoagulation and
      anti-platelet therapies in the hybrid setting.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the association of DNA polymorphisms linked to the level of
      αβ1 integrin expression on platelets with clinical outcome in terms of bleeding or thrombotic
      complications. The association of polymorphisms in other genes such as GPVI, PAR-1, and
      COX-2, as well as PLA ½ status, will also be examined and considered in the context of other
      factors such as medications including IIb/IIIa inhibitors, anticoagulants, type of procedure,
      obesity smoking status, etc.

      Lower levels of platelet surface expression of the α2β1 integrin are associated with an
      increased risk of bleeding complications following hybrid procedures, especially when the low
      level of integrin expression is associated with other risk factors that may exacerbate
      bleeding such as vigorous anti-coagulation, aggressive anti-platelet therapy and other
      genetic risk factors that contribute to a hemorrhagic phenotype. Conversely, higher level
      expression of the α2β1 integrin is likely associated with a greater tendency to thrombotic
      complication that is again modified by other coexisting risk factors.
