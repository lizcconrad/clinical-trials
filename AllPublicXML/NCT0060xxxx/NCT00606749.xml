      The purpose of this study is to determine whether KC706 is effective in the prevention and
      healing of blisters in patients with pemphigus vulgaris, while the patient remains on stable
      doses of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants.

      The present study is designed to follow-up on pre-clinical observations that administration
      of KC706 is associated with prevention of the development of lesions in a mouse model of PV.
      Patients participating in this study will be those with active disease in spite of ongoing
      treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. The dose chosen for this
      clinical study is 300 mg once daily. The primary assessment of interest will be pemphigus
      lesion status during dosing with KC706.

          -  Diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris

          -  Patients must be taking and require either corticosteroid therapy or immunosuppressive
             therapy or both;

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy, if any,should have been administered at a stable dose for
             at least 60 days prior to the Baseline Visit and be well-tolerated, without the
             expectation that there will be a need to increase that dose during the next 30 days;

          -  Corticosteroids, if any, should have been administered at a stable dose for at least
             30 days prior to the Baseline Visit without expectation that there will be a need to
             increase that dose during the next 30 days;

          -  Patients should have active PV skin, scalp or mucosal lesions that meet at least one
             of the following criteria at the Baseline Visit:

               -  &gt; 3 new lesions/week every week in the previous 3 weeks (skin, scalp, and/or
                  mucosal), with healing occurring at a rate to match the appearance of new
                  lesions; or

               -  At least 3 active, established lesions with a Pemphigus Lesion Score of at least
