    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose finding, multiple-dose study in subjects with metastatic
      melanoma. Three dose levels of MPC-6827 will be administered with temozolomide to three
      separate cohorts. Study endpoints will include determination of the maximum tolerated dose,
      determination of dose limiting toxicities, and evaluation of evidence of anti-tumor activity
      of MPC-6827 when given with temozolomide.
