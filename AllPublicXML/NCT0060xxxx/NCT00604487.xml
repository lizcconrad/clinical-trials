  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Artificial ripening of the cervix and induction of labor remain as one of the therapeutic
      challenges in Obstetrics. The method widely used, the intravenous administration of Oxytocin,
      is associated with prolonged induction periods, a significant failure rate, and considerable
      patient discomfort. Therefore, over the years, a variety of locally applied pharmacological
      and physical ripening agents were evaluated. Currently, the commonly utilised local ripening
      agent is a Prostaglandin (PG) preparation. Although PG is being applied vaginally or
      extra-amniotically, systemic absorption of this agent is common, sometimes resulting in
      uterine hypertonicity, nausea and vomiting. In addition, both induction methods are
      associated with the initiation of uterine contractions, sometimes lasting for prolonged
      periods. Therefore a preferred induction method may be a mechanical one which will lead to
      cervical ripening without causing uterine contractions. Furthermore, there are additional
      potential advantages of mechanical methods compared to pharmacologic methods such as, ease of
      storage, low cost and less side effects. A folly catheter, inserted through the cervix,
      combined with continuous extra-amniotic NS instillation is being used for this purpose for
      many years. However this method although effective may cause uncomfortable traction of the
      balloon to the women's leg. Furthermore, dripping of saline through the cervix and vagina,
      occasionally occurs, may be annoying, and may be confused with rupture of membrane. We have
      recently introduced a newly developed balloon device (Atad Ripener Device), which was
      designed with one balloon located at the distal end of the device (the uterine balloon, U),
      while the other balloon is located 1.5 cm proximal to the first one (the cervicovaginal
      balloon, CV). Both balloons are expandable with Saline. The balloon inflated in the vagina
      provides the traction action and seals the cervix from saline leakage. Another balloon the
      AID (Atad double balloon Instillation Device) is identical to the ARD but has an additional
      long tip for instillation of normal to the extra-amniotic space. To the best of our
      knowledge, no comparison was performed between the use of the double balloon ripener device
      and folly catheter for induction of labor. Furthermore, there are no published data regarding
      the use of the double balloon instillation device (AID) combined with continuous
      extra-amniotic NS instillation. This study is designed to compare the efficacy, safety and
      side effects of mechanical methods of cervical ripening and labor induction by the double
      balloon device (ARD), the double balloon instillation device (AID) combined with continuous
      extra-amniotic instillation of normal saline and the folly catheter combined with continuous
      extra-amniotic normal saline instillation. The study aims at the accrual of 300 women (100
      randomised in each arm).
