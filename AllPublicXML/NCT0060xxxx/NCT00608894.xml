      An open-label, multi-center, prospective, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety
      and tolerability of LCP-Tacro tablets given once daily vs. azathioprine for the treatment of
      autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

      Patients with histologically confirmed chronic hepatitis who fulfill criteria established by
      the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) and Inclusion and Exclusion criteria
      will be enrolled after having signed an informed consent document.

      Up to 60 patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive treatment with LCP-Tacro + prednisone
      vs. azathioprine (AZA) + prednisone.

        -  LCP-Tacro will be started at 2 mg once daily (q.d.) with weekly measurement of
           tacrolimus whole blood trough levels and adjustment of the daily dose of LCP-Tacro to
           achieve target tacrolimus levels of 3 - 6 ng/mL. Patients with histological evidence of
           cirrhosis and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≤ 8 will commence
           LCP-Tacro at a fixed dose of 1 mg once daily, with subsequent dosage adjustments to
           maintain tacrolimus trough levels at 3 - 6 ng/mL.

        -  AZA will be started at 50 - 100 mg (approximately 1 mg/kg) once daily (q.d.).

      Patients will also commence treatment with prednisone 30 mg/day for one week, then 20 mg/day
      for one week, then 15 mg/day for two weeks, then 10 mg/day through Month 6.
