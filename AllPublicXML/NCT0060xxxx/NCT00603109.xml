    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor-1
      blocking drug, on the appetite, body weight, body fat and growth hormone level of subjects
      with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). This will be a double blind placebo controlled clinical
      trial involving a total of 18 young adults aged 18 to 35 years with PWS. Patients will be
      divided in to the two groups of control and intervention, and treated with either placebo
      (inactive drug), or rimonabant 20 mg once a day for a total duration of 6 months. Body
      weight, fat distribution, objective and subjective assessment of the hunger, fasting blood
      sample for measurement of ghrelin and leptin (two hormones regulating appetite), serum lipids
      , IGF-1(growth hormone related protein), insulin and glucose concentrations will be measured
      upon enrollment, at 3 months, and at the end of the study. The proportion of body fat to
      muscle will be determined using a radiological technique, whole body dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, and also by measurement of skin fold thickness, waist and hip
      circumference at the enrollment prior to the intervention, and at the end of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will be selected if they have Prader Willi Syndrome previously confirmed by
             standard genetic testing (the DNA methylation test) or meet the clinical diagnostic
             criteria as follows :the presence of at least four of the six principal
             characteristics of PWS syndrome including 1) infantile hypotonia, 2) abnormal pubertal
             development, 3) obesity after early infancy, 4) dysfunctional central nervous system
             performance, 5) dysmorphic facial features, and 6) short stature. In addition, they
             must have one or more of the following characteristics commonly associated with PWS:
             1) small hands and feet, 2) skin problems, 3) behavioral problems related to food, and
             4) decreased pain sensitivity.

          2. Subjects must be 18 to 35 years of age and fairly cooperative with the study protocol.

          3. Subjects must have a BMI of at least 30 or more.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of pulmonary disease.

          2. Presence of any other abnormal endocrine findings, including abnormal thyroid
             function.

          3. Presence of significant behavioral problems or psychiatric illness including anxiety
             disorder and depression, interfering with the follow up of protocol. Any degree of
             depression and moderate to severe anxiety will be exclusion criteria for this study.

          4. Subjects with Prader Willi Syndrome who are on other medications including growth
             hormone therapy, anti epileptic medications, or antipsychotic medications.

          5. The presence of moderate to severe renal or liver disease. Mild elevations of liver
             enzymes are not exclusive.

          6. Subjects who are on any other research or weight loss medication
