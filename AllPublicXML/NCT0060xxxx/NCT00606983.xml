    <textblock>
      Various adrenergic blockers are used for acute voiding difficulty after proctectomy.
      Recently, a selective alpha5-adrenergic blocker, Tamsulosin has been reported to have benefit
      in reducing urinary symptom score and in reducing the rate of intermittent
      self-catheterization for patients with rectal cancer after radical proctectomy.

      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic prevention to ameliorate the
      incidence of postoperative urinary dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      Acute voiding difficulty is caused from damage to pelvic sympathetic nerve after rectal
      surgery, and usually resolved spontaneously within several months after the surgery. However,
      acute voiding difficulty results in prolonged insertion of urinary catheter and is associated
      risk for urinary tract infection. Various adrenergic blockers are used for acute voiding
      difficulty after proctectomy. Recently, a selective alpha5-adrenergic blocker, Tamsulosin has
      been reported to have benefit in reducing urinary symptom score and in reducing the rate of
      intermittent self-catheterization for patients with rectal cancer after radical proctectomy.

      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic prevention to ameliorate teh
      incidence of postoperative urinary dysfunction.
