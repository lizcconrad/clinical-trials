  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Nosocomial Pneumonia remains to be a major complication for patients who were incubated
      with ventilation. Most cases are attributed to increased bacteria flora in oropharyngeal
      secretion and aspiration of those organisms. Research indicates that the Gram-Negative
      Bacteria grows in upper air way and trachea rapidly during the initial 2-4 hospital days and
      the dental plague also increased dramatically at the first 5 days. About 50% cases with
      prolonged intubation experienced temporal swallowing disorders and majority of them recovered
      7 days post weaning. Some evidence exist suggesting that oral care could reduce bacterial
      flora, prevent aspiration, and subsequently decrease the incidence of ventilation-associated
      pneumonia for this group of high risk patients.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized oral care protocol in
      improving oral hygiene and reducing the incidence of pneumonia on a sample of surgical
      patients at intensive care unit.
