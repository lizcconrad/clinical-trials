  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational
      drug called doxercalciferol in participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis,
      in comparison with a placebo (&quot;sugar pill&quot;). All study related care was provided including
      doctor visits, physical exams, laboratory tests and study medication. Total length of
      participation was 28 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel
      group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxercalciferol given orally, once daily
      for 24 weeks to participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Participants
      were randomized and stratified by site and Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score to one
      of three active treatment groups or to the placebo group.

    <description>Static PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale (0 = clear to 4 = severe), reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Clear (erythema: no, scale: no, induration: no thickness); Almost Clear (erythema: light pink, scale: fine scale, induration: barely palpable); Mild (erythema: light red, scale: coarse scale on most lesions, induration: slight but visible elevation, indistinct edges); Moderate (erythema: red, scale: coarse adherent scale predominates, induration: moderate elevation with edges); and Severe (erythema: dark red to purple, scale: thickened adherent scale, induration: marked thickness distinct and pronounced edges). Percentage of participants with static PGA score of clear or almost clear are reported.</description>
