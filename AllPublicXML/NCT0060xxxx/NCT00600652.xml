      Monitoring the GR with a GR-MoAb and FITC-Dex probes by FCM would be useful and convenient in
      determination GR before the steroid treatment in clinical, especially in steroid resistant
      states, in order to design more efficient clinical treatment protocols.

      In order to assess the efficacy of this method, 100 patients with nephrotic syndrome and
      systemic lupus erythematosus receiving sufficient prednisolone thereafter and 50 age- and
      sex-matched normal controls will be studied.

        one hundred patients, including 50 SLE and 50 NS, who will receive GC therapy, were
        studied. Of them, fifty were GC-resistant patients (25 male and 25 female; 20 without
        treatment and 30 relapse) and fifty were GC-sensitive ones( 25 male and 25 female; 20
        without treatment and 30 relapse ). Controls were 50 healthy volunteers (25 male and 25
        female). All participants gave their informed consent, and this investigation was approved
        by Changhai hoapital ethics committee.
