    <description>WASO was the time in minutes scored as wake between the onset of persistent sleep and lights on, where the onset of persistent sleep was the beginning of the first continuous 20 epochs (10 minute) scored as non-wake. Mean values were calculated based on 2 treatment PSG nights. The score was derived by a central polysomnography reader and was analyzed as the mean of the PSG TST recordings obtained on two consecutive nights. If only one assessment was present for a particular PSG session, the score from that one assessment was used.</description>

    <time_frame>Night 1 and Night 2 of every treatment period (Up to Day 63)</time_frame>
    <description>REM density was defined as total REM activity divided by total REM time and was recorded as Number of REMA (N) per minute. The REM activity score and total REM time were derived by a central PSG reader. This ratio was calculated first for each of the relevant polysomnography reader recordings obtained on two consecutive nights, and then REM Density was analyzed as the mean of these two ratios. If it was only possible to calculate the ratio for one of the nights in a particular polysomnography session (REM activity or Total REM time was missing for one night), the ratio from that one night was used.</description>

    <measure>Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) Score as daytime cognitive function tests on the morning following dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 2 of every treatment period (Upto Day 63)</time_frame>
    <description>The DSST test a subset of Wechsler Intelligence scale, which assesses the attention and psychomotor performance. During this test the participant needs to transcribe a geometric symbol with its corresponding Arabic number. The participant is initially shown numbers 1 to 9 and under each number there is a corresponding geometric symbol. A series of boxes with numbers on top is shown to the participant. The participants then copy the specific geometric symbol next to the number. The correct items transcribed within the time limit were used to generate the score. The range of score was 0 to 63. Higher scores were indicative of good cognitive function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal Learning Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 2 of every treatment period (upto Day 63)</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal learning and memory test comprised of four subscales including total recall, delayed recall, retention score, and recognition discrimination index. The total recall score was the number of correctly reported words in each of the 3 learning trials and the score ranged from 0 to 36. The delayed recall score was the number of correctly reported words in the delayed recall test and the score ranged from 0 to 12. The retention score represented the score on the delayed recall test divided by the higher of the recall scores from learning trials 2 and 3, multiplied by 100. It was practically ranged from 0 to 100. The recognition discrimination index (RDI) was calculated by subtracting the total false positives score (semantically-related plus semantically un-related) from the total true-positives score obtained in the delayed recognition test)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 2 of every treatment period (upto Day 63)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale evaluated the effects of the psychoactive compounds on sleep and early morning behavior. The questionnaire consisted of ten self rating; 100-mm-line analogue questions pertaining to four consecutive aspects of sleep: getting to sleep (GTS), quality of sleep (QOS), awakening from sleep (AFS) and behavior following wakefulness (BFW). Scores range between 0 and 100. Higher scores indicate better sleep and better early morning behavior. It was performed at week 8.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 2 of every treatment period (upto Day 63)</time_frame>
    <description>This was a subjective scale to evaluate alertness of the participant on a 7-point scale. where 1 is &quot;feeling active, vital, alert, wide awake&quot;, 2 is &quot;still functioning at high levels, but not peak; able to concentrate&quot;, 3 is &quot;awake, but relaxed; responsive but not fully alert&quot;, 4 is &quot;somewhat foggy, let down&quot;, 5 is &quot;foggy, losing interest in remaining awake&quot;, 6 is &quot;sleepy, woozy, fighting sleep, prefer to lie down&quot;, and 7 is &quot;no longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon, having dream like thoughts&quot;. Thus the higher values were indicative of more sleepiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with Adverse events and serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical events that jeopardize the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or a drug-induced liver injury.</description>
