  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pliaglis™ (lidocaine and tetracaine) Cream 7%/7% is a topical local anesthetic cream that
      forms a pliable peel on the skin when exposed to air. When applied to intact skin, Pliaglis
      provides local dermal analgesia by the release of lidocaine and tetracaine from the peel into
      the skin.

      Pliaglis is currently approved in the United States for use on intact skin in adults to
      provide topical local analgesia for superficial dermatological procedures such as dermal
      filler injection, pulsed dye laser therapy, and facial laser resurfacing.

      This study will evaluate lidocaine and tetracaine cream 7%/7% for the treatment of pain
      associated with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

      The objectives of the study are 1) to compare the clinical efficacy of lidocaine and
      tetracaine cream 7%/7% with placebo cream in the treatment of neuropathic pain associated
      with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and 2) to monitor the nature and frequency of adverse
      events following a single, 60-minute application of lidocaine and tetracaine cream 7%/7% and
      placebo cream.
