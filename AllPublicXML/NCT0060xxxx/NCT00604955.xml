    <textblock>
      This modular Program will first confirm the safety and efficacy of Paromomycin IM Injection
      when given to an expanded population in the outpatient setting in experienced VL centers and
      subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of an expanded access model of providing Paromomycin
      IM Injection to progressively more resource-constrained clinics in Bihar, India.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safe, effective, and affordable treatments for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) that are widely
      available to the poorest population of rural India where the disease is endemic are urgently
      needed. Resistance to antimonials, which have historically been the first line of treatment
      for VL in Bihar and adjoining states, is a major problem. Other available treatments are
      limited by their high cost, toxicity, or contraindications in certain populations.
      Paromomycin IM Injection was approved for the treatment of VL in August 2006 by the Drug
      Controller General of India (DCGI).

      The study is designed to establish a Phase 4 Access Program in a modular, stepwise fashion
      (Modules 1 to 3). The study will first confirm the safety and efficacy of Paromomycin IM
      Injection in an expanded VL population treated as an outpatient in experienced centers
      (Module 1); and then progressively extend the network of treatment facilities, the number and
      reach of the trained staff, and the implementation of the requisite logistics systems to
      rural Bihar (Modules 2 and 3). An expanded network of healthcare workers will be trained and
      supervised to make a preliminary diagnosis of VL; to make appropriate referrals to confirm
      the diagnosis of VL; to treat with Paromomycin IM Injection; and to assess patient safety and
      clinical response on an outpatient basis.
