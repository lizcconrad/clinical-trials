  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of Open Door (previously known as the
      Treatment Initiation Program [TIP]), a brief psychosocial intervention to address the
      psychological barriers to care and improve the use of mental health services by depressed
      community elderly. The intervention is designed to help the older adult identify the
      barriers, problem-solve to find solutions and mobilize the motivation to seek help. Open Door
      was developed to work collaboratively with an older adult who is depressed to improve access
      and adherence to mental health treatment.

      The primary aim of this research study did not change from the original application; it is to
      conduct a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of a brief, psychosocial
      intervention on engagement in mental health care among homebound depressed older adults.
      Engagement is defined as accepting a referral and attending a visit with a provider who could
      provide traditional mental health care (medication or psychotherapy). The intervention, now
      called Open Door, was developed to work collaboratively with an older adult who has
      depressive symptoms to address the barriers to care with the aim of helping them consider a
      referral and engage in mental health care. In prior research, this intervention has been
      found to improve treatment participation, reduce depressive symptoms and increase adherence
      to antidepressant therapy among depressed older adults in primary care and outpatient
      psychiatric settings. We propose that Open Door will improve the access to mental health care
      by reducing psychological barriers, providing education about care, and managing the
      resignation associated with the symptoms of depression among community dwelling depressed
      elders. Additionally, we believe that despite the heterogeneity of mental health care that
      may be received, Open Door will be associated with reduced depressive symptoms by empowering
      the older adult to initiate care for him/herself.

    <measure>The Primary Outcome is Engagement Defined as at Least One Visit With a Mental Health Provider Who Can Offer Treatment of Depression.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement was defined as at least one visit with a mental health provider, due to the fact that in some treatment settings, the initial evaluation and the onset of treatment both took place in the first visit.
The primary outcome, engagement, was counted if the participant had engaged in mental health treatment by EITHER 12 weeks OR 24 weeks, based on research suggesting that older adults may take up to 6 months to follow through on a referral.
Therefore, while there is only a single primary outcome (engaged or not), it could be fulfilled at either of the two follow-up time points, at 12 or 24 weeks.</description>

        <title>The Primary Outcome is Engagement Defined as at Least One Visit With a Mental Health Provider Who Can Offer Treatment of Depression.</title>
        <description>Engagement was defined as at least one visit with a mental health provider, due to the fact that in some treatment settings, the initial evaluation and the onset of treatment both took place in the first visit.
The primary outcome, engagement, was counted if the participant had engaged in mental health treatment by EITHER 12 weeks OR 24 weeks, based on research suggesting that older adults may take up to 6 months to follow through on a referral.
Therefore, while there is only a single primary outcome (engaged or not), it could be fulfilled at either of the two follow-up time points, at 12 or 24 weeks.</description>
