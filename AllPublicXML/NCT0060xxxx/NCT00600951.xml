    <textblock>
      The objective of this long-term study is to prospectively compare the incidence of NSF in two
      cohorts (Cohort 1 - patients with moderate chronic kidney disease eGFR 30 to 59 and Cohort 2
      - patients with severe chronic kidney disease or kidney failure eGFR &lt;30).

        A total of 1000 patients in 2 cohorts who are going to receive or have received MULTIHANCE
        during an MRI examination as part of their routine clinical management. The cohorts are
        defined as:

        COHORT 1 - 600 patients of any age, with moderate CKD (stage 3, i.e., with eGFR stably
        comprised between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2); COHORT 2 - 400 patients of any age, with severe
        CKD or kidney failure (stages 4 and 5, i.e., with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m2).

          -  Has CKD with eGFR stably comprised between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73m2, as calculated from
             a SCr value obtained from the local laboratory within 24 hours prior to the MULTIHANCE
             injection.

          -  Provides written informed consent and is willing to comply with protocol requirements.

        OR

        COHORT 2

          -  Has CKD with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m2, as calculated from a SCr value obtained from
             the local laboratory within 24 hours prior to the MULTIHANCE injection.

          -  Provides written informed consent and is willing to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Is unable or unwilling to return for necessary office visits, to be examined by
             dermatologists or to undergo deep skin biopsy should development of NSF be suspected.

        OR

        COHORT 2

          -  Has received a GBCA within the past 12 months prior to inclusion in this study;
