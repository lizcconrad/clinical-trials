    <textblock>
      There is a great need for the development of sensitive outcomes that allow experimental drugs
      to be tested in human subjects more efficiently. If we could more precisely measure whether
      an experimental drug slows the progression of ALS or other neuromuscular diseases, this would
      allow more drugs to be tested quicker and at less expense. We have developed a new device
      that accurately measures isometric strength called: Accurate Test of Limb Isometric Strength
      (ATLIS). This device was designed to be portable, quick, and easy to use, while generating
      accurate and reliable, interval level data. This study will enable us to test the reliability
      and validity of ATLIS.
