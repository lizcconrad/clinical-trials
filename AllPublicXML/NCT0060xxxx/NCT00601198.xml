  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of amifostine (ETHYOL) on decreasing the
      rate and severity of nerve dysfunction or neuropathy (numbness and tingling in hands and
      feet) associated with FOLFOX chemotherapy.

      In addition, this study will provide information on how subjects with colorectal cancer do
      while receiving amifostine in combination with other chemotherapy drugs. This study will also
      look at the frequency of complications associated with amifostine and chemotherapy.

      The FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen consists of three drugs, 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin,
      all given intravenously (into the vein) every 2 weeks with or without Avastin given in
      combination with chemotherapy. FOLFOX has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of cancer of the colon or rectum.

      Amifostine is not a chemotherapy drug. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) to prevent moderate or severe dryness of the mouth caused by radiation treatment for
      head and neck cancer, and to prevent kidney damage caused by cisplatin chemotherapy treatment
      for ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer. Amifostine is not FDA approved for use in this
      study and is therefore considered investigational.

    <description>The chemotherapy regimen will be given for 2 consecutive days. On day #1, pt. will be premedicated with drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting in addition to intravenous fluids. Then they will receive amifostine intravenously followed by oxaliplatin, 5FU and leucovorin. This will be followed by an infusion of 5FU given in a pump over 22 hours. If the doctor decides on giving the pt. Avastin, this will be given on day #1. On day #2, they will receive the same treatment except for oxaliplatin.</description>
