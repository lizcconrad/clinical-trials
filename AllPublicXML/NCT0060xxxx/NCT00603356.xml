  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose of OSI-930 and Erlotinib.

      Patients may continue to receive OSI-930 and Erlotinib until one of the following occurs:
      disease progression, adverse event requiring withdrawal, failure to recover from toxicity
      despite a 14-day dosing interruption, medical or ethical reasons, patient request, or patient
      death.
