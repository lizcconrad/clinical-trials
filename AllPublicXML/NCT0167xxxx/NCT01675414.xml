      The purpose of this research study is to help us learn if children with Autism Spectrum
      Disorder (ASD) have gastrointestinal (stomach and intestine) problems more frequently than
      children without ASD do. The investigators hope to learn if children with ASD and
      gastrointestinal (GI) disorders have certain Problem Behaviors (PB), such as self-injury and
      aggression, more than children with ASD but no GI disorders do. The investigators want to
      learn if the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (GIQ) can help us tell which children
      with ASD also have gastrointestinal disorders.

      Hypothesis 1: Children with ASD exhibit high rates of symptomatic GI dysfunction that are not
      identified by current diagnostic evaluation.

      Hypothesis 2: Painful or discomfort-causing gastrointestinal dysfunctions contribute to an
      elevated incidence or severity of PB in an identifiable subpopulation of PB-expressing
      children. The investigators anticipate that the proposed study will raise the standard of
      medical care for children with ASD by improving current methods of identifying GI dysfunction
      and determining whether there is a significant relationship between GI dysfunction and PB in
      this population.
