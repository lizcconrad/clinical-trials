  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to utilize flavoprotein fluorescence and fundus autofluorescence
      to detect progression of Stargardt macular dystrophy in a pediatric population over the
      course of a year with the hope of aiding future therapeutic risk-benefit decisions and
      assessment of outcomes.

      Stargardt macular dystrophy is the most common of the juvenile-onset macular dystrophies.
      Despite determination of ABCA4 as the causative gene, clinicians have been challenged by
      variability in clinical phenotypes. Given the recent initiation of clinical trials to assess
      novel treatments (e.g. gene therapy), there is a need to identify patients with the worst
      prognosis.

      The investigators have observed that pediatric patients lose central visual function faster
      than their adult counterparts. Thus, they present an ideal cohort with which to determine the
      utility of novel modalities to detect early change. These include flavoprotein fluorescence,
      a new imaging technique for detecting mitochondrial dysfunction developed at the University
      of Michigan. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is another commonly utilized technique of
      evaluating hereditary eye diseases. The investigators have developed a novel means of
      quantifying FAF signatures that will allow documentation of severity as well as detection of
      progression.

      This study will evaluate whether more sophisticated testing and analytic methodologies,
      including fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and a novel non-invasive method to measure retinal
      flavoprotein fluorescence (FPF) may be used to better predict Stargardt macular dystrophy
      progression and monitor treatment effects than conventional modalities such visual acuity and
      visual field. This method involves the use of novel statistical methods to assess the
      heterogeneity of fundus autofluorescence images.

      Participants will complete 3 visits to the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center. Each
      visit will take approximately 2.5 hours. The initial visit will include a routine clinical
      eye examination, measurement of best-corrected visual acuity, indirect ophthalmoscopy,
      microperimetry, frequency-domain optical coherence tomography, Goldmann visual fields, fundus
      flavoprotein fluorescence (FPF) imaging, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and fundus
      photography. Patients will return for evaluation at 6 and 12 months after their initial visit
      to repeat testing and imaging.
