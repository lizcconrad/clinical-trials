    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Irinotecan is a drug that is used to treat colon or rectal cancer. It affects the
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of growing cancer cells. It is most often used with other
      chemotherapy drugs. Researchers want to test it with an experimental drug, ISIS 183750. They
      want to see if the drugs are a safe and effective treatment for advanced solid tumors or
      colorectal cancer that has not responded to other treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of ISIS 183750 with irinotecan for advanced solid
      tumors or colorectal cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors or colorectal cancer that has
      not responded to other treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will also be collected. Tumor tissue samples may be collected as well before and
           after treatment. Imaging studies will also be performed.

        -  Participants will take ISIS 183750 once a week for 28-day cycles of treatment. On the
           first cycle, they will also have ISIS 183750 on days 3 and 5.

        -  Participants will take irinotecan every second week, beginning on day 15 of the first
           cycle.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  Treatment will continue as long as the cancer does not grow and the side effects are not
           severe.

      Background:

      The eukaryotic translation initiation factor - eIF4E - is a potent oncogene that is found to
      be dysregulated in approximately 30% of human cancers. Upregulation of eIF4E is an early
      event in colorectal cancer (CRC) and correlates with CRC progression. ISIS 183750 is a
      second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to inhibit the production of the
      human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) protein.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      To establish Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and establish safety for the combination of ISIS
      183750 and irinotecan in advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate Response Rate, Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) for
           the combination of ISIS 183750 and irinotecan in advanced irinotecan-refractory
           colorectal cancer.

        -  To perform correlative studies to evaluate the effect of eIF4E inhibition on relevant
           regulated proteins and immune cells.

        -  To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for ISIS 183750 in the
           absence and presence of irinotecan

        -  To characterize the plasma PK parameters for irinotecan in the presence of ISIS 183750

      Eligibility:

      -Adult patients with irinotecan-resistant colorectal cancer (or advanced solid tumor in phase
      I part).

      Design:

        -  This is a single-arm phase I/II study whereby all patients will receive the combination
           of ISIS 183750 and irinotecan. All cycles are 28 days.

        -  Cycle 1 only: ISIS 183750 will be administered intravenously on Cycle 1 Days 1, 3, 5, 8,
           15 and 22.

        -  Cycle 2 and beyond: ISIS 183750 will be administered as an intravenous infusion every
           week without break, i.e. Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients will be
           re-staged every 8 weeks.

        -  Irinotecan will be administered at a dose of 160mg/m^2 as an intravenous infusion every
           second week commencing on Day 15 of Cycle 1. The primary endpoint of the study will be
           to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of ISIS 183750 and
           irinotecan in advanced solid tumors. The phase II portion of the study will be confined
           to irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer. Irinotecan-refractory will be defined as
           patients who have radiological evidence of disease progression whilst receiving
           irinotecan or within 3 months after completing it.

        -  Correlative studies will comprise: Mandatory pre- and post- dose biopsies for eIF4e
           messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein (IHC) analysis will be performed in the
           phase II portion of the study; Immune subsets; positron emission tomography (PET)
           responses (only in expansion cohort); Pharmacokinetic data regarding the interaction of
           irinotecan and ISIS183750 in 10-12 patients.

          -  The effects of ISIS 183750 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception

             for 16 weeks post- last dose due to sperm life cycle. Should a woman become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,

             cancer within 4 weeks prior to starting ISIS 183750.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
             Patients with clinically significant ascites, pleural effusion, and/or peripheral
             edema, unless the ascites or pleural effusion occurred as a result of malignancy.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy
             are excluded from this study due to the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions
             between antiretroviral medications and the investigational agent.

          -  Known hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.

          -  Pregnancy and breast feeding are exclusion factors. Enrolled patients must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)

        <description>Objective response was evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete Response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% reduction in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of athe diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more lesions is also considered progression).</description>

        <population>Only 6/10 participants in Phase I, Dose Level II and 9/10 participants in Phase II were evaluable for response. Per protocol, no responses were to be reported for the Phase I Dose Level I Arm because the participants have different histologies, thus there are no objective responses for Phase I Dose Level I.</population>
