      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, 28 week extension study to evaluate the long-term
      safety and tolerability of ABT-126 in subjects who complete dosing through Week 24 of Study
      M10-985. Up to 410 subjects may participate at approximately 30 sites in several countries.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - The subject and caregiver must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent. If the
        subject does not have the capacity to provide informed consent, full informed consent must
        be obtained from the subject's representative and assent must be obtained from the subject.
        - The subject was randomized into Study M10-985 and completed dosing through Week 24 in
        that study. - With the exception of a diagnosis of mild to moderate AD and the presence of
        stable medical conditions, the subject is in general good health, based upon the results of
        medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory profile, and a 12-lead ECG.
        - If male, the subject is surgically sterile (vasectomy, is sexually inactive, or is using
        a barrier method of birth control (condom) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository
        for the duration of the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug.
        However, if the male subject's partner has been postmenopausal for at least 2 years or is
        surgically sterile, then use of a barrier method of birth control is not required. - The
        subject has an identified, reliable caregiver who will provide support and ensure
        compliance with the study medication and procedures, and provide accurate information about
        the subject's status during the study. - The subject and caregiver must have sufficient
        visual, hearing and graphomotor skills to complete the study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Experienced an adverse event or abnormal finding in physical examination, vital signs,
        laboratory profile and/or ECG measurements in Study M10-985 that indicates the subject
        could become medically unstable during the current study. - The subject is currently taking
        or is expected to be prescribed any excluded medications (including acetylcholinesterase
        inhibitors or memantine), without the approval of Abbott medical monitor. - The subject
        anticipates a move outside the geographic area of the investigative site or is planning
        extended travel inconsistent with the recommended visit intervals. - The subject is
        currently enrolled in, or plans to participate in, another experimental study during the
        course of this trial. - The subject developed any significant medical or psychiatric
        condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, renders the subject an unsuitable
        candidate to participate in this study. - For any other reason the investigator considers
        the subject to be an unsuitable candidate to receive ABT-126 or to participate in this
        study.
