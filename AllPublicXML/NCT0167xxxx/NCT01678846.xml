      The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of the Good Schools Toolkit is
      effective in reducing violence against children in primary schools.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Violence against children has profound effects on both children's health and their ability to
      do well at school. Fear, anxiety and injuries caused by violence may play a large role in
      both children's absenteeism and low educational achievement, and there is increasing interest
      from large bilateral donors in investigating this link in low income countries. The Good
      School Toolkit has been developed and refined for 6 years in Uganda by Raising Voices. The
      toolkit takes a systemic approach, involving an entire school in a process of change to
      reduce violence and improve teaching techniques. The Toolkit draws on the Transtheoretical
      Model and incorporates standard behaviour change techniques such as setting a goal and making
      an action plan, which are effective in modifying behaviour. This study aims to determine
      whether use of the Good School Toolkit reduces children's experience of violence by school
      staff. The investigators will also examine the effects of the Toolkit on children's
      educational outcomes, mental health and well-being.

      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial in 40 primary schools in
      Luwero District, Uganda. More than 3500 children in Primary 5, 6 and 7 will be surveyed (aged
      about 11-16 years). Half of the schools will receive the Toolkit, and other half will be put
      on a waiting list to receive the Toolkit at the end of the study. The results from this
      evaluation will be used to brief policy-makers within the Ministry of Education and Sports
      involved in developing country-wide policy and practice around violence against children in
      schools.

I feel that my teachers care about me. I feel safe in school. I feel like I belong at school. I like to spend time at school. I am scared of my teachers (reverse coded). Scores summed, modelled as a continuous variable. Range 0 (low) to 15 (high). Higher score is better safety and well-being at school.</description>

    <description>The Toolkit uses a six step process to create a school wide intervention that engages teachers, students, administration, and parents to reflect on how they can promote quality of education in their school. The Toolkit articulates complex ideas (what is a good learning environment, a good teacher, how to create positive discipline without using violence) through booklets, posters and school initiated learning processes. Specific modules on alternative discipline techniques and how staff can use positive discipline are included in the Toolkit. The intervention includes sessions on knowledge, attitudes and opportunities to practice new behavioural skills. Work is led by teachers and students, and supported by visits from Raising Voices staff. The Toolkit can be reviewed at (http://www.raisingvoices.org/children/good_school_toolkit.php).</description>

Good School Toolkit: The Toolkit uses a six step process to create a school wide intervention that engages teachers, students, administration, and parents to reflect on how they can promote quality of education in their school. The Toolkit articulates complex ideas (what is a good learning environment, a good teacher, how to create positive discipline without using violence) through booklets, posters and school initiated learning processes. Specific modules on alternative discipline techniques and how staff can use positive discipline are included in the Toolkit. The intervention includes sessions on knowledge, attitudes and opportunities to practice new behavioural skills. Work is led by teachers and students, and supported by visits from Raising Voices staff. The Toolkit can be reviewed at (http://www.raisingvoices.org/children/good_school_toolkit.php).</description>
