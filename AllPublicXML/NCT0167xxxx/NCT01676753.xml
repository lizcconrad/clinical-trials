  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)) of weekly dinaciclib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced
      breast cancer. Once this is defined, dose expansion will be performed at this MTD in patients
      with metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable triple negative breast cancer, to
      evaluate the efficacy of combined dinaciclib and pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase Ib trial of weekly dinaciclib in combination with every 3 week
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer. Any number of prior
      therapies is allowed. Pembrolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks at a fixed dose of 200
      mg IV. Dinaciclib will be administered D1 and D8 of a 21 day cycle by 2-hour intravenous
      infusion. The starting dose level of this study will be dinaciclib 12 mg/m2 in combination
      withpembrolizumab 200 mg IV. The dose of dinaciclib will be escalated following a toxicity
      probabilily interval (TPI) design which targets a DLT rate of ~ 25% . The primary objective
      is to define the maximum tolerated and recommended phase 2 dose (MTD and RP2D) of dinaciclib
      when given weekly in this combination and schedule. The primary endpoint is safety and
      tolerability. MTD will be defined in at least 6 patients. Secondary objectives include
      evaluation of the preliminary efficacy of this combination using RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST.
      Exploratory studies characterizing and correlating PDL-1 and MYC overexpression with clinical
      response will be performed. Tumor biopsies are mandatory unless otherwise specified.
