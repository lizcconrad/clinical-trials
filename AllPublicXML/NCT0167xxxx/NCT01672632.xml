  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that large fat cells are associated with more risks for insulin resistance
      and more cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol or triglycerides.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at fat cell size and how it affects fat deposition, insulin resistance
      and muscle oxidative capacity. A comparison will be made with the differences between
      participants with larger versus smaller fat cells in insulin resistance and blood levels of
      lipids. The study will also determine if characteristics of fat cells and muscle can predict
      the development of weight gain-induced insulin resistance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the effect of 8-weeks 40% high fat overfeeding in 40 healthy, young adults on adipose and skeletal muscle characteristics, ectopic fat accumulation, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic flexibility.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>This study will investigate how fat cell size (independent of total fat mass) affects metabolic outcomes of overfeeding, including changes in fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and muscle oxidative capacity. It has been shown that large fat cells relative to fat mass are associated with higher risks for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</description>

    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure and monitor the natural hormone insulin becomes less effective at lowering blood sugars. The resulting increase in blood glucose may raise levels outside the normal range and cause adverse heealth effects, depending on dietary conditions or sensitivity of cells to insulin.</description>

    <time_frame>10 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure and heart rate measurement: An automatic BP monitoring device (Mortara® Ambulo 2400) for ambulatory use was attached to a BP cuff to obtain blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) readings at 30-min intervals during the day (6:30 AM to 9:30 PM) and 60-min intervals at night (10 PM to 6 AM) while the participants went about their activities. Data were downloaded into the database at the end of the 7-day recording span for a chronobiological analysis. This was done at baseline, post-overfeeding and at 3 months.</description>

    <description>Endothelial function testing: Assessment of resting endothelial function was done with the participant in a fasting state, after having avoided stimulants (caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, exercise) for 12 hours, at the same fixed clock hour (range 8-10 AM), using the EndoPAT 2000 device manufactured by ITAMAR Medical®.</description>
