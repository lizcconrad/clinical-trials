      Primary Objective:

      Part A - Monotherapy:

      - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR260301 administered as monotherapy and
      either on a once or twice daily schedule, to patients with advanced solid tumors or
      lymphomas.

      Part B - Combination:

      - To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR260301 administered in combination with
      the recommended standard dosage of vemurafenib to patients with unresectable / metastatic
      v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF)-mutated melanoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the overall safety and tolerability profile of SAR260301 administered as
           monotherapy (Part A) and in combination with vemurafenib (Part B).

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR260301 administered as
           monotherapy (Part A) and in combination with vemurafenib (Part B) as well as vemurafenib
           PK in combination with SAR260301 (Part B)

        -  To evaluate food effect on SAR260301 PK (Part A)

        -  To assess preliminary antitumor activity according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
           Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1 criteria).

        -  To assess preliminary antitumor activity using volumetric computed tomography (CT) or
           magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of SAR260301 on blood and tumor.

        -  To evaluate PK/PD relationships.

        -  To identify the recommended phase 2 dose of SAR260301 in combination with vemurafenib
           (RP2D) (Part B only)

        -  To assess potential induction effect of SAR260301 on cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A
           (CYP3A) (Part A)

      Study duration for one patient will include a period for inclusion (screening period) of up
      to 4 weeks, a treatment period of at least 4 weeks, and a end-of-study visit at 30 days
      following the last administration of study drug. The patient may continue treatment until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or willingness to stop, followed by a minimum of
      30-days follow-up.
