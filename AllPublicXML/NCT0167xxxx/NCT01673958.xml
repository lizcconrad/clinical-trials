      The aim of the present project is to compare the acute and chronic effect of stair descending
      versus stair ascending exercise on muscle damage and performance in elderly males with
      chronic heart failure.

      Study design:

      Twelve elderly males with chronic heart failure, New York Heart Association class I-II, will
      participate in this study. Participants will be allocated into two equally-sized groups: a
      stair descending group (n = 6) and a stair ascending group (n = 6). At the beginning of the
      study, the volunteers will perform an acute bout of stair descending or stair ascending
      exercise on an automatic escalator (4 sets of 3 min each, speed will be set at 45
      steps∙min-1). Step height will be 20.5 mm. Before and at day 2 post exercise, physiologic
      measurements will be performed and blood samples will be collected. Then, participants will
      carry out six weeks of stair descending or ascending training consisting of three exercise
      sessions per week (the first two weeks the speed will be set at 45 steps∙min-1, the next two
      weeks at 50 steps∙min-1 and the last two weeks at 55 steps∙min-1 for both groups). Afterward,
      they will repeat the acute stair descending or ascending protocol, as carried out at the
      beginning of the study, and the same physiologic measurements will be performed and blood
      samples will be collected.

      Measurements:

      Isometric (at 90 knee flexion), concentric and eccentric peak torque at 60o∙s-1of quadriceps
      femoris, pain-free range of motion, delayed onset muscle soreness and creatine kinase will be
      measured.

    <description>An isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex, Ronkonkoma, NY) will be used for the measurement of isometric, eccentric and concentric knee extensor peak torque at 90° knee flexion. The average of the three best maximal voluntary contractions with their dominant leg will be recorded. In order to ensure that the subjects provide their maximal effort, the measurements will be repeated if the difference between the lower and the higher torque value exceeded 10%. There will be two minutes rest between isometric efforts.</description>

    <measure>Pain free range of motion (degrees)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and at day 2 post exercise at the first and sixth week of training</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of pain-free ROM will be performed manually using the the isokinetic dynamometer. The investigator will move the calf at a very low angular velocity from 0 knee extension to the position where the subject will feel any discomfort.</description>

    <measure>Creatine kinase, CK (activity IU)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and at day 2 post exercise at the first and sixth week of training</time_frame>
    <description>CK activity will be measured as a general indicator of muscle damage.It will be measured in a Cobas Integra Plus 400 chemistry analyzer.</description>

    <measure>Delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMS (scale 1-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and at day 2 post exercise at the first and sixth week of training</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will assess delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) during squat movement (90o knee flexion) and perceived soreness will be rated on a scale ranging from 1 (normal) to 10 (very sore).</description>
