  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of bitopertin in combination with SSRI in participants with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. Participants will be randomized to receive either bitopertin
      30 milligrams (mg) or bitopertin 10 mg or placebo orally daily in addition to their
      background therapy with an SSRI. Participants will be allocated to one of two strata.
      Participants in Stratum 1 will start study drug on Day 1. Participants in Stratum 2 will
      receive placebo from Day 1 (placebo lead-in) and will then start study drug at the Week 2
      visit. Participants in both strata will receive the study drug in addition to their
      background therapy with an SSRI until Week 16.
