  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is one side effect of breast cancer treatment. Measuring the edematous limb
      enables monitoring changes in the lymphedema and the effect of treatment. Circumference
      measurement using a measuring tape is an inexpensive simple method and therefore useful and
      widespread in clinical practice. Circumference measurement performance varies amongst
      therapists and lacks uniformity in the literature. To date, the effect of different limb
      positions on measurement results has not been examined.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe 1) the effect of position on upper limb
      volume measurement by using circumference measurement and 2) to examine whether the
      difference between positions are similar in the upper limbs of the same woman, and 3) between
      groups of women who are in the intensive phase, in the maintenance phase of lymphedema
      treatment and women without lymphedema

      Study design: Analytical cross section study Population: Inclusion criteria: 15 women who
      have completed breast cancer treatments, with a diagnosis of unilateral arm lymphedema, in
      the intensive phase of lymphedema treatment; 15 women who have completed breast cancer
      treatment and are in the maintenance phase of lymph edema treatment and 15 healthy women
      adjusted in age and BMI. Exclusion criteria: active cancer, cardiovascular disorder, wounds
      or inflammation in the measured upper limb, and illness with fever.

      Research tools: Questionnaire to gather personal details, information about the cancer and
      the lymphedema. Plastic, retractable measuring tape with an accuracy of 1 mm. Fixed points on
      the limb are measured according to anatomical landmarks and afterwards the limb volume is
      calculated using the formula for a truncated cone.
