  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover clinical
      trial looking at whether gabapentin can provide symptom relief for chronic irritability in
      neurologically impaired children. The investigators hypothesize gabapentin ins beneficial and
      safe for children with chronic irritability that persists despite identification and
      appropriate management of symptom sources.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design of the effects of
      gabapentin on chronic irritability in neurologically impaired children. The study will
      involve a 22 day medication titration, followed by a 7 day stable dosing period and a 6 day
      medication taper period. After an additional 3 day washout period, the subject will
      cross-over to the remaining arm of the study. Subjects will be evaluated for symptoms of
      chronic pain. Since the subjects are generally non-communicative, the subjects will be
      evaluated by two questionnaires and the Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Revised,
      to be completed by their parent or primary caregiver.

      The primary aim is to determine if gabapentin provides symptom relief for chronic
      irritability in neurologically impaired children.

    <description>We will determine whether gabapentin provides symptom relief for chronic irritability in neurologically impaired children, who continue to have irritability even though potential sources may have been identified and treated, or have sources that have not been identified.</description>

    <measure>Prevalence of associated gastrointestinal and sleep problems in neurologically impaired children and improvement using gabapentin.</measure>
    <time_frame>Compiled data reviewed at completion or withdrawal from study (3 months from beginning study).</time_frame>
    <description>We will attempt to identify gastrointestinal and sleep problems in neurologically impaired children with questionnaires given throughout the study. We hypothesize that gastrointestinal symptoms (feeding intolerance and symptoms associated with gas and bowel movements) and disrupted sleep are frequently associated with chronic irritability and will improve with gabapentin.</description>

    <description>The active drug is in a flavored glycerin based solution. The drug will be given orally or through a gastrointestinal tube. Titration up to a stable dose will take 22 days. The total stable dose is 40mg/kg/day. Once 7 days on this dose are finished, children will take 6 days to reduce their dose and begin their 3 day washout period.</description>
