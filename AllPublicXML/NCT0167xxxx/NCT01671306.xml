  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monocyte heterogeneity in peripheral blood seems to be important in coronary collateral
      development in non-diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease. Our aim in this
      study is to find out any possible relationship between the levels of circulating monocyte
      subsets and coronary collateral development in type 2 diabetic patients.

    <textblock>
      83 diabetic patients with severe coronary artery disease were enrolled in the study. These
      patients were investigated according to their collateral development. Monocytes and their
      subtypes, namely CD14++CD16- and CD14+CD16+ cells were compared in 2 groups

        The study population consisted of 83 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients who have
        undergone coronary angiography because of stable symptoms and signs of coronary artery
        disease. The main inclusion criterion was the presence of &gt;95% stenosis of at least one
        major coronary artery in their first coronary angiogram.
