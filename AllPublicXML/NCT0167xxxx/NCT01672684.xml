      This randomized phase I trial studies at-home group video calling sessions in quality of life
      in rural patients with breast cancer. At-home group video calling support sessions may
      improve the well-being and quality of life of women who have breast cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine whether delivering at-home professionally-led breast cancer support using group
      video calling is feasible, acceptable and satisfactory for women in rural northern
      California.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of using on-line tools to recruit, screen, treat, and assess
      this population for a subsequent randomized clinical trial.

      III. Assess whether the rate of recruitment of women in this region in this study using
      predominantly on-line means of recruitment can be improved over that of the previous study
      using predominantly face-to-face means of recruitment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate effect size changes in measures of quality of life (post-traumatic stress
      disorder symptoms, depression symptoms, perceived stress, and positive states of mind),
      satisfaction with social support, and self-efficacy for coping with cancer.

      II. Prescribe sample size. III. Perform I and II for all of these outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (experimental arm): Participants complete at-home group video calling sessions for 1
      1/2 hours once weekly for 8 weeks.

      ARM II (control arm): Participants receive an educational workbook journal.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 1 week.

    <description>The major criterion for determining feasibility is to determine whether we can recruit rural women with breast cancer more rapidly using predominantly on-line procedures in this study than in our previous study that predominantly used face-to-face procedures. The qualitative data for determining the feasibility will be collected during the at-home group video calling sessions and from women's interviews conducted at the end of the study. Will be assessed using mixed methods.</description>
