  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant use of fibrin glue (FG) in the fistula tract has been shown to promote closure of
      low-output ECFs. The primary objectives of this study are to compare the clinical efficacy,
      safety of autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue (PRFG) and a commercially available fibrin
      sealant Bioseal® in the management of patients with low-output volume ECFs.

      -  This is a prospective, randomized, single-centered study clinical, safety and economic
           outcome of ECFs patients.

        -  Subjects are randomized to one of 2 groups:

             -  Group 1: Autologous PRFG-treatment (PRFG + SOC)

             -  Group 2: Commercial FG-treatment (Bioseal® + SOC)

        -  Study will include three phases:

             -  Phase 1: Screening, consent and enrollment

             -  Phase 2: Patients will receive either PRFG, or Bioseal only for 14 days

             -  Phase 3: Follow up: for patients with closed fistula within 14 days, we will follow
                up them for 6 months. For patients whose fistulas were still open will be treated
                with other therapeutic option and follow up for 6 months after closure.

    <description>As described in our previous study, platelet-rich cryoprecipitate and thrombin were obtained from 300-400ml whole blood of each patient enrolled in the autologous PRFG(platelet-rich fibrin glue) group and then frozen at -20°C for storage. Prior to application, frozen cryoprecipitate and thrombin stored were thawed in a 37°C water bath. Aminomethylbenzoic Acid (1ml: 1mg, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added into the cryoprecipitate in the volume ratio of 1:10.</description>

    <description>The commercial fibrin sealants used in the study were purchased from Guangzhou Bioseal Biotech Co. Ltd, Guangzhou, China. Upon application, two components, fibrinogen and thrombin, were placed separately in two syringes which were joined by a Y-shaped connector. The trunk of the Y-shaped connecter was connected to a single lumen catheter.</description>

    <description>A forward-viewing fistula-fiberscope (EndoView, Outai Medical Equipment, Shanghai, China), with 15cm length and 5mm width of fiber optical wire, was inserted into the fistula tract to accomplish endoscopic visualization. Briefly, the fistula-fiberscope assisted procedure was carried out percutaneously, allowing the exposure of internal hole and the whole tracts, followed by insertion of this catheter with distal mixing device. Upon injection, two components, fibrinogen and thrombin, were mixed together in the mixing reservoir and yield a gelatin-like glue. This procedure was repeated in patients up to 3 times within 14-day FG treatment period.</description>
