  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to examine the safety of the study drug in patients with
      locally advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study team would like to know
      about any side effects a patient may have when given the study drug. Another goal of the
      study is to determine if combining dendritic cells and the study drug can be possibly used as
      a vaccine for this disease. Dendritic cells are cells that are present in the body's immune
      system that help your body fight disease.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each of the following criteria must be met in order for a patient to be considered eligible
        for enrollment.

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma that is locally advanced and unresectable. Patients with endocrine or
             neuroendocrine tumors, lymphoma of the pancreas, or ampullary cancer are not eligible.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. One or more tumors measurable on
             CT scan per RECIST 1.1. (Eisenhauer)

          -  Patients may have had prior cancer therapy. Patients do not need to demonstrate
             progression to be considered for this trial.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patient must have an expected life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  Signed, written IRB-approved informed consent.

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal (CTCAE Grade 2 baseline)

          -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN (CTCAE Grade 1 baseline)

          -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 XULN (CTCAE Grade 1 baseline)

          -  Acceptable hematologic status, defined as:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 cells/mm3

          -  Platelet count ≥ 75,000 (plt/mm3), (CTCAE Grade 1 baseline)

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL.

          -  Urinalysis with no clinically significant abnormalities.

          -  PT and PTT ≤ 1.5 X ULN after correction of nutritional deficiencies that may
             contribute to prolonged PT/PTT

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Each of the following criteria should not be present in order for the patient to be
        considered eligible for enrollment.

          -  Patients must not have metastatic disease. Patients with evidence of metastatic
             disease at the time of screening or prior to the administration of DC vaccination will
             be considered a screen failure and excluded from study.

          -  Prior surgery is allowed provided at least 14 days has elapsed between surgery and
             registration. Prior radiation/chemo is allowed provided that at least 28 days have
             elapsed since the last treatment.

          -  Patients must not have any serious uncontrolled acute or chronic medical condition
             that would interfere with this treatment. Examples would include active acute or
             chronic infection requiring antibiotics, uncontrolled cardiovascular, endocrine, or
             infectious disease.

          -  Patient must not have clinically significant ascites.

          -  Patients must not have significant ongoing cardiac problems, myocardial infarction
             within the last six months, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, uncontrolled
             arrhythmia or congestive heart failure.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are not eligible. However, brain-imaging studies
             are not required for eligibility if the patient has no neurologic signs or symptoms.
             If brainimaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease. Patients
             must have no plans to receive concurrent chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy,
             immunotherapy or any other type of therapy for treatment of cancer while on this
             protocol treatment.

          -  Due to the undetermined effect of this treatment regimen in patients with HIV-1
             infection and the potential for serious interaction with anti-HIV medications,
             patients known to be infected with HIV are not eligible for this study.

          -  Due to the possibility of harm to a fetus or nursing infant from this treatment
             regimen, patients must not be pregnant or nursing. Women of child bearing potential
             must have a negative pregnancy test completed during study screening. Women and men of
             reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years.
