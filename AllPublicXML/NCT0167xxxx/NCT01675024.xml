  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of unconjugated and total Rotigotine
      after single and multiple doses of Rotigotine transdermal patch, and also to investigate the
      safety and tolerability of Rotigotine transdermal patch in healthy Chinese subjects.
