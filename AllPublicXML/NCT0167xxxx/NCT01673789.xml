  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia Areata (AA) is one of the most common T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, leading
      to the chronic and relapsing hair loss. The prevalence of AA worldwide is 0.1 to 0.2%,
      affecting an estimated 5.3 million people in the United States. To date, the clinical
      therapies are limited and disappointed for the treatment of AA. Alternative approaches are
      needed. Increasing evidence demonstrates that stem cells possess the function of immune
      modulation. We established the Stem Cell Educator therapy by using cord blood-derived
      multipotent stem cells (CB-SCs)(Zhao Y, et al. BMC Medicine 2012). A closed-loop system that
      circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell separator, briefly co-cultures the
      patient's lymphocytes with adherent CB-SCs in vitro, and returns the educated lymphocytes
      (but not the CB-SCs) to the patient's circulation. Our clinical trial reveals that a single
      treatment with the Stem Cell Educator provides lasting reversal of autoimmunity that allows
      regeneration of islet beta cells and improvement of metabolic control in subjects with
      long-standing type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is another most common T cell-mediated autoimmune
      disorder in the United States. Here, we develop and explore the therapeutic effectiveness of
      Stem Cell Educator therapy in AA patients.

      A 16-gauge IV needle is placed in the left (or right) median cubital vein, and the patient's
      blood is passed through a Blood Cell Separator MCS+ (Haemonetics®, Braintree, MA) at 35
      mL/min for 6 to 7 hours to isolate lymphocytes in accordance with the manufacturer's
      recommended protocol. The collected lymphocytes are transferred into the device for exposure
      to allogeneic CB-SCs (or process control without CB-SCs), and other blood components are
      returned to the patient. After 2 to 3 hours in the device, lymphocytes are returned to the
      patient's circulation via a dorsal vein in the hand under gravity flow control (2 to 3
      mL/min) with physiological saline. Approximately 10,000 mL of blood is processed during the
      procedure resulting in approximately two repeated educations for the lymphocyte fraction.
      Patients are hospitalized for two days to monitor temperature and conduct routine laboratory
      blood tests for adverse reactions following treatment. Follow-up visits are scheduled 4, 12,
      24, 40, and 54 weeks after treatment for clinical assessments and laboratory tests

    <description>The collected lymphocytes are transferred into the device for exposure to CB-SCs, and other blood components are automatically returned to the patient. The Stem Cell Educator functions as part of a closed-loop system that circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell separator, briefly co-cultures the patient's lymphocytes with CB-SCs in vitro, and returns the educated lymphocytes to the patient's circulation. CB-SCs tightly attached to interior surfaces in the device, and only the CB-SC-educated autologous lymphocytes are returned to the subjects. The Stem Cell Educator therapy requires only two venipunctures with minimal pain, and does not introduce stem cells or reagents into patients.</description>

    <description>For the treatment, commonly the left (or right) median cubital vein, a patient's blood is passed through a Blood Cell Separator that isolates the lymphocytes from the blood according to the recommended protocol by manufacture; consequently, the collected lymphocytes were transferred into the Stem Cell Educator and treated by CB-SC; after that, the educated cells return the blood back to the patient via a dorsal vein of hand. During the MCS+ collection, the whole blood flow rate was maintained at 35 mL/min. The whole procedure was scheduled for 8 ~ 9 hrs.</description>
