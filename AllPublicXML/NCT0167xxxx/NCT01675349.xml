  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the biologic activity of a Chenopodium album
      allergen extract in histamine equivalent prick (HEP) units, in order to be used as in-house
      reference preparation (IHRP).

      This is an open, unblinded and non-randomized biological assay. The study design is a slight
      modification of the recommendations proposed by the Nordic Guidelines.

      Four concentrations of Chenopodium album allergen extract, together with a positive and
      negative control, using 10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride solution and a glycerinated phenol
      saline solution, respectively, will be tested in every patient in duplicate on the volar
      surface of the forearm.
