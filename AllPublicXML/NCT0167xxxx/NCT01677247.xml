    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, single blind, two-period, two sequence cross-over study under fasting
      condition to compare the bioavailability of two glimepiride 4 mg tablet formulations (test
      and reference formulations).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast; and in the next morning
      they were given orally either one tablet of 4 mg glimepiride as the test drug (produced by PT
      Dexa Medica) or one tablet of 4 mg glimepiride (Amaryl®, Sanofi Aventis) as the reference
      drug with 200 mL water.

      Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
      2.5, 3, 3.5, 4.5, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 hours after drug administration. Immediately after drug
      administration, subjects were administered 100 ml of 10% glucose at approximately 0.5, 1.5,
      2, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 hours. In addition, 20% glucose solution was given to any subject who
      exhibited symptoms of hypoglycaemia. One week after the first drug administration (wash-out
      period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate drug.

      The plasma concentrations of glimepiride were determined by high performance liquid
      chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed
      are AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, tmax, and t1/2.
