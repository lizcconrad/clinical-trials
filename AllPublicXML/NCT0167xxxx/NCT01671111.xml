  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this extension study is to evaluate SSP-004184AQ in patients with
      transfusional iron overload and to provide data on long term safety and efficacy.

      SSP-004184AQ is an iron chelator under development for chronic daily oral administration to
      patients with transfusional iron overload

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cardiac T2* Values at Week 24 (Cycle 2)</title>
        <description>The efficacy of SSP-004184 was assessed by determining cardiac iron load. Cardiac MRI data were collected by using T2* standard procedures and used to determine iron load. A negative change from baseline indicates that iron load increased. A cycle consisted of 8 standard 6-weekly visits and the cycles were repeated each year for the duration of the study.</description>
