  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of in vitro fertilization is based mainly on uterine implantation embryo. An
      excessive uterine contractility may interfere with implantation by a movement of the embryo
      in the uterus. The inhibition of the uterine contractility may have a positive effect on
      success rate of in vitro fertilization. It is through parenteral injection of glucagon and
      its spasmolytic effect on various smooth muscles and thereby on the uterine muscle, at the
      time of embryo transfer, the investigators intend to improve the pregnancy rates obtained
      after IVF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women will have a cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and follow the standard protocol
      established by the clinic ovo or the fertility clinic of CHUM. On the day of embryo transfer,
      the investigators will administer 1 mg of Glucagon or placebo intramuscularly 10 minutes
      before the embryo transfer. The uterine contractility will be measured by ultrasound before
      and after injection to document the impact of Glucagon on it and we will proceed to embryo
      transfer.
