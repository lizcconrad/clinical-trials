  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In endurance sports competitions such as cycling, an athlete's capacity to sustain submaximum
      power (i.e. endurance capacity) strongly influences overall race performance. Endurance
      capacity can be increased by both long, continuous endurance exercise at moderate oxygen
      consumption, and high-intensity (at or above peak oxygen consumption) interval training.
      However, it has also been shown that resistance exercise, if performed in addition to
      endurance exercise, can further enhance endurance capacity. The investigators have recently
      described a novel training method, which is based on combined vibration and resistance
      training and superimposed vascular occlusion. Based on the investigators previous results
      showing that this type of training leads to marked increases in endurance capacity in
      previously untrained young women, the investigators aim at investigating whether the method
      is also effective in increasing endurance capacity in highly endurance-trained young men, and
      whether the method leads to bigger improvements relative to resistance exercise alone.
      Besides the functional outcomes the investigators are also interested in the specificity of
      the cellular adaptations with respect to the two trainings methods.
