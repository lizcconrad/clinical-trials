    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic
      parameters of Genz-682452 in healthy adult males, in two parts.

      Part 1 (GZFD00111TDU12766): double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential
      ascending single dose study;

      Part 2 (GZFD00211FED12767): open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment
      crossover study with a minimum wash-out period; to obtain preliminary information on the
      pharmacokinetics, tolerability and safety of Genz-682452 after single oral doses in fed and
      fasted conditions.

      Subjects are not allowed to participate in more than 1 part of the study.

    <description>Participants will receive two single doses of Genz-682452 separated by a 7-day wash-out period, one dose given under fed (standardized high-fat breakfast) and one under fasted conditions. The dose will be based on the blind review of the safety/tolerability/pharmacokinetic data of single dose level cohorts in Part 1.</description>
