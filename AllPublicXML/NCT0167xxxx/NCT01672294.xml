  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers provide a majority of care for patients during serious illness. Lack of
      preparation and completion may leave caregivers less capable of caring for a loved one or
      making crucial decisions influencing care.

      This study will examine whether a preparation and completion intervention reduces caregiver
      anxiety, depression, anticipatory grief, and burden and improves patient quality of life and
      health care use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized control trial to evaluate an intervention of
      preparation and completion with Veterans and their caregivers during serious illness.
      Specific aims are to 1) Evaluate the impact of the caregiver Outlook intervention on
      caregiver anxiety, depression, anticipatory grief, completion, and burden; 2) Evaluate the
      impact of the home versus in hospital, emergency department, or nursing facility; 3) Evaluate
      the impact of the intervention session's qualitative content, examining variation associated
      with selected demographic variables, quality of family communication, and stage of illness on
      change.

      Caregivers in the first group (&quot;Treatment&quot;, or &quot;Preparation and life completion&quot;) will meet
      with a facilitator three times for a period of forty-five minutes each. In the first session,
      subjects will be asked to discuss issues related to relationship life review.

      In session two, participants will be asked to speak in more depth about issues such as regret
      and forgiveness. In the final session, subjects will focus on legacy and celebration.
      Caregivers in the second group (&quot;attention control&quot; or &quot;relaxation meditation&quot;) will meet
      with a facilitator three times for a period of forty-five minutes each and be asked to listen
      to a non-guided relaxation compact disk (CD) or participate in a guided relaxation exercise.

      Participants in both groups will receive pre and post-test measures administered by a blinded
      interviewer. Outcome measures will be measures by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      - General (FACT-G), Quality of life scale, FACIT-sp sub-scale, Anticipatory Grief Scale,
      Caregiver Reaction Assessment, the Qual-E completion and preparation sub-scales, and patient
      days at home.

    <description>The number of days that a patient used either the VA emergency department (ED) or was an inpatient at a VA hospital in the 6 months following randomization. Inclusion of non-VA utilization was made unpractical due to the long delay in filing for non VA reimbursement (up to 2 years). The original variable was Day AT home, defined to be 180 days minus the days in ED or inpatient hospital. This was changed to days of use due to distribution/modeling considerations.</description>

The esteem subscale has 7 items with a 5 level Likert scale: 1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree. The score is the average of the 7 items ranging from a low score of 1 associated with negative reactions and high score of 5 with positive reactions.</description>

    <description>The Prolong Grief Disorder scale is a clinically-based diagnosis determination scale modified for this study. The components/requirements that were dropped were a) diagnosis should not be made until at least 6 months since death, and b) the disturbance is not better accounted for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder or post traumatic stress disorder. The outcome was a dichotomized variable with 1 indicating symptoms of prolonged grief are present and 0 indicating insufficient symptoms.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study conducted recruitment from June 2013 to October 2015. Potential patients were identified by data pulls and then medical record review as well as obtaining approval to approach from providers. Patients were approached both at select outpatient clinics at the Durham VAMC as well as being sent invitation letters with subsequent phone calls.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participant pairs (seriously-ill veteran and primary informal caregiver) were consented and then each completed a baseline interview before the dyad was randomized. Enrolled participants may be excluded if either of the pair refused to consent or did not complete a baseline.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA). The Caregiver Reaction Assessment is a 24-item multidimensional instrument designed to measure a caregiver's reactions to caregiving for family members with a variety of chronic illnesses. The esteem subscale has 7 items with a 5 level Likert scale: 1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree. The score is the average of the 7 items ranging from a low score of 1 associated with negative reactions and high score of 5 with positive reactions.</description>
