  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy &amp; safety of SR-T100 gel (2.3% of SM in
      Solanum undatum plant extract) in patients with VIN(s) or EGW(s).

    <textblock>
      An open-label, pilot study to evaluate the efficacy &amp; safety profiles of SR-T100 gel in
      treating patients with VINs or EGWs. Male &amp; female older than 20 years old have at least one
      VIN or EGW with lesion size greater than 5 mm in diameter are candidates for this study. The
      primary endpoint is evaluated based on patients who has received 16-week treatment and
      presents evaluable measurement datas by the end of 20th week. The secondary endpoints will be
      evaluated based on all patients with measurable values for VINs or EGWs, recruited patients
      in this study has never had experiencs associated with prior SR-T100 treatment of any sorts
      during their life time before becoming a participant in this study. The study plans to
      recruit 20 patients with VINs or EGWs, the enrollment duration will last two years with total
      of 40 patients involved.
