  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is a disorder of breathing during sleep
      characterized by prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete
      obstruction (obstructive apnea) that disrupts normal breathing during sleep1. The condition
      occurs in 2-5% of children and can occur at any age, but it is most common in children
      between the ages of 2 to 62,3. Untreated OSA is associated with lung disease, heart disease,
      growth delay, poor learning and behavioral problems such as inattention and hyperactivity.
      The most common underlying risk factor for the development of OSA is enlargement of tonsils
      and adenoids. Given the potential risk of complications associated with surgery of the
      tonsils and adenoids, medications to shrink the adenoids without requiring surgery have been
      considered, in particular intranasal corticosteroids (INCSs) which is a nose spray. A recent
      Cochrane systematic review suggested a short-term benefit of INCSs in children with mild to
      moderate OSA4. The authors recommended that further randomised controlled studies were
      required to evaluate the efficacy of INCSs in children with OSA. In particular they
      recommended that future studies should employ sleep studies to look for any improvement with
      INCSs, and should include children with more severe OSA, as these are the patients at the
      greatest risk of complications of surgery and would benefit most from a non-surgical
      treatment. The purpose of this study is therefore to explore the efficacy of INCSs in
      children with the full spectrum of OSA severity, including sleep study analysis., and longer
      term follow-up.

For patients that are between age 3 to 11 years and if they are randomized to the medicated group, they will use pediatric dosing of Mometasone nasal sprays, 1 spray (50 mcg) in each nostril once daily for 8 weeks. For patients that are older than age 12 and if they are randomized to the medicated group, they will use adult dosing of Mometasone nasal sprays, 2 sprays (100mcg) in each nostril twice daily for 8 weeks.</description>
