             translator

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate cancer as determined by transrectal ultrasound
             (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy performed within 6 months of study enrolment

          -  Gleason Score &gt;= 7and/or prostate cancer that is clinical stage T2 disease.

          -  Candidates for open radical prostatectomy considered surgically resectable by urologic
             evaluation

          -  Normal organ and marrow function as defined by the following criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or current use of hormonal management of prostate cancer (surgical castration
             or other hormonal manipulation, including GnRH receptor agonists, GnRH receptor
             antagonists, anti-androgens, estrogens, megestrol acetate, and ketoconazole)

          -  History of receiving radiation to the pelvic area.

          -  Previously received therapy with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors finasteride and/or
             dutasteride 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  History of bilateral orchiectomy, adrenalectomy, or hypophysectomy.

          -  History of severe untreated asthma, anaphylactic reactions, or severe urticaria and/or
             angioedema.

          -  Known hypersensitivity towards any component of the investigational medicinal product
             or Casodex (bicalutamide) or their excipients.

          -  Marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTcF interval (e.g. repeated demonstration of a
             QTcF interval &gt;450 ms).

          -  History of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. heart
             failure, hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome).

          -  Previous history or presence of another malignancy, other than prostate cancer or
             treated squamous / basal cell carcinoma of the skin, within the last five years.

          -  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (e.g. severe renal or hepatic
             impairment) which in the judgment of the Investigator would affect the patient's
             health or the outcome of the trial.

          -  Clinically significant disorder (other than prostate cancer) including, but not
             limited to, renal, haematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, cardiac, neurological,
             or psychiatric disease, and alcohol or drug abuse or any other condition, which may
             affect the patient's health or the outcome of the trial as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Use of natural medicines thought to have endocrine effects on prostate cancer (e.g.
             saw palmetto and St. John's Wort) 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Mental incapacity or language barrier precluding adequate understanding or co
             operation.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within the last 28 days preceding the Screening Visit
             or longer if considered to possibly influence the outcome of the current trial.

          -  Previously participated in any degarelix trial.
