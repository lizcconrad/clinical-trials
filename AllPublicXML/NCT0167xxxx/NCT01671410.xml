  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The opioid neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a condition of withdrawal symptoms after
      utero exposure to opioids. Sublingual buprenorphine shows promise as a new treatment in NAS.
      This trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of sublingual buprenorphine in
      infants exposed to both opioids and benzodiazepines in utero or with exposure of opioids in
      those who are breastfeeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with in utero exposure to opioids often require therapy with morphine for an extended
      period. In a clinical trial, sublingual buprenorphine reduced this treatment period by ~30%.
      However, infants with both opioid and benzodiazepine exposure were not included in the trial.
      This study will test the safety and tolerability of sublingual buprenorphine in infants with
      in utero exposure to benzodiazepines or who are breastfeeding.

             prescription (as determined by self-report or intake urine) by the mother 30 days
             prior to birth.

        Exclusion Criteria:
