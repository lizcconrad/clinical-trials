      Background

      Severe health anxiety, hypochondriasis according to DSM-IV, is common and associated with
      functional disability. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and behavioral stress management
      (BSM) have been showed to be effective in the treatment of severe health anxiety. The
      mechanisms of the treatments are however poorly understood. In addition, effective
      psychological treatments are accessible to only a few. One prior RCT has shown that
      internet-based CBT could be effective in comparison to waiting list controls. More studies on
      internet-based CBT is essential to establish evidence. In addition, few studies with
      sufficient power have investigated the effect of CBT in comparison to other active
      treatments.

      Aim of the study The aim of the present RCT is to compare internet-based CBT (n=110) to
      behavioral stress management (n=110) for adult participants with severe health anxiety. BSM
      is considered a comparison treatment for two reasons: it has been shown to be effective and
      it lacks exposure and response prevention, which is suggested to be an important mechanism in
      CBT.

      Participants in both treatments are expected to be significantly improved on measures of
      health anxiety. Participants receiving CBT are expected to be significantly more improved
      compared to participants receiving BSM.

      is considered a comparison treatment for two reasons: it has been shown to be effective and
      it lacks exposure and response prevention, which is suggested to be an important mechanism in
      CBT.

      The investigators expect participants in both treatments to be significantly improved on
      measures of health anxiety. Participants receiving CBT are expected to be significantly more
      improved compared to participants receiving BSM.

      Design:

      Randomized controlled trial. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio.

      Assessments:

      The primary outcome measure is the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). Assessments with HAI are
      conducted at baseline, post-treatment, 3- and 12 month follow-up.
