  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the considerable efforts of the DoD and VA to improve awareness of mental health
      problems and access to care, many returning veterans still report substantial barriers to
      seeking traditional mental health care. Research suggests that a significant barrier to
      pursuing treatment is the perception of stigma (Hoge at al., 2004). The primary objective of
      this 12-week pilot, randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to obtain pilot data on the
      utilization and efficacy of a standardized, integrative exercise protocol (aerobic exercise
      and mindful breath training) in addressing global post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      symptoms, sleep disturbances, and non-sleep PTSD symptoms in veterans with PTSD.
      Specifically, this study will examine whether a 12-week course of Integrative Exercise
      therapy, a treatment lacking stigma, 1) produces significant pre-post improvements in PTSD
      symptoms and sleep disturbances (compared to a Monitor Only Waitlist condition) 2) improves
      other clinical outcomes including mood, alcohol and non-alcohol substance use, psychological
      distress, mindfulness, and overall quality of life (compared to a Monitor Only Waitlist
      condition) and 3) whether such treatment is feasible and acceptable.

      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate possible mechanisms underlying these effects
      such as chemicals in the blood related to stress, changes in brain imaging markers, aerobic
      capacity, and improved sleep.
