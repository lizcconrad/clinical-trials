  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, an inactivated vaccine (vero cell) against EV71 has been investigated in Phase 1
      and Phase 2 clinical trials. Data from these trials showed that the EV71 vaccine has good
      safety profile and was immunogenic. 320 U alum-adjuvant vaccine has been chosen as the
      candidate vaccine for the phase 3 clinical trial.

      This clinical trial is a supplementary phase 2 trial, which is designed to study the gene
      expression patterns induced by EV71 vaccine in Chinese healthy children aged from 2 to 5
      years old use a systems biology approach combined with microarray analysis，RT-PCR and
      neutralizing antibody testing for PBMC and serum collected form the studied children
      population, to predict immunogenicity, and explore mechanistic insights about the EV71
      vaccine.
