    <textblock>
      This study compares the outcomes of the Vedera KXS procedure (a microwave-based procedure,
      also known as Keraflex) combined with corneal collagen crosslinking to corneal collagen
      crosslinking alone for the treatment of keratoconus. The goal is to improve corneal shape in
      patients with keratoconus.

      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of the Vedera KXS (a
      microwave-based procedure) combined with corneal collagen cross-linking performed with VibeX
      (Riboflavin Ophthalmic Solution)and the KXL System to corneal collagen cross-linking alone in
      reducing corneal curvature in patients with keratoconus. Patients will be randomized into one
      of two treatment groups: Vedera KXS combined with corneal collagen cross-linking or collagen
      cross-linking alone. The Vedera KXS procedure performs a controlled application of microwave
      energy in an annular configuration. The goal of this procedure is to reshape the cornea to
      flatten the cornea and improve corneal topography in patients with keratoconus. The primary
      goal of collagen crosslinking is to stabilize the corneal shape in keratoconus and prevent
      progression of the disease. Moreover, investigations of crosslinking have shown the procedure
      not only to decrease keratoconus progression, but also to decrease the steepness of the cone
      and improve uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity in some cases. Since the mechanism
      of improvement differs between the procedures, this study will compare the combined
      microwave/crosslinking treatment to crosslinking alone.

    <description>The change in manifest refraction spherical equivalent from baseline will be evaluated at 12 months. As secondary analysis of this endpoint, a repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to assess the profile of the treatments across time at 1,3,and 6 months to look at the effect of wound healing on this variable.</description>

    <description>Change in BSCVA (best spectacle corrected visual acuity) and UCVA (uncorrected visual acuity) compared to the baseline examination will be evaluated at 12 months postoperatively.
