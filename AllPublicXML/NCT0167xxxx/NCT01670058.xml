      -  The prevalence of Belatacept use

        -  The characteristics of Belatacept users and the temporal trends in these characteristics

        -  Characteristics of adult kidney-only transplant recipients who are treated with
           Belatacept vs. who are treated with Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)-based regimens at the
