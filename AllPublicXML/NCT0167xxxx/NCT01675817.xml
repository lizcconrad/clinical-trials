  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent work has shown that heparin rebound is common after cardiac surgery.

      The exact doze of protamine required to neutralize heparin at the end of CPB is unknown.
      Besides, the precise doze of protamine to treat heparin rebound is also unknown. It is also
      unknown if precise titration of protamine perioperatively in cardiac surgery can influence
      transfusion requirements after cardiac surgery.

      This study will assess how much protamine is required to neutralize residual heparin
      perioperatively in cardiac surgery through measurement of functional assays of heparin
      (anti-Xa and anti-IIa levels). In the first phase of this study, protamine titration assays
      will be carried out on normal pooled plasma incubated with heparin in the laboratory.

      Once the correct dose of protamine required to neutralize the heparin is established in the
      laboratory, the second phase will begin. Herein, plasma samples from patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery (with anticoagulation with two different commercial preparations of heparin)
      will be evaluated for residual heparin (Anti-Xa and anti-IIa levels). Protamine titration
      assays wil then be carried out in vitro to assess neutralization of heparin.
