  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies revealed only a low evidence for the various biofeedback methods and pelvic
      floor exercises for treatment of chronic obstipation. The number of randomized controlled
      trials is low with in part significant systemic deficiencies. However, the results from the
      previous study with 3T treatment in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) are so
      promising that a further randomized controlled trial appears useful to demonstrate a higher
      degree of evidence. The purpose of this study is to determine whether triple target treatment
      (3T) or EMG-Biofeedback alone are effective in the treatment of chronic obstipation and if
      the duration of treatment (3, 6 or 9 months) influence the efficacy.

      Methods in this parallel-group randomized multicenter study with blinded observer we enroll
      140 patients with chronic obstipation. The study is divided into two trials. After three
      months the first trial is completed and can be extended directly into the second trial
      (completed after 12 months) after an interim analysis. Primary endpoints are changes from
      baseline to three and twelve months in the Altomare ODS Score.

    <description>In the 3T arm, patients were stimulated with a carrier wave of 25 KHz and biphasic modulations of the pulse train of 40 Hz. Anxious patients trained at first only in the biofeedback mode. The stimulation was introduced after four weeks for these patients. Patients were instructed to carry out the training at home, with an alternating combination in the morning and with EMG-triggered stimulation in the evening, each for 20-minute periods. Apart from this, the protocol of the active treatment group was identical to that of the control group.</description>

    <description>In the biofeedback arm, patients were instructed to carry out EMG-biofeedback training at home, standing, mornings and evenings, for 20-minute periods. The core of the task was to pull the plug-electrode upward inside the anal channel, like a lift, and to hold it there during varying periods of tension. This can only be done successfully if the perineum rises and at the same time the puborectal muscle is activated. Just squeezing the sphincter muscles does not produce this lifting effect.</description>
