    <textblock>
      The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome of progressive dyspnea
      and refractory hypoxemia caused by various reasons. Although in recent years a variety of
      supportive care measures have significant progress, but the mortality rate of patients with
      ARDS is still as high as 35-40%. Mechanical ventilation is one of the main treatments with
      ARDS, which is widely used in clinical. The rational mechanical ventilation strategy can
      improve the oxygenation of patients with ARDS and reduce lung injury. Patients with ARDS
      usually have alveolar epithelial and pulmonary capillary endothelial injury, and the lesion
      has heterogeneity. The protective mechanical ventilation strategies chosen by patients with
      ARDS in clinical practice are gradually being accepted and applied. The High-frequency
      oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is a ventilation way with high respiratory rate and low tidal
      volume. Compared with conventional mechanical ventilation, HFOV may be able to more
      effectively improve oxygenation and reduce ventilator-associated lung injury. HFOV and
      protective ventilation strategy in ARDS is consistent with an important position in the
      treatment of ARDS, but not been widely adopted in clinical practice and is still only as a
      salvage treatment. Therefore, this study intends to use HFOV treatment with conventional
      mechanical ventilation by matching the cases in patients with ARDS. By comparing the
      influences of the patient's condition and mortality with HFOV, the clinical efficacy, safety,
      and health economics effectiveness of HFOV are further investigated and adaption time and
      parameter settings of HFOV are explored, which provide better treatment options for patients
      with ARDS and improve their prognosis.
