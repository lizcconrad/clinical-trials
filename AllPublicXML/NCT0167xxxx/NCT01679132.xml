      The BAROSTIM NEO HTN trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate the
      safety and efficacy of the Barostim Neo system in subjects with resistant hypertension.

      Currently, the BAROSTIM NEO HTN trial is not actively enrolling. CVRx is conducting long-term
      follow-up of patients implanted with the BAROSTIM NEO device. This update was not done for
      any subject protection concerns that would preclude continuation of the investigation.

        Inclusion Criteria Highlights:

          -  Age at least 21 years and no more than 80 years at the time of randomization.

          -  On four or more maximally tolerated anti-hypertensive medications, one of which is a
             diuretic. The antihypertensive medication regimen must remain unchanged for 4 weeks
             prior to screening and must be expected to remain unchanged for at least 6 months
             during follow-up.

          -  Protocol defined systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mmHg.

          -  Protocol defined 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) greater than or
             equal to 135 mmHg.

          -  Serum estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt; 29 mL/min/1.73 m^2.

          -  Appropriate surgical candidate.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must use a medically accepted method of birth control
             and agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the study. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to
             randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria Highlights:

          -  Known or suspected baroreflex failure or autonomic neuropathy.

          -  Myocardial infarction, hypertensive crisis, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension,
             unstable angina, syncope, or cerebral vascular accident within the 3 months.

          -  Hypertension secondary to an identifiable and treatable cause other than sleep apnea.

          -  Prior surgery, radiation, or endovascular stent placement in the carotid sinus region.
