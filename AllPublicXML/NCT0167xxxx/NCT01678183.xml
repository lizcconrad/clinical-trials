  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study. The investigators have designed a randomized, controlled trial
      of financial incentives in medication adherence, focusing primarily on poorly-controlled
      diabetes, and secondarily on hypertension, and high cholesterol. Prior work has shown that
      many patients do not take their medications as prescribed by their doctors. This contributes
      to increased rates of bad outcomes such as blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, and
      death. The investigators hypothesize that use of a financial incentive will motivate patients
      to improve their medication adherence and ultimately their control of their chronic diseases.

      The investigators plan to identify patients who get Primary Care at Boston Medical Center who
      still have high blood sugars more than a year after their diabetes diagnosis, and randomize
      them to a control arm, or one of two intervention arms. Subjects will be approached at the
      time of a regularly-scheduled appointment with their Primary Care doctor and offered the
      opportunity to participate in the study. All subjects who agree to participate in the study
      will meet with a Clinical Pharmacologist to review their medications in detail, and then
      undergo randomization. Subjects in the first intervention group will receive a cash incentive
      for picking up medications for the targeted conditions from the pharmacy each month. Subjects
      in the second intervention group will receive a cash incentive for picking up medications for
      the targeted conditions from the pharmacy each month, and a one-time payment at the
      conclusion of the study based on the amount of hemoglobin A1c decrease. The investigators
      will enroll a total of 100 subjects in the study, and anticipate an observational cohort of
      approximately 1,000 patients.

      All patients who are eligible for the study but who are not enrolled in the study and have
      not declined to participate in the study will become the observational cohort for the study.
      The observational cohort will be used to determine whether randomization to the control arm
      of the study has a negative, rather than neutral, effect on patients.

      At the end of eight months, all subjects will meet with a Visiting Nurse in their home, to
      have their blood pressure checked and to have their blood drawn so that their blood sugar and
      cholesterol can be measured. Outcomes to be evaluated include hemoglobin A1c, lipid panel,
      systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, self-reported health, microvascular and
      macrovascular complications, and death.
