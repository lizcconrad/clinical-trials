    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and humoral immune
      responses of the study vaccine when administered at the dose of 7.5 µg HA, 15 µg HA, or 30 µg
      HA to human subjects.

      Since 1997, avian H5N1 influenza in Southeast Asia has caused several human infections and
      has a high mortality rate. Experts warn that the next influenza pandemic is imminent and
      could be severe and prevention and control will depend on the rapid production and worldwide
      distribution of specific pandemic influenza candidate vaccines. An H5N1 influenza vaccine was
      successfully produced from whole virus grown in MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells. These
      purified inactivated vaccine antigens were safe and could induce immune responses in animal
      studies. Moreover, when formulated in aluminum phosphate a stronger response was generated
      even at low doses in animals (Chong et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2008). However, further
      investigations are necessary before their human safety and immunogenicity can be established.
      This human phase I clinical study, therefore, evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of
      adjuvanted H5N1 virion influenza vaccine.
