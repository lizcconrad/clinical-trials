  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, phase II, open label study of dovitinib in patients with
      progressive, recurrent and/or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). The primary purpose
      of this study is to assess the anti-cancer effects of dovitinib in this population in order
      to evaluate whether dovitinib is worthy of further study in patients with progressive ACC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed ACC of major or minor salivary glands.

          -  Recurrent and/or metastatic disease deemed progressive that is not amenable to surgery
             or curative radiotherapy.

          -  Measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST, version 1.1), defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured
             in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be
             recorded) with a minimum size of:

               -  &gt; 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).

               -  &gt; 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesion which cannot be accurately
                  measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable).

               -  &gt; 20 mm by chest X-ray Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically
                  enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be &gt;15mm in short axis when assessed
                  by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).

          -  Progressive disease, defined as one of the following occurring within 12 months of
             study entry:

             i) at least a 10% increase in radiologically or clinically measurable disease; ii)
             appearance of one or more new lesions, or iii) deterioration in clinical status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years of age.

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status &gt; 2.

          -  Known brain metastases.

          -  Treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas
             or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from
             adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to entering the study.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to dovitinib.

          -  Taking medications that are potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors (dovitinib is
             metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 liver enzyme, every effort should be made to
             switch patients taking such agents or substances to other medications).

          -  History of cardiac dysfunction with an ECHO or MUGA scan outside the institutional
             range of normal.

          -  QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval &gt; 500 msec) or other significant ECG

               -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture,

               -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal
                  abscess within 28 days of treatment,
