  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To advance our understanding of the mechanisms of human cardiorenal syndrome with emphasis
      upon the interaction of diuretic therapy and the renal-angiotensin-aldosterone -system and
      cGMP pathway.

      The belief is that the chronic AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with compensated CHF and
      renal dysfunction will improve renal function with increased sodium excretion, glomerular
      filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow and renal function reserve as compared to the
      response of placebo-treated subjects.

      IRB # 09-003284, &quot;Specific Aims 2: Define in humans with compensated CHF and renal
      dysfunction, the modulating action of chronic AT1 receptor blockade in addition to ACE
      inhibition on cardiorenal and humoral function&quot;, involving 12 weeks of study drug
      (Candesartan or placebo) starting at 4 mg daily and doubling every 2 weeks to 16 mg, if
      tolerated. Safety labs are performed one week after each dose increase (end of weeks 1, 3 and
      5), and in week 10 of the study. Participants are monitoring their blood pressure weekly, and
      are aware to watch for symptoms of hypotension (lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision).
      Renal clearance testing and ECHO are performed at the start and end of the 12 weeks of study
      medication in the 5-Domitilla Clinical Research Unit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction of equal or less than 40% assessed by
             echocardiography, nuclear scan, MRI or left ventriculogram within the past 48 months.

          -  Stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III symptoms as defined by: no
             change in NYHA symptoms over the past 3 months, on stable doses of ACE inhibitor, beta
             blocker, digoxin and furosemide over the last 4 weeks and no episode of decompensated
             CHF over the past 6 months.

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance of equal or less than 80 ml/min and greater than 20
             ml/min, using the MDRD formula assessed within the past 48 months and a confirmatory
             calculated creatinine clearance equal or less than 80 ml/min and greater than 20
             ml/min at the time of enrollment.

        Subjects who are already taking AT1 receptor blocker will be excluded. Aldosterone
        antagonist, antiarrhythmic medications and other vasodilators will be allowed; however, all
        medications must be at stable doses 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Subjects taking
        nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) except aspirin will not be able to increase
        their medication dose for the duration of the study. Subjects will be excluded if they have
        had a prior diagnosis of intrinsic renal disease, including renal artery stenosis of &gt; 50%,
        or if they meet any one of the exclusion criteria listed below.
