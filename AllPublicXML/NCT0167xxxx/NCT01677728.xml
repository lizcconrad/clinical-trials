  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore whether target therapy in combination with chemotherapy
      as treatment could improve survival or tumor response in patients undergoing Synchronic
      Hepatectomy for Colorectal Liver Metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), the liver is the most common site of hematogenous
      metastases. Approximately half of patients develop hepatic metastases during the course of
      the disease, and hepatic metastases are responsible for death in at least two thirds of CRC
      patients.

      Over the past decade, due to the introduction of irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based
      combination chemotherapy, the median survival among patients with colorectal liver metastases
      (CLM) has increased from 6 ~8 months to more than 20 months5.In recent years, target therapy
      has rapidly gained attention for the treatment of CLM and is under active investigation.

      Although numerous publications have reported the efficacy of target therapy in combination
      treatment for CLM patients, most of these studies focused solely on those patients without
      undergoing resection of liver metastases. In contrast, little work has concentrated on
      exploring the effection of target therapy for CLM patients undergoing Synchronic Hepatectomy.
