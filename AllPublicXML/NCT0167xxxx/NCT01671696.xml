    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis being tested is that imaging and serologic biomarkers of apoptosis and
      progressive extracellular matrix remodeling will precede echocardiographic indices of
      systolic and diastolic function among childhood cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines
      thus allowing evaluation of new therapies to prevent and manage heart failure in these
      patients.

      Part A: Patients who received a high dose of anthracyclines and who completed chemotherapy
      for a minimum of 2 year and are still in remission we gathered information about their
      previous heart disease, radiation dose to the heart, bone marrow transplant, age at
      treatment, gender, elevation of serum cardiac troponin-T or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
      peptide measurements during anthracycline therapy, systolic dysfunction and congestive heart
      failure during anthracycline therapy. Participants had a Cardiac MRI (CMRI), echo and
      collection of serum for the the measurement of biomarkers of inflammation (C Reactive Protein
      (CRP), TNF-α, myocyte injury (Cardiac troponin (cTn), extracellular matrix remodeling,
      (Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP), Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), C terminal
      propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), C terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP),
      Bone Alkaline Phosphatase, apoptosis (Caspase-3 P17 peptide), and ventricular derived B-type
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) once during the study. Part A has been completed.

      Part B: For those patients enrolled in part A they had another CMRI to validate CMRI findings
      and to study progression of cardiomyopathy overtime by comparing all CMRI derived imaging
      parameters between the first and second subject visits. Results of their standard of care
      echo will be post-processed to include the same parameters as the subjects' previous research
      echo that took place 2 years ago for comparison. Subjects had a blood draw (3mL) for for DNA
      and RNA analysis. Part B has been completed.

      Part C: Will include an additional 60 patients who received low dose anthracycline therapy
      (&lt;300 mg/m2) and who were also identified through the cardio-oncology registry. These
      patients will undergo a CMRI, study echo, and a blood sampling for collection of serum for
      measurements of biomarkers of inflammation, microRNA and caspase. Matrix/Fibrosis pathway:
      Plasma levels of all soluble types of MMPs, all 4 TIMPs; Inflammatory domain: cytokines
      (TNFα, interleukins, interferon gamma (IFNG), TGF β2, TGF βII)), cytokine receptors (sTNF RI,
      sTNF RII, sSt2, sgp130, siL1RII/sCD121b, siL-2Rα/CD25, siL-4R, siL- 6R, Endoglin), acute
      phase proteins: CRP; Signaling pathway: growth factors(GDP-15, GCSF, VEGF, sVEGFR2 TGFβ1,
      IGF-1; Cell viability/growth domain: Indices of myocyte death and apoptosis(Caspase-3 P17
      peptide), myocyte injury (cardiac troponin T (cTnT); Neuro-hormones: NTproBNP;. All
      measurements will be done in duplicate using an internally validated and calibrated multiplex
      suspension array. Results of the standard of care echo will be post-processed to include the
      same parameters as the original 60 subjects' previous research echocardiogram for comparison
      purposes. All subjects recruited will serve either as a &quot;case&quot; (because they have
      cardiotoxicity) or as a control, if they are free of cardiotoxicity. Currently enrolling for
      part C patients who received low dose anthracyclines.

      Cardiotoxicity for the overall group will be defined as global systolic dysfunction
      (indicated by an ejection fraction &lt; 2SD below normal (Z score &lt;-2), or decrease in global
      circumferential or longitudinal strain magnitude less than 2SD below normal. CMRI is
      considered to be the standard of care for assessment of cardiomyopathy. Based on the proven
      utility of CMRI as a screening tool for cardiomyopathy, CMRI studies will be performed as
      standard of care for assessment of global and regional myocardial function in cancer
      survivors. T1 pulse sequences for estimation of native T1 and ECV are continually being
      developed and refined, and will require further validation prior to clinical application.
      These sequences will still be considered be part of research.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Part A. CMRI parameters will be correlated with echo parameters of
      systolic and diastolic function. Data on peak circumferential strain will be compared to
      published historic normative data. T1 relaxation values will be compared to a group of age
      matched controls with normal SF and no exposure to anthracyclines. Results are expressed as
      mean and SD for continuous data and as percentages and numbers for categorical data. Subjects
      will be classified into 3 groups as detailed previously. Differences in the means between the
      groups and between exposed and controls for all normally distributed data will be assessed by
      analysis of variance. For skewed data, the Mann-Whitney U test will be performed. Image
      quality scores for all patients will be averaged for corresponding T1 maps. Mean segmental T1
      and ventricular myocardial peak circumferential strain values and standard deviations will be
      calculated. The literature shows that T1 value is subject to a mild systematic heart rate
      dependency and a patient's height and weight has some impact on T1 values. To find and
      correct for these potential confounding factors, the relationships between T1 and heart rate,
      height, and weight will be investigated by using linear regression analysis of section data.
      In addition, the relationship between T1 mapping-derived relaxation time, left ventricular
      myocardial peak circumference strain and echocardiography parameters of systolic and
      diastolic function will be investigated by using linear regression analysis of section data.
      All statistical analysis will be performed with SAS 9.2. All tests are two tailed, and P &lt;
      .05 is considered to indicate a significant difference. Interobserver and intraobserver
      variability of HARP strain will be performed using a paired t test and reported as a mean
      difference and 95% confidence interval.

      Serum levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-1/TIMP ratio, PICP, CITP, Bone Alkaline
      Phosphatase and that of Caspase-3 P17 peptide will be measured as indicators of extracellular
      matrix remodeling and apoptosis, respectively and compared to CMRI and echocardiographic
      parameters of systolic and diastolic function. Serum level of a cleaved p17 fragment (p17) of
      Caspase-3, the end effector caspase for apoptosis, will be compared to published normative
      data from a group of 167 healthy subjects 68. Circulating levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and
      TIMP-1 will be compared to published historic healthy controls 69 Serum biomarkers N-terminal
      pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) and Cardiac troponin will also be obtained given their known association
      with cardiac dysfunction.

      Biomarkers statistical analyses results are expressed as mean and SD for continuous data and
      as percentages and numbers for categorical data. Subjects will be classified into three
      groups as detailed previously. Differences in the means between the groups for all normally
      distributed data will be assessed by analysis of variance. For skewed data, the Mann-Whitney
      U test will be performed. The relationship between levels of Troponin, Caspase-3 P17 peptide,
      MMPS, TIMPs, PICP, CITP, Bone Alkaline Phosphatase, CRP, CK-MB, and echo parameters of
      systolic and diastolic function will be investigated by using linear regression analysis of
      section data. All statistical analysis will be performed with SAS 9.2. All tests are two
      tailed, and P &lt; .05 is considered to indicate a significant difference.

      The interdisciplinary nature and the potential for bedside to bench translational research
      should position us to obtain pilot data based on the projected changes in our patient
      cohorts. For example, we will test whether serum P17 level in any patient groups (groups 1-3)
      is higher than that in healthy controls. However, it is possible that only the late groups
      (Group 2 or 3) will show a rise in P17 level. Similarly, only the late groups may show
      changes in serum MMPs or T1 relaxation time. If any of the change is too small to be detected
      given the sample size, we will focus on parameters exhibiting larger differences vs. healthy
      controls. This will also guide us in designing future study. The change in MMPs may reflect
      presence of diastolic vs. systolic dysfunction in the early vs. late groups. For example, it
      is possible that the early group (Group 1) will exhibit diastolic problem, manifested as a
      reduced MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio. When significant systolic dysfunction ensues, the ratio may be
      reversed.

      Part B: All CMRI imaging biomarkers of cardiotoxicity demonstrated in the baseline pilot
      study will be compared among the first and second study visits among the high dose (≥240
      mg/m2) subjects. Frequencies and percents of the patients who exhibit the phenotype of
      cardiotoxicity as measured by cMRI will be calculated for each study visit. If the
      frequencies/percents are the same or greater in the second visit as compared to the first,
      then the use of cMRI to indicate anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity can be validated.

      Specific Aim 2: All CMR imaging parameters of athracycline induced cardiomyopathy will be
      compared between the first and second study visits among high dose (≥240 mg/m2) subjects. All
      CMR volumetric parameters including volumes, mass, and measurements of end systolic fiber
      stress as well as measurements of global and regional myocardial function, T1 maps and ECV
      will be compared between the two study visits using paired t-tests, p&lt;0.05 will be used to
      indicate a statistically significant difference.

      Part C:

      Specific Aim 1: The objective of this aim is to test the hypothesis that CMR imaging
      biomarkers of AIC will be less frequent among subjects exposed to low dose anthracyclines.
      The proportion of subjects that possess the anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity phenotype in
      both the high and low dose groups will be compared using Fisher's exact test. P&lt; 0.05 will be
      used to indicate a statistically significant difference.

      Specific Aim 2: This aim will tell the hypothesis that elevation of biomarkers of
      inflammation, myocyte injury, extracellular matrix remodeling and apoptosis will be less
      prevalent in survivors of childhood cancer exposed to low-dose anthracyclines, as reflected
      by lower levels of serum CRP, high sensitivity troponin, MMPs and Caspase-3 P17 levels. The
      objective is to characterize changes in serum levels of markers for extracellular matrix
      remodeling and apoptosis in patients at various intervals after anthracycline chemotherapy.
      Serum levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-1/TIMP ratio, PICP, CITP, Bone Alkaline
      Phosphatase and that of Caspase-3 P17 peptide will be measured as indicators of extracellular
      matrix remodeling and apoptosis, respectively and compared to CMRI and echocardiographic
      parameters of systolic and diastolic function. Serum level of a cleaved p17 fragment (p17) of
      Caspase-3, the end effector caspase for apoptosis, will be compared to published normative
      data from a group of 167 healthy subjects. Circulating levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and
      TIMP-1 will be compared to normal controls. Serum biomarkers N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP)
      and Cardiac troponin will also be obtained given their known association with cardiac
      dysfunction.

      DNA and RNA analysis will be collected for future analysis by the Jackson Lab bioinformatics
      core unit, to be analyzed based on the results of a parallel murine model of cardiotoxicity.
