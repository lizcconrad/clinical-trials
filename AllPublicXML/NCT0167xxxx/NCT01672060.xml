    <textblock>
      Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a primary prevention program that was developed by Dr.
      David Olds in the United States (US) with the goal of helping vulnerable young first-time
      mothers and their children. The program involves public health nurses (PHNs) visiting mothers
      in their homes, providing intensive supports starting in pregnancy and continuing until
      children reach their second birthday. Studies in the US have shown that NFP significantly
      reduces child maltreatment and child behaviour problems, while also improving children's
      early learning and mother's economic self-sufficiency. Economic studies have also shown that
      the program pays for itself over the long-term. However, NFP has never been tested in Canada.
      Due to major differences in our populations and in our public services, we do not know
      whether NFP will show the same benefits here. We therefore plan to conduct a scientific
      evaluation of NFP's effectiveness in British Columbia (BC), in close collaboration with the
      BC government and BC's Health Authorities. Using randomized-controlled trial methods, NFP's
      effectiveness will be specifically evaluated in comparison with existing perinatal services
      in BC regarding outcomes across three fundamental domains: 1) pregnancy and birth; 2) child
      health and development; and 3) maternal health and life course. Findings from this evaluation
      will be used to improve the NFP program â€” to better meet the needs of vulnerable young
      mothers and their children in BC.

    <description>Trained Public Health Nurses (PHNs) will deliver Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) using specified pregnancy, infancy and toddler curricula. Following enrollment in the study, NFP PHNs will provide regular home visits to participants throughout the remainder of the participant's pregnancy, continuing through until the child's second birthday. In addition to offering standard care during each visit, PHNs will deliver NFP content using program materials relevant to the following domains: personal health, maternal role, environmental health, family and friends, life course development, and health and human services.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to the comparison group will receive all the usual perinatal programs and services offered within their Health Authority, including primary care and specialist physician services covered under BC's public healthcare system. These services vary across the province but may include: standard primary healthcare services; public health programs including prenatal classes, pregnancy outreach and home visiting by nurses or paraprofessionals; and a variety of targeted and universal parenting and early child development programs.</description>
