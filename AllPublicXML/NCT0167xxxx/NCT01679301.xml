  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SimplyGo Study is a single site, cross-over study which aims to enroll a maximum of 30
      participants (to allow for 20 completers) with a prescription for nocturnal oxygen, and
      meeting all eligibility criteria. All participants will undergo a single night
      polysomnography testing in a sleep lab while they're SpO2 is monitored. The study has a
      cross-over design, in which participants will receive their oxygen prescription in two
      different modes at different times during the night. The assignment (sleep vs. continuous
      mode) to which participants will initiate the night will be randomized, and all participants
      will utilize each of the two modes during the study. The hypothesis of this study is that
      there will not be a significant difference in oxygen saturation (SpO2) for participants while
      they use the SimplyGo Portable Oxygen Concentrator, set in 'Sleep Mode', or pulsed oxygen
      flow, as compared to their SpO2 while on continuous flow oxygen during sleep during the
      course of the one night sleep study.

        Participants will be recruited from the Principal Investigator's clinic, as well as the
        Philips Respironics Home Healthcare Research Registry. This study is designed to allow both
        continuous and pulsed dose nocturnal oxygen users to participate.
