  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the treatment of panic disorder with medication and psychotherapy are both
      effective. Representative as a treatment for panic disorder, Selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) are recommended as first-line treatment of panic disorder. In general, the
      initial reaction rate of panic disorder medication known to be frequently stopped early
      recurrence 70-80% It's too early, it is recommended that the duration of drug treatment for
      at least one year to be long-lasting. But whether it is appropriate for the duration of drug
      treatment to maintain a certain extent remains controversial, and maintain the medication for
      more than one year, even if the long-term effects known to be approximately 50% less than
      beyond being negative when remission based. Meanwhile, the typical method for the treatment
      of panic disorder psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy (Cognitive behavioral therapy) and
      looked comparable to the effect of the drug in the treatment of the known, especially in
      recent years when the combined treatment with medication can increase the long-term treatment
      of sexual reported that there's has been the subject of attention.

      But prospectively compare the long-term effects of these two treatments, research, especially
      the research about the long-term effects of the combined treatment with the drug treatment of
      panic disorder is very low, and almost nil is Researchers, drug treatment and the effect of
      the combined treatment in patients with panic disorder over two years prospective study to
      compare the plans were. And verification, the researchers performed only through this study
      by comparing the long-term effects of the combined treatment with medication combined
      treatment of medication to be more effective than if the reaction to the long-term treatment
      of panic disorder that can affect the clinical and biological factors navigate to evaluate
      them. In addition, long-term observational study, panic disorder patients' subjective quality
      of life actually improved to some extent on the map together proven to.

      Panic disorder SSRI medication and long-term effects of the combined treatment on the
      Hamilton Rating Scale more effective treatment compared with the Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A),
      Clinical Psychology, I try to find the law. Drug and combination therapy of panic disorder
      from affecting the long-term effects on clinical (demographic and economic Factors), and to
      check for navigation and biological factors. - Improved quality of life to some extent due to
      the long-term treatment of patients with panic disorder, if you want to check

      2.3 Expected Effects Panic disorder in a comparative study of the long-term effects of the
      combined treatment with SSRI medication until now very rare, and most of the research to
      target Westerners, Asians to study is almost wholly lacking. Also to investigate the nature
      of the clinical course of panic disorder, long-term study also little or no sleep. Elapsed
      for the treatment of long-term treatment of panic disorder and its impact on various clinical
      variables to be able to figure out if, through the analysis of the results of this study, the
      future could be a very useful background material, used in the development of clinical care
      guidelines is expected. Leading researchers in various studies for panic disorder at home and
      abroad, and also, therefore, the results obtained in this research is very useful in the
      pathogenesis and in the treatment of panic disorder is expected. The results of this study
      will be introduced in the Domestic Society and International Society, will finally be
      published in major journals of SCI related.

      3 Research plan 3.1 Research information and how to

      - The selection of subjects Diagnosis by the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major panic
      attacks in patients with disabilities will be conducted by a clinical psychologist or
      psychiatrist: Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus (MINI-plus) of structured
      skilled diagnostic tool.

      In the case of patients who were taking medication Airlines sulfur existing at least 2 weeks
      (hydrochloric acid flu Jade Satin scheduled to participate in a study of the existing 4
      weeks) and stop taking the drug. All other prescription non-drug (herbal medicine), forbids
      smoking within 24 hours before the test, caffeine drink, drinking is prohibited in the state
      to proceed with a test is scheduled.

      (alprazolam) and tapering zolpidem use, but only occasionally, within 3 months of treatment,
      so that Should, in principle, (using the PRN as alprazolam available).

      bruising and discomfort of the byeolun.

      In addition, the possible side effects be used to study aviation sulfur drugs, selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, dizziness, diarrhea,
      insomnia, somnolence, ejaculation delay or erectile impairment sexual interference and can
      be.

      Suspended for the duration of existing drugs, on recurrence gonghwangjeung and cause a
      worsening of the subjects were taking the existing air sulfur drugs, if may be.

      Interests: while participating in a clinical trial for two years, the state of mental health,
      and balance the autonomic nervous system, the degree and temperament / personality traits in
      the individual subjects to learn. Blood through the analysis of the primary results of a
      blood test before and after treatment may also be associated with various psychological
      tests, can receive free of charge.
