  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is the development and the implementation of a new protocol about
      home-based exercises, supported by an illustrated manual, for the treatment of individuals
      with stroke.

      The hypothesis is that this group of patients who are going to carry out the training of this
      study protocol are going to show improvement in measured parameters (functionality and
      physical performance), which allows this protocol to be improved and published as a proposal
      of physiotherapeutic treatment.

      1. Program Development: 27 exercises were selected, based on the most frequent motor
           alterations present in hemiparesis. Three modes were created for each exercise: assisted
           active, active and resisted active executions. Besides explanatory text, there were
           illustrative photos for all exercises and their modes.

        2. Program Execution: All groups were submitted to a motor evaluation utilizing the
           Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and functional evaluation utilizing the Functional
           independence measure (FIM). After assessment, for the patients of the home-based
           exercise group (HBG) a group of home exercises was selected for each patient; these
           exercises were explained and performed one by one. The home-exercises were re-executed
           at each fortnightly visit, when any necessary correction was made. The next steps
           stipulated by the manual were taken, providing the patients with more complex exercises
           according to their progress. The patients in the supervised exercise training group
           (SEG) participated in supervised individual exercise sessions two times per week. A
           physical therapist supervised these sessions. Exercise sessions included: 30 minutes of
           global exercises that involved stretching, range of motion, muscle strengthen and
           another 30 minutes of functional training (gait, balance and use of the arm in daily
           activities).The control group (CG) was assessed but reluctant or unable to regularly
           attend a supervised exercise program. The groups were reassessed after six months.

        3. Program assessment: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score and the Functional independence
           measure score, measured at baseline and after six months, were compared between the
           groups.

    <description>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) it is an 18-item ordinal scale with seven levels ranging from 1 (total dependence) to 7 (total independence).FIM can be subdivided into a 13-item motor subscale (eating, grooming, bathing, dressing upper body, dressing lower body, personal hygiene, bladder control, bowel control, transfer to tub/shower, walk or wheelchair, stairs) and 5-item cognitive subscale (comprehension, expression, social interaction, problem solving, memory).The motor and cognitive sub-scales scores range from 13 to 91(motor-FIM) and from 5 to 35 (cognitive-FIM). The maximum total score is 126.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>motor performance, Fugl-Meyer scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer physical performance scale assesses five dimensions of impairment, including three aspects of motor control, such as the amplitude of joint movement, pain, sensitivity, motor impairment of the upper and lower extremities and balance. The data are scored in an ordinal scale of 3 (0=no performance; 2=complete performance) applied to each item7. The total motor score is equal to the classification of the upper limb (UL) plus the lower limb (LL), corresponding to 100 total scores (UL=66, LL=34). The total FM score, including the other items, corresponds to 226 scores in the final sum.</description>
