  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy plus concurrent chemotherapy has been demonstrated a significant
      improvement in overall and disease-free survival according to Intergroup Trial 0116 in
      patients with gastric cancer after surgical complete resection. Advantage of application of
      IMRT has been shown in planning comparison studies for postoperative gastric patients. So the
      investigators designed the trial to see safety and efficacy of postoperative concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy of capecitabine combined with IMRT for stage II/II gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Intergroup 0116, only 64% patients in concurrent chemoradiation group completed treatment
      as planed, but in recently reported ARTIST trial, capecitabine was admitted to concurrent
      with radiotherapy,patients who completed treatment as planed in concurrent group reach high
      as 80%. IMRT is an advanced radiotherapy technology which allows high conformal dose
      distribution to Planing Tumor Volume (PTV) and low dose to organ at risk. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of concurrent IMRT combined with capecitabine
      for the treatment of gastric cancer patients after D1/2 surgery.

    <description>â€¢ Radiation: concurrent chemoradiotherapy Postoperative radiotherapy regimen: Therapy plan system was formulated by Computed tomographic (CT) simulation. Radiation was delivered with 6MV photons. Radiotherapy consisted of 4500 cGy of radiation at 180 cGy per day, five days per week for five weeks, to the tumor bed, to the margins of resection or the stoma, to the regional nodes. Protection of spinal cord, heart, liver and kidney should be considered.
