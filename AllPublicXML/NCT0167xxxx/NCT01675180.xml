      Purpose/Objective of the study:

      The main objective of the study is to investigate oral health awareness and attitudes towards
      oral health among Norwegian pregnant women and assess the impact of information about oral
      hygiene on the risk of dental caries during pregnancy.

      The hypothesis of the study are:

        1. The state of oral health during pregnancy depends on pregnant woman's preventive oral
           hygiene behaviour and practice.

        2. Pregnant women with high level of oral health awareness and positive attitude towards
           oral health are more likely to visit their dentists regularly and have better oral
           hygiene compared to those with less awareness.

        3. Proper information and guidance on oral hygiene care provided during pregnancy can help
           to improve oral bacteriological milieu and reduce the dental caries risk among pregnant
           women.
