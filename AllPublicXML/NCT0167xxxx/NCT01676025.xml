      The purpose of this study is to compare two surgical methods of adrenalectomy. One is called
      PRA(posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy), which is performed through 3 or 4 holes at
      patient's back. The other is LA(laparoscopic adrenalectomy) which is performed through
      patient's abdominal cavity after making 3 or 4 holes in the abdomen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1992, transabdominal LA(laparoscopic adrenalectomy) has been a standard method of
      adrenalectomy. This traditional method has been used widely because this procedure provides
      wide view of the whole abdomen which is familiar to surgeons. But due to its unique location
      at retroperitoneum, adrenal is still not easy to approach. So various retroperitoneal
      approaches were designed and adjusted. Among those, PRA(posterior retroperitoneal
      adrenalectomy) has showed good outcomes in many institutes. PRA facilitates direct approach
      to kidney and adrenal gland, and so operative time can be shortened. But there has been no
      randomized controlled trial between these two methods.

      Therefore, as experienced surgeons in both methods, we want to practice this study.
