  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, five-period
      cross-over clinical study of PA-824 to evaluate the effect of PA-824 and of PA-824 plus
      moxifloxacin on cardiac repolarization (QT/QTc interval duration) in a total of 75 healthy
      male and female participants, aged 18 to 45 years. Moxifloxacin will be used as an active
      control. Participants will be blinded to the treatments they will receive. The study consists
      of a screening period up to 26 days; enrollment, 1 day; five in-patient treatment periods
      consisting of an admission day (except in the first treatment period, when the pre-dose day
      is the baseline), dosing day and two post-dosing days; an out-patient period of at least
      three days and not more than 10 days between treatment periods; and a final visit 7 - 14 days
      after discharge from the last treatment period.

      This is a Phase I, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, five-period
      cross-over clinical study of PA-824 to evaluate the effect of PA-824 and of PA-824 plus
      moxifloxacin on cardiac repolarization (QT/QTc interval duration) in healthy male and female
      participants. Moxifloxacin will be used as an active control. Participants will be blinded to
      the treatments they will receive. The study consists of a screening period up to 26 days;
      enrollment, 1 day; five in-patient treatment periods consisting of an admission day (except
      in the first treatment period, when the pre-dose day is the baseline), dosing day and two
      post-dosing days; an out-patient period of at least three days and not more than 10 days
      between treatment periods; and a final visit 7 - 14 days after discharge from the last
      treatment period. During the study, the subjects will receive each one of the following five
      treatments: Treatment A: PA-824 placebo and moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment B: PA-824 400 mg
      plus moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment C: PA-824 1000 mg plus moxifloxacin placebo; Treatment
      D: PA-824 placebo plus moxifloxacin 400 mg; Treatment E: PA-824 400 mg plus moxifloxacin 400
      mg. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of single-dose administration of PA-824
      400 mg and 1000 mg versus placebo on the QTcI interval. A total of 75 randomized (in order to
      have at least 60 evaluable) healthy male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 45 years will be
      enrolled.
