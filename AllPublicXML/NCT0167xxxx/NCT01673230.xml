  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low Cardiac Output Syndrome occurs frequently after cardiac surgery, especially when
      pre-operative LVEF is altered (LVEF≤45%). The correction of hemodynamic failure requires
      adapted treatments: fluid expansion and/or inotropic or vasoactive drugs. Predictive indices
      of a response to fluid challenge may allow an earlier hemodynamic optimization, which has not
      been showed until now when LVEF is altered.
