  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medic Mobile conceptualized and proposed the creation of an SMS-based appointment validation
      tool to automate appointment confirmation and rescheduling. Working in parallel with the San
      Mateo Medical Center (SMMC) electronic medical records (EMR) system, the software tool will
      automate reminders that request text responses from patients to either confirm or request to
      reschedule their upcoming appointments. While simple in concept, this tool aims to free up
      scarce clinical resources which are currently allocated to daily patient phone call
      reminders. With funding from a Bay Area foundation, the investigators will develop and pilot
      this open-source software tool in a 12-month randomized-controlled trial, slated to begin in
      October 2012. The endpoints of the study will aim to demonstrate improvements in both
      appointment adherence and glycemic control.

    <description>The 150 patients in the intervention arm of the study will receive SMS reminders regarding their upcoming appointments. Working in parallel with the SMMC electronic medical records system, the software tool will automate reminders that request text responses from patients to either confirm or request to reschedule their upcoming appointments. This bidirectional text messaging system would not interfere with the clinics' existing reminder protocol.</description>
