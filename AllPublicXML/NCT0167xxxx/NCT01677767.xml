    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the use in clinical practice and efficacy of Mircera
      (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis
      receiving Mircera for the treatment of chronic renal anemia. Eligible patients will be
      followed for 24 weeks.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Dose Per Injection of C.E.R.A</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The dosing and titration of C.E.R.A treatment were at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with local clinical practice or approved prescribing information. Mean dose per injection of C.E.R.A received by participants was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Received Concomitant Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Medications that were used during the study treatment period (from the first dose date of study medication to the end of the study) were included as concomitant medications. The prescribed concomitant medications (in greater than or equal to 10% of participants) in the study were prazosin, torasemide, vitamin and nutritional supplements, omeprazole, amlodipine, calcium supplements, calcitriol, and clonidine.
