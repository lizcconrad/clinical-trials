    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility MRI tracking of a vaccine produced from a
      persons cancer cells injected intradermally once a day for 3 consecutive days. One of the
      daily doses will contain a chemical that can be detected by an MRI. That will be either the
      1st or 3rd day of the 3 day course. On that day MRI scans will be performed 6 and 24 hours
      after the injection on that day. Patients may be able to receive booster doses every 1-2
      months

           Subjects may be contacted every 3 months within the first three years after study
           intervention, every six months until year 5, and annually afterwards. In lieu of direct
           contact a medical record review may be performed to obtain the data for these time
           points for disease progression and/or survival.

Peripheral blood CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against autologous tumor cells, using IFNγ-ELISPOT readout.
In any HLA-A2+ subjects on the protocol, we may evaluate peripheral blood CD8+ T cell responses against CRC-related peptide epitopes present, using IFN ELISPOT as readout.</description>
