  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has proposed the use of ST without microbubble treatment in randomized association with
      both intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis, but combined treatment (rtPA + U.S.)
      associated with MB diagnostic not yet been investigated in a randomized study.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy of the combined treatment (r-rtPA+US+MB) vs the
      standard rtPA treatment in a randomized study in consecutive patients with acute ischemic
      stroke.

      We expect to demonstrate that the combined treatment (rtPA+US+MB) will be statistically
      superior to standard treatment in terms of recanalization rate.

    <description>The short term efficacy of treatment will be evaluated by recanalization rate at 6 hours control TCD (TIBI score) and at 24 hours by the NIHSS (a &gt; 4 points improvement). As explained, the Rankin scale score will be used to test the efficacy of the treatment at day 90 after stroke onset.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All acute (&lt;4,5 hours) ischemic stroke patients in the MCA territory (as depicted by
             head computed tomography CT or suspected by clinical data) with a disabling
             neurological deficit measurable by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
             score, that in the opinion of treating physicians require and meet accepted criteria
             of treatment with a standard 0.9 mg/kg dose of iv rtPA.

          -  A documented occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) documented by TCD and/or
             angioCT.

          -  The patient or the legal representative signs the written consent to participate

          -  Age &gt; or = 18 years

          -  No significant improvement before treatment.

          -  The treatment is initiated within 90 minutes of hospital admission (door-to-needle
             time &lt; or = 90 minutes)

          -  There is no limitation regarding the NIHSS score. Scores under 5 are usually
             considered mild strokes, but they can be treated if the investigator believes that the
             measured deficit is important enough to cause disability. The investigator should
             weight benefits and risks when the score is under 5 and above 22.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  severe stroke as indicated on baseline CT imaging or by a NIHSS score &gt; 25

          -  evidence of hemorrhage on noncontrast head computed tomography CT),

          -  any other standard contraindication for intravenous rtPA therapy,

          -  primary treatment with intra-arterial thrombolysis,

          -  Previous Rankin scale score &gt; 1 and NIHSS &lt; 14 or previous Rankin scale score &gt; 2 and
             NIHSS &gt; or = 14

          -  Rapidly improving neurological symptoms such that the rate of improvement is expected
             to result in a NIHSS score of &lt; 4 at randomization

          -  Coexisting neurological diseases such as dementia or life-threatening illness.

          -  Seizure at symptom onset

          -  History or clinical presentation of intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage
             (even with a normal CT), arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, spinal cord disease or
             cerebral neoplasm. Incidental meningioma and microbleeds per se are not exclusion
             criteria.

          -  Baseline blood glucose concentration less than 50 mg/dL or greater than 400 mg/dl,
             that cannot be corrected

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 185 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg on at least two separate occasions at least 10 min apart,
             or blood pressure that requires aggressive treatment to reduce it to within these
             limits

          -  Hereditary or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis

          -  Another stroke, a serious head injury or major surgery within the previous 3 month

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100.000/mm3

          -  Hemorrhagic retinopathy

             puncture of a non-compressible blood-vessel

          -  Bacterial endocarditis, pericarditis

          -  Acute pancreatitis; documented ulcerative gastrointestinal disease during the last 3
             months, esophageal varices

          -  Arterial aneurysm, arterial/venous malformations

          -  Neoplasm with increased bleeding risk

          -  Severe liver disease, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension and
             active hepatitis

          -  Major surgery or significant trauma in past 3 months

          -  Contraindication to CT perfusion: Iodinated contrast allergy, renal insufficiency
             (elevated serum creatinine above normal laboratory levels at each center),
             non-collaborative patients, pregnancy
