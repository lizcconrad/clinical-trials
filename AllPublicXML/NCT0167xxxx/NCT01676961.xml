  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well romiplostim works in increasing low platelet counts in
      patients with multiple myeloma receiving chemotherapy. Romiplostim may cause the body to make
      platelets after chemotherapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if Nplate (romiplostim) is capable of increasing platelet counts to &gt; 50 x
      10^9/L for greater than 2 weeks in myeloma patients with chemotherapy induced
      thrombocytopenia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of romiplostim in this patient population by standard Common
      Toxicity Criteria (CTC).

      II. To determine any increase in thrombosis or marrow fibrosis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive romiplostim subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for up to 6 weeks. Patients
      achieving a platelet count &gt; 50 x 10^9 then receive romiplostim once weekly during 1 course
      of chemotherapy and may continue for as long as benefit is seen.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
