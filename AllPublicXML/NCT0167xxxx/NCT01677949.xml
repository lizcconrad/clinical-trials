      Study Design:

      This is a two-stage Phase II trial investigating the efficacy of Clofarabine,
      Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide in acute leukemia patients with detectable minimal residual
      disease (MRD) prior to allo-HCT. The primary objective is to determine the impact of the
      study treatment in eliminating the presence of minimal residual disease without causing a
      significant delay of allo-HCT due to treatment related toxicity. The intent of this study is
      to allow patients to proceed to transplant (independent of this study) within 42 days of Day
      1 of Clofarabine based therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be stratified at the time of enrollment based on diagnosis (ALL versus AML).
      Based on this two-stage optimal design, a maximum of 49 patients with ALL and a maximum of 49
      patients with AML will be needed. For each disease cohort, 21 patients will be enrolled in
      stage 1. If at the end of stage 1, the criteria is met for activating stage 2 (based on
      success of clearing MRD, proceeding to transplant within 42 days and without excessive
      toxicity) for one or both groups, stage 2 will be activated with an additional 28 patients
      enrolled.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study will be to determine the impact of Clofarabine, Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide on the conversion to an minimal residual disease (MRD) negative state at day 30 (&lt;0.01% leukemic blasts by flow cytometry) or day 42 if day 30 marrow is un-evaluable due to hypocellularity per RECIST criteria as well as the ability of patients to reach allo-HCT without significant delay due to study treatment related toxicity. Unable to proceed to transplant by Day 42 will be considered unacceptable.</description>
