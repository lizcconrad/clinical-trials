  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and PK of oral codeine sulfate
      in pediatric subjects with mild to moderate post-procedural pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible pediatric subjects will complete all screening procedures within 14 days before the
      scheduled procedure. Screening will be permitted on the day of the procedure. At screening,
      the subject's parent or guardian will provide written parental permission/informed consent to
      participate in the study and subjects will provide assent (if required by the local
      Institutional Review Board [IRB]) before any protocol-specified procedures or assessments are
      performed.

      Subjects may be inpatients, outpatients, or day-surgery patients at the study site who will
      undergo procedures expected to result in at least mild to moderate post-procedure pain with
      the day of the procedure noted as Day 0, and will be followed until discharge from the study
      site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a parent or guardian providing written parental permission/informed consent, with
             subject assent (if required by local IRB).

          2. Is a child 2 years old through 17 years old, inclusive (at the time of informed
             consent signing).

          3. Has a routine pediatric procedure that is expected to cause at least mild to moderate
             pain.

          4. Is expected by the investigator to require a minimum of one (1) dose of oral codeine
             for the treatment of mild to moderate post-procedural pain.

          5. Has the ability to read and understand the study procedures and has the ability to
             communicate meaningfully with the study investigator and staff (if the subject is of
             preverbal age or cannot read or communicate meaningfully, then the subject's parent or
             guardian must meet this criterion).

          6. If female subject is of childbearing potential, she must have a negative urine or
             serum pregnancy test result on the day of the scheduled procedure prior to the
             procedure. In this population, female of childbearing potential is defined by the
             onset of menarche, that is, menstruation, whether at irregular or regular intervals
             (periods).

          7. Must have vascular access to facilitate multiple blood draws.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently lactating.

          2. Has significant medical disease(s), laboratory abnormalities, or conditions(s) that in
             the investigator's judgment could compromise the subject's welfare, ability to
             communicate with study staff, complete study activities, or would otherwise
             contraindicate study participation.

          3. Weighs less than 10.5 kg. (see Table 4 Maximum Number of Doses of Study Drug by Weight
             for details)

          4. Has weight ≤ 5th or ≥ 95th percentile for age based on CDC Growth Charts. (see
             Appendix 6)

          5. Has received codeine, hydrocodone, morphine or oxycodone in any form in the previous
             seven (7) days.

          6. Has used opioids chronically (e.g., codeine, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, or
             hydromorphone) for &gt;7 calendar days within the previous 30 days before surgery.

          7. Has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to receiving oral opioid(s).

          8. Has an active enteral malabsorption disorder.

          9. Has impaired liver function (e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≥3 times the upper
             limit of normal [ULN], or bilirubin ≥3 times ULN), known active hepatic disease (e.g.,
             hepatitis), evidence of clinically significant chronic liver disease or other
             conditions affecting the liver (e.g., chronic hepatitis) that may suggest the
             potential for an increased susceptibility to hepatic toxicity with oral codeine
             exposure. NOTE: Subjects with no previous history of liver function impairment may be
             enrolled before results are available from screening laboratory samples.

         10. Has significantly impaired renal function or disease, as evidenced by an estimated
             glomerular filtration rate (i.e., from creatinine levels using the Schwartz formula)
             calculated to be less than one-third (1/3) of normal for the applicable age of this
             study population. NOTE: Subjects with no previous history of kidney function
             impairment may be enrolled before results are available from screening laboratory
             samples.

         11. Is undergoing a procedure as treatment for acute burns.

         12. Has a history of substance abuse or there is evidence of current substance abuse, in
             the investigator's opinion.

         13. Has participated in an interventional clinical study (investigational or marketed
             product) within 30 days before screening, or plans to participate in another clinical
             trial in the next 30 days.
