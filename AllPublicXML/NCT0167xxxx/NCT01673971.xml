  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that there are differences between infantile hemangiomas (IH)
      during the proliferating and involuting phases and in response to medical treatment that can
      be detected by optical tomography of these hemangiomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are common vascular growths that frequently arise in infants. The
      clinical presentation is variable, and some hemangiomas have the potential to cause
      disfiguring and even lifethreatening complications. While there is no FDA approved treatment
      for IH, certain medications have been shown to be effective in shrinking the growths.
      Unfortunately, there is no objective tool to monitor IH or to guide treatment. Such a tool
      would improve the management of these patients. A new handheld wireless device uses diffuse
      optical imaging (DOI) technology to measure blood flow characteristics.

      The device has been used in studies to assess patients with breast cancer. Optical tomography
      has also been increasingly used to assess neurological function and pathology in newborn
      infants.

      The goal of the investigators' study is to assess the utility of DOI for characterizing and
      monitoring IH. Fifteen IH will be assessed at three points in time as part of this study,
      comprising two groups: 'Natural History' and 'Treatment'. DOI measurements will be correlated
      with clinical findings and existing ultrasound measurements of the IH.

        All subjects will be recruited verbally from the pediatric dermatology faculty practices,
        clinics and inpatient services at CUMC/NYP (MSCHONY). In accordance with CUMC policy,
        researchers will not approach a patient for recruitment until that patient has been
        informed of the study by their treating physician who has ascertained the patient's
        willingness to discuss the study with the investigators.

        presentation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  IH of size &lt;2 cm in diameter

          -  Complicated IH requiring medical or surgical intervention
