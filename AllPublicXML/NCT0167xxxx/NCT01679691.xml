  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural anesthesia is a very useful tool in lower limb salvage surgery, which helps pain
      control intra and more importantly post-operative pain. It is a well-known effect of epidural
      injections to cause a sympathetic stimulation and consequently vasodilatation in the lower
      limb vessels.

      Since epidural catheters can cause vasodilatation in lower limb vessels, they can
      subsequently lead to increased intra and post-operative bleeding from the surgical wound.

      The study will involve all patients having a bone tumor in the lower limb and subjected to
      tumor resection and reconstruction by prosthesis.

      The patient will be randomized according to the administration of epidural anesthesia into
      two arms, an arm in which epidural anesthesia was employed and another arm in which the
      patient was subjected only to general anesthesia and the amount of intra and postoperative
      bleeding will be compared in both arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of intra-operative bleeding will be based upon weighing and counting of the blood
      soaked dressing and the amount of blood transfusion used.

      Assessment of post-operative bleeding will be based upon the amount of blood collected from
      the suction drain and amount of blood transfusion.

      All patient subjected to anticoagulant post-operative or another type of surgery other than
      implantation of prosthesis will be excluded from the study.
