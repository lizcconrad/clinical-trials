Presents the model of 'stress' and how it influences 'overeating', to develop a more balanced lifestyle and better QoL.
Session 2: 'Intervention' using Compassion Focussed Therapy model to understand relationship to food from their diary. Help develop a 'minimising overeating plan' (a 'relapse prevention' plan). Help learn to meet needs in other ways than food.
Session 3: Focus on physical body. Current body image, explore hopes and expectations for after surgery. Consider how to manage changes to social reactions and sexual relationships that may occur.</description>
