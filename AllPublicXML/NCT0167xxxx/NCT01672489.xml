  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to assess the risk of drowsy driving amongst shift workers
      using objective measures of drowsiness and driving performance in an instrumented research
      vehicle.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that on road (track) driving performance will
      deteriorate (variation in lateral lane position and the rate of out of lane driving events)
      and the frequency of episodes of severe sleepiness will increase (&quot;microsleeps&quot; on EEG and
      Johns' Drowsiness Score &gt;4) in shift workers following an extended work shift or night shift
      compared to a rested state, following day shifts.

      Specific Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that ocular measures of alertness (percent of time
      with eyes closed, eye tracking and Johns' Drowsiness Score) are related to abnormal driving
      performance (driving out of the lane) and &quot;microsleeps&quot; during on road (track) driving.

      Specific Aim 2a. To test the hypothesis that autonomic measures, ECG, respiration (measured
      with the Bioharness), skin conductance level and peripheral blood flow (measured with the Q
      sensor), are related to abnormal driving performance (driving out of the lane) and
      &quot;microsleeps&quot; during on road (track) driving

      Specific Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that self-reported sleepiness is related to on road
      (track) driving performance and episodes of severe sleepiness following extended working
      shifts or night shifts.

        Participants in this study include shift workers who undertake extended duration shifts (16
        hours or longer) or night shifts (e.g. resident physicians, nursing staff and allied health
        staff, police, firefighters, etc.).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be a shift worker who undertakes extended duration shifts (16 hours
             or longer) or overnight shifts

          -  Participant must be between the ages of 18-65y

          -  Participant needs to have held a US driving license for two years previously or an
             International Driving license for two years with 6-months regular (&gt;2/week) US driving
             experience

          -  Participants who wear corrective eye wear (i.e., glasses) are ONLY eligible to
             participate if they have a valid prescription so we can fit the Optalert glasses with
             their prescription lenses

          -  Resident physicians are only recruited if the combination of their time involvement in
             the study (i.e., any additional time beyond the time that it would ordinarily take
             them to commute home from work), together with their scheduled work hours, would fall
             within ACGME standards for duty hours for resident physicians.

        criteria above.
