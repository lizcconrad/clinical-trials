    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if medication cabinets located outside of isolation rooms in
      hospitals and their contents, particularly medications and the delivery folders are at a
      higher risk of having harmful bacteria on them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies show high touch areas maybe contaminated with organisms such as Methicillinâ€”resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. MRSA can live on hospital
      surfaces for 9-14 days. Patients in rooms that were previously MRSA isolation rooms are at
      higher risk for developing a hospital-acquired infection.

      This study is to determine if medication cabinets located outside of MRSA isolation rooms and
      their contents, particularly medications and the pharmacy delivery folders are at a higher
      risk of having MRSA colonization on them. This study will use conventional methods to
      determine if MRSA colonization is present and compare results between non-isolation and
      isolation rooms. This will evaluate if alternate measures for the reduction of MRSA
      colonization are needed for the MRSA isolation rooms in regards to medication delivery and
      storage.

    <description>Swabbing of four areas of the medication cabinet will be performed (keypad, handle, medication folder and a medication). A Semi-quantitative sampling technique will be used to collect the samples. A sterile saline moistened sterile cotton tip swab will be used to swab the specified areas. The swabs will then be used to inoculate sheep blood agar plates in 4 quadrants. The plates will be incubated for 48 hours. The number of quadrants with growth will be identified. Individual colonies will be removed from the plate with an inoculation loop, then streaked onto a second sheep blood agar plate. The second plates will be incubated for 48 hours. The colonies will then be run through standard identification tests to determine if the colonies are MRSA or not. A comparison will be made between non-isolation and isolation rooms.</description>

The colonies will be categorized as gram negative, gram positive catalase negative, Gram positive coagulase negative Staphylococcus species or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. This will serve as a baseline epidemiology of the hospital and generate other possible hypotheses.</description>
