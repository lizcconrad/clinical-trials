      Open-label, Phase 0, dose-escalation study of 3 successive cohorts (3 subjects per cohort),
      to determine and characterize the plasma PK of gemcitabine HCl oral formulation (D07001-F4)
      administered once on Day 1 with 7 Days of study follow-up. In addition, oral tolerability and
      safety will also be assessed during this 1-week period.

         14. Subject is willing to comply with protocol-required visit schedule and visit
             requirements and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:
