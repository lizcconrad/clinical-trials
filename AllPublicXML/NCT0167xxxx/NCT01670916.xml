  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics is given routinely to infants admitted to the department of neonatology during the
      first 3 days of life with gestational age less than 30 weeks since March 2010. The incidence
      of necrotizing enterocolitis Bell stage II and III will be assessed blindly from clinical
      records. It is hypothesised that the incidence of NEC will decrease. Infants admitted from 1
      March 2010 to 28 February 2013 will be compared to infants admitted 1 Dec 2007 to 30 Nov 2009
      will be compared.

    <description>The clinical records of infants who had a discharge diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis are selected. Records of infants who had a prescription of metronidazole for a non-preventive purpose is added. The clinical records are abstracted. The abstracts and X-rays are presented to a review board that are blinded to the period of birth. The board classifies the cases as NEC-I, NEC-II, NEC-III, focal intestinal perforation, and OTHER.
NEC-II/III is the primary outcome.</description>
