    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder mostly affecting adolescent girls and
      young adult women. There are many methods in the treatment of AN, such as family therapy,
      cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy and so on. However, almost 50% of patients are
      refractory to all current medical treatment and never fully recover and the standardized
      mortality ratio over the first 10 years is about 10%. For treatment-refractory anorexia,
      stereotactic functional neurosurgery may be the better choice. Deep brain stimulation and
      capsulotomy are the most used methods which has been proved effective in obsessive and
      compulsive disorders, depression and other psychiatric disorders. Many case reports indicate
      that deep brain stimulation or capsulotomy may be effective in the treatment of AN. As there
      are some common pathways between AN and other psychiatric disorder. The investigators have a
      hypothesis that deep brain stimulation and capsulotomy may be promising methods in the
      treatment of AN.

      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder mostly affecting adolescent girls and
      young adult women. Although the etiology of AN is still unclear, it is unanimous that social,
      genetic and psychological factors appear to be involved in the onset and maintenance of this
      disorder. There are many methods in the treatment of AN, such as family therapy, cognitive
      behavioral therapy, psychotherapy and so on. However, almost 50% of patients are refractory
      to all current medical treatment and never fully recover and the standardized mortality ratio
      over the first 10 years is about 10%. For treatment-refractory anorexia, stereotactic
      functional neurosurgery may be the better choice. Neurosurgery has been used in the treatment
      of mental diseases for more than fifty years. Deep brain stimulation and capsulotomy are the
      most used methods which has been proved effective in obsessive and compulsive disorders,
      depression and other psychiatric disorders. Many case reports indicate that deep brain
      stimulation or capsulotomy may be effective in the treatment of AN. As there are some common
      pathways between AN and other psychiatric disorders. The investigators have a hypothesis that
      deep brain stimulation and capsulotomy may be promising methods in the treatment of AN.
