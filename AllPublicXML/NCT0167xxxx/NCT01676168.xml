      Aim: To compare the gene expression of postburn hypertrophic scar with normal skin.

      Background: Postburn hypertrophic scar (HS) remains a challenging problem. Although varied
      clinical therapeutic methods have been used, none of them has been widely accepted as a
      standard care. As hypertrophic scar is hereditary, gene therapy can be a potential tool for
      scar treatment. To investigate the correlation between the clinical presentation of the
      hypertrophic scar and its gene expression, we propose an analysis of gene expression in the
      hypertrophic scar using DNA microarray and Real-Time Quantitative PCR. The study result may
      form the base of clinical treatment.

      Methods and Materials: Thirty scar patients requiring surgical treatment in NTUH burn center
      will be enrolled into the study. Inclusion criteria: (1) Age between 20 and 80 (2) Patients
      with postburn hypertrophic scar require surgical treatment.

        1. Hypertrophic scar and normal skin collection: Under Clinical Trial Informed Consent of
           Research Ethic Committee, scar and normal skin specimen of 1x1cm2 each will be collected
           and transported to tissue bank with a vacuum low temperature container. The specimen
           will be kept in a -80â„ƒ refrigerator.

        2. RNA extraction from skin tissue: The RNA extraction will be performed using kit
           available in the market. Spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis will be used to
           measure the purity and concentration of RNA.

        3. Gene expression analysis: DNA microarray and Real-Time Quantitative PCR will be used to
           analyze RNA expression of hypertrophic scar and normal skin.

      Statistics: Student's t-test will be used to compare statistically gene expression between
      hypertrophic scar and normal skin. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered as statistical significance.
