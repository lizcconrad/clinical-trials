  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of nimodipine in preventing a
      luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in women undergoing ovulation induction with clomiphene
      citrate. It is important to prevent the premature LH surge in controlled ovarian stimulation
      to allow adequate recruitment of follicles, proper maturation of a dominant follicle before
      ovulation, and effectively time insemination with semen to allow fertilization of a mature
      egg to occur.

      The investigators are also conducting this study to determine medication side effect profile
      (including lightheadedness or dizziness from low blood pressure or rapid heart rate,
      headache, and nausea), patient treatment compliance, and clinical pregnancy (positive
      pregnancy test and ultrasound evidence of fetal heart rate). Finally, LH and follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels will be measured to determine effect of nimodipine on
      these hormones.

      As a calcium channel blocker, nimodipine has been shown to block calcium mediated release of
      gonadotropin releasing hormone in animal and preliminary human studies. The investigators
      hypothesize that nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, will prevent or delay the LH surge
      during controlled ovarian stimulation cycles using clomiphene citrate in subfertile patients
      undergoing assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination (IUI).

      After enrollment, subjects will be randomized to Placebo Comparator or Active Comparator. All
      subjects will receive Clomid 100 mg for 5 days for the purpose of ovarian follicle
      recruitment. Intervention will be initiated once ovarian follicle maturation has been
      documented (≥1 ovarian follicle size of ≥ 17mm) and the absence of a premature LH surge has
      been confirmed - this will be classified as intervention day 0. Subjects will receive their
      assigned comparator (Placebo or Active) according the schedule below:

        -  Intervention Day 0 - noon / afternoon / bedtime (3 doses)

        -  Intervention Day 1 - morning / noon / afternoon / bedtime (4 doses)

        -  Intervention Day 2 - morning (1 dose) Serum hormone levels and ultrasound examination
           will occur on days 0,1 and 2 for all subjects.

LH surge will be determined by serum LH levels at least two times the baseline serum LH (baseline serum LH = (cycle day 3 serum [LH] + cycle day 7 serum [LH])/2).</description>
