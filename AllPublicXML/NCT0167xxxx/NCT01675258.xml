  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancers account for 783,000 new cases and cause 437,000 deaths per year across the
      world. Diagnosis in the early stages improves survival rates. Up to now, these cancers are
      mostly diagnosed only at later stages of the disease's course through histoimmune staining
      and molecular biology processes on the tissues biopsied from the gastrointestinal system
      under invasive diagnostic procedures of colonoscopy.

      Oral fluid presents a large protein complexity and has been recently used as a diagnostic
      biofluid for oral, as well as systematic diseases. Using oral fluid as a bio-marker for the
      colorectal cancer can be advantageous as it contains gastrointestinal fluids, in addition to
      bacteria and bacteria lysate, which can also serve as a bio-markers' source for colorectal
      cancers. Proteomic technologies provide the tools needed to discover and identify
      disease-associated biomarkers.

      The aim of the present study is to identify salivary bio-markers in patients suffering from
      colorectal cancers.
