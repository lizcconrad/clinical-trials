  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TissueGene-C, an allogeneic human
      chondrocytes expressing Transforming Growth Factor(TGF)-b1, is effective and safe in patients
      with degenerative arthritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of normal chondrocytes and transduced
      chondrocytes that express growth factors to regenerate the damaged cartilage tissues.

      In the clinical trial Phase 2b, the investigators compared TissueGene-C to placebo during 6 -
      months trial with 54 outpatients who have had degenerative arthritis. The outpatients are
      assigned to TissueGene-C or placebo in 1:1 ratio, and will be monitored and recorded for
      improving clinical symptoms, sports activities, and function of the knee, and for the
      presence of adverse events.
