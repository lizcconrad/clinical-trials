    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to confirm that at least 1 or more doses of telotristat
      etiprate compared to placebo is effective in reducing the number of daily bowel movements
      (BMs) from baseline averaged over the 12-week double-blind portion (Treatment Period) of the
      trial in patients not adequately controlled by current SSA therapy.

    <description>Participants recorded abdominal pain in a daily diary. Participants evaluated the level of any abdominal pain using an 11-point numeric rating scale, where: 0=no pain to 10=worst pain ever experienced. The average daily abdominal pain was averaged over the 12-week period. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
