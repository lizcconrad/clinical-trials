      This study is designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ixmyelocel-T
      compared to placebo (vehicle control) when administered via transendocardial catheter-based
      injections to patients with end stage heart failure due to IDCM, who have no reasonable
      revascularization options (either surgical or percutaneous interventional) likely to provide
      clinical benefit.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ixmyelocel-T compared to
      placebo (vehicle control) on the average per patient number of all-cause deaths,
      cardiovascular hospital admissions, and unplanned outpatient or emergency department visits
      to treat acute decompensated heart failure, over the 12 months following administration of
      investigational product (IP).
