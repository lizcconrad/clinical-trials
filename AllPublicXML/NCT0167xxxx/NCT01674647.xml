  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study for patients with abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) who need to undergo
      cardioversion (procedure to restore normal heart rhythm). The study will compare patients
      assigned randomly (like flipping a coin) to either Rivaroxaban or vitamin K antagonist (VKA).
      The study will measure common medical outcomes for this type of patient such as bleeding and
      stroke.

    <time_frame>From randomization to the date of last dose of study drug +2 days for subjects who completed planned treatment or the earlier date [last planned dose, follow-up visit at the end of 30-day follow-up period] for subjects who prematurely stopped treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke, TIA, Non-CNS Embolism, MI and cardiovascular death were adjudicated and confirmed by Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC). Stroke included hemorrhagic and ischemic infarction. TIA including information if with or without matching lesion. Non CNS systemic embolism included emboli in peripheral arterial of the upper and lower extremities, ocular and retinal (pulmonary embolism and MI were excluded from the category). MI was assessed based on either cardiac biomarkers, new abnormal Q waves appeared on electrocardiogram for &gt;= 2 leads, or autopsy confirmation. Cardiovascular death included death in subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Number of subjects with composite events were reported.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization up to the date of the last dose of study drug + 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding events were adjudicated and confirmed by CEC blinded to treatment. The CEC categorized the bleeding events as major or non-major. The bleeding events were defined per the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria. Major bleeding was clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 gram per deciliter (g/dL) or higher, leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, occurring in a critical site or contributing to death. Number of subjects with confirmed adjudicated bleeding events occurring in greater than (&gt;)1 total subjects were reported.</description>

    <description>A Direct Cardioversion Strategy can be performed only if sufficient anticoagulation is proven during the last 21 days prior to randomization and/or a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned before cardioversion. Rivaroxaban will be given for 1-5 days before planned direct cardioversion. The run-in of 1-5 days is needed due to potential pretreatment with VKA. Treatment with rivaroxaban will be continued for 42 days after the cardioversion. A Delayed Cardioversion Strategy will be chosen if sufficient anticoagulation is not proven during the last 21 days prior to randomization and no TEE is planned. Rivaroxaban will be given for at least 21 (+4) days before the planned cardioversion, to a maximum of 56 (+4) days prior to planned cardioversion.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 141 centers (involving 144 investigators) in Europe, South Africa, North America, and Asia Pacific.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Overall, 1584 subjects were screened and 80 subjects did not complete or pass screening. 1504 subjects were randomized; 1002 were assigned to rivaroxaban and 502 to vitamin K antagonist (VKA).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, BAY59-7939)</title>
          <description>Subjects randomized to treatment with rivaroxaban received rivaroxaban 20 milligram (mg) orally once daily. Subjects with moderate renal impairment [i.e., Creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to 49 milliliter per minute (mL/min), inclusive] at screening received the adjusted dose of 15 mg once daily. The duration of the treatment period for a given subject depended on the cardioversion strategy. For subjects in the Direct Cardioversion Strategy, the cardioversion procedure was performed within 1-5 days after randomization. Rivaroxaban was given for 1-5 days before planned direct cardioversion and for 42 days thereafter. Subjects in the Delayed Cardioversion Strategy received rivaroxaban for 21 (+4) to 56 (+4) days prior to cardioversion and for 42 days thereafter. The investigator assessed whether or not long-term anticoagulation was warranted and treated the subject according to standard of care. Then subjects entered 30-day follow-up period.</description>

          <title>Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA)</title>
          <description>Subjects assigned to treatment with VKA received VKA orally once daily titrated to a target INR of 2.5 (range 2.0-3.0, inclusive). The specific VKA was given by the investigator based on local standard of practice. For all subjects randomized to receive VKA, the investigator assessed if a parenteral anticoagulant drug, particularly before cardioversion, was needed as bridging therapy with VKA as standard of care (until target INR was achieved). The duration depended on the cardioversion strategy. For subjects in the Direct Cardioversion Strategy, cardioversion was performed within 1-5 days after randomization. VKA was given for 1-5 days before it and for 42 days thereafter. Subjects in the Delayed Cardioversion Strategy received VKA for 21 (+4) to 56 (+4) days before cardioversion and for 42 days thereafter. The investigator assessed if long-term anticoagulation was warranted and treated the subject according to standard of care or not. Then subjects entered 30-day follow-up period.</description>

        <description>Stroke, TIA, Non-CNS Embolism, MI and cardiovascular death were adjudicated and confirmed by Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC). Stroke included hemorrhagic and ischemic infarction. TIA including information if with or without matching lesion. Non CNS systemic embolism included emboli in peripheral arterial of the upper and lower extremities, ocular and retinal (pulmonary embolism and MI were excluded from the category). MI was assessed based on either cardiac biomarkers, new abnormal Q waves appeared on electrocardiogram for &gt;= 2 leads, or autopsy confirmation. Cardiovascular death included death in subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Number of subjects with composite events were reported.</description>

Subjects with moderate renal impairment [i.e., Creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to 49 milliliter per minute (mL/min), inclusive] at screening received the adjusted dose of 15 mg once daily. The duration of the treatment period for a given subject depended on the cardioversion strategy. For subjects in the Direct Cardioversion Strategy, the cardioversion procedure was performed within 1-5 days after randomization. Rivaroxaban was given for 1-5 days before planned direct cardioversion and for 42 days thereafter. Subjects in the Delayed Cardioversion Strategy received rivaroxaban for 21 (+4) to 56 (+4) days prior to cardioversion and for 42 days thereafter. The investigator assessed whether or not long-term anticoagulation was warranted and treated the subject according to standard of care. Then subjects entered 30-day follow-up period.</description>

Subjects in the Delayed Cardioversion Strategy received VKA for 21 (+4) to 56 (+4) days before cardioversion and for 42 days thereafter. The investigator assessed if long-term anticoagulation was warranted and treated the subject according to standard of care or not. Then subjects entered 30-day follow-up period.</description>
