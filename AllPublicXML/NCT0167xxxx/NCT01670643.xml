  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common goal for patients with vision loss who present for vision rehabilitation is
      to be able to read. The video magnifier (a device which combines a video camera and a screen
      to view the print being magnified) is the device which most often allows low-vision
      individuals to read successfully for extended periods of time. Previous studies on the
      outcomes of vision rehabilitation have not identified which components of the vision
      rehabilitation are effective. The hypothesis of this project is that providing a video camera
      magnifier, with basic training in operating the device, will allow patients to enhance both
      objective reading ability and subjective report of reading competence.

      Patients will be given a video magnifier at initial consultation or at the end of vision
      rehabilitation
