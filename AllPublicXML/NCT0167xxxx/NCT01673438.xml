          3. Capable of providing informed consent and complying with trial procedures.

          4. Baseline absolute left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured scintigraphically
             (MUGA, myocardial scintigram) or by ultrasound (echocardiogram) ≥ Institutional Lower
             Limit of Normal.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-2.

          8. Women must not be able to become pregnant (e.g., post-menopausal for at least 1 year,
             surgically sterile, or practicing adequate birth control methods) for the duration of

             keep all study-related appointments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Palliative surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation treatment &lt; 4 weeks

             (ULN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2 times
             the ULN if no liver metastases or 5 times the ULN if liver metastases, total bilirubin
             &gt; 2 times the ULN, white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 3500/mm3, or absolute neutrophil
