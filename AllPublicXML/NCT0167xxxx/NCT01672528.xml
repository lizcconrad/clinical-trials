      A multicentre, prospective observational study to develop, evaluate and validate Patient
      Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for patients treated with cardiac ablation for symptomatic
      cardiac arrhythmias
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, evaluate and validate disease specific PROMs for patients in the
      UK treated with cardiac ablation for cardiac arrhythmias. The potential benefits include
      support for clinicians to improve their performance, assisting patients in making informed
      choices and strengthening audit and research.

      Phase 1 of the study will involve patient interviews with approximately 30 patients from 2
      sites. These, together with input from a multidisciplinary team, will aim to improve drafts
      of disease specific questionnaires. This will be followed by Phase 2 which will trial the
      questionnaires in a group of approximately 600 patients from three sites. In Phase 2 patients
      will be asked to complete a pre-procedure questionnaire relating to their symptoms, quality
      of life and procedure expectations. They will also be sent post-procedure questionnaires
      relating to procedural outcomes, symptoms and quality of life at 8-16 weeks post procedure
      and at 1 and 5 years post-procedure.

      The responses obtained from these PROMs will be used to undertake recommended statistical
      tests of reliability and validity.
