    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BNG-1 in patients
      with ischemic stroke. The efficacy assessment will be based on the functional outcome while
      the safety will be reviewed by the adverse events and laboratory examinations.

      The primary endpoint will be performed on the 12 weeks after study drug administered and will
      compare the favorable rate between treatment with Aspirin alone and combination treatment
      with BNG-1 and Aspirin in patients with ischemic stroke. The favorable to therapy will be
      determined if all of the following occurs: alive, Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) &lt; 3, Barthel
      Index (BI) &gt;= 60.

      Secondary objectives are to compare the following:

        1. Compare the favorable rate at one week after study drug administered and the end of
           treatment (Week 4) and 4 weeks of follow-up (Week 8) of either Aspirin alone or
           combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.

        2. Compare the mean change in Barthel Index (BI), at each evaluation time-point of either
           Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.

        3. Compare the mean change in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at each
           evaluation time-point of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and
           Aspirin.

        4. Compare the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) at each evaluation time-point of either Aspirin
           alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.

        5. Compare the change in Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at each evaluation
           time-point of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.
