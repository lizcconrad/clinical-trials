  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute abdominal pain comprise a significant proportion of attendances at
      emergency departments. These patients account for about a third of general surgical
      admissions in a typical day. In some cases, the diagnosis is clear from baseline
      investigations (for example in cases of pancreatitis). In other cases, the diagnosis remains
      unclear but there are signs that necessitate urgent surgery (for example in cases of
      appendicitis). A final group exists where no clear explanation for the pain is found and
      where there are insufficient clinical signs to warrant surgery. These patients are said to
      have &quot;non specific abdominal pain&quot; (NSAP) and present a management dilemma.

      Traditionally such patients are managed with a strategy of active observation. Patients are
      examined at regular intervals and may undergo imaging. In some cases, symptoms and signs
      progress and surgery is needed while in other cases resolution may occur or a diagnosis may
      be reached non-operatively allowing focused medical treatment. Recently, two alternative
      strategies have emerged. Early cross-sectional imaging using CT scanning may identify
      conditions whilst being non-invasive. This would allow diagnosis and treatment would follow.
      The alternative strategy of early laparoscopy (key hole surgery) offers the possibility of
      concomitant therapy, but is invasive.

      The study hypothesis is that in patients with acute non-specific abdominal pain active
      management with laparoscopy on admission will reduce hospital stay and costs when compared to
      traditional active observation, without increasing complications.

      Patients referred to the general surgical service will initially be managed as per routine
      practice. They will be assessed by a member of the surgical house-staff, simple baseline
      investigations (full blood count, serum amylase, C-reactive protein, plain radiography) will
      be requested. Patients will then be reviewed by a registrar or consultant. At this point, a
      proportion of patients will have clear indications for surgery e.g. free gas on an erect
      chest x-ray or peritonitis. A further subgroup will be more appropriately managed by further
      tests on an out-patient basis and these patients will be allowed home. Some patients will
      have a clear diagnosis e.g. pancreatitis. Patients in each of these groups will be managed
      according to the usual practice of the responsible consultant surgeon.

      There is a final subgroup of patients who are the population of interest for this trial.
      These are patients in whom no clear diagnosis or safe decision to operate or discharge is
      possible. Such patients are usually admitted for a period of observation with further
      investigations or interventions ordered as their clinical picture evolves.

      These patients will then be randomly assigned to one of two management options: an active
      observation arm (control) or early laparoscopy arm.

      Active Observation: Patients randomised to this group will receive routine practice and will
      serve as the trial control group. They will be reviewed regularly by the responsible surgical
      team. Further investigations and interventions will be requested at the discretion of the
      responsible team.

      Early laparoscopy: Patients randomised to this group will be listed for a diagnostic
      laparoscopy in the emergency theatre . The aim will be to undertake this procedure within 12
      hours of randomisation. The procedure will be performed by the duty consultant surgeon or his
      / her nominated deputy as is usual practice. Findings at laparoscopy which require surgical
      intervention e.g. appendicitis will be treated as part of the same procedure as is routine
      clinical practice.

      Follow-up: Each patient will be followed-up on a daily basis by a member of the trial team
      whilst an in-patient. Complications, further investigations and interventions, unplanned
      critical care admissions, death, length of hospital stay and final discharge diagnosis will
      all be recorded. Following discharge, each patient will be reviewed at four weeks and six
      months. SF36 questionnaires will be completed at each of these visits. In addition, the
      Hospital In-patient Episode database will be interrogated for further admissions to other
      hospitals within six months of randomisation

    <description>Laparoscopy under performed by the surgeon on duty or his/her deputy. The aim is to achieve this within 12 hours of randomisation. This will be performed under general anaesthetic and involve the necessary drugs. The procedure will require laparoscopy instruments. There will be a umbilical port which will be 10mm in size and one 5mm port below this. If pathology is found, a further port will be needed to perform treatment.</description>
