  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This long-term, open-label extension study will evaluate the safety of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) in patients with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who
      completed the WA19977 core study. Patients will continue to receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg
      intravenously every 4 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis American College of Rheumatology Response 50/70</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 108</time_frame>
    <description>The Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) is comprised of six components: Maximum number of joints with active arthritis; Number of joints with limitation of movement; Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive Protein (CRP); Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disease Index (CHAQ-DI) graded on 4-point scales [0 = without any difficulty and 3 = unable to do] of 30 items grouped into 8 domains of physical function; Physician's global assessment of disease activity and Participant's global assessment of overall well-being (both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS], where score 0 = inactive arthritis and 100 = very active arthritis). A JIA ACR50/70 response is defined as improvement in at least three of the six core components by at least 50 percent (%), or 70%, respectively and no more than one of the remaining core components worsening by more than 30%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Inactive Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 24, 36, 48, 72, and 108</time_frame>
    <description>Inactive disease was defined as: 1) No joints with active arthritis (no swollen, painful and lack of motion joints), 2) No fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to JIA, 3) No active uveitis, 4) ESR and/or CRP within normal range, and 5) No disease activity according to Physician's global assessment of disease activity (&lt;= 10 millimeters [mm] on a VAS). The participant's treating physician provided a rating of the participant's arthritis disease activity on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal scale where score 0 represented 'arthritis inactive' (i.e., symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and score 100 represented 'arthritis very active'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Clinical Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 24, 36, 48, 72, and 108</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined as inactive disease observed for at least 6 continuous months. Clinical remission was defined as per medication uptake as: Level 1 (clinical remission on medication), Level 2 (clinical remission off oral corticosteroid medication [still on TCZ]), Level 3 (clinical remission off both oral corticosteroid and methotrexate medication [still on TCZ]), and Level 4 (clinical remission off all anti-inflammatory medications [still on TCZ]). Number of participants at each clinical remission level was reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Minimally Important Improvement in the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 108</time_frame>
    <description>The CHAQ-DI included questions on dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The disability index (DI) of the original CHAQ was graded on 4-point categorical scales of 30 items grouped into 8 domains of physical function. The highest scoring item in each domain determined the score for that domain. The score for the disability index was the mean of domain scores ranging from 0 to 3 (0 = without any difficulty and 3 = unable to do) with higher scores meaning higher disability. Minimally important improvement in CHAQ-DI was defined as a change from baseline of WA19977 core study (Day 1/Visit 1) &gt;=0.13 at each visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 108</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician's global assessment of disease activity was recorded on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal VAS where score 0 represented 'arthritis inactive' (i.e., symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and score 100 represented 'arthritis very active' (higher score indicate worsening of disease).</description>

    <measure>Parent/Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 108</time_frame>
    <description>Parent/patient global assessment of disease activity was performed using 0 to 100 mm VAS, and higher the score of VAS, worse the disease status (0= absence of activity or sign or symptom; 100= maximal activity or signs or symptoms). No disease activity was defined as VAS &lt;=10 mm.</description>

    <measure>Parent/Patient's Discomfort Index (Pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 108</time_frame>
    <description>Participants or parents rated participant's pain by placing a horizontal line on a VAS of 0 (no pain) - 100 mm (unbearable pain). To describe the pain, a cut-off at 10 mm was used, and VAS &lt;10 mm was defined as no pain.</description>

        <description>The Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) is comprised of six components: Maximum number of joints with active arthritis; Number of joints with limitation of movement; Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive Protein (CRP); Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disease Index (CHAQ-DI) graded on 4-point scales [0 = without any difficulty and 3 = unable to do] of 30 items grouped into 8 domains of physical function; Physician’s global assessment of disease activity and Participant’s global assessment of overall well-being (both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS], where score 0 = inactive arthritis and 100 = very active arthritis). A JIA ACR50/70 response is defined as improvement in at least three of the six core components by at least 50 percent (%), or 70%, respectively and no more than one of the remaining core components worsening by more than 30%.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis American College of Rheumatology Response 50/70</title>
          <description>The Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) is comprised of six components: Maximum number of joints with active arthritis; Number of joints with limitation of movement; Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive Protein (CRP); Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disease Index (CHAQ-DI) graded on 4-point scales [0 = without any difficulty and 3 = unable to do] of 30 items grouped into 8 domains of physical function; Physician’s global assessment of disease activity and Participant’s global assessment of overall well-being (both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS], where score 0 = inactive arthritis and 100 = very active arthritis). A JIA ACR50/70 response is defined as improvement in at least three of the six core components by at least 50 percent (%), or 70%, respectively and no more than one of the remaining core components worsening by more than 30%.</description>
          <population>The ITT population included all participants who had at least one efficacy assessment. Number (n) = number of participants analyzed for the given parameter at the specified visit.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Minimally Important Improvement in the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index</title>
        <description>The CHAQ-DI included questions on dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The disability index (DI) of the original CHAQ was graded on 4-point categorical scales of 30 items grouped into 8 domains of physical function. The highest scoring item in each domain determined the score for that domain. The score for the disability index was the mean of domain scores ranging from 0 to 3 (0 = without any difficulty and 3 = unable to do) with higher scores meaning higher disability. Minimally important improvement in CHAQ-DI was defined as a change from baseline of WA19977 core study (Day 1/Visit 1) &gt;=0.13 at each visit.</description>
