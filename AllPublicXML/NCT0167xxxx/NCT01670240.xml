      This study wants to investigate the efficiency of biological treatment for chronic pouchitis.
      Chronic pouchitis is inflammation in a reconstruction after removal of the colon, a pouch. It
      is examined in patients with ulcerative colitis.

      The primary objective evaluation is to evaluate the clinically effect of biological therapy
      (adalimumab) in patients with chronic pouchitis.

      Secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of biological therapy on the endoscopical and
      histological inflammatory activity.

      It is a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled study.

    <description>The number of patients with chronic pouchitis achieving a clinical improvement, defined as a reduction in clinically PDAI ≥ 2 at any time within the 12 weeks of treatment with adalimumab (Humira).
Clinical PDAI (0-6 points)(pouchitis disease activity index)refers to fewer (0-1 point), number of bowel movements(0-2 points), rectal bleeding(0-1 point) and fecal urgency(0-2 points).</description>

    <description>Effect (reduction in PDAI)of adalimumab (Humira) on the endoscopical and histological activity in chronic pouchitis Endoscopical and histological activity is defined from PDAI (pouchitis disease activity index). Endoscopically the presence of Edema, Granularity, Friability, Loss of vascular pattern, Mucous exudates or Ulceration, gives 1 point each (max 6 points). Histological the presence of polymorphic nuclear leukocyte infiltration and ulceration each gives 1-3 points regarding severity (max 6 points)</description>
