  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) fatality rate
      can be as high as 20% -41%, once progress is severe of ARDS, mortality rose to 90%, the main
      cause of death was refractory hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilation as the main measure to
      improve hypoxemia cannot correct all hypoxemia and relating complications of mechanical
      ventilation, mechanical ventilation in the treatment of severe ARDS has gradually been
      challenged. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation（ECMO) technology matures, so that clinicians
      have more choices in the face of hypoxemia, and with the deepening understanding of ECMO,
      ECMO may become severe ARDS first-line treatment. Currently, ECMO therapy has been recognized
      by the majority of medical workers. Therefore, we assume that accurately grasping the ECMO
      indications and standardizing the implementation of treatment can significantly improve the
      prognosis, shorter hospital stays, lower hospitalization costs.
