  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive disorders occur at a high rate in patients with inflammatory disorders, with a
      point prevalence of 15-29%, which is two to three times greater than that observed in the
      general population. Substantial evidence has shown that inflammation and increases in
      proinflammatory cytokine activity play a critical role in the onset and perpetuation of
      depression and depressive symptoms (e.g. insomnia, fatigue) in those who are co-morbid for
      inflammatory disorders. Consistent with this, experimental work has shown that an
      inflammatory challenge can increase depressed mood in an otherwise healthy sample. Based on
      these findings, there has been a growing interest in whether inflammatory processes can
      contribute to depression in a causal manner and how these effects might occur.

      Given the observation that inflammatory processes trigger social withdrawal, coupled with
      evidence that feelings of 'social disconnection' play a critical role in the onset and
      perpetuation of (non-inflammatory forms of) depression, it is surprising that the social
      psychological consequences of inflammation and their contribution to depression have not been
      more fully explored. Here, we suggest that inflammation may increase feelings of social
      disconnection and that these social psychological changes may be an important contributor to
      inflammation-associated depression. Indeed, preliminary data demonstrated that an
      experimentally-induced inflammatory challenge (endotoxin) led to increases in self-reported
      feelings of social disconnection (e.g., &quot;I feel disconnected from others&quot;) in addition to
      increases in depressed mood. Aside from these findings, however, there are no studies that
      have explored the effect of inflammatory processes on social experience in humans. The
      over-arching objective of this proposal is to explore the experiential and neural correlates
      of inflammatory-induced changes in social experience (e.g., feelings of social
      disconnection), which may provide a critical missing link in understanding the relationship
      between inflammation and depression.

      Participants (n=100) will be randomly assigned to receive either endotoxin or placebo and
      will then be monitored for the next six hours. Blood draws to assess cytokine levels as well
      as self-reported feelings of social disconnection and depressed mood will be collected
      hourly. In addition, at the time of peak cytokine response, participants will complete a
      neuroimaging session to examine the effect of inflammatory challenge on neural sensitivity to
      social rejection and social acceptance. It is hypothesized that endotoxin will increase
      feelings of social disconnection over time, and that the underlying neural sensitivities that
      give rise to these feelings (e.g., increased neural sensitivity to social rejection;
      decreased neural sensitivity to social acceptance) will contribute to inflammatory-induced
      depressed mood.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be required to be in good general health (as evaluated during the
             phone and in-person screening sessions described below), and to be between 18-50 years
             of age. All participants will be required to be fluent in English and to be
             right-handed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Following a structured telephone interview, prospective participants with the
             following conditions will not advance to the in-person screening session:
             claustrophobia or presence of metal in their body (relevant for the neuroimaging
             component of the study), pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the next 6 months,
             presence of chronic mental or physical illness, history of allergies, autoimmune,
             liver, or other severe chronic diseases, current and regular use of prescription
             medications, nightshift work or time zone shifts (&gt; 3hrs) within the previous 6 weeks,
             or previous history of fainting during blood draws.

        Furthermore, the absence of significant health problems or medication use history will be
        confirmed by an in-person screening session. Any participant who has any of the following
        conditions will be ineligible for the study: Medical conditions. (1) presence of co-morbid
        medical conditions not limited to but including cardiovascular (e.g., history of acute
        coronary event, stroke) and neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease), as well as
        pain disorders; (2) presence of co-morbid inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid
        arthritis or other autoimmune disorders; (3) presence of an uncontrolled medical condition
        that is deemed by the investigators to interfere with the proposed study procedures, or to
        put the study participant at undue risk; (4) presence of chronic infection, which may
        elevate proinflammatory cytokines; (5) presence of an acute infectious illness in the two
        weeks prior to an experimental session. Psychiatric Disorders. (6) current and/or lifetime
        history of a major Depressive Disorder or other DSM-IV psychiatric disorder (e.g. substance
        dependence) due to the known effects of major depression and/or substance dependence on
        inflammation. (Absence of a psychiatric diagnosis will be based on a structured psychiatric
        interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnosis: SCID; First et al., 1996).)
        Medication and substance use. (7) current and/or past regular use of hormone-containing
        medications including steroids; (8) current and/or past regular use of non-steroid
        anti-inflammatory drugs; (9) current and/or past regular use of immune modifying drugs that
        target specific immune responses such as TNF antagonists; (10) current and/or past regular
        use of analgesics such as opioids; (11) current and/or past regular use of psychotropic
        medications, including selective serotinergic reuptake inhibitors, antidepressants,
        anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives and barbiturates. Health factors. (12) current smokers or
        excessive caffeine users (&gt;600 mg/day) because of known effects on proinflammatory cytokine
        levels; (13) body mass index (BMI) greater than 35, (14) shows evidence of drug use from a
        positive urine test, (15) has a positive pregnancy test, if female, or (16) shows any
        abnormalities on screening laboratory tests.
