  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is one of the commonest medical emergencies. The
      condition accounts for 150 per 100,000 populations. A National United Kingdom reported a
      crude overall mortality rate of 10%. While bleeding stops spontaneously in majority of
      patients at their presentation, there remains a subgroup of patients who continue to bleed or
      develop recurrent bleeding. In these patients, the mortality increases manifolds. If these
      high-risk patients can be identified, early interventions may improve their outcomes.

      Several prognostic indices are in use for the purpose of patient stratification. They include
      the Rockall, Glasgow-Blatchford (GBS) and the Baylor scores. The Rockall score is a composite
      score which incorporates clinical parameters as well as findings during endoscopy which was
      derived to predict mortality. The GBS is a pre-endoscopy or a clinical score for the
      prediction for the need of further intervention loosely defined as the need for transfusion,
      endoscopy or surgery. It has been shown to be accurate in identifying low risk patients for
      early discharge.

      The GBS, being a pre-endoscopy score with clinical parameters, is more suitable for patient
      triage leading to urgent endoscopy and a higher level of care. A GBS of 0 has been shown to
      identify patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who may be managed safely as
      outpatients. The proportion of patients requiring endoscopic therapy increases with a higher
      score. A cut-off score that identifies &quot;high-risk&quot; patients who may benefit from urgent
      intervention however has not been determined. Guidelines from Societies around the world
      recommend early endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation for acute upper gastrointestinal
      bleeding (AUGIB). The guidelines also state that a proportion of patients need emergency
      &quot;out-of-hours&quot; endoscopy, without defining the &quot;high-risk&quot; group. A recent international
      consensus on the management of NVUGIB recommended early endoscopy within 24 hours for
      Non-Variceal Upper Gastro Intestinal Bleeding (NVUGIB), and noted no additional benefit
      associated with urgent endoscopy (&lt;12 hours) vs. early endoscopy (&gt;12 hours) in unselected
      patients with NVUGIB. However, there are only limited data on the role of urgent endoscopy in
      the &quot;selected&quot; subgroup of patients with high-risk NVUGIB.
