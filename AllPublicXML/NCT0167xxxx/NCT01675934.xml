  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening colonoscopy has been shown to be less effective in preventing colorectal cancer in
      the proximal colon compared to the distal colon. Possible reasons for this include bowel
      preparation often being worse in the proximal colon as well as flat depressed lesions being
      more common in the proximal colon.

      Retroflexion is commonly regarded as standard practice in the rectum, but retroflexion in the
      proximal colon is not currently routinely performed due to concerns of perforation and
      possibly because of the increased time required.

      Proximal colon retroflexion has been shown to be safe and effective without any
      complications, but data regarding ability to retroflex with certain types of colonoscopes is
      limited. Endoscopists interchangeably use standard adult colonoscopes or pediatric
      colonoscopes. Studies have not been performed to comparatively evaluate the success rates of
      standard adult and pediatric colonoscopes and whether either type of instrument confers a
      greater polyp detection rate.

    <description>This will be assessed as a yes/no variable. In addition, the specific reasons that the endoscopist could not retroflex the colonoscope in the right colon will assessed, such as the colonoscope not being able to be advanced to the cecum, small diameter of the right colon, too much resistance encountered when attempting retroflexion that the endoscopist does not feel comfortable with, etc.</description>
