  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a biomechanical study which is Project 1 in the Developmental Center for Clinical and
      Translational Research in Chiropractic (DCRC I) (NIH/NCCAM grant 1 U19 AT004663-01; principal
      investigator Christine Goertz, DC, PhD). This study is designed to monitor both physiological
      and patient self-report outcome variables. In addition, as there is little quantitative
      information on Spinal Manipulation Technique procedures reported in clinical trials, the
      study is designed to collect preliminary kinetic measures of the spinal manipulation
      technique delivery (i.e. force-time profiles).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with narrowly defined chronic low back pain will be included in this study. Each
      participant will be treated 12 times over the course of 6 weeks. The following data will be
      collected: participant characteristics that may predict outcome or be modifiers of force used
      by provider (gender, age, height, weight, and Body Mass Index); spinal segment load during
      the pre-load and thrusting phases (force and moment in the pre-load phase, peak load, and
      loading rate); physiological measures (posterior-anterior global stiffness and
      flexion-relaxation); patient-centered outcomes of back pain and function; and adverse events.

      Study participants (n= 80) will be recruited from the Quad Cities metro area. A team of
      experienced chiropractic clinicians working at the Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research
      will treat study participants. Each of the study participants will receive 2 High Velocity
      Low Amplitude Spinal Manipulation treatment visits per week over a 6 week period. The
      physiological assessments will be performed immediately before and after Spinal Manipulation
      delivery during treatment visits 1, 5 &amp; 12 (6 sets of assessments in total). During these
      same treatment visits, we will also capture the kinetic measures during Spinal Manipulation
      delivery for spinal segment load analysis. Participant patient-centered outcomes will be
      measured at baseline 1, and treatment visits 6 and 13. For simplicity, data collection time
      points will be named as baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 6 weeks.

    <measure>Kinetic Measure - Spinal Segment Load (SSL) Force</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SSL* contains variables: maximum amplitude (Newton) during preload and peak thrust force in anterior-posterior (X), side-to-side (Y), head-to-toe direction (Z) and combined force (C).
*Interpretation: the purpose of the outcomes is to quantify force-time profile of SM. The values of the outcome depend on the doctor who delivers SM, location and direction of SM, participant body position, and equipment. Currently there is no consensus regarding what value is higher than normal, normal, or lower than normal.
Sign convention: because patient position would affect the sign of some measurements, the right side up position was used as the reference position (i.e., the affected measurements assessed in the left side up position had their sign inverted) in order to calculate mean and SD. The value reported is the change from baseline to week 6.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS-29 - Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Scale-29: General Health Status Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>1) The questionnaire contains 7 PROMIS-29 specific items: Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Pain Interference, Physical Function, Sleep Disturbance, and Satisfaction with Participation in Social Role (anchors: 1= 'Not at all', 5= 'Very much', higher score is worse).
Each PROMIS-29 specific item is reported in raw score (4-20) and scored in T-score (T), which rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10 for a population.
On the T-score metric &amp; interpretation:
A score of 40 is one SD lower than the mean of the reference population.
A score of 60 is one SD higher than the mean of the reference population.
For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (e.g., more Fatigue, more Physical Function). Thus a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the average referenced population. This could be a desirable or undesirable outcome, depending upon the concept being measured.</description>

          <description>VAS - Visual Analog Scale: The VAS is a single-item, unidimensional measure for pain. Score interpretations for the VAS include the following cut points: no pain (0 to 4 mm), mild pain (5 to 44 mm), moderate pain (45 to 74 mm), and severe pain (75 to 100 mm).
RMDQ - Roland Morris disability questionnaire: The RMDQ consists of 24 questions related to disability, with each question worth one point. Scores can range from 0 (no disability) to 24 (severe disability).</description>

          <title>Flexion-Relaxation Ratio (FRR)</title>
          <description>FRR contains 4 variables, which are the average right and left back muscle FRR obtained using 1) maximum EMG during flexion, and 2) maximum EMG during extension to normalize EMG during full flexion; and asymmetry between the right and left back muscle FRRs using 3) maximum EMG during flexion, and 4) maximum EMG during extension to normalize EMG during full flexion
FRR Interpretation: The values of the outcome depend on testing procedure, instruction to participants, and equipment. Currently there is no consensus regarding what value is high than normal, normal, lower than normal.</description>

        <title>Kinetic Measure - Spinal Segment Load (SSL) Force</title>
        <description>SSL* contains variables: maximum amplitude (Newton) during preload and peak thrust force in anterior-posterior (X), side-to-side (Y), head-to-toe direction (Z) and combined force (C).
*Interpretation: the purpose of the outcomes is to quantify force-time profile of SM. The values of the outcome depend on the doctor who delivers SM, location and direction of SM, participant body position, and equipment. Currently there is no consensus regarding what value is higher than normal, normal, or lower than normal.
Sign convention: because patient position would affect the sign of some measurements, the right side up position was used as the reference position (i.e., the affected measurements assessed in the left side up position had their sign inverted) in order to calculate mean and SD. The value reported is the change from baseline to week 6.</description>

The number of observations for individual measures is lower than the total number of analyzable SM (n=575) due to missing data in corresponding components.</population>

        <title>Kinetic Measure - Spinal Segment Load (SSL) Rate of Loading for Moment</title>
        <description>SSL* contains variables: rate of loading for moment in anterior-posterior (X), side-to-side (Y), head-to-toe direction (Z) and combined force (C).
*Interpretation: the purpose of the outcomes is to quantify force-time profile of SM. The values of the outcome depend on the doctor who delivers SM, location and direction of SM, participant body position, and equipment. Currently there is no consensus regarding what value is higher than normal, normal, or lower than normal.
Sign convention: because patient position would affect the sign of some measurements, the right side up position was used as the reference position (i.e., the affected measurements assessed in the left side up position had their sign inverted) in order to calculate mean and SD. The value reported is the change from baseline to week 6.</description>
        <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Note: 82, 71 and 68 participants completed at baseline, after 2 weeks and after 6 weeks, respectively, and a total of 593 SM was delivered during visits 1, 5, and 12. The number of observations for individual measures is lower than the total number of analyzable SM (n=575) due to missing data in corresponding components.</population>

        <title>PROMIS-29 - Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Scale-29: General Health Status Scale</title>
        <description>1) The questionnaire contains 7 PROMIS-29 specific items: Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Pain Interference, Physical Function, Sleep Disturbance, and Satisfaction with Participation in Social Role (anchors: 1= 'Not at all', 5= 'Very much', higher score is worse).
Each PROMIS-29 specific item is reported in raw score (4-20) and scored in T-score (T), which rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10 for a population.
On the T-score metric &amp; interpretation:
A score of 40 is one SD lower than the mean of the reference population.
A score of 60 is one SD higher than the mean of the reference population.
For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (e.g., more Fatigue, more Physical Function). Thus a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the average referenced population. This could be a desirable or undesirable outcome, depending upon the concept being measured.</description>
