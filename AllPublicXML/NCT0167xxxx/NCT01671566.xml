  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with congenital heart disease have various degrees of impaired exercise capacity
      compared to healthy controls. Impaired exercise capacity makes everyday activities more
      difficult and demanding. There are few studies on effect of exercise training in adults with
      congenital heart disease. The hypothesis of this study is that structured home based exercise
      training will improve exercise capacity and health status in the studied population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number adults with congenital heart disease is increasing. Thanks to advances in the
      medical and surgical fields the number of adults with complex congenital heart disease is now
      higher than the children with corresponding heart disease. Though the long term prognosis is
      still unknown and continuously changing as new therapeutic options are introduced.

      Persons with congenital heart disease have different degrees of impaired exercise capacity
      compared to healthy controls. Some studies indicate that this population is not sufficiently
      active to achieve the recommendations for physical activity in preventing acquired heart
      disease. Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for developing acquired heart
      disease and other life style diseases as obesity and diabetes. In a population where one or
      more previous cardiac surgeries are common, the prevention of life style diseases is
      especially important. Exercise training in heart failure and coronary artery disease is well
      studied and there are clinical guidelines. Regarding exercise training in adults with
      congenital heart disease, however,the information is sparse and further studies are needed.

      Based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria adults with complex congenital heart
      disease will be recruited in the Northern Health Care Region in Sweden and in Gothenburg.
      Before and after the twelve week intervention period the investigators will collect
      information about cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, health related quality of life, exercise
      self-efficacy, anxiety and depression. The patients will be randomized to twelve weeks of
      home based interval training or to a control group. The randomization ratio will be 2:1
      (intervention:control). The control group will be instructed to continue with their habitual
      physical activities. The home based interval training program will be individualized based on
      the results of the exercise tests.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of home based interval training on maximal and
      submaximal exercise capacity, quality of life, exercise self-efficacy, anxiety and
      depression.

    <description>The participant in the intervention group will receive an individualized interval training program. The individualized adjustments in training load will be made from the results of the CPET-incremental and adjustments in training time from the results of the constant work rate 75% of peak work rate (Watt). The training will be home based and performed on a ergometer cycle 3 times a week for twelve weeks. During exercise they will wear a heart rate monitoring watch. The registered heart rate will be transferred to a webpage after the exercise session. Only the physiotherapist and participant have the access to this page. The physiotherapist and participant will have a weekly contact to promote compliance, provide feedback and if necessary adjust the training time or load. Progression in training load and time will be made when necessary to keep a relevant intensity.</description>
