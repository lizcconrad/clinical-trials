      The purpose of this study is to identify biomarkers that can be utilized in the diagnosis of
      chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain is the hallmark of patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), a
      non-bacterial category of prostatitis that is a significant source of morbidity in American
      men. The cause of CPPS is unknown and there is a lack of convenient biomarkers for diagnosis
      of this syndrome. This project will examine the expression of biomarkers in expressed
      prostatic fluid from adult men with and without a diagnosis of CPPS. Thus our specific aim is
      to validate the use of the chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha and mast cell tryptase as
      biomarkers for CPPS in humans and correlate their levels with CPPS symptoms.

        The Study population will include 176 adult patients diagnosed with CPPS (equal numbers of
        CPPS IIIa and CPPS IIIb) and 88 adult comparator controls, at least 18 years of age,
        recruited from Northwestern urology clinical site practices. All CPPS participants will be
        male and will have pelvic pain symptoms. Men who are at least 18 years of age and who had
        been seen by a physician for symptoms of CP/CPPS within the previous 2 years will comprise
        the patient population.

        additional criteria for control subjects are as follows.

          1. In the past year, symptoms of discomfort or pain in the pelvic region for extended
             periods of time.
