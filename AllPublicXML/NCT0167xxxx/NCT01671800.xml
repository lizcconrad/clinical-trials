  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if Myobloc significantly decreases
      prosthesis-associated symptomatic sweating in amputees when compared to a saline solution
      placebo. The study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with a
      total enrollment of 32 amputee subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with amputations experience severe sweating due to sockets and liners used with
      fitted prostheses. This excessive sweating causes inadequate fitting and function of the
      prosthesis as well as discomfort.

      The treatment modality and techniques used are based upon a successful prior open-labeled
      pilot study done by this research group investigating the effect of Botulinum Toxin A (BOTOX)
      on residual limb hyperhidrosis, which demonstrated significant decreases in sweating in
      amputees with residual limb hyperhidrosis treated with BOTOX.

      Each subject will undergo baseline testing consisting of 15 minutes of walking on a treadmill
      (or using a handcycle) at light exertion (11 on the Berg scale). They will report the effect
      of sweating on their prosthesis fit and function over the past month, and the amount of sweat
      produced in the 15 minutes will be measured via gravimetric assessment. At the end of the
      baseline session, subjects receive either the drug or placebo by injection into the residual
      limb area they identify as being the most troublesome for sweating. Subjects return for a
      1-month follow-up session where the questionnaire, walking test, and sweat collection are
      re-administered. At the one-month follow-up session, subjects who received the placebo and
      felt it was not successful in decreasing their sweating are given the opportunity to
      cross-over into the drug arm of the trial.

    <description>The amount of sweating will be assessed via gravimetry, which is an accepted method for determining sweating in a particular area. This method involves covering the area of the residual limb in question with filter paper for five minutes. After five minutes, the filter paper is removed and weighed. The weight of the dry filter paper is subtracted to give the approximate weight of the sweat produced. This study will use the total weight of sweat produced as a method of objectively quantifying the amount of sweating in the residual limb. Gravimetry will be used as a measure of change from pre-treatment to post-treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18-50 years of age, active duty or retired military

          -  Limb amputation (single or multiple:for lower extremity amputees, amputation at the
             ankle or above; for upper extremity amputees, amputation at the wrist or above)

          -  Clear history of excessive sweating in a residual limb that is interfering with
             prosthesis fitting and functioning. This will be defined as focal, visible sweating in
             the region of the residual limb with at least one of the following characteristics:
             impairs prosthesis fitting, impairs functioning with a limb prosthesis

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test prior to the administration of study medication (for
             females)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 or greater than 50

          -  Any medical condition that may put the participant at increased risk with exposure to
             Myobloc, including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, amyotrophic
             lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, neuropathy, renal stones, or any other
             disorder that may interfere with neuromuscular function

          -  Females who are pregnant, breast feeding, or planning a pregnancy during the study, or

             controlled

          -  Current or planned use of a myoelectric prostheses (for upper extremity amputees), as
             the potential for weakness caused by botulinum toxin could interfere with muscle
             contraction

          -  Concurrent participation in another investigational drug or device study, or
