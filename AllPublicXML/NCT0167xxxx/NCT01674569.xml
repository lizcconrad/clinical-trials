      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary biologic
      activity/efficacy of X-82 in patients with wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).
      Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by change from baseline in visual acuity, fluorescein
      leakage, retinal thickness and fibrosis, if detectable, based on fundus examination, fundus
      photography, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

          2. No previous treatment with anti-VEGF therapy or prior anti-VEGF therapy with evidence
             of response to treatment and the need for additional treatment.

          3. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) BCVA 20/32 to 20/320 in the study
             eye(s).

          4. Adequate bone marrow function.

          5. PT within the institutional upper limit of normal.

          9. Age ≥ 50 years.

         10. Willing and able to provide written informed consent, comply with the investigational

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT) within 4 months of screening in the
             study eye.

          2. CNV due to causes other than AMD.

          3. Geographic atrophy involving the foveal center in the study eye.

          4. Any retinal vascular disease or retinal degeneration other than AMD in the study eye.

          5. In the opinion of the investigator, any significant disease in the study eye that
             could compromise best-corrected visual acuity.

          6. Cataract surgery in the study eye within three months of screening.

          7. Trabeculectomy or aqueous shunt or valve in the study eye.

          8. Intraocular surgery in the study eye within three months of screening; Nd:YAG
             capsulotomy or laser iridotomy within 30 days of screening.

          9. Inadequate pupillary dilation or significant media opacities in the study eye.

         10. Use of any investigational agent or participation in any other clinical trial of an
             investigational agent or investigational therapy within thirty (30) days of baseline

         19. Presence of active gastrointestinal (GI) disease or other condition that will
             interfere significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of
             X-82.

         20. Receiving treatment with anti-coagulants other than 325 mg of aspirin per day.

         21. Serious active infection, other serious medical condition or any other condition that
             would impair the ability of the subject to administer the investigational drug or to
             adhere to the study protocol requirements.

         22. Presence of any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would prevent
             the subject from completing the study.

         23. No herbal medications with the exception of bilberry are allowed within 7 days of
             start of study drug.
