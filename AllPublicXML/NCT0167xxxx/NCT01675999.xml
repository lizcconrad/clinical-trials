  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced colon cancer (high risk stage II and stage III), curative
      surgery followed by adjuvant FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy has become the standard of care. However,
      for 30-40% of these patients, the current curative treatment strategy of surgical excision
      followed by adjuvant chemotherapy fails either to clear locoregional spread or to eradicate
      distant micrometastases, leading to disease recurrence. Preoperative chemotherapy is an
      attractive concept for locally advanced colon cancer and has the potential to impact upon
      both of these causes of failure. Optimum systemic therapy at the earliest possible
      opportunity may be more effective at eradicating distant metastases than the same treatment
      given after the delay and immunological stress of surgery. Added to this, shrinking the
      primary tumor before surgery may reduce the risk of incomplete surgical excision, and the
      risk of tumor cell shedding during surgery.

      ECKINOXE is a multicenter randomized phase II trial designed to evaluate efficacy (response
      rate) and feasibility (safety, tolerance) of these two chemotherapy regimens (FOLFOX-4 alone
      and FOLFOX-4+Cetuximab) in a neoadjuvant strategy in patients with locally advanced colon
      cancer. Control arm includes patients for whom standard treatment comprises surgery followed
      by adjuvant FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy. This phase II study will assess the feasibility of a
      neoadjuvant strategy in these patients and determine which neoadjuvant regimen is the most
      effective in terms of response rate.
