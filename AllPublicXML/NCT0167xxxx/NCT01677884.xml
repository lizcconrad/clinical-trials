        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Liver metastases of colon cancer or rectal predominant (histological evidence obtained
             on the primary tumor or liver metastases)

               -  Isolated (no extra-hepatic metastasis, primary tumor resected)

               -  No access to curative hepatectomy (R0 resection foreseeable or not leaving less
                  than 30% residual non-tumor liver normally vascularized), or requiring complex
                  hepatectomy, very large (5 or more segments) and / or risked (class II CPP)

               -  which at least one measurable by RECIST (&gt;2 cm, or &gt;1 cm if Computed tomography
                  (CT) spiraled)

               -  Or extra-hepatic disease of small size potentially accessible to a resection (one
                  or two lung metastases, lymphadenopathy localized accessible to curative
                  resection)

               -  colon or rectal primary tumor : resected or asymptomatic

          -  Progression after first line chemotherapy to treat the metastatic disease, all types

             be included even if they were transfused

          -  CT (or MRI) reference for the measurement of metastases performed within 28 days
             before the first treatment cycle

             resection

          -  Grade 3-4 allergy to one of the treatment compounds

          -  Two lines of prior chemotherapy. One line is allowed for metastatic disease but must

          -  Participation during or within 30 days before study to another therapeutic trial with
             an experimental molecule

          -  Concomitant cancer systemic treatment using immunotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone

          -  Symptomatic CHD or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior entry into the study,
             cardiac arrhythmia uncontrolled despite treatment

             treatment)

          -  Heart Failure &gt;Grade II of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) (class
             II-III-IV)severe renal failure

          -  History and / or presence of bleeding disorders and/or thrombotic &lt;6 months

          -  Uncontrolled Serious illness, uncontrolled active infection or other serious
             underlying condition which may prevent the patient to receive treatment
