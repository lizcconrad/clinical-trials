    <textblock>
      The objective of the 'Exploring potential synergistic effects of aerobic exercise and
      cognitive training on cognition after stroke' pilot trial is to investigate the combined
      effects of aerobic and cognitive training on cognition after stroke. This is to lay the
      groundwork for a larger RCT on the same topic. Twenty patients greater than 6 months
      post-stroke will be randomly assigned into one of four following treatment groups: (i)
      aerobic training (AEROBIC group), (ii) cognitive training (COGNITIVE group), (iii) aerobic
      exercise plus cognitive training (AEROBIC+COGNITIVE group); and (iv) non-aerobic range of
      motion (ROM) and unstructured mental activity (CONTROL group) (for group descriptions, please
      see detailed description below). We hypothesize that the combination of aerobic exercise and
      cognitive training will be more effective in improving cognition after stroke than either
      treatment on its own.

      Aerobic exercise: Body weight support (BWS) treadmill exercise at moderately high intensity
      (60-70% of heart rate reserve) using 15-30% BWS. An additional 6-10 min will be needed for
      warm-up and cool-down. Heart rate will be continuously monitored, and blood pressure and
      rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be measured periodically.

      Cognitive training: Computerized dual n-back training program that involves a working memory
      task, the difficulty of which adapts to the individual participant's performance.

      ROM exercise: Non-aerobic passive and active movement of upper and lower extremity joints
      performed with the subject lying on a plinth. RPE will be recorded every 5 minutes to ensure
      intensity remains low. Mental activities: Unstructured mental activity: such as listening to
      light novels on tape, which will be selected by the subject from a pre-determined list.

    <description>Flanker Test is a computerized test of selective attention and reaction time that involves a motor response. The participant needs to focus and identify an item presented on a screen while ignoring task-irrelevant distractors. Performance on this test has been shown to improve with exercise.</description>
