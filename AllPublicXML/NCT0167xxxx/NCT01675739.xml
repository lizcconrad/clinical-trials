      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of SMS (short message service of
      mobile phone) reminder to fix PC interval for bowel preparation in afternoon colonoscopy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bowel preparation quality for colonoscopy is influenced by several factors and
      preparation-to-colonoscopy (PC) interval is one of the important factors. The bowel
      preparation with split-dose PEG (polyethylene glycol) is an obviously uncomfortable process,
      it is usually difficult to ingest PEG in time. Therefore, the investigators conducted a
      prospective randomized control study to evaluate the effectiveness of fixed PC interval for
      satisfactory bowel preparation in the afternoon colonoscopy using mobile phone short message
      service (SMS), which reported that it could increase patient's compliance in other practical
      era

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the Ottawa bowel preparation scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at the end of time of the colonoscopic examination (about 30 minutes-1hour)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses cleanliness and fluid volume respectively and presents the total score as sum of these two values. Cleanliness was assessed for the right colon (cecum, ascending colon), midcolon (transverse, descending colon), and the rectosigmoid colon; each colon section was individually rated from 0 to 4 (0 = no liquid, 1 = minimal liquid, no suction required, 2 = suction required to see mucosa, 3 = wash and suction required, 4 = solid stool, not washable). Fluid quantity was rated from 0 to 2 for the entire colon (0 = minimal, 1 = moderate, 2 = large). The Ottawa Scale scores range from 0 (perfect) to 14 (solid stool in each colon segment and large amount of fluid).</description>
