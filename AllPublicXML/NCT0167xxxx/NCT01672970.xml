    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count (DAS28) at Months 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeter per hour [mm/hr]), and Participant's Global Assessment (PGH) of disease activity (measured on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity). DAS28 was calculated using following formula: DAS28 = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PGH of disease activity. Total score range: 0-10, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;3.2 implied low disease activity, DAS &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Month 1), Visit 3 (Month 2), Visit 4 (Month 3), Visit 5 (Month 4), Visit 6 (Month 5), Visit 7 (Months 6) and Visit 8 (Final Visit; within 2 weeks after 6months observation period)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response assessed as per EULAR categorical DAS28 response criteria was defined as clinically meaningful improvement at a particular time point. EULAR response was based on change from baseline (CFB) in the DAS28 score and also on the actual DAS28 score at the time point so was more reflective of the current status of the participant. The DAS28 score was a measure of the participant's disease activity, based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PGH (mm), and ESR (mm/hr). DAS28 total scores ranged from 0 to approximately 10. Scores &lt;2.6 = best disease control and scores &gt;5.1 = worse disease control. A negative CFB indicated clinically meaningful improvement. EULAR Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &lt;-1.2. EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 &gt;3.2 to ≤ 5.1 or a CFB &lt; -0.6 to ≥ -1.2. EULAR No response: DAS28 ≤3.2 or CFB greater than or equal to (&gt;=) -0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 or CFB &gt;=-0.6 and DAS28 &gt;5.1 or CFB &gt;=-0.6.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Score at Months 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SDAI was a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA which reflected the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PGH and physician's global assessment (PhGH) of disease activity, assessed on 0-100 mm VAS where 0 = no disease activity and 100 = worst disease activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) (milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]). SDAI total score = 0-86. A SDAI score of &lt;=3.3 represented clinical remission, a score of &gt;3.4 to &lt;=11.0 represented low disease activity, a score of &gt;11 to &lt;=26.0 represented moderate disease activity and a score of &gt;26.0 represented high (or severe) disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Months 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI was a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and used to evaluate disease activity in the absence of laboratory testing of CRP and ESR. It was the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PGH and PhGH (assessed on 0-100 mm VAS); VAS (0 = no disease activity and 100 = worst disease activity). CDAI total score = 0-76. A CDAI score of &lt;=2.8 represented clinical remission, a score of &gt;2.8 to &lt;=10.0 represented low disease activity, a score of &gt;10.0 to &lt;=22.0 represented moderate disease activity and a score of &gt;22.0 represented high (or severe) disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count (DAS28) at Months 3 and 6</title>
        <description>DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeter per hour [mm/hr]), and Participant’s Global Assessment (PGH) of disease activity (measured on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity). DAS28 was calculated using following formula: DAS28 = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PGH of disease activity. Total score range: 0-10, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;3.2 implied low disease activity, DAS &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

        <description>Clinical response assessed as per EULAR categorical DAS28 response criteria was defined as clinically meaningful improvement at a particular time point. EULAR response was based on change from baseline (CFB) in the DAS28 score and also on the actual DAS28 score at the time point so was more reflective of the current status of the participant. The DAS28 score was a measure of the participant’s disease activity, based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PGH (mm), and ESR (mm/hr). DAS28 total scores ranged from 0 to approximately 10. Scores &lt;2.6 = best disease control and scores &gt;5.1 = worse disease control. A negative CFB indicated clinically meaningful improvement. EULAR Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &lt;-1.2. EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 &gt;3.2 to ≤ 5.1 or a CFB &lt; -0.6 to ≥ -1.2. EULAR No response: DAS28 ≤3.2 or CFB greater than or equal to (&gt;=) -0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 or CFB &gt;=-0.6 and DAS28 &gt;5.1 or CFB &gt;=-0.6.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI was a participant self-reported questionnaire for assessing the extent of a participant’s functional ability. It consisted of 20 questions in 8 categories (dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities). Each question had 4 response options, ranging from 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores and ranged from 0 to 3, where higher scores represented higher disease activity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Particpant's Assessment of RA Morning Stiffness Assessed Using VAS at Months 3 and 6</title>
          <description>Morning stiffness was defined by the time elapsed between the time of usual awakening (even if not in the morning) and the time the participant was as limber as he/she would be during a day involving typical activities. Morning stiffness was assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0= none and 100= very severe.</description>
