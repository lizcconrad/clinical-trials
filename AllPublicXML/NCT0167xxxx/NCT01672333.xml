    <textblock>
      Early stage diagnosis of gastric cancer has ensued different approaches in its resection
      strategies. In order to increase the proportion of cases that undergo radical resection and
      reduce the recurrence rate, different pre-operative treatments are introduced. Here, the
      investigators investigate an active preoperative chemotherapeutic regimen to in patients with
      locally advanced gastric cancer.

    <description>A single expert clinician evaluates the clinical outcome of the chemotherapy regimen after 2 primary courses 3 weeks apart. Evaluation is done with regards to the &quot;TNM&quot; scoring of gastric cancer (T for the size and expansion of the tumor, N for lymph node involvement, M for distant metastasis). Participants are divided into 4 groups including clinically progressive disease, complete clinical response, partial clinical response and clinically stable disease.</description>
