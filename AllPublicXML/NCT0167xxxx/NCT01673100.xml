  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of using targeted daily cell phone
      interaction to facilitate behavior change for physical activity in previously-sedentary
      individuals who have recently undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is important in the maintenance of cardiovascular health, and is
      especially critical for previously sedentary individuals who have undergone percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Changing behavior to adopt and maintain recommended
      physical activity levels in this population is difficult. Interventions to accomplish
      behavior change will not work unless they can be adopted into a person's busy lifestyle. This
      proposed study fills a gap by testing the feasibility of an innovative, targeted intervention
      (Physical Activity Promotion Telehealth Intervention), delivered by a practical and feasible
      platform (cell phone). The asynchronous targeted daily interaction will consist of 5-6 text,
      picture, and/or video messages delivered to the subject's cell phone each day. Upon
      successful completion of this study, it is believed that these feasibility findings will
      provide a foundation for the testing of a larger clinical trial to promote physical activity
      in this population.

    <description>Evaluate the feasibility of each component of this pilot study, in order to refine the intervention for a larger clinical trial. This will include:
Evaluate all aspects of implementation (numbers of subjects contacted, enrollment, attrition; problems and solutions identified using the telehealth platform, time for delivery; subject acceptance and perception).
Evaluate feasibility of the data collection methods (time required for data collection, missing data, reliability estimates of outcomes).
Estimate effect sizes for sample size determinations for a future, larger clinical trial.</description>

    <description>Pilot test the impact of the Physical Activity Promotion Telehealth Intervention in post-PCI patients over time compared to patients receiving attention only, on the following outcomes:
Movement through the stages of readiness for physical activity.
Behavior change constructs (self efficacy for exercise, decisional balance, and use of processes for change).
Amount of physical activity (estimated energy expenditure per day as measured by the actigraph accelerometer) and exercise (reported minutes exercising per day).</description>

    <description>Subjects in the experimental group (Physical Activity Promotion Telehealth Intervention) will receive messages on the study cell phone - approximately 2 to 3 messages every day. These messages will be tips to help them engage in physical activity and also to help them keep the physical activity appropriate. Walking will be primarily the suggested mode of activity.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the experimental group (Physical Activity Promotion Telehealth Intervention) will receive messages on the study cell phone - approximately 2 to 3 messages every day. Depending on the subject's responses to the questionnaires at baseline (stages and processes of change) they will be given tips to help them engage in physical activity (such as messages to increase their self-efficacy or confidence, walking with a friend or spouse, breaking up physical activity bouts into 10 minutes bouts, etc.) and also to help them keep the physical activity appropriate. Walking will be primarily the suggested mode of activity.</description>
