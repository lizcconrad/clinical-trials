  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This application proposes a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the impact of adding a
      focused physical therapy (PT) intervention to the preoperative regimen of individuals
      diagnosed with a malignancy of the lower extremity (LE). The primary aim will be to determine
      if individuals diagnosed with a malignancy of the LE can participate in a 10 week
      preoperative strengthening, stretching, and aerobic exercise regimen.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention group will receive PT 3 times per week for 60 minutes each session. The
      therapy sessions will include endurance, strengthening, and stretching exercises. Endurance
      exercises will consist of ambulating with assistive devices as needed, using the upper
      extremity (UE) ergometer, and/or playing the Wii. Strengthening exercises will involve both
      UE's and LE's. For UE's, bicep curls, triceps curls, shoulder flexion, and/or press-ups from
      the therapy mat or wheelchair will be included. For the LE's, bridging, long arc quads,
      hamstring curls, calf raises in standing, single LE squats, and/or dorsiflexion (DF) in
      supine will be performed on the uninvolved extremity. Resistance and exercise time will be
      increased depending upon participant's tolerance. Stretching will consist of ankle stretch
      into DF in supine or long sitting, hamstring stretch in supine with hip flexed to 90 degrees,
      and trunk extension in sitting.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      To determine if individuals diagnosed with a malignancy of the LE can participate in a 10
      week preoperative strengthening, stretching, and aerobic exercise regimen.

    <description>Determine if individuals diagnosed with a malignancy of the LE can participate in a 10 week preoperative strengthening, stretching, and aerobic exercise regimen. We will consider the study to be feasible if at least 60% of the patients are able to complete at least 50% of their scheduled PT sessions.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will receive PT 3 times per week for 60 minutes each session. The therapy sessions will include endurance, strengthening, and stretching exercises.
Exercise time and resistance will be progressed per individual's medical status and per participant's tolerance. All participants will be given a tailored home exercise program (HEP).
Participants will participate in PT 10 weeks prior to surgery and 10-12 weeks after surgery. Subjects will be seen by the physical therapist both when inpatient and outpatient. Patients will not be seen for PT if platelet count is less than 20,000mm3 and/or hemoglobin is less than 8g/dL.</description>
