      In this Phase II study a dose of 2.8 mg (eight 0.35 mg siG12D-LODERs) will be administered in
      12-week cycles to patients with unresectable LAPC combined with chemotherapy treatment
      (Gemcitabine+nab-Paclitaxel). This will be the first study to assess the response rate of the
      siG12D-LODER in patients with unresectable LAPC. The study is of a two-arm design with one
      arm receiving siG12D-LODER + chemotherapy, and the other arm receiving only chemotherapy.

      The investigational agent siG12D-LODER is a miniature biodegradable bio polymeric matrix that
      encompasses the drug, designed and produced by Silenseed Ltd. The implantation of LODERs is
      selected to meet current gastroenterology endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) biopsy procedures,
      proved to be highly effective and safe.

      siG12D-LODER has been studied in the escalating dose Phase I study of 15 patients, and
      results showed high safety and tolerability profiles, with no single DLT.

          -  Men and women patients 18 years of age and up

          -  Have an unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer (AJCC stage III). (Excluded:
             resectable and borderline resectable patients are ineligible per NCCN criteria)

          -  Allocated to receive Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel as first line treatment.

          -  Have a target tumor that is accessible for intratumoral administration by PTA
             (Percutaneous transluminal approach) or EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound) guidance as
             determined by the radiologist/gastroenterologist performing the PTA/EUS injection.

          -  Have an ECOG performance status of ≤ 1
