          <description>Subects in the DEX implant arm received a single intravitreal administration of 0.7 mg OZURDEX in the study eye at the Day 0 appointment. In order to minimize subject discomfort, adequate local anesthesia was administered to the study eye prior to DEX implant injection. Immediately following DEX implant injection, the investigator performed indirect ophthalmic exam to assess for complications. In order to minimize risk of infection, a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic was placed in the study eye immediately prior to and following the injection, and the subject were provided a sample of a broad-spectrum antibiotic to use 4 times daily for 3 days following injection. The subject remained in the clinic for 15-30 minutes or until IOP &lt;28 mmHg.</description>

Subjects was instructed how to instill eye drops properly and to instill each drop in the study eye four times per day every day until month 1 visit. At each monthly visit, subjects in this arm were assessed for the need to continue steroid/NSAID therapy.</description>

            <description>Subects in the DEX implant arm received a single intravitreal administration of 0.7 mg OZURDEX in the study eye at the Day 0 appointment. In order to minimize subject discomfort, adequate local anesthesia was administered to the study eye prior to DEX implant injection. Immediately following DEX implant injection, the investigator performed indirect ophthalmic exam to assess for complications. In order to minimize risk of infection, a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic was placed in the study eye immediately prior to and following the injection, and the subject were provided a sample of a broad-spectrum antibiotic to use 4 times daily for 3 days following injection. The subject remained in the clinic for 15-30 minutes or until IOP &lt;28 mmHg.</description>
