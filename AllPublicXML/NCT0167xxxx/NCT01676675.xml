  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza virus with high incidence and
      serious complications even causing death. According to the announcement released by the World
      Health Organization (WHO), the number of global annual influenza case was 0.6 to 1.2 billion
      and 0.5 to 1 million people died. The emergence of a new subtype of influenza virus may cause
      an influenza pandemic with occurence once every 10 to 50 years which cause serious adverse
      consequences for human health and social welfare worldwide.

      From 1997 to 2003，the H5N1 virus infection has increased highly and gradually spreaded to
      Europe, Africa and other countries and regions. High mortality caused by H5N1 virus has
      attracted the WHO and national government great attention. So it is meaningful to develop
      vaccine to provide effective antibody to reduce the number of infections.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary immunogenicity of a
      whole virus inactivated influenza H5N1 vaccine.
