  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the many uses of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the assessment of right
      ventricular (RV) volumes. There are a number of congenital heart defects and acquired
      conditions in which management decisions are fundamentally based on ventricular volumes. The
      &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessment of RV volume is CMR. It has better near-field resolution than
      echo and excellent contrast between the blood pool and the myocardium. CMR is more suitable
      to the irregular geometry of the RV. The objectives of this study are (1) to assess
      ventricular volumes in the fasting state and after oral hydration in order to assess the
      effect of fluid status on ventricular volumes as measured by CMR; (2) to evaluate the effect
      of hydration on ventricular volumes compared the effect of with inter-observer and
      intra-observer variability, and; (3) to evaluate the effects of chamber volume on chamber
      deformation, including strain and peak strain rate. This study hypothesizes that (1)
      hydration status has an effect on right and left heart volumes, measured by CMR in healthy
      volunteers; (2) the effect of volume status will be a more significant contributor to
      variability in RV volumetry than that of inter-observer variability and intra-observer
      variability, and; (3) atrial and Ventricular deformation corrected for chamber size or volume
      is more accurate than when uncorrected for volume.

    <description>The CMR examinations will be performed in the cardiac MRI scanner (Siemens &quot;Avanto&quot;, 1.5 Tesla, Erlangen, Germany) at the Hospital for Sick Children. A brief echocardiogram will be performed using a GE Vivid 7 or Vivid E9 machine (General Electric Medical Systems, Wisconsin, USA) We will image from standard parasternal long axis and apical four-chamber before and after completed hydration.</description>

        Staff from the Heart Centre at The Hospital for Sick Children will be sent an email
        notifying them of the study. They will be invited to obtain the particulars of the study by
        replying to Dr. Daryl Schantz or Dr. Lars Grosse-Wortmann. If they agree to participate Dr.
        Schantz will obtain written informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be healthy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who are unable to participate in an overnight fast will be excluded

          -  Those with known or suspected structural heart disease will be excluded

          -  A screening form to identify pre-existing cardiac conditions will be completed by the
             subject prior to participation in this study. If a pre-existing condition cardiac
             condition is identified, or suspected they will be excluded from the study.

          -  If any functional abnormality is detected at any stage by echocardiography or by CMR
             the study will be terminated. Common anatomical variants, which are generally regarded
             as normal variants (such as a patent foramen ovale, or a persistent left superior vena
             cava) will not lead to exclusion from the study.
