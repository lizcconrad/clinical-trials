    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a growing clinical diagnosis affecting 10-20% of the US
      population. While current diagnostic criteria aids in correctly diagnosing IBS, the cause of
      the disease still remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that patients with IBS have
      alterations in the intestinal lining leading to release of toxic substances into the blood,
      commonly referred to as leaky gut. Current methods used to study leaky gut are both expensive
      and invasive. The investigators will test a new breath test to measure leaky gut in both IBS
      patients and subjects without IBS symptoms.

      The sucrose breath test involves taking by mouth 20 grams of common sucrose. This amount of
      sucrose is about 4 packets of sugar that you would use to sweeten a beverage. If subjects
      meet eligibility criteria, a single breath test will be conducted on all subjects. The breath
      test involves collecting breath by exhaling through a straw into a special test tube. A
      breath sample is collected before administration of sucrose. After the baseline breath
      sample, a sugar solution with the 20 grams of sucrose is administered by mouth. Three
      additional breath samples are collected at 30, 60 and 90 minutes. After 90 minutes, the
      protocol is finished. We will be analyzing breath carbon dioxide for different levels of
      heavy carbon atoms (carbon-13)with an instrument called an isotope ratio mass spectrometer.
      Our study plan is to compare the amount of carbon-13 in breath between IBS patients and
      subjects without the condition. Up to 20 subjects per group will be studied.
