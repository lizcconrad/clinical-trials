    <textblock>
      This multi-center observational study will evaluate the use and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Eligible patients
      initiated on RoActemra/Actemra treatment according to the licensed label will be followed for
      6 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With RA Diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants was reported based on the timing RA was diagnosed. Timings included more than 5 years, less than 5 years. Participants with unknown timing were reported under &quot;unknown&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Different Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>BMI was calculated by weight divided by height squared and measured as kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2). BMI from 16 to 18.5 = underweight, BMI from 18.5 to 25= normal weight, BMI from 25 to 30= overweight, BMI from 30 to 40 = obese.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Anti-Citrullinated Cyclic Peptide (Anti-CCP) Status</measure>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Reduction of at Least 2.6 Units in DAS28 From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participants' disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], participant's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity [visual analog scale (VAS): 0 millimeter (mm)=no disease activity to 100 mm=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). DAS28 was calculated using following formulas: DAS28-ESR = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PtGA of disease activity. A total possible score of 0 to approximately 10, with higher score indicating worse disease activity. A reduction of at least 2.6 units from Baseline in DAS28 was considered as significant clinical improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving a Response According to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Response was determined using EULAR criteria based upon DAS28 absolute scores at the assessment visit and the DAS28 improvement from Baseline. Participants with a score less than or equal to (≤) 3.2 and DAS28 improvement of greater than (&gt;) 1.2 points were assessed as having a 'good' response. Participants with a score ≤3.2 and DAS28 improvement of &gt;0.6 to ≤1.2 points, score of &gt;3.2 and ≤5.1 with DAS28 improvement of &gt;0.6 to ≤1.2 points, score of &gt;3.2 and ≤5.1 with DAS28 improvement of &gt;1.2 points, score of &gt;5.1 and DAS28 improvement of &gt;1.2 points were assessed as having a 'moderate' response. Participants with a score ≤3.2 and DAS28 improvement of ≤ 0.6 points, score of &gt;3.2 and ≤5.1 with DAS28 improvement of ≤ 0.6 points, score of &gt;5.1 and DAS28 improvement of &gt;0.6 to ≤1.2 points, score of &gt;5.1 and DAS28 improvement of ≤ 0.6 points were assessed as having a 'no' response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Different Types of Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The SDAI was calculated as [SJC (28 joints) + TJC (28 joints) + VAS patient global assessment of disease activity + VAS physician global assessment of disease activity+CRP level(milligram/deciliter {mg/dL})]. VAS assessments: 0 centimeters (cm)=no disease activity to 10 cm=maximum disease activity'. Scores ranged from 0 to 86, with higher scores also indicating increased disease activity. SDAI score ≤ 3.3 is 'remission', score &gt; 3.3 and ≤ 11 is 'low disease activity', score &gt; 11 and ≤ 26 is 'moderate disease activity', score &gt; 26 is 'high disease activity'. SDAI was reported as 'not available' for participants with no data on physical/patient global assessment of disease activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Different Types of Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI was calculated as [SJC (28 joints) + TJC (28 joints) + VAS patient global assessment of disease activity + VAS physician global assessment of disease activity]. VAS assessments: 0 cm =no disease activity to 100 cm=maximum disease activity'. CDAI scores ranged from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity. CDAI score ≤ 2.8 is 'remission', score &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 is 'low disease activity', score &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 is 'moderate disease activity', score &gt; 22 is 'high disease activity'. CDAI was reported as 'not available' for participants with no data on physical/patient global assessment of disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</time_frame>
    <description>ACR20/50/70 percent (%) response is defined as a ≥ 20%/50%/70% improvement (reduction) compared with baseline for both TJC28 and SJC28, as well as for three of the additional five ACR core set variables: Participant's assessment of pain over the previous 24 hours: using a VAS, left end of the line 0 cm=no pain to right end of the line 10 cm=unbearable pain; Patient's global assessment of disease activity and physician's global assessment of disease activity over the previous 24 hours using a VAS where left end of the line 0=no disease activity to right end of the line 100=maximum disease activity; health assessment questionnaire: 20 questions, 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; and acute-phase reactant [either C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate].</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Reduction of at Least 2.6 Units in DAS28 From Baseline</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participants' disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], participant’s global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity [visual analog scale (VAS): 0 millimeter (mm)=no disease activity to 100 mm=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). DAS28 was calculated using following formulas: DAS28-ESR = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PtGA of disease activity. A total possible score of 0 to approximately 10, with higher score indicating worse disease activity. A reduction of at least 2.6 units from Baseline in DAS28 was considered as significant clinical improvement.</description>
