  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to acquire information on the usage, effectiveness, safety, and
      levels of health care resource utilization associated with Velcade therapy in recurrent and
      refractory multiple myeloma patients who are initiating Velcade and various combination
      therapies within the approved indication in a naturalistic setting.

      This is a national, multi-center (study conducted in multiple sites), non-interventional (a
      scientific study where one or more investigators monitor one or more patients being treated
      with the same medication), observational study (a scientific study to make a clear and easy
      understanding of the cause and effect relationship) of Chinese Multiple Myeloma patients
      treated with Velcade. The study consists of 3 phases, including, screening phase, treatment
      phase, and follow up phase. In the screening phase, data will be collected on the basis of
      patient's demographic status, components of disease severity assessment, and potential
      prognostic factors. Data on prior cancer treatments will be collected retrospectively at
      baseline for patients receiving cancer treatment prior to receiving Velcade. In the treatment
      phase, Velcade is administered intravenously for a 2-week treatment period followed by a
      10-day rest period. Each treatment cycle consists of 21 days. Prospective (in which the
      participants are first identified and then followed forward as time passes) observational
      data will be collected during treatment with Velcade. In the follow up phase, patients will
      be followed for up to three years to document long-term survival data. For patients who
      reinitiate Velcade, data collection should follow Velcade treatment period documentation
      process. Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, intensity, and types of adverse
      events. The total duration of the study is set prospectively for three years from the date of
      the patients' initiation of Velcade.
