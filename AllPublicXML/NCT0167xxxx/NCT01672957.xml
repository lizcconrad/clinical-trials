  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate renal function in participants who underwent renal
      allograft transplantation and are started on combined immunosuppressive treatment containing
      mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept). Eligible participants will be followed for 12 months
      following transplantation.

      The participant sampling method used in the Orange study was consecutive sampling, a
      non-probability sampling method where each participant meeting the study's inclusion and
      exclusion criteria is selected and enrolled in the study until the pre-set sample size is
      achieved.

      Thus, in the Orange study de novo kidney transplanted participants, who were on mycophenolate
      mofetil immunosuppressive combination therapy in routine clinical practice, were selected in
      a consecutive manner (a non-probability sampling method) if they met the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria until 128 participants were recruited to the study.

    <measure>Creatinine Clearance at 1 Month After Transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>Creatinine clearance is an indicator of renal function. Creatinine clearance is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Normal values for healthy, young males are in the range of 100-135 milliliters per minute (mL/min) and for females, 90-125 mL/min. Creatinine clearance decreases with age. A low creatinine clearance rate indicates poor kidney function.</description>

    <description>GFR is an index of kidney function. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. A normal GFR is greater than (&gt;) 90 mL/min, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicates poor kidney function. A GFR less than (&lt;) 15 mL/min indicates kidney failure.</description>

          <title>Creatinine Clearance at Month 6 After Transplantation</title>
          <description>Creatinine clearance is an indicator of renal function. Creatinine clearance is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Normal values for healthy, young males are in the range of 100-135 mL/min and for females, 90-125 mL/min. Creatinine clearance decreases with age. A low creatinine clearance rate indicates poor kidney function.</description>
