      Clinically, recurrence and life-threatening complications are challenging problems for
      chronic suppurative osteomyelitis of the jaw. There is no quantitative analysis or report
      about the causes of or risk factors for the two problems. Doctors identify the causes or risk
      factors only through clinical experience. The investigators performed a retrospective study
      of 322 patients with chronic suppurative osteomyelitis of the jaw. The risk factors for the
      above mentioned two problems were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. The investigators
      found that some of the patients' general conditions, including age, admission temperature,
      admission white blood cell count, pre-admission antibiotic administration without
      consultation, location of the lesion, and general patient condition, were the risk factors.
      The results indicate that doctors should be mindful of those risk factors and that the
      management should be more aggressive when the above risk factors are present.

      This is a retrospective study of 322 patients hospitalized with CSOJ. The socio-demographic
      and clinical characteristics were recorded. The risk factors for the above two problems were
      analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Frequency and percentage were used to indicate
      descriptive research factors. A univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to
      calculate the odds ratio (OR) and to identify preliminary risk factors. The preliminary risk
      factors were further identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis.

    <description>An age from 6-18 years or &gt; 65 years, pre-admission antibiotic administration, a lesion at the mandibular ramus, concurrent maxillofacial space infection (MSI), and conservation of pathogenic teeth were found to be risk factors for recurrence. An age &gt; 65 years, admission temperature &gt; 39 oC, admission white blood cell (WBC) count &gt;15Ã—109/L, pre-admission antibiotic administration, concurrent MSI, pre-existing diabetes, and respiratory difficulty were found to be risk factors for life-threatening complications.</description>

        Patients with a diagnosis of CSOJ who were admitted to our hospital from 1980 to 2009 were
        investigated. Ultimately, 322 patients were enrolled in the study of life-threatening
        complications.Patients were divided into four classes according to their age (years): &lt;6,
        6-18, 19-65, &gt;65.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis on admission was made on the basis of the presence of sequestra and
             laminations of periosteal new bone in the pathological area.

          -  The other diagnostic criteria is that symptoms such as local pain, pyorrhea, fever,
             swelling, fistula, neuropalsy, odontoseisis, lymphadenopathy, bromopnea, and trismus
             pain are unresponsive or insensitive to conservative therapy and simple debridement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients without confirmed evidence of CSOJ and (or) without standard treatment (a
             combination of antimicrobial therapy and surgery consisting of incision and drainage,
             debridement or sequestrectomy) were excluded.

          -  Paget's disease, hypercementosis, fibrous dysplasia, and early stage malignant bone
             tumor were differentially diagnosed and excluded.
