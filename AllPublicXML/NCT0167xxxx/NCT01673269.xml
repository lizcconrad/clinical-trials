  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a doctor performs Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography &quot;ERCP&quot; (Endoscopy to
      examine the bile duct) a flexible tube is inserted into the mouth and into the stomach. The
      tube passes beyond the stomach and into an opening in the liver called the bile duct. Another
      small flexible endoscope is inserted inside the ERCP scope to directly visualize the bile
      duct to ensure that there are no cancers or stones in the bile duct and occasionally to take
      a sample from the bile duct. The purpose of our study is to examine wither performing this
      procedure can transmit bacteria from the bile duct to the main blood stream.

      This is a prospective study to measure the frequency of bacteremia in patients undergoing
      ERCP with direct cholangioscopic examination of the Common Bile Duct &quot;CBD&quot;. A blood culture
      will be drawn from patients prior to the procedure, 5 minutes after the procedure and 30
      minutes after the procedure. The patient will be followed up for 7 days after procedure for
      fever and sepsis. The estimated sample size is 60 patients.

             3- Adult patients (18-80) who are undergoing ERCP with direct cholangioscopic
             examination of the common bile duct for tissue acquisition from the common bile duct
             mass.

             4- Adult patients (18-80) who are undergoing ERCP with direct cholangioscopic
             examination of the common bile duct for tissue acquisition from common bile duct
             strictures.
