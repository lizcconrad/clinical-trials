    <textblock>
      Hypothermia after delivery is a world-wide problem associated with morbidity and mortality.
      The conventional approach of drying the baby with a pre-warmed towel and radiant warmers is
      unsuccessful in a large proportion of very preterm infants. Polyethylene occlusive skin
      wrapping covering the infant's body up to the neck will reduce postnatal heat loss in very
      preterm babies and represents the standard of care recommended by the International
      Guidelines for Neonatal Resuscitation. The use of a polyethylene head cap will also reduce
      heat loss 9 and its efficacy is comparable to that obtained with the wrap. However, the
      proportions of hypothermic infants at NICU admission (temperature &lt;34Â°C) in the wrapped group
      (62%) as well as in the infants covered with a polyethylene cap (43%) remain high. The
      combination of body and head protection with a polyethylene wrap needs to be evaluated
      further. The investigators conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in very
      preterm infants to evaluate whether a polyethylene total body wrapping (body plus head)
      prevents heat loss after delivery better than polyethylene occlusive wrapping.
