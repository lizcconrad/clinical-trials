      The main purpose of this study is to prospectively examine changes in Brain Network
      Activation(BNA)following concussion in high school athletes. In addition, the study will
      examine the relationship between changes in BNA to symptoms, cognitive performance and
      vestibular function from baseline to 1-7, 8-14 and 15-21 day post injury intervals in high
      school athletes with concussion.

        High school (13-18 yrs) athletes from American football, soccer, and lacrosse who meet the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited into the study. We expect that between 10-20
        participants will sustain a concussion during the period of the study and complete the
        post-concussion protocol.
