  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of pain in the shoulder, arm and hand is high among slaughterhouse workers,
      allegedly due to the substantial load of these body regions during work. Work disability is a
      common consequence of these pains. Lowering the physical exposure through ergonomic
      intervention may be a strategy to reduce the workload. An alternative strategy could be to
      increase the physical capacity through strength training of the shoulder-, arm- and
      hand-muscles. This study investigates the effect of two contrasting interventions, i.e. load
      reduction (ergonomic intervention) versus training of physical capacity (strength training)
      on pain and work disability in slaughterhouse workers.

      The main hypothesis is that strength training intervention for 10 weeks compared with
      ergonomic intervention results in reduced pain of the shoulder, arm and hand.

    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>

    <description>The change in &quot;pain intensity during the last week&quot; (average value of shoulder, elbow and hand) from baseline to 10 week follow-up between the strength training group and ergonomic group. The ergonomic group will be considered the reference group. 2-way analysis of variance (Proc Mixed of SAS) with repeated measures will be used, with time and group as fixed factors and subject as random factor.</description>
