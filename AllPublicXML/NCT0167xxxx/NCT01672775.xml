  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics and assess the
      immunogenicity and effectiveness of AGS-16C3F in subjects with renal cell cancer (RCC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two components. The first aims to establish a safe dose for AGS-16C3F. Once
      identified, the safety and effectiveness will be tested in additional subjects with either
      clear cell or papillary histology in expanded cohorts.
