  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is characterize the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and
      steady-state plasma levels after once-daily oral dosing of prucalopride (R108512) as a
      solution, 0.01 mg/kg to 0.03 mg/kg, given to paediatric subjects with functional faecal
      retention (FFR) for 8 weeks.

      Hypothesis:

      Pharmacokinetic profile of prucalopride in paediatric subjects is expected to resemble the
      adult pharmacokinetic profile. Safety and tolerability profile are expected to resemble the
      adult profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open-label trial in which paediatric subjects (ages 4 to 12 years)
      with FFR were administered prucalopride in oral solution once daily for 8 weeks. Subjects who
      entered this extension trial had completed PRU-USA-12, a single-dose pharmacokinetic trial,
      usually within the previous week.

      Evaluations for efficacy, safety and tolerability were performed, and plasma samples for
      analysis of prucalopride levels were obtained at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks.

      The initial dosage of prucalopride oral solution was 0.02 mg/kg/day. Dependent on the
      subject's response, the parent could adjust the dosage within a range of 0.01 mg/kg/day to
      0.03 mg/kg/day.
