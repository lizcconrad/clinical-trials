  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a &quot;proof of concept&quot; study, to assess the feasibility of introducing a novel
      high-precision radiotherapy technique called &quot;stereotactic radiosurgery&quot; (SRS) or
      &quot;stereotactic body radiotherapy&quot; (SBRT) for the treatment of kidney cancers in Australia.
      This study aims to invite 20 patients with renal cell carcinoma and 10 patients with isolated
      adrenal metastases from non-small cell carcinoma who are either medically inoperable, high
      risk for surgery, or decline surgery to participate. In cohort of patients with renal cell
      carcinoma, both patients with primary disease only, and those patients who have limited
      metastases (≤5) will be eligible. Besides technical feasibility of delivering this treatment,
      this study will be to assess efficacy, toxicity and tumour response using a novel imaging
      biomarker called diffusion weighted-MRI.

      FASTRACK is a 2 -cohort, non-randomised prospective feasibility study. Anticipated total
      duration of accrual is approximately 24 months, with all patients expected to complete all
      protocol treatment and imaging within a further 3 months. The trial will close after the last
      patient has completed his/her last protocol related follow-up visit (at 12 months
      post-treatment).

      Cohort 1: patients with renal cell carcinoma within the kidney Cohort 2: patients with
      solitary adrenal metastases from non-small cell lung carcinoma The investigational treatment
      will be prescribed the covering isodose, ensuring that 99% of the PTV is covered by 100% of
      the dose (D99=100%). It is anticipated that most treatments should be highly conformal.
      Treatment must be delivered with at least six (6) non-opposing conformal megavoltage photon
      beams. It is anticipated that a typical range of beam numbers would be 8 to 12, comprising of
      at least 6 co-planar beams and 1-2 non-coplanar beams. No cytotoxic chemotherapy is allowed
      within 3 weeks or concurrently with respect to the investigational treatment. Consultation
      with the treating radiation oncologist is strongly recommended if chemotherapy is to be
      considered after the investigational treatment and before documented disease progression, to
      prevent unforeseen combined toxicities. Targeted agents (such as sunitinib) are exempt from
      this recommendation.

Gastrointestinal (Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, acute ulceration)
Pulmonary (atelectasis, cough, dyspnoea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, fibrosis)

    <description>Effective SBRT is defined as a treatment which results in local control at 1 year after treatment. Local control is defined as lack of progression of the target lesion as measured by RECIST criteria. RECIST criteria are a CT evaluation of change in tumour size.</description>
