  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the accuracy of bowel ultrasound in the follow-up of known (previously
      diagnosed) pediatric small bowel Crohn disease, using MR Enterography (magnetic resonance
      imaging technology used to obtain detailed images of the small bowel) as the reference
      standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      25-30% of individuals with Crohn disease present during childhood or adolescence, and the
      incidence is rising. MRE (magnetic resonance enterography) is considered the standard of care
      for imaging of pediatric small bowel Crohn's disease. Bowel ultrasound is an emerging
      technology for bowel assessment and offers several advantages over MRE, including lower cost,
      shorter exam time, and lack of need for sedation and contrast materials and bowel medication.
      The researchers goal is to assess the accuracy of bowel ultrasound in the follow-up of known
      pediatric small bowel Crohn disease using MRE and the reference standard.

    <description>The subject will have a small intravenous (IV) catheter placed in on of their arms before the MRE exam. Medications called Glucagon and MultiHance will be given thru the IV catheter during the imaging study. The glucagon will decrease the movement of the intestines, which helps provide better images of the bowel. MultiHance is a contrast that helps create clearer MRE images. In addition to the MultiHance, the subject will be given an oral contrast medication called VoLumen to drink approximately 45 minutes before the MRE imaging is started. These medications are used for all clinically necessary MRE studies performed in children and adults at the UMHS. The MRE will take approximately 50 to 60 minutes to complete.</description>
