  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how patients use ustekinumab (label-recommended or
      other/missed dose interval) in Asia-Pacific countries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the medication), multicenter, Phase 4,
      observational study (no study medication was administered during the study) designed to
      assess how patients will use ustekinumab (label-recommended or other/missed dose interval) in
      Asia-Pacific countries. The study will consist of 4 study visits which will take place over
      the duration of 1 year. At the first visit (ie, Week 0), eligibility for the study will be
      determined (it will be screening and baseline visit). At each subsequent visit (Weeks 16, 28,
      and 52), exposure to ustekinumab will be recorded, questionnaires for efficacy will be
      completed, and information about adverse events and concomitant medications will be
      collected. As many patient reported outcome questionnaires as possible will be administered,
      depending on the availability of validated translations. Safety will be assessed by
      monitoring of adverse events, vital signs and physical examination.

    <description>Epidemiologic characteristics of the psoriasis patients (sex, age, race, weight height, and peak disease level) will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline (Week 0) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at Weeks 16, 28 and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 16, 28 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a physician-administered assessment tool used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline (Week 0) in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score at Weeks 16, 28, and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16, 28 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>NAPSI is used for assessing and grading the severity of nail psoriasis. Each nail is divided with imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each nail is given a score for nail matrix psoriasis (0 to 4) and nail bed psoriasis (0 to 4) depending on the presence of any of the features of nail psoriasis in the 4 quadrants as: 0 (none), 1 (present in 1/4 nail), 2 (2/4), 3 (3/4), and 4 (4/4). Each nail gets a matrix score and a nail bed score, the total of which is the score for that nail (0 to 8). Each nail is evaluated, and the sum of all the nails is the total NAPSI score. The sum of the scores from all nails is 0 to 160 (Both finger and toe nails are included). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16, 28 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D (EuroQol Group) is a validated generic measure of quality of life which usually requires less than 1 minute to complete (eg, the questionnaire may have questions about mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline (Week 0) in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16, 28 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a patient-completed 10-item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluating overall quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The aim of this questionnaire is to measure how much your skin problem has affected your life over the last week. For each of 10 questions patient has to select one of the following options: very much, a lot, a little, not at all.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16, 28 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PBI is a patient-defined benefit assessment tool. Patients select personally relevant treatment goals from a standardized list of benefits called the Patient Needs Questionnaire. An evaluation of those treatment goals assessed by the patient is captured on the Patient Benefit Questionnaire. The PBI is calculated from the sum of the benefit items weighted by their respective relevance divided by the number of relevant items. Values between 0 (no benefit) and 4 (maximal patient-defined benefit) are possible.</description>
