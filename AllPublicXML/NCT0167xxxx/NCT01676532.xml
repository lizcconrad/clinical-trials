      This is a prospective cross sectional study to assess the feasibility of a school based
      health centre (SBHC) at Sprucecourt Public School, an inner-city elementary school in
      Toronto. The SBHC allows inner-city children who face barriers to accessing health care the
      opportunity to receive health care in their school.The primary aim of this study is to
      determine utilization of the SBHC. Establishing feasibility of the SBHC would support further
      development and expansion of this program into other inner city schools.

      A chart review of the first year of the SBHC was conducted. Feasibility metrics included the
      number of children who enrolled at the SBHC. Efficacy metrics included the proportion of
      enrolled children who enrolled at SBHC. Efficacy metrics included the proportion of enrolled
      children who attended and received new diagnoses and treatment plans
