    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a serious, costly and highly prevalent condition. However,
      currently available treatment options have limited efficacy. The aim of this pilot study is
      to determine whether patients suffering from MDD who have not responded to at least one
      antidepressant trial may actively engage in a novel group therapy, Central Meditation and
      Imagery Therapy (CMIT). Preliminary results with individual patients suggest that CMIT
      techniques may have benefit for major depression. The purpose of this trial is to assess the
      feasibility of a group form of CMIT for the treatment of major depression. The trial will
      also seek to identify neurophysiological and cardiovascular predictors of treatment response.

      In this study, 10 subjects with major depressive disorder will receive antidepressant
      treatment augmentation with group meditation and mental imagery therapy for a total of 12
      weeks, as well as daily meditation practice. Group sessions will also involve gentle yogic
      stretches. The subjects will be limited to those who remain depressed despite at least one
      trial of antidepressant medication. Changes in brain activity and heart rate variability will
      be measured at three time points utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) and pulse monitors.
      Depression symptoms will be measured at several time points using questionnaires and
      objective measures. Participation will require a total of 15 visits for weekly therapy and
      the measurements. Two-month follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to the subjects after
      study end to assess durability of any improvements in depressive symptoms.

    <description>Intervention involved Central Meditation, may be characterized by a voluntary, regulated attentional set towards a specific stimulus or set of stimuli and visualization exercises utilized within CMIT, which primarily involves two types of thought experiments: 1) creating mental models of how a person fits into the larger world and universe according to evolutionary biology and modern cosmology, in order to gain a larger perspective on emotions and thought patterns, and 2) backcasting, the generation of a desirable future coupled with mental time travel back to the present to determine how to create that future with present-day actions.</description>
