  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incretins have become a successful drug target in the repertoire of medications used for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. However little is known about a potential benefit of GLP-1 on
      the vascular system in humans, independent of their glucose lowering actions and data are
      only derived from ex vivo studies in animals. Particularly little is known about clinically
      relevant benefits of GLP-1 and its analogues on the microvascular system of individuals with
      type 2 diabetes.

      The vascular effect could be medicated by endogenous GLP-1 (9,36) amide, the breakdown
      product of GLP-1 (7,36) amide which has a low affinity for the GLP-1 receptor. The
      investigators hypothesis is that the co-administration of DPP-IV inhibitors will lack the
      beneficial effects of GLP-1 on the vascular system as GLP-1 (9,36) amide will not be produced
      by the body.

      The study aims to examine the response of GLP-1 and its analogues on small blood vessels and
      examine the effect of the addition of DPP-IV inhibition in healthy lean individuals, obese
      individuals and subjects with Type 2 diabetes.
