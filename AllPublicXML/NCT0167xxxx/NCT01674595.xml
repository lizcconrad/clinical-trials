      This trial is an open, national, multi-centre trial. The trial will be initiated after olive
      pollen season 2012 and subjects will receive treatment for 6 weeks.

      The aim of study is to assess the tolerability of the up-dosing phase of AVANZ Olive. The
      frequency of patients with adverse reactions will be the primary endpoint.

      Frequency of patients with systemic reactions according to EAACI classification, increase in
      IgG4 and in IgE and reduction in immediate skin reactivity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 18-65 years of age.

          2. A clinical history of olive pollen induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or
             without asthma at least one year prior to trial entry.

          3. Positive SPT to olive pollen (wheal diameter ≥ 3 mm).

          4. A positive specific IgE against olive pollen (≥Class 2; ≥0.70 KU/L) documented in the
             last 5 y

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted value at screening after adequate pharmacologic treatment.

          2. Uncontrolled or severe asthma.

          3. A clinically relevant history of symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or
             conjunctivitis caused by an allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed and
             sensitized.

          4. History of severe asthma exacerbation or emergency room visit or admission for asthma
             in the previous 12 months.

          5. At screening, current symptoms of, or treatment for, upper respiratory tract
             infection, acute sinusitis, acute otitis media or other relevant infection (serous
             otitis media is not an exclusion criterion).

          6. Treatment with parenteral corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids or anti-IgE in the
             previous 3 months or during the study (except for steroids if needed as rescue
             medication).

          7. Currently treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, tricyclic
             antidepressants, β-blockers, mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and any other drug
             containing alum (e.g. antacids) taken on a daily basis.

          8. Previous treatment by other allergen concomitant IT or immunotherapy with Olea
             europaea extracts within the previous 5 years (initiation of subcutaneous
             immunotherapy is acceptable if treatment has been discontinued before reaching
             maintenance dose; for SLIT 3 months in the last 5 years is accepted).

          9. History of anaphylactic shock due to e.g. food, insect venom, exercise or drug.

         10. History of severe and recurrent angioedema.

         11. Any contraindication according to the Investigator Brochure (IB).

         12. Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening.
