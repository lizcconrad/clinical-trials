  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) has been associated with increased
      morbidity and mortality. Patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) have elevated risk for
      development of CTEPH. It is not known, whether the location of pulmonary embolism (central
      vs. peripheral) nor fibrinolysis have an impact of CTEPH incidence. This study has been
      performed to assess the CTEPH incidence in different populations: in patients with central
      vs. peripheral PE and in patients with or without fibrinolysis therapy for PE.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The embolus localization during index pulmonary embolism might be of potential relevance for
      CTEPH development.

      In the present study patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism for at least 12 months will
      be screened for CTEPH. The incidence of CTEPH will be correlated to thrombus location
      (central vs. peripheral) and the index use of fibrinolysis.
