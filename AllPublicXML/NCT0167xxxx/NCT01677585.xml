      The purpose of this study is to compile real-world clinical outcomes data for the PROMUS
      Element™ and PROMUS Element™ Plus Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS Element
      and PROMUS Element Plus Stent System) in routine clinical practice in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus-eluting stents have been studied extensively in ongoing clinical studies. The
      safety and effectiveness of the everolimus drug and polymer combination have been studied
      extensively in the SPIRIT Clinical Trial Program. The PROMUS Element stent is currently being
      studied in the PLATINUM Clinical Trial Program. The PROMUS Element stent is also being
      evaluated in PROMUS Element Plus US post-approval studies and the ongoing Platinum China
      study. This study is designed to provide post-market surveillance information on the PROMUS
      Element™ and PROMUS Element™ Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS Element and
      PROMUS Element Plus Stent System) after it has been approved by SFDA (State of Food and Drug
      Administration) in China. The study will evaluate clinical outcomes for subjects receiving
      the PROMUS Element and PROMUS Element plus stents over 5 years in a real world setting
      according to post approval requirements from SFDA.
