  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single 2 mg oral dose of
      prucalopride in subjects with various degrees of renal impairment compared with normal renal
      function and to monitor the safety profile of prucalopride in subjects with renal impairment.

      Hypothesis:

      Prucalopride might accumulate and exhibit a different pharmacokinetic profile in renally
      impaired subjects compared with the normal population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open label, single-dose, pharmacokinetic trial with prucalopride in
      subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. Subjects were classified into one of four
      renal function groups, as defined by a 24-hour creatinine clearance determination (CRCL)
      obtained within 2 weeks before trial entry. Each subject was administered a single 2mg oral
      dose of prucalopride. Plasma samples and complete urine collections were obtained from 0
      through 120 h (6 days) after dosing to characterize the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects had to meet the following inclusion criteria:

          -  Between the ages of 18 and 75 years, inclusive;

          -  Males or females. Females were to be of non-childbearing potential.

        Normal subjects had to meet the following additional inclusion criteria:

          -  Demographically comparable to the subjects with renal impairment, within 30% of mean
             weight and height and 10% of the mean age;

          -  Physical examination, clinical laboratory results, and 12-lead ECG within normal
             limits at screening;

          -  No intake of medication, including over-the-counter medication, during a pre-trial
             7-day drug-free washout period;

        Subjects with renal impairment had to meet the following additional inclusion criteria:

          -  Stable severity of renal disease;

          -  Concomitant medications to treat underlying disease states or medical conditions
             related to renal insufficiency were allowed;

          -  Stable dose of medication and/or treatment regimen from 2 months prior to and during
             the trial;

          -  Subjects with stable cardiovascular disease could be enrolled, provided that the
             investigator felt their condition would not interfere with the results of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All subjects who met any of the following criteria were excluded from the trial:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to prucalopride or inactive ingredients in the
             prucalopride capsule or to related prokinetic compounds;

          -  Use of any other investigational drug within 30 days prior to signing the consent or
             intention to take any investigational drug during the trial;

          -  History of significant blood loss, or blood plasma donation (500mL) within the last 30
             days;

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding;

          -  Gastrointestinal (GI) surgery within 3 months, or history of major GI surgery with
             potential compromise of drug absorption or metabolism;

        Normal subjects who met any of the following criteria were excluded from the trial:

          -  Any abnormal medical history, physical examination, ECG, or laboratory results;

          -  Use of medications 7 days prior to and during the trial.

          -  Subjects with renal impairment who met any of the following criteria were excluded
             from the trial.

          -  Any abnormality in medical history, physical examination, ECG, or laboratory results
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect the safety of the subject;

          -  History of uric acid stone disease, uricosuria, or gout, or current hyperuricemia;

          -  Renal transplants, lupus erythematosus, or renal carcinoma.
