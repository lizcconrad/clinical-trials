  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main focus of this study is to develop blood and/or urine tests that will help to detect
      early signs of rejection in people who have had a liver transplant. Researchers will examine
      blood, urine, and tissue samples and try to identify markers for certain conditions such as
      rejection, response to therapy, and scarring of the liver. Additionally, researchers would
      like to identify biomarkers that can detect damage to the native kidneys before blood levels
      of creatinine rises. By studying gene expression, researchers hope to be able to diagnose
      these conditions earlier and improve liver survival.
