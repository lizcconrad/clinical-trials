      The overall purpose of this project is to study the acute, short- (≤ 1 year) and long- (&gt; 1
      year) term effects on body composition and psychological health after a 10 to 14-weeks
      comprehensive lifestyle modification program for the treatment of severe obesity.

      The aims of the PhD project are to investigate whether an intensive lifestyle intervention
      leads to acute and short term (&lt; 1 year) changes in:

        1. The BMI/Weight

        2. Body composition (waist circumference, fat mass, fat free mass, skeletal muscle mass and
           visceral fat area)

        3. Psychosocial factors such as eating behavior, anxiety and depression symptoms and
           health-related quality of life

      The study is based on data collected from patients at The Hjelp24 NIMI Ringerike Obesity
      Clinic, which is an inpatient program to address morbid obesity in adults. The study is a
      non-randomized clinical trial comparing the acute and long-term effects on physical and
      psychological health of the 10-14-weeks inpatient comprehensive lifestyle modification
      program for the treatment of morbidly obese patients.

      In between the inpatient stay, the patients are followed up either by telephone, occasional
      mail and/or structured / weekly email.

      In this project we prospectively follow two groups of patient included in the treatment
      programme in September 2010 and January 2011, respectively. In addition a control group with
      waiting-list patients is also included in the study, and they were recruited in
      October-November 2011
