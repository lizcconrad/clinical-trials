  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about what factors influence parental decisions to participate or to decline
      participation in tobacco trials offered in the pediatric clinical setting. Further, it is
      unclear what proportion of parents treated in our setting would elect to receive formal
      assistance with quitting smoking or consider alternative approaches that could facilitate
      eventual smoking cessation. While the recommendation to parents is generally to quit smoking,
      some may be unwilling or unable to quit and prefer more achievable alternative treatment
      goals. Some parent smokers may be unlikely to participate in an intervention aimed only at
      cessation but would be willing to participate in an intervention focused on establishing
      smoke-free environments for their child. Parents are typically not offered a choice regarding
      the type of intervention they receive and many interventions are not tailored to their
      readiness to quit smoking or designed to reach multiple family members in the home who may
      also smoke. Quitting smoking and establishing smoke-free homes and cars are distinct, yet
      challenging, goals for parents and families. Both approaches can directly, or indirectly,
      help parents to quit smoking, reduce the child's exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS), and
      initiate an important dialogue with families about tobacco control. How parental
      acceptability of smoking interventions is affected by the context of their child's treatment
      for cancer or SCD, as well as survivorship, warrants further study.

      Following a Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM), this study will assess factors that influence
      parent's willingness to participate in tobacco trials that emphasize cessation or promotion
      of smoke-free homes/cars while identifying barriers for implementing these strategies.
      Information will be obtained from questionnaires completed by parents. This information will
      be used to suggest an appropriate emphasis for intervention, refine our recruitment
      strategies, design interventions that maximize participation rates and retention, and better
      direct our resources and future tobacco control efforts for patients and their families.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the proportion of smoking parents of children with cancer, children with
           sickle cell disease (SCD), and childhood cancer survivors who are willing to participate
           in tobacco trials offered in the context of their child's medical care.

    <description>The proportion of parents who are willing to participate in a tobacco trial will be determined by affirmative responses to at least one of three questions that assess willingness to participate in a research study focused on smoking cessation, adoption of a smoke-free home and car, and/or enforcement and maintenance of a smoke-free home and car.</description>

    <description>Questionnaire data will be collected one time from parents who enroll on the study during their child's regular clinical visit. We will use a cross-sectional design to estimate the proportion of smoking parents of children with or surviving cancer, or sickle cell disease (SCD) who are willing to participate in tobacco trials, hypothetically offered in the context of their child's medical care. We will also examine the contribution of sociodemographic, environmental, and psychosocial variables, as well as, smoking behaviors as they relate to a parent's willingness to participate in a tobacco-related study.</description>

        For the purposes of this protocol, the term &quot;parent&quot; includes biological parents,
        step-parents, and legal guardians.

        The primary study population will consist of parents of St. Jude Children's Research
        Hospital (SJCRH) patients with a diagnosis of (1) cancer or (2) sickle cell disease (to
        include genotypes HbSS, HbSC, HbSβ°thal, HbSβ+thal, HbSD, HbSO, Hb S/HPFH, HbSE), or (3)
        will be a surviving cancer patient.
