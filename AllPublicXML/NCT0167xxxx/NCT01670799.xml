    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-cancer effect of a pain medication called
      ketorolac (Toradol) on ovarian cancer cells in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity after
      surgery for ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the seventh most common cause of cancer
      deaths in women across the globe. The majority of women, nearly 70%, will present with
      advanced stage disease that heralds a poor prognosis.

      Despite aggressive treatment that still favors initial debulking surgery followed by a
      platinum and taxane based chemotherapy regimen, most patients relapse after achieving a
      complete clinical response.

      Our group has shown that the ketorolac can inhibit gene activity which inhibits cell
      proliferation and migration.Ketorolac will be used in this study with the goal of producing
      specific inhibition of cell adhesion and migration in ovarian cancer cells retrieved within
      the peritoneal cavity after cytoreductive surgery.

    <description>All patients will receive a single dose of IV ketorolac for pain management for the indication of post-operative pain control. Patients less than 65 years of age and in otherwise good health will receive a 30mg IV single dose. Patients 65 years of age or greater, or who have mild renal insufficiency or are of low weight (as per section 3.2) will receive a single 15 mg dose IV ketorolac.
In patients who have a clinical pain response and have no contraindications to multi-dose (every 6 hours over 24 hours), additional doses will be given per physician discretion based on clinical indication. Patients receiving 24 hour dosing will be eligible for sample time points after 24 hour dosing.</description>
