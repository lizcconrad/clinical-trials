      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group multi-center study in
      adult patients with active moderate to severe UC . Eligible patients will be randomly
      assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups, bertilimumab 10 mg/kg or matching
      placebo, respectively.

      The study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to two weeks, a 4-week
      double-blind treatment period (three IV infusions at 2-week intervals), and a safety and
      efficacy follow-up period of approximately 9 weeks.

      Bertilimumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes human eotaxin-1
      (eotaxin). Bertilimumab will be administered every other week for 4-weeks, by IV infusion
      over 30 minutes.
