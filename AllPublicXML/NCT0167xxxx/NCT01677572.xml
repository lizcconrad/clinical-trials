    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple
      doses of Aducanumab (recombinant, fully human anti-Aβ IgG1 mAb) in participants with
      prodromal or mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The secondary objectives of this study are to
      assess the effect on cerebral amyloid plaque content as measured by florbetapir-fluorine-18
      (18F-AV-45F-AV-45) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, to assess the multiple dose
      serum concentrations of Aducanumab and to evaluate the immunogenicity of Aducanumab after
      multiple dose administration in this population.

      The study consists of a placebo-controlled period to study week 54, followed by a long-term
      extension to study week 388. The placebo-controlled period is conducted with a staggered,
      parallel group design, with the first 3 treatment arms conducted in parallel, 2 further
      treatment arms subsequently beginning in parallel, 2 additional treatment arms beginning in
      parallel, and the last 2 treatment arms subsequently beginning in parallel. Qualifying
      participants can enter the long-term extension period for up to 42 additional doses of active
      drug for the first 3 years of LTE. Furthermore, up until the last participant in Arms 8 and 9
      has had his or her EOS Visit in the third year of the LTE, eligible participants will be able
      to continue treatment beyond the third year of the LTE.
