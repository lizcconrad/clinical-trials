    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained rhythm disturbance, is associated with a
      significantly enhanced mortality and morbidity due to thromboembolic events, and other
      cardiac and noncardiac complications. Therefore the &quot;Network of Competence on Atrial
      Fibrillation (AFNET)&quot; supported by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) was
      established in order to collect clinical data on patients (pts) with AF (paroxysmal,
      persistent, permanent) over a study period of 6 years with an expected sample size of 12,000
      pts. Incidence, clinical relevance and outcome after SAE is recorded and assessed by a
      Critical Event Committee (CEC).

      The CEC-members (experts in cardiology and neurology) defined as SAE any death with or
      without relationship to AF, cardio-embolic events (stroke, peripheral arterial embolism),
      bleeding complications due to antithrombotic therapy, acute heart failure, syncope,
      resuscitation; additionally, the complication of interventional strategies for AF-treatment
      and other AF-independent SAEs.

      Over a 3-year follow-up period, during 6-monthly and unscheduled visits, the SAEs are
      systematically documented, blinded and their relationship to AF will be interpreted in detail
      by the CEC.
