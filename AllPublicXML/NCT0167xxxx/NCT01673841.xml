  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study the investigators compared mixed venous oxygen saturation (SmvO2) with
      relative and absolute cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) measurements. They hypothesized that
      previously reported contradictory results regarding the equivalence of SmvO2 and rScO2 might
      be related to time delay issues and to the measurement technology.

      42 consenting patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were
      included. 4 disposable oxygenation sensors were applied bilaterally on the patient's forehead
      for continuous, non-invasive registration of rScO2. The sensors of one monitor were placed
      just above the eyebrows, and the sensors of the other monitor were placed just above the
      former sensors. The sensors placement was determined at random by a computerized
      randomization list. SmvO2 was measured continuously via a pulmonary artery catheter. All
      variables were recorded continuously. The study ended at the end of the operation.
