    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two different
      formulations of FP-01.1 as well as build on the data set from the first in human study
      FP-01.1_CS_01. It is anticipated that the results of this Phase I study will inform the best
      formulation of the vaccine to evaluate in efficacy studies.

             control in addition to any contraceptive measures normally taken by his partner until
             completion of the Day 57 visit, and refrain from fathering a child at least until
             completion ofthe Day 57 visit. Male subjects do not need to use contraception if their
             partner has been through the menopause, or has had her womb or both her ovaries
             removed.

             OR

             • For female subjects of childbearing potential, be surgically sterile or using an
             insertable, injectable, transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive approved by the
             TGA combined with a barrier contraceptive through to completion of the Day 57 visit
             study and have negative results on a serum or urine pregnancy test done before
             administration of study medication (women who are postmenopausal [no menses for at
             least 2 years] are also eligible to participate)

          3. Satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically significant or relevant
             abnormalities in medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG and
             laboratory evaluation (haematology, biochemistry or urinalysis) as assessed by the
             Investigator.

          4. An understanding, ability and willingness to fully comply with study procedures and
             restrictions

          5. Ability to provide written, personally signed and dated informed consent to
             participate in the study.

          6. The subject has a body mass index (BMI) within the range 19.0-32.0 kg/m2 and falls
             within the weight range of 50.0-100.0 kg.

          7. The subject is willing to present a study prepared letter to a General Practitioner
             (GP) if visiting for any purpose

          8. Subject is willing to refrain from consuming alcohol for 24h prior to all visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As a result of the medical screening process, the Principal Investigator or
             Co-Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.

          2. Current, chronic or recurrent disease (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine,
             renal, liver, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, immune suppression, malignancy or other
             conditions) that could affect the action, absorption or disposition of the IMP or
             could affect clinical or laboratory assessments.

          3. Significant illness as judged by the Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator within
             2 weeks of the first dose of IMP.

          4. Subjects with a history of allergies or allergic conditions including anaphylactic
             reactions, asthmatics, hay fever and eczema sufferers requiring medication which in
             the opinion of the Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator will affect their
             participation in the study.

          5. Subjects receiving medications that affect the immune system including systemic
             steroids and patients on chronic medications where the dose has not been stable for at
             least 3 months.

          6. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the IMP, or closely related
             compounds or any of the stated ingredients

          7. History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year. A positive screen
             for alcohol or drugs of abuse.

          8. Male subjects who consume more than 21 units of alcohol per week and female subjects
             who consume more than 14 units of alcohol per week.

          9. A positive HIV antibody screen, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B core
             antibody, or Hepatitis C antibody screen

         10. Subjects who have significant scarring, tattoos, abrasions, cuts or infections, that
             in the opinion of the Investigator could interfere with evaluation of injection site
             local reactions, over the deltoid region of both arms as these will be the dose site.

         11. Donation of blood or blood products (e.g. plasma, platelets) within 90 days prior to
             or intention to donate blood during the entire study.

             first dose of IMP or intention to enrol in another clinical study throughout the
             entire study (up to and including Day 57), including the 6 month follow-up period for
             those subjects who consent to remain on study for this follow-up.

         13. Subject with suspected recent (≤12 months) pre-exposure to the influenza A virus - flu
             like symptoms associated with ≥ 2 days off normal daily activities

         14. Subjects who have received a flu vaccine in the last 12 months or who anticipate
             receiving it within the duration of the clinical phase of the study (ie up to
             completion of Day 57) or the period up to the 6 month safety follow-up telephone call,
             for the subjects who consent to remain on study for this follow-up.

         15. Any clinically significant abnormalities, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator
             or Co-Investigator, on electrocardiograms (ECGs), as assessed against the clinical
             site's reference range.

        In addition, for each subject, a completed medical history questionnaire will be taken as
        part of the consented study procedure.
