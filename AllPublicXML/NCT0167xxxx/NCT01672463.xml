  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase 1b clinical trial of IV administration of OKN-007 in a pilot
      cohort of human recurrent malignant glioma patients. All patients will have been previously
      treated with the standard-of-care treatment which includes surgical resection, radiation and
      chemotherapy, and in some cases treatment for recurrent disease with investigational agents
      or bevacizumab (Avastin). Patients with unequivocal recurrence (first or greater) established
      by MRI with and without contrast (e.g., Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentacetic
      acid) and meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be eligible for OKN-007 treatment on
      this protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed histopathology of WHO grade III glioma or WHO grade IV GBM at primary
             diagnosis

          2. Unequivocal radiographic evidence of tumor progression by MRI within 14 days prior to
             registration

          3. Prior radiotherapy

          4. Prior Temozolomide treatment

          5. Last cytotoxic chemotherapy 28 or more days or biologic therapy treatment 14 or more
             days before study start (greater than or equal to 42 days if nitrosourea was
             administered)

          6. Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60%

          7. Full recovery (&lt; grade 1) from the toxic effects of any earlier intervention and a
             minimum of 28 days from the administration of any investigational agent

          8. Adequate renal, liver and bone marrow function:

               -  Leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL

               -  Platelets &gt;100,000/mcL

               -  Total bilirubin within normal limits

               -  AST / ALT (SGPT) &lt;2.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine within normal limits

          9. Patients must be &gt;_18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Second primary malignancy (except adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin). Patients who had another malignancy in the past, but have been free of active
             disease for more than 2 years, are eligible

          2. Have received treatment within the last 28 days with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry

          3. Serious concomitant systemic disorders (for example, active infection or abnormal
             electrocardiogram (ECG) indicative of cardiac disease) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient and his/her ability to
             complete the study

          4. Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance of
             &lt; 60 mL/min)

          5. Patients with sodium, potassium, or creatinine serum electrolytes &gt; grade 2.

          6. Patients with PT/PTT above the upper limit of normal

          7. Screening ECG abnormality documented by the investigator as medically significant
