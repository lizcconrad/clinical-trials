  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for subjects with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The purpose of this research
      study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of modified Folfirinox and radiation
      therapy as treatment for adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the pancreas before surgery. Screening
      tests will be done to determine if subjects are eligible for participation in this study. If
      subjects are eligible to participate and agree to participate they will begin chemotherapy.
      After 3 cycles of chemotherapy, subjects will begin chemoradiation. Within 4 to 8 weeks of
      completing radiation therapy, subjects will have surgery. There will also be post-treatment
      and follow-up evaluations. Subjects will be followed for every 3 months for 3 years after
      their initial registration.
