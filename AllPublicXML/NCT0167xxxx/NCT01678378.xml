    <textblock>
      This community-partnered participatory study will work within high school health centers
      (SHCs) to test, via a 2-armed cluster randomized controlled trial, a multi-level intervention
      to reduce adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) among adolescents ages 14-19. The goal of this
      study is to examine the effectiveness of the School Health Center Healthy Adolescent
      Relationships Program (SHARP) intervention in SHCs on individual SHC clients, the SHC clinic
      environment, and the schools in which the SHCs are located. Evaluation of the intervention
      will involve random assignment of eight comparable SHCs in the Greater Bay Area of California
      that provide comprehensive health services, to either intervention or control sites.
      Adolescent females and males ages 14-19 seeking care at any of these SHCs (N=1200) will be
      assessed via audio computer-assisted survey instrument (ACASI) at baseline and 16-20 weeks
      follow-up to examine intervention effects on knowledge and self-efficacy regarding ARA, harm
      reduction and ARA-related resources as well as intentions to intervene with peers. For youth
      reporting recent ARA victimization, the investigators will assess for increases in ARA
      disclosure, resource utilization, as well as reduction in ARA victimization.

    <description>Providers and staff located in high school school health centers (i.e., nurse practitioners, nurses,physicians, health educators, medical assistants) will be trained to address adolescent relationship abuse with school health center clients using knowledge, skills, and resources gained through the SHARP Intervention training. The training includes strategies to help youth recognize adolescent relationship abuse among themselves and their peers, to learn strategies to increase safety (harm reduction), and to utilize adolescent relationship abuse-related resources.</description>
