  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial the investigators want to investigate whether early
      versus late mobilisation after surgery in the first carpometacarpal joint (CMC1) leads to a
      faster recovery of hand function. The investigators also want to explore patients'
      satisfaction with the two different treatment regimes. The participants in the control group
      will receive the standard treatment at Diakonhjemmet hospital: immobilisation of the thumb in
      a splint for six weeks. The participants in the intervention group will use a soft splint for
      six weeks, but will be instructed to remove the splint daily to perform exercises for the
      thumb. A total of 70 patients will be included in the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) at 3, 6 and 12 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM-assessment starts with an interview, addressing patient specific Hand Osteoarthritis (HOA)-related activity limitations within the areas self-care, productivity and leisure. The patient will thereafter rate the five most important activities for performance and satisfaction with performance, on 1 to 10-point scales (higher scores reflect better performance or higher satisfaction). The Norwegian version of the COPM has been tested for validity, reliability and responsiveness and has demonstrated good ability to detect functional changes in HOA.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Patient satisfaction with the rehabilitation regimen at 3, 6 and 12 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient will be asked to complete a Numeric Rating Scale in order to give an opinion about their postoperative treatment regimen (splint-use, hand function, pain in the thumb, thumb movement and satisfaction with the operation).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure for activity performance (MAP-hand).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>MAP-hand is a questionnaire consisting of questions about 18 standardised activities. The patients will be instructed to score their ability to perform the activities on a scale from 1(No difficulty)to 4 (Not able to do). The Norwegian version of the MAP-hand has been tested for validity, reliability and responsiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip force and pinch grip</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The electronical instrument Grippit will be used to measure grip force and pinch grip. In Grippit, force recordings in Newtons (N) are displayed on the electronic unit every 0.5 seconds over a period of 10 seconds. The peak and average of the 20 registrations, as well as the final value (last recording) will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Joint mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The flexion deficit of fingers 2 - 5 will be assessed by measuring the distance between the distal nail and the proximal crease inside the hand in millimeters.
Range of motion in the thumbs metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints will be measured with a goniometer.
The palmar abduction of the CMC1 and of the entire thumb will be measured with the Pollexograph.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured on a numeric rating scale (NRS), (0-10, 0=no pain), by asking the patients to mark the level of pain experienced both while they are resting and during resisted motion when measuring grip force and pinch grip.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Training diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention group: 2-6 weeks and 3-4 months. Control group: 6-10 weeks and 3-4 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be asked to report which date they performed exercises, which exercises they performed and how much pain they experienced after performing the exercises. They will also be encouraged to write down their own comments /reflections regarding the training.</description>
