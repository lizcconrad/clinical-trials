      Genetic factors of an individual patient may have an impact on Ranibizumab (Lucentis)
      treatment outcome in patients with Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

    <textblock>
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a disease that affects central part of the retina,
      called macula, and is associated with progressive central vision loss. Moreover, AMD is known
      to be a leading cause of blindness in developed countries. In wet form of AMD, new abnormal
      blood vessels start to grow from the choroid towards the retina that leads to leakage from
      these vessels and, in turn, to impaired retinal structure and rapid vision loss.

      Genetic factors were found to be important in development of wet AMD. Our previous research
      showed the association between some genetic polymorphisms and the risk of wet AMD as well as
      with specific clinical features of the disease. At present, anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (anti-VEGF) therapy with intravitreous ranibizumab (Lucentis) is considered to be the
      most effective treatment for wet AMD. However, treatment outcomes may vary significantly from
      improved vision to no effect. The aim of this research is to study how ranibizumab treatment
      outcomes depend on genetic factors.
