  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being the craniostenoses sutural basically a disease, the fact that the brain being trapped
      in an enclosure that does not have complacency required to accompany their growth constitutes
      the challenge of treatment, which aims to restore the complacency of the suture and correct
      the stenotic compensatory cranial deformity.

      This paper proposes the combination of a helicoid osteotomy distraction osteogenesis provided
      by the use of springs distracting.

      As demonstrated by some authors, the curved shape of the helix fits perfectly the remodeling
      of a curved surface as well as the skullcap. If you do not receive fixation, however, trace
      the helicoid of the bone osteotomy can turn on a spring that can expand or contract depending
      on the direction of the force that is received. This form of osteotomy was therefore chosen
      by the authors to induce bone compliance areas of secondary defect that should expand or
      compress indirectly during the process of dynamic remodeling of primary defect with springs.

    <description>This study proposes to analyze the cranial remodeling achieved through the use of a dynamic craniotomy, without detachment of the dura mater in cranial deformities caused by craniosynostosis.</description>

    <description>Quantify the results of cranial remodeling by osteotomy helicoid-shaped Nautilus by clinical and CT in 6 months after the procedure, by 3 surgeons at different times - The skull shape, postoperatively, will be assessed independently by four surgeons, who will use the following scale results: insufficient when there was no attenuation of preoperative deformity, partial, when the correction happened, but was not able to capture all the characteristics of the deformity; appropriate, when there was complete remission of cranial deformity.</description>
