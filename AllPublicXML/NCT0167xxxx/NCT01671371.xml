      The purpose of this study is to determine whether point-of-care (bedside) ultrasound assists
      physicians in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syncope is one of the more common presentations to the Emergency Department, representing
      between 1.2-1.5% of all evaluated patients and up to 6% of admissions. Due to an often broad
      and overlapping differential diagnosis, syncope represents a disease entity that often
      requires extensive workup. This typically involves laboratory tests, EKGs, x-rays, computed
      tomography, or other studies that are costly, time-consuming, and, in the case of diagnostic
      imaging, frequently involves ionizing radiation. Yet, despite extensive testing, an exact
      diagnosis is not made in up to 50% of cases.

      Cardiac causes of syncope include myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, volume
      depletion, arrhythmia, among other entities, many of which are life threatening.
      Echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) has been used for inpatient syncope evaluations for
      several decades. In the Emergency Department, echocardiography is currently being used at the
      point-of-care (POC) in a limited and focused approach to a variety of conditions. However,
      POC ultrasound has never been systematically evaluated as a diagnostic or prognostic tool
      specifically for syncope in the Emergency Department. We aim to determine if an
      ultrasound-based protocol is effective as an adjunct in the evaluation of syncope. Our
      research study will examine the utility of POC ultrasound in the diagnosis, imaging and
      laboratory utilization, and prognosis of syncope in the Emergency Department.
