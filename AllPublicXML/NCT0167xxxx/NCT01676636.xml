  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SickKids-led research team is currently developing a prenatal micronutrient powder that
      will contain calcium, iron, and folic acid with different absorption characteristics. Once
      the powder is developed, it can be incorporated into various oral delivery vehicles. The
      overall effectiveness of a micronutrient program is highly dependent on the acceptance and
      regular consumption of supplements (i.e., adherence) by the targeted users. This is a study
      of the preference, acceptability, and palatability of 4 alternative delivery vehicles for the
      innovative prenatal multiple micronutrient supplement: traditional tablets, oral
      disintegrating tablets, unflavoured powder with a suspension agent, and flavoured powder with
      a suspension agent. This study will be conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study
      hypothesizes that that the formulation of the delivery vehicle will impact preference,
      acceptability, and palatability.

    <description>Consumption of the delivery vehicles will be measured during the once-weekly interactions with the research assistants in two ways: (1) by self-report from study participants; and (2) by counting the number of missing doses from those provided in the weekly supply.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Pregnant Women</arm_group_label>
    <description>Women who are 13 to 30 weeks pregnant. Each participant will take all 4 different calcium vehicles and decide which one they prefer.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Traditional Tablet</intervention_name>
    <description>The traditional tablets will be swallowed with liquid. Each tablet will contain 500 mg of calcium (as calcium carbonate), thus participants will be asked to take 3 per day.. Participants will be asked to take the tablets with a liquid of their choosing with a meal. Traditional tablets will function as a control in this study, as they represent what is widely available on the market in Bangladesh.</description>

    <intervention_name>Chewable tablets</intervention_name>
    <description>Chewable tablets are chewed in the absence of additional water. Each chewable tablet will contain 300 mg of calcium (as calcium carbonate), thus participants will be asked to take 5 per day. Participants will be asked to consume the chewable tablets with a meal.</description>

    <intervention_name>Unflavoured Powder</intervention_name>
    <description>The unflavoured powder with suspension agent will be tasteless and consumed by either adding it to a semi-solid food or drink of one's choosing. Appropriate foods for mixing with the powder will be at the discretion of the participants. This vehicle was selected on the basis that it would be easy to swallow, given the nausea associated with pregnancy. A similar product is Sprinkles, a multiple micronutrient powder developed at SickKids by Dr. Zlotkin.</description>

    <intervention_name>Flavoured Powder</intervention_name>
    <description>The flavoured powder with suspension agent will be consumed by adding it to clean water with a meal. This vehicle was also selected on the basis that it would be easy to swallow, given the nausea associated with pregnancy. Similar products include oral rehydration salts or artificial juice flavour crystals.</description>
