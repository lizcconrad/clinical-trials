      This protocol will investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of alcohol craving in
      recently detoxified alcoholic drinkers utilizing novel functional brain imaging. This
      clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study will investigate whether glutamate and
      other brain metabolites correlate to measures of alcohol craving severity

        Inclusion Criteria: (Minimal or No Alcohol Group)

          1. Male or female age 21-70

          2. Consume less alcohol then what is described in this protocol as a &quot;higher dose
             drinker&quot;, or consume no alcohol at all.

          3. Able to complete a 60 min. MRS brain scan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to speak English

          2. Inability or unwillingness to provide written informed consent

          3. Diagnosis of active substance dependence other than nicotine (e.g. alcohol, cannabis,
             caffeine, prescription use of barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, or stimulants)
             this will be determined using a PRISM (Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance
             and Mental Disorders) interview.

          4. Any unstable active medical or additional psychiatric condition as determined by the
             investigator

          5. Active suicidal ideation as determined by the PHQ-9 question 9 indicating response #2
             or higher (several days; more than half the days; or nearly every day).

          6. History of encephalopathy, hepatic failure, or HIV seropositivity

          7. History of claustrophobia

          8. History of major head trauma with loss of consciousness &gt;5 minutes or skull fracture

          9. History of previous neurological event (e.g. epilepsy, stroke, transient ischemic
             attack)

         10. Implanted metal objects (e.g. pacemakers; aneurysm clips; metal prostheses, joints,
             rods, or plates)

         11. Contraindication to MRI scanning

         12. Pregnancy or breast-feeding
