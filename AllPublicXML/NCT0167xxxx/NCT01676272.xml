      Despite the widespread use of advanced biologics for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers,
      data comparing one type of modality to another are scarce. This investigation is a
      prospective randomized study comparing a bioengineered skin substitute to a human skin
      allograft.

      The primary goal in treating a DFU is to obtain wound closure. Healing can be a lengthy and
      painful process for ulcers of diabetic etiology. Healing is often further complicated in
      subjects with diabetes by vascular compromise and peripheral ischemia, renal insufficiency
      and diminution of inflammatory responses

      The two products to be compared in this study are both commonly used for the treatment of
      diabetic foot ulcers. DermaGraft is considered a medical device by the FDA, and was cleared
      for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in 1997. It is a staple for the treatment of
      diabetic foot ulcers, and is widely used throughout the United States. It is composed of an
      absorbable substrate that has been seeded with living human fibroblasts. Once formed, the
      graft is cryopreserved until it reaches the clinic, where it is defrosted and applied to the
      wound surface.

      TheraSkin is composed of a split thickness skin graft harvested within 24 hours post-mortem,
      from an organ donor who has cleared the standard safety screenings. It is classified by the
      FDA as a donated tissue. Once harvested, the graft is sanitized according to FDA
      specifications, and cryopreserved, until it is delivered to the clinic for application to the
      foot ulcer. It is also a widely used treatment for diabetic foot ulcers.

             one of the following:

               1. Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) at least 0.65 (moderate arterial disease) and less

             healing (e.g., systemic steroids, immunosuppressive therapy, autoimmune disease
             therapy, cytostatic therapy within the 12 months prior to randomization, dialysis,
