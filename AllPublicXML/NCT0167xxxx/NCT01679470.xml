      This is an open-label, single-center, single-dose efficacy pilot study of AuroLase Therapy in
      the treatment of subjects with primary and/or metastatic tumors of the lung where there is
      airway obstruction. In this study patients will be given a systemic IV infusion of particles
      and a subsequent escalating dose of laser radiation delivered by optical fiber via
      bronchoscopy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have documented histological or cytological evidence of tumor(s) of the
             lung.

          -  Subjects must have one or more primary or metastatic tumors of the lung which have at
             least 10 mm in long axis as evaluated by spiral CT scan evaluation performed within
             last 30 days.

          -  Target lesions should be accessible to examination (examination by fiberoptic
             bronchoscopy is permitted) and to biopsy.

          -  Each index lesion should be large enough to provide at least 6 mg of tumor tissue by
             biopsy for assessment by neutron activation analysis.

          -  Tumors must be measurable according to RECIST criteria.

          -  Subjects must have ECOG Performance Score of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Subjects or their legal representative must be able to read, understand and sign an
             informed consent.

          -  Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL.

          -  Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by: Serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL; Alkaline
             phosphatase ≤ 2X the ULN for the reference lab; SGOT/SGPT ≤ 2X the ULN for the
             reference lab.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective form of contraception
             during the study and for 90 days following treatment (an effective form of
             contraception is an oral contraceptive or a double barrier method). Women who are NOT
             of childbearing potential are those who have undergone a bilateral oophorectomy or who
             have undergone menopause, defined as an absence of a menstrual cycle for 12
             consecutive months.

          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the PEGylated
             AuroShell suspension (polyethylene glycol, gold).

          -  Patients who are pregnant and/or lactating.

          -  Patients who have undergone splenectomy.

          -  Subjects who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy or who have received
             investigational therapy within the 30 days prior to AuroShell infusion
             (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no
             regulatory authority approved indication).

          -  Subjects with evidence of an active bacterial infection or with a fever ≥ 38.5 ºC
             (101.3 ºF) within 3 days of the first scheduled day of dosing.

          -  Subject who has had a course of radiotherapy in the treatment area within the 30 days
             prior to AuroShell infusion.

          -  Subject who has had a course of chemotherapy or other anti-neoplastic therapy in the
             30 days prior to AuroShell infusion.

          -  Life expectancy of less than 3 months.

          -  Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by
             the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a subject's ability to sign informed
             consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation
             of the results.
