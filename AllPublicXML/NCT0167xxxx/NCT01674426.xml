      This is a randomized pilot study of the use of cognitive behavior therapy versus observation
      to treat functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, often termed stress-induced anovulation.

    <time_frame>Change before and after 20 weeks of CBT or observation</time_frame>
    <description>The change in ovarian function was assessed by comparing ovarian function before and after 20 weeks of CBT or observation using menses and serial estradiol and progesterone level as indices of ovarian function</description>

    <measure>metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Change before and after 20 weeks of CBT or observation</time_frame>
    <description>The change in metabolism was assessed by measuring levels of cortisol, TSH, T4, free T4, T3, free T3, leptin in blood and by measuring weight before and after 20 weeks of CBT or observation</description>
