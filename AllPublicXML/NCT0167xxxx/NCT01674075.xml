    <textblock>
      The J-Tip device (National Medical Products, Irvine, CA, USA) is a single-use, needle-free
      anesthesia delivery system, approximately 10cm long and weighing 9g that allow for the rapid
      delivery of lidocaine hydrochloride prior to peripheral venous access procedures. First
      introduced in 2001, it uses compressed carbon dioxide for drug delivery into the subcutaneous
      space. J-Tip is now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both children
      and adults.

      Designed for patients with needle anxiety and phobia, several clinical trials (Hollingsworth
      et al, 2000; Cooper JA et al, 2000) have shown the device to be effective with no significant
      untoward effects, including in children as young as 3 years old (Zempsky et al, 2008).
      However, two recent cases of toxic serum lidocaine levels in pediatric patients at
      Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) following the use of the J-Tip device is concerning.
      Both patients were administered local anesthetic using the J-Tip device prior to needle-stick
      and toxicity screens returned with high levels of lidocaine (&gt;6000 mcg/L).

      Currently, there is a limited amount of literature available on the safety profile of the
      J-Tip Delivery System and no study to date has evaluated serum lidocaine levels following its
      use, likely on the assumption that systemic absorption from the small amount of lidocaine
      within the device should be negligible. The two pediatric cases highlighted above, seem to
      suggest otherwise. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the safety of the J-Tip
      device on a small population of healthy adults and to determine if elevated lidocaine levels
      are present systemically or locally. The primary outcome will be lidocaine serum levels
      following the administration of the J-Tip device measured at the local site and two distal
      sites to establish lidocaine serum levels following J-Tip administration. We expect lidocaine
      levels to be undetectable.
