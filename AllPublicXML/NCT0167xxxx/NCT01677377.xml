      This will be an open-label, Phase 2A, multiple ascending dose study in 1 to 3 sites, designed
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of multiple subcutaneous injections of
      60mg, 90mg, and 120mg doses of risperidone in the RBP-7000 formulation, in subjects with
      clinically-stable schizophrenia who are on a once daily stable dose of 2mg, 3mg, or 4mg of
      oral risperidone
