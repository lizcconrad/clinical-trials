  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cortisol is a stress hormone that can be measured in saliva. This has provided a convenient
      way to evaluate the biological impact of day-to-day stressors that people encounter as they
      go about their lives, since saliva is so easy to collect. However, the biological meaning of
      saliva cortisol measures has never been carefully examined. The goal of this study is to
      collect saliva from a large group of people as they go about their every-day lives, to
      measure their cortisol levels, and then study them in the laboratory where Investigators can
      learn more about how their stress response system (which produces cortisol) is really
      functioning. Investigators can then determine much more precisely what saliva cortisol levels
      really mean in terms of stress system biology. This will allow investigators to obtain much
      more useful information from the next decade of research on naturalistic stress and its
      biological impact using saliva cortisol measures, helping investigators to understand how
      stress undermines health and how to combat this effect.
