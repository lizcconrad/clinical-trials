  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study to determine the ability of the Clear device to treat mild
      to moderate inflammatory acne, and to determine if the average person is able to use the
      device properly according to the labeling as describe in the operator manual.

      The study involve treatments twice a week over 4 weeks total of 8 treatment sessions, in
      which the subjects will be treating themselves with the Clear device, and 2 follow-up visits
      to evaluate the results. The clinical result will be assessed by the investigator for
      improvement in the acne condition. Treatment will be performed on the face of subjects
      enrolled and who meet the inclusion criteria.

      The subjects will be recruited if they are eligible to participate in the study according
      with the device labeling presented at the doctor's office by printed ads. Subjects will be
      given information about the Clear device according to its labeling. After reading the
      information and labeling, it will be the subjects' decision if they understand the device
      label information and if they want to participate in the study. The investigator will review
      the inclusion / exclusion criteria with the subjects to ensure eligibility.

    <description>A total of 50 subjects were included.
The majority are female (62 %)
At baseline the average number of lesions was 20.5±7.1, ranging from 6 to 36 lesions.
All subjects demonstrated a reduction in lesion count.
The average improvement after one month was 56.7%±8.9%, and remained similar also after 3 months 57.7%±9.4%.
The percent of responders (with at least 40% of reduction) was 94% after 1 month and 96% after 3 months
The Percent of responders is similar for males &amp; females and similar for cheeks &amp; front.</description>
