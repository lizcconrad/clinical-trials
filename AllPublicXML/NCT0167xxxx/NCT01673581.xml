  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the usefulness of an informational website designed to educate
      patients with prostate cancer about their options for treatment. The investigators hope that
      this website will assist patients with making informed decisions about their care and
      improving their satisfaction with the treatments they choose.

      Investigators will first ask patients to answer a series of questions to assess their wishes
      regarding treatment, knowledge about their disease and discussion with the physicians at
      initial patient visit. This initial survey should take approximately 20 minutes. Once
      patients have selected a treatment path investigators will contact them again and ask them to
      fill out a short 10-minute survey online or by mail. Investigators will contact patients by
      phone 2 weeks after their initial visit to see if they have made a decision. If not,
      investigators will contact patients by phone every 2 weeks or at an interval that works for
      the patient's schedule. Finally, 3 months after the initial visit today investigators will
      contact patients for the last time and again ask you to fill out a short 10-minute survey
      online or by mail.

      Once patients have completed the final survey there are no future surveys planned.
      Investigators may contact patients by phone in the future to ask them to participate in
      another study.
