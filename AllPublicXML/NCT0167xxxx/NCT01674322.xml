  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the absorption, the metabolic pathways and the
      excretion of ibrutinib in healthy male adult participants after administration of a single
      oral dose of 50 mg to 140 mg (5 mg/mL solution) of unlabeled ibrutinib admixed with 14C
      ibrutinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      single-dose study in healthy male participants. Six men will be enrolled to allow a minimum
      of 4 participants to complete the study. All participants will receive a single oral solution
      dose of 50 to 140 mg ibrutinib containing 1480 kBq (40 µCi) of 14C labeled ibrutinib,
      constituting a total radiation burden of approximately 0.916 mSv (ICRP risk category IIa).
      The duration of the study is approximately 73 days including screening period of 28 days,
      treatment period of 15 days, and follow-up period of 30 days. Safety will include adverse
      events, laboratory safety, 12 lead electrocardiogram, physical examination, and vital signs.
