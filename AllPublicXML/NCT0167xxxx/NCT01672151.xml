  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of rapamycin with Refractory Immune
      Thrombocytopenic Purpura (RITP) and explore the further mechanism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapamycin, an immunosuppressive drug, is widely used to prevent allograft rejection and
      autoimmune diseases. Many studies have shown that the drug contributes to the expansion of
      regulatory T cells and preserves the highly suppressive function of autoreactive T cells.
      Patients with RITP often display a decreased proportion of regulatory T cells by flow
      cytometer, therefore, the investigators will examine the efficacy of rapamycin in RITP
      patients.
