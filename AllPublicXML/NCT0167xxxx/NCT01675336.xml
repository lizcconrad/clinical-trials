        All study subjects will be selected from a pre-existing patient database in Taiwan. All
        chronic periodontitis cases and controls will be subjects who were at least 35 years old at
        time of enrollment.

        Classification of chronic periodontitis will be based on the extent of periodontal tissue
        destruction with consideration of tooth loss.
