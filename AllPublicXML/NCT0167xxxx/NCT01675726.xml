      AIMS The aims were 1) to describe the quality of life (QoL) of a cohort of children born very
      preterm (&lt;28 weeks of gestation) aged 7 to 9 years; 2) to compare children's QoL to the QoL
      reported by a French general population of reference. 3) to determine whether
      socio-demographic factors, neonatal features and neurocognitive status were impacting their
      QoL.

      METHODS:

        -  Multi-centre study: 6 French level three perinatal care units (Marseille, Montpellier,
           Nantes, NÃ®mes, Nice and Rouen).

        -  Inclusion criteria: all infants born before 28 weeks of gestation between January 2005
           and December 2007, from 7 to 9 years old of age at the time of evaluation.

        -  Written agreement to participate: collected from parents.

        -  Data collection: reports of children's QoL by children and their parents (using
           standardized validated questionnaires); clinical information about the children,
           obtained through a medical examination; children neurocognitive profile.

        -  Duration of inclusion: over 24 months.

        -  Population: of the six structures, approximately 300 children will be evaluated
           consistent with the active files of the participating centres and an attrition rate of
           30%.

      PERSPECTIVES This is one of the first studies to collect self-reported data on quality of
      life of school-age children (7-9 years) born before 28 weeks of gestation. A better
      understanding of demographic and clinical determinants of QOL of school-age very preterm
      children may help clinicians involved in the care of these children in their ethical and
      medical considerations.
