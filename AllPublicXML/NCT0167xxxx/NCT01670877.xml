          -  To be eligible for the Part II fulvestrant-naïve ER+ cohort, prior treatment with
             fulvestrant is not allowed. In addition, ER and/or PR positivity by institutional
             standard is required on pathology from the most recent tumor specimen if biopsy was
             done unless the tissue source (for example, pleural effusion or ascites or bone
             biopsy) may yield false negative ER and/or PR result, in which case the pathology from
             an earlier time point could be used and a discussion with the study chair is required.

             the exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver
