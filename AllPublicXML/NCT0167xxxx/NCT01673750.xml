    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that seeks to gather information about perceptions of body
      image through the use of a one-time questionnaire completed by participants at the time of
      study enrollment.

      Effective management of Human Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by the Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has become possible through the use of Highly Active
      Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART). As a result of more successful treatment options, HIV/AIDS
      has transitioned from a terminal illness to one which is treated as a chronic condition. One
      particular group that has been impacted tremendously by HIV in the United States is the
      adolescent population. As youth are living longer with HIV/AIDS, clinicians and researchers
      are beginning to examine ways in which the disease can affect one's physical health, mental
      health, and other psychosocial factors. Research emerging involving adults with HIV/AIDS has
      suggested that increased attention to and negative views of one's body image may be found at
      a higher rate in this group. To our knowledge, very few studies have examined this
      relationship in adolescents with HIV.

      The purpose of this exploratory study is to characterize body image perceptions among youth
      with perinatally and behaviorally acquired HIV. In a cross-sectional design, adolescents will
      be asked to complete an ACASI questionnaire that will assess body image, medication
      adherence, depressive symptoms, medical, and other sociodemographic variables which may
      relate to adolescents with HIV. Information regarding the adolescents' medical history,
      medications, and physical functioning also will be abstracted from his or her medical record.
      Guided by the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach, findings from this study will inform future
      intervention studies designed to enhance HIV disease management among adolescents.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To characterize body image perceptions among youth with HIV.

    <description>The MBSRQ-AS is a well-validated self-report inventory for the assessment of body image (BI). It has five subscales: Appearance Evaluation, Appearance Orientation, Overweight Preoccupation, Self-Classified Weight, Body Areas Satisfaction Scale. Descriptive analyses (means and standard deviations of overall scores and means for each subscale) will be reported.
The Figure Rating Scale is a culturally relevant measure modeled after Stunkard's widely used nine-figure scale of schematic figures of varying size. Participants will be asked to identify which BI they find most similar to their current body type and which BI would be ideal or preferred. A BI discrepancy (BID) score will be calculated for each subject based on their responses on the Figure Rating Scale: negative BID score indicates the subject's ideal BI is larger than perceived; positive BID score indicates the subject wants to be smaller/thinner than perceived; score of zero indicates the subject prefers his/her perceived BI.</description>
