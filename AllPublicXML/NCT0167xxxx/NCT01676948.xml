  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-part open-label, multi-arm, non-comparative study will collect long-term safety,
      efficacy and tolerability data from patients who were responsive to canakinumab from study
      CACZ885G2301E1 (Cohort 1), and from patients who are treatment naïve to canakinumab (Cohort
      2). In addition, the effect of inactivated vaccines in an SJIA patient population will be
      assessed for the development of adequate (protective) antibody levels following immunization
      according to respective local vaccination guidelines.

      Study Part I:

      All patients will be treated with canakinumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks (or 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks
      for Cohort 1 patients who are receiving that dose in CACZ885G2301E1) until study end unless
      discontinuation occurs, or until they qualify for Part II of the study.

      Study Part II:

      Patients who are eligible will be randomized to receive canakinumab at a reduced dose or
      prolonged dose interval (see requirements for dose reduction/dose interval prolongation
      below).

      Patients in Cohort 1 receiving 2 mg/kg q4wk in CACZ885G2301E1 will not be randomized but will
      be part of the treatment arm canakinumab dose reduction if they are eligible.

In the canakinumab dose interval arm, patients will be classified into the following 3 categories: Number of patients who are able to reach 4mg/kg q12wk at the end of Part II, canakinumab-free regimen by the end of Part II and those who come back to 4mg/kg q8wk at the end of Part II.</description>

    <measure>The time to treatment failure in Part II</measure>
    <time_frame>from start of Part II to Day 533</time_frame>
    <description>Time to treatment failure (TTF) is defined as time from randomization to the date when the patient's worsened SJIA disease activity requires increasing the doze or shortening the treatment interval of canakinumab or the date the patient is withdrawn from the study due to a safety concern.</description>
