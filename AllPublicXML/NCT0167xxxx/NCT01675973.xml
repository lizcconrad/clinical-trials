  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of severe renal impairment on the
      steady-state PK, as well as safety and tolerability, of ranolazine, compared to subjects with
      normal renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of severe renal impairment (RI)
      on the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of ranolazine and key metabolites. The secondary
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of
      ranolazine in subjects with severe RI.
