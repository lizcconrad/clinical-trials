    <textblock>
      Open-label, 6 month-treatment with the IP in all subjects. - Sample size: A total of 90
      subjects will be enrolled so that among them at least 57 will complete the 6-month treatment
      period and evaluable for analysis.

      -Primary objective: To assess the safety of 0.5 mg dutasteride/0.4 mg tamsulosin combination
      therapy for six month in BPH patients by monitoring category, frequency and severity of
      adverse events encountered during the treatment period.

      -Secondary objective: To assess the efficacy of 0.5 mg dutasteride/0.4 mg tamsulosin
      combination therapy with regard to symptom improvement in BPH patients by monitoring and
      analyzing of changes in IPSS and Qmax after 6 months of treatment.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product at any dose, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event that jeopardizes the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, and is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The IPSS is a screening tool used to assess the symptoms of prostate related disease. The IPSS questionnaire consists of seven symptoms questions including feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining and nocturia, each referring to during the last month, and each involving assignment of a score from 0 to 5 (no symptoms to almost always symptoms) for a total of maximum 35 points. IPSS total is the sum of the scores of seven questions; therefore, the possible total score ranges from 0 to 35 (0-7: Mildly symptomatic; 8-19: Moderately symptomatic; 20-35: Severely symptomatic). IPSS was assessed at Baseline and Month 6. Change from Baseline was calculated as Month 6 IPSS score- minus Baseline IPSS score.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any On-treatment Adverse Events (AEs) or Any Serious Adverse Event (SAEs) and Treatment-related AEs</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product at any dose, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event that jeopardizes the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, and is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening, Month 3 (Visit 3) and Month 6 (Visit 5) for hematology laboratory assessments. Hematology parameters included basophils, leukocytes, hemoglobin (HGB), eosinophils, erythrocytes (ery), ery mean Corpuscular HGB concentration, ery mean corpuscular HGB, ery distribution width, lymphocytes, hematocrit, monocytes, neutrophils and platelets. The number of participants with a shift from normal at Baseline to abnormal at any time post-Baseline for hematology parameters are summarized.</description>

        <description>Serum sample was collected at Screening (Baseline for participants with Free to Total PSA ratio at Month 6), and Month 6 for assessment of free to total PSA ratio. PSA is a substance produced by prostate gland, and the elevated level of PSA indicates prostate cancer or any other non-cancerous condition related to prostate. Free to total PSA ratio at Baseline for participants with free to total PSA Ratio at Month 6 and free to total PSA ratio at month 6 are presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Month 6</title>
        <description>The IPSS is a screening tool used to assess the symptoms of prostate related disease. The IPSS questionnaire consists of seven symptoms questions including feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining and nocturia, each referring to during the last month, and each involving assignment of a score from 0 to 5 (no symptoms to almost always symptoms) for a total of maximum 35 points. IPSS total is the sum of the scores of seven questions; therefore, the possible total score ranges from 0 to 35 (0-7: Mildly symptomatic; 8-19: Moderately symptomatic; 20-35: Severely symptomatic). IPSS was assessed at Baseline and Month 6. Change from Baseline was calculated as Month 6 IPSS score- minus Baseline IPSS score.</description>
