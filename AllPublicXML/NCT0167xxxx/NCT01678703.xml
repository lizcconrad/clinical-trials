  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effectiveness of cervical preparation before second trimester
      abortion using laminaria versus vaginal Misoprostol.

      The investigators hypothesize that medical preparation of the cervix with vaginal Misoprostol
      is superior to mechanical preparation using laminaria.

      The investigators believe that medical preparation makes the procedure easier to perform,
      equally safe, without addition of pain or discomfort.

      This is a prospective randomized study.

      The aim of the study is to compare preparation of the cervix before surgical abortion with
      laminaria and misoprostol.

      Primary outcome measures will include:

      Initial cervical opening and the need for further dilatation at the procedure Procedure
      duration

      Difficulty score performing the abortion

      Complications during and after the procedure

      Assessment of pain, using VAS scale, and the need for analgesia before and after the
      procedure

Pain score will be recorded again right before performing the abortion and will address the 8-12 hours elapsed from the insertion.
Another assessment of pain will be recorded immediately after the abortion following recovery from general anesthesia</description>
