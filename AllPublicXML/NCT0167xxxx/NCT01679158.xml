  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of minor variations in Incisionless
      Operating Platform (IOP)procedural techniques on gastric emptying, hormone levels, satiety,
      and weight loss in the treatment of primary obesity. It will confirm, in an open prospective
      study, the action mechanisms for the &quot;POSE&quot; endoscopic treatment technique for obesity, and
      it will help determine if they are maintained at least 6 months following the procedure.
      Durability of weight loss will be tracked through post-POSE visits up to 18 months following
      the procedure.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting/Post-prandial Peptides</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-procedure &amp; 8 weeks post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Samples to be collected when fasting and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after a standard meal (a meal consisting of 400 calories), The meal must be consumed within 10 minutes.. Serum collection tubes will be centrifuged immediately at 4°C for 10 minutes at 3600rpm and stored at -20°C
Samples to be collected by ELISA are: C-peptide, serum insulin, glucose, PYY, GLP-1 (active), leptin, and GIP. Total ghrelin level to be analyzed by RIA.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric Emptying</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-procedure &amp; 2 &amp; 6 months post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of determining the duration of a radioactive marker in a stomach, which is non-absorbable, and free of any food components.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satiety Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-procedure &amp; 2 &amp; 6 months post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects ingest a nutritional drink (Ensure) at a constant rate of 30 mL per minute, constantly filling the glass with a perfusion pump (Gemini PC-2, IMED, San Diego, CA). (The subjects are not conscious of the volume being ingested.) The subjects are instructed to maintain consumption at the fill rate. Participants take note of their sensation of satiety with a graphical classification scale, which combines verbal descriptors on a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = no symptoms, 1 = first sensation of fullness [threshold]; 2 = light, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, and 5 = maximum fullness or unbearable). The participants are told to stop taking the food product when a score of 5 is obtained. The maximum consumption of volume of the nutritional drink is recorded.</description>
