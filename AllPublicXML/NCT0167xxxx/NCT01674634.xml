      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of two concurrent injections of
      AA4500 into the same hand in subjects with multiple Dupuytren's contractures with palpable
      cords followed 24 to 72 hours later by a finger extension procedure and compare the rate of
      occurrence of targeted serious adverse events (tendon rupture/ligament injury and
      anaphylaxis) to historical rates of the same in clinical studies and post-marketing
      commercial use.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of two concurrent injections of AA4500.

      Methodology/Study Design: After all pre-injection procedures are completed on Day 1, eligible
      men and women will receive two concurrent injections AA4500 (AA4500/AA4500) into cord(s)
      affecting MP and/or PIP joints on the same or different fingers in the selected hand. A
      finger extension procedure to facilitate cord disruption will be performed (after
      administration of local anesthesia, if needed) 24 to 72 hours after injection in those
      subjects who do not have spontaneous disruption of their cord(s).

      Follow up visits for the evaluation of safety and efficacy will be required for all subjects
      24 to 72 hours after injection, and on Days 15, 31, and 61.

      Upon completion of the day 61 follow-up visit (end of study visit), subjects who require
      additional treatment in the treated hand may receive up to three additional injections of
      AA4500 according to the XIAFLEX package insert. Subjects may receive up to a total of five
      injections and individual cords may receive up to a total of three injections. Subjects who
      require additional treatment will be followed for safety.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Fixed Flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 31</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from baseline in total fixed flexion = 100 * (baseline total FFC - day 31 total FFC)/baseline total FFC, where total fixed flexion is defined as the sum of the fixed flexion contracture (FCC) of the 2 joints receiving treatment. Positive percent change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 31</time_frame>
    <description>The total range of motion (ROM) is the sum of the range of motion measurements of the 2 treated joints. ROM is defined as difference between full flexion angle and full extension expressed in degrees. A positive change from baseline indicates increased (improved) ROM.</description>

    <description>The Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scale is a patient-reported functional 9-item scale (total score 0-45) developed and validated to assess functional outcome of patients suffering from Dupuytren's disease with higher scores indicating greater difficulty using the hand.The estimated clinically important change of the URAM scale is 2.9 points. A decrease in total URAM score indicates improvement in hand function.</description>
