  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test different methods of measuring energy balance,
      including food intake and energy expenditure. Another primary purpose of this study is to see
      if energy expenditure predicts weight and change after a weight loss diet. A secondary aim
      will be to test the reliability and validity of the Actical accelerometer, SenseWear
      Armbands, and the Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Activity (IDEAA) monitors at
      measuring activity energy expenditure (AEE) and total daily energy expenditure (TEE) against
      the gold standard, doubly-labeled water (DLW). Similarly, we will test whether the estimated
      energy expenditure or posture allocation from the 3 devices is associated with weight change
      during and following a low calorie diet (LCD).

      The study will take place over a period of one year. Participants will spend 3 weeks
      completing Phase I, and eight weeks completing Phase II (the weight loss phase of the study).
      Then, participants will return to the center at months 6 and 12 for a follow-up visit. During
      these visits, body weight, blood pressure, and pulse will be recorded, and questionnaires
      about eating attitudes and habits will be collected and assessed.

    <time_frame>~6 days</time_frame>
    <description>A new method of digital photography of foods to measure the energy intake (EI) and macronutrient intake of free-living humans was tested. Digital photography (RFPM) EI was tested against measured food provisions during an in-feeding period and against EI measured with doubly labeled water (DLW) during free-living conditions for 1 week. EI measured by directly weighing food provisions in the clinic over two days and measuring food intake during free-living conditions over one week with the DLW.</description>

    <description>The secondary aim was to test if posture allocation (the amount of time spent engaging in certain behaviors e.g., sitting, walking, running, changing positions and the energy burned during these activities) predicts weight change over one year following a period of weight loss.</description>

    <description>Bland-Altman analyses compared the TDEE and AEE from the SensewearÂ® and IDEEA and Actical monitors to the DLW data from the week participants wore the monitors. Only the week of DLW data that corresponded with the wearing of the monitors was used for this analysis.</description>

    <measure>Device Predictions of % Weight Change During and After an 8-week LCD</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary aim of the study was evaluated with linear regression analysis to determine if TEE, AEE, or measures of posture allocation predicted weight loss during the 8-week LCD. Percent weight change from diet initiation to termination was the dependent variable for the weight loss regressions. Of the 87 participants considered for these secondary analyses, five were excluded because they did not finish baseline accelerometry assessment, and an additional five were excluded because they did not enter the LCD phase due to BMI's &lt; 25. Finally, seven more participants from this original sample were excluded because they did not successfully complete all aspects of the DLW dosing period. Finally, an additional 4 subjects were lost to follow up during the 8-week LCD period. Thus, 66 participants were included in the analysis</description>

    <description>During one week of the doubly labeled water (DLW), participants will use digital photography of foods. During the other week of the DLW phase, participants will wear the Intelligent Device for Energy Expenditure and Activity (IDEEA) monitor and Actical monitor. Whether the participants wear the monitors first or complete digital photography first will be randomozed. Participants who complete the first two weeks and have a BMI over 25kg/m2 will receive a partial supplement low-calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks. This diet plan is a 1000-1150 kcal/day diet that participants will complete in a free-living environment. All participants will return to follow-up at six and twelve months after they completed the LCD. Anthropometric and questionnaire data will be collected.</description>

    <description>The digital photography of foods method was developed to unobtrusively measure energy intake in naturalistic settings (e.g., cafeterias). Participants will be provided with cell-phones with digital cameras and cellular network capability. Participants were trained to take pictures of their food selection and plate waste and to send these pictures to the researchers over the cellular network. The participant will collect data in free-living conditions and these data will be collected in near real time.</description>

        <description>A new method of digital photography of foods to measure the energy intake (EI) and macronutrient intake of free-living humans was tested. Digital photography (RFPM) EI was tested against measured food provisions during an in-feeding period and against EI measured with doubly labeled water (DLW) during free-living conditions for 1 week. EI measured by directly weighing food provisions in the clinic over two days and measuring food intake during free-living conditions over one week with the DLW.</description>

        <description>This secondary aim of the study was evaluated with linear regression analysis to determine if TEE, AEE, or measures of posture allocation predicted weight loss during the 8-week LCD. Percent weight change from diet initiation to termination was the dependent variable for the weight loss regressions. Of the 87 participants considered for these secondary analyses, five were excluded because they did not finish baseline accelerometry assessment, and an additional five were excluded because they did not enter the LCD phase due to BMIâs &lt; 25. Finally, seven more participants from this original sample were excluded because they did not successfully complete all aspects of the DLW dosing period. Finally, an additional 4 subjects were lost to follow up during the 8-week LCD period. Thus, 66 participants were included in the analysis</description>

          <description>Participants completed 2 phases of the study. Phase I included a 2-week doubly labeled water period where they also wore activity trackers for one week, and used a food photography method for the other week. Phase II was an 8-week partial supplement low-calorie diet (LCD). This diet plan was a 1000-1150 kcal/day diet composed of HealthOne shakes and prepackaged portion controlled foods or home-cooked meals that participants completed in a free-living environment. Participants returned to follow-up at six and twelve months after they completed the LCD. During these assessments, anthropometric and questionnaire data were collected.</description>
