        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous enrollment in the study evaluating 2.0mg ranibizumab (NCT 01189019) without
             early study discontinuation. The last treatment* in the study eye should have been
             received at least 30 days before enrollment in this study.

             **last study treatment of either 1.0mg or 2.0mg ranibizumab

          -  Presence of persistent fibrovascular pigment epithelial detachment Willing and able to
             comply iwth clinic visits and study related procedures Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with verteporfin, or external beam radiation therapy, or
             transpupillary thermotherapy in the study eye.

        Previous subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation involving the foveal center in the study
        eye.

          -  History of vitrectomy, submacular surgery, or other surgical intervention for AMD in
             the study eye.

          -  Concurrent eye disease in the study eye that could compromise visual acuity (e.g.
             diabetic retinopathy, advanced glaucoma).

          -  Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g. diabetic retinopathy or
             glaucoma) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either require medical or
             surgical intervention during the 12 month study period to prevent or treat visual loss
             that might result from that condition, or if allowed to progress untreated, could
             likely contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of best corrected
             visual acuity over the 12 month study period.

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye, or history of
             idiopathic or auto-immune associated uveitis in either eye.

          -  Current vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye.

          -  History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (stage 3 or 4) in the
             study eye.

          -  Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either
             eye.

          -  Aphakia, anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL) or unstable posterior chamber
             intraocular lens (PCIOL).

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure equal to or
             greater than 30 despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication).

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Sexually active men* or women of childbearing potential** who are unwilling to
             practice adequate contraception during the study (adequate contraception measures
             include stable use of oral contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical
             contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device
             (IUD); bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or
             jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam or jelly).

               -  Contraception is not required for men with documented vasectomy. **Postmenopausal
                  women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to be considered of
                  child bearing potential. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for
                  women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation.
