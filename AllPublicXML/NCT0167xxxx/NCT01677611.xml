  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal studies indicate that resveratrol, a phytoalexin enriched in the skin of red grapes
      and a constituent of red wine, is associated with longevity likely through the increased
      production of a protein, SIRT1.

      The trial is a proof-of-concept study primarily designed to examine for the first time in
      humans, the effect of 12 weeks of oral resveratrol on skeletal muscle SIRT1 expression in 10
      patients with T2DM in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. Secondary
      outcomes include measures of AMPK, p-AMPK and GLUT4 expression levels, energy expenditure,
      physical activity levels, distribution of abdominal adipose tissue and skeletal muscle fiber
      type composition, body weight, HbA1c, plasma lipid subfraction, adiponectin levels and
      insulin sensitivity.

      Eligible criteria include Chinese males, aged between 40 and 69 years old, with T2DM with a
      HbA1c of 7.1 to 12% and who have been on a stable oral hypoglycemic regimen for the past 3
      months. Subjects who were insulin-dependent, with renal or liver impairment or who were
      terminally ill were excluded.

    <description>Trans-resveratrol extract from Polygonum Cuspidatum (Mega Resveratrol, Danbury, USA) was used in the trial.Following the run-in period, subjects who were tolerant of the placebo would proceed to the treatment period. Subjects were given a starting dose of 500 mg daily of either resveratrol.The dose was increased by 500 mg per day every 3 days to a maximum dose of 3 g per day in three divided doses if there was no hypoglycemia. Subjects were instructed to abstain from foods with high resveratrol content during the entire duration of the trial.</description>

    <description>All subjects underwent a 2-week run-in period during which placebo was administered. The placebo was manufactured so that it was not distinguishable by color, form, or taste from the active drug. Following the run-in period, subjects who were tolerant of the placebo would proceed to the treatment period. Subjects were given a starting dose of 500 mg daily of matching placebo and instructed to abstain from foods with high resveratrol content during the entire duration of the trial. The dose was increased by 500 mg per day every 3 days to a maximum dose of 3 g per day in three divided doses if there was no hypoglycemia.</description>
