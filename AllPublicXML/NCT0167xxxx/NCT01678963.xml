      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical ophthalmic
      squalamine lactate eye drops in treating patients with neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration (wet AMD), a degenerative retinal eye disease that causes a progressive,
      irreversible, severe loss of central vision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative retinal eye disease that causes a
      progressive loss of central vision. AMD is the leading cause of legal blindness among adults
      age 50 or older in the Western world and affects 25-30 million people globally. This number
      is expected to triple over the next 25 years. Central vision loss from AMD is caused by the
      degeneration of light-sensing cells in the macula called photoreceptors. The macula, the
      central portion of the retina, is responsible for perceiving fine visual detail. As
      photoreceptors begin to degenerate, so does the individual's central vision. The extent of
      vision loss varies widely and is related to the type of AMD, its severity and other
      individual characteristics.

      AMD presents itself in two different forms — a &quot;dry&quot; form and the more severe &quot;wet&quot; form. Dry
      AMD, the more common and milder form of AMD, accounts for 85% to 90% of all cases. It results
      in varying forms of sight loss and may or may not eventually develop into the wet form.
      Although the wet form of AMD accounts for only 10% to 15% of all AMD, the chance for severe
      sight loss is much greater. Wet AMD is responsible for 90% of severe vision loss associated
      with AMD. Approximately 500,000 new cases of wet AMD are diagnosed annually worldwide. In
      North America alone, approximately 200,000 new cases of wet AMD are diagnosed each year.

      Squalamine lactate has been found to be an inhibitor of new blood vessel formation
      (angiogenesis) induced by VEGF, PDGF or bFGF. Since angiogenesis is implicated in the growth
      and maintenance of choroidal neovascularization, squalamine lactate is potentially an
      attractive development candidate in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD),
      in which blood vessel proliferation has a role.

          -  Have the following criteria in the study eye:

               -  A diagnosis of choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD with total lesion
                  area ≤ 12 disc areas with CNV affecting at least 50% of the total lesion area, in
                  at least one eye confirmed by fluorescein angiography (via the reading center)
