  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of the combination of three drugs: sirolimus, cyclophosphamide, and
      topotecan. This is the first study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the
      combination of oral sirolimus, oral cyclophosphamide and oral topotecan in pediatric and
      young adult patients with relapsed and refractory solid tumors.

      In this phase I study, the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus will be administered in combination with
      oral cyclophosphamide and oral topotecan to children with relapsed or refractory solid
      tumors. The primary aim of this study is to recommend a phase II dose schedule and describe
      the toxicity of this combination. Myelosuppression will be a targeted toxicity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of cyclophosphamide and topotecan is well-tolerated and provides an oral
      therapy option for heavily pre-treated patients. The toxicity profile and activity level
      suggest that this combination will provide a useful platform onto which novel compounds may
      be added. Sirolimus has been shown to demonstrate single-agent activity in preclinical models
      of rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and
      osteosarcoma. Sirolimus has also been shown to have additive effects in pre-clinical models
      of solid tumors when combined with cyclophosphamide. This trial therefore will evaluate the
      combination of sirolimus with cyclophosphamide and topotecan. Pharmacokinetic studies of
      sirolimus as well as pharmacodynamic studies to assess antiangiogensis and inhibition of the
      mTOR pathway will be done.

      Patients will be accrued to dose levels in cohorts of 3 using a 3 + 3 design. Patients will
      initially be enrolled on dose level 1. Patients will receive daily oral sirolimus and
      cyclophosphamide on days 1 - 21 in a 28 day cycle. This will be combined with oral topotecan
      given on days 1 - 14. Sirolimus will be dosed based on steady-state plasma trough
      concentrations with a goal level in dose level 1 of 3-7.9 ng/ML and goal levels in subsequent
      dose levels of 8-12.0 ng/ML. Dosing of cyclophosphamide and topotecan will be 25 mg/m2/dose
      and 0.8 mg/ m2 /dose respectively for dose levels 1 and 2. Level 3 dosing will escalate
      cyclophosphamide to 50 mg/ m2/dose. If level 1 dosing is not tolerated, patients will then be
      enrolled in a level -1 cohort with cyclophosphamide and sirolimus administered only on days 1
      - 14. If level -1 is not tolerated, patients will be enrolled in level -2 with topotecan
      administration limited to days 1 - 7.

    <description>Define the dose limiting toxicities to recommend a Phase 2 trough concentration of sirolimus when administered on a protracted schedule in combination with oral topotecan and oral cyclophosphamide.
Evaluations done during first Cycle to assess/define DLT:
Physical exams, vitals, blood tests: CBC, CMB, coagulation-PT, LDH, D-dimer, peripheral smear, urine glucose, performance evaluations.
All toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination), severity (by NCI CTCAE v 4.0), and attribution. The MTD is the highest dose level tested at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug(s) with at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients encountering DLT at the next higher dose. If 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT at the highest dose level (dose level 3), then that dose level will be called the MTD.</description>
