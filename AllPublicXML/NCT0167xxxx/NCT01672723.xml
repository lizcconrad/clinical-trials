  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From birth we rely on others for comfort and care and derive pleasure from being together.
      Research from the fields of health psychology, social psychology, and public health converge
      to highlight the importance of having and maintaining good relationships for overall health.
      Indeed, having close friends and family and feeling connected to them has been called a basic
      need, similar to our need for food and water. It may not be a coincidence then that feelings
      of connection rely on similar systems in the body as other needs that are both basic and
      highly pleasing and rewarding. For instance, its possible that opioids, a substance in the
      body associated with pleasant, euphoric feelings, may also be important for connecting with
      others. This study will examine the role of opioids in feeling connected to others by
      administering a drug called naltrexone, that effects opioid processing in the body, on
      perceptions and feelings toward a number of tasks in the lab. Additionally, to assess the
      effects of naltrexone outside of the lab, participants will complete daily diary responses
      via text and online surveys.

      40 participants will take both placebo and naltrexone. Participants will complete two
      sessions, one in each drug condition, in which they complete a number of tasks including
      reading messages on a computer screen, holding a number of objects, and viewing images while
      undergoing electric shocks. Participants will also complete a daily diary for 14 days while
      on naltrexone and placebo. Prior to these lab sessions participants will be screened at
      UCLA's Clinical &amp; Translational Research Center (CTRC) to ensure that they are healthy and
      that it is safe for them to take the study drug.

      We hypothesize that people will report feeling less socially connected when on naltrexone
      compared to placebo and will show subsequent changes in social behavior outside of the lab.

    <measure>Changes in Self-reported Feelings of Connection During Naltrexone (vs. Placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will report on their feelings of connection during two separate lab visits, on day 4 of each drug assignment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will read positive, loving messages from friends and family members and then rate their feelings of connection (how connected, touched, and warm they felt, Î± = .93, averaged to create a measure of feelings of social connection). Ratings were made on a 1-7 scale anchored by &quot;not at all&quot; and &quot;very.&quot; Higher numbers indicate greater feelings of connection in response to reading the loving messages.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Self-reported Feelings of Social Connection</measure>
    <time_frame>end of day for 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>For 8 days (4 while on placebo, 4 while on naltrexone), participants were asked to think back to the last 24 hours and respond to how disconnected they felt (&quot;I felt out of touch and disconnected from others&quot;). Ratings were made on a 1-7 scale anchored by 'strongly disagree' and 'strongly agree.' For ease of interpretation, feelings of disconnection were reverse-coded to measure daily feelings of social connection. Thus higher numbers indicate greater feelings of connection. Responses were averaged across the 4 days that participants were on each study drug (4 while on placebo, 4 while on naltrexone).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported Physical Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>once a day for 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of each day while on a study drug (4 days when on naltrexone and 4 days when on placebo) participants reported on their physical symptoms (headaches, dizziness/faintness, nausea, appetite increase/decrease) on a 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe) scale.
Responses were averaged across study drug to evaluate a single outcome for days when participants were on naltrexone and a single outcome for days when participants were on placebo.</description>

        <title>Changes in Self-reported Feelings of Connection During Naltrexone (vs. Placebo)</title>
        <description>Participants will read positive, loving messages from friends and family members and then rate their feelings of connection (how connected, touched, and warm they felt, Î± = .93, averaged to create a measure of feelings of social connection). Ratings were made on a 1-7 scale anchored by ânot at allâ and âvery.â Higher numbers indicate greater feelings of connection in response to reading the loving messages.</description>

Participants will be asked to take the first drug, either naltrexone or placebo, once a day for three days prior to the first experimental session and when they arrive at the lab for the experimental procedure . After the first session, participants will take the second study drug for three days prior to the second experimental session and when they arrive for the second experimental procedure.

        <title>Daily Self-reported Feelings of Social Connection</title>
        <description>For 8 days (4 while on placebo, 4 while on naltrexone), participants were asked to think back to the last 24 hours and respond to how disconnected they felt (âI felt out of touch and disconnected from othersâ). Ratings were made on a 1-7 scale anchored by 'strongly disagree' and 'strongly agree.' For ease of interpretation, feelings of disconnection were reverse-coded to measure daily feelings of social connection. Thus higher numbers indicate greater feelings of connection. Responses were averaged across the 4 days that participants were on each study drug (4 while on placebo, 4 while on naltrexone).</description>
