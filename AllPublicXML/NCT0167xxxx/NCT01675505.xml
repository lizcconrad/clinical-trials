    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether there are prognostic factors regarding the
      mental and functional adjustment of colon cancer patients following curative surgery.
      Patients will be selected using specific inclusion criteria. Prognostic factors investigated
      include personality characteristics, initial distress, medical, social and economic factors.
      The utmost purpose of the study is to assist clinicians with the timely identification of
      vulnerable patients in order to ensure their proper management and their optimal adjustment.

      Moreover this is the first study using the Distress Thermometer in Greek patients with
      cancer.
