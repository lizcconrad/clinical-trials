    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to explore whether short-term therapy with GSK1278863 affects PASP
      under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in healthy volunteers. Healthy subjects will be
      evaluated using echocardiography to estimate PASP based on the velocity of the tricuspid
      regurgitant jet. Resting PASP will be assessed under normoxic (room air) conditions, as well
      as after 30 minutes' exposure to 15% O2 before, during, and after short-term treatment with
      GSK1278863.

      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded (subjects and
      investigators will be blinded, GSK internal personnel will not be blinded) study designed to
      test whether short-term administration (5 days) of GSK1278863 affects PASP under normoxic and
      hypoxic conditions in healthy volunteers. Approximately 45 healthy subjects with
      mild-moderate baseline tricuspid regurgitation (sufficient to allow reliable assessment of
      PASP) will be enrolled into this study and will provide ~15 evaluable subjects in each arm
      [Placebo, 5 mg, and 100 mg GSK 1278863].
