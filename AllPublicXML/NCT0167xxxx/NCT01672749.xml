  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The foremost challenge when managing early onset scoliosis (curve deformity before the age of
      10) is to prevent curve progression while maintaining growth of the spine. Current treatment
      options require repetitive interventions as the spine and the child grow. This study will
      compare two techniques of growth modulation: Standard dual growing rods versus the new Luqu√©
      Trolley screws

      Hypothesis: Patients treated with the DePuy Synthes TROLLEY system will undergo fewer
      re-operations after 3 years of follow-up (FU) than patients included in the comparison group

      The purpose of this clinical study is to show that the growth guiding construct with DePuy
      Synthes TROLLEY Gliding Vehicles allows for less re-operations and for ongoing spinal growth
      across an instrumented immature spine while preventing curve progression in early onset
      scoliosis patients.

        One third of the patients will be recruited in designated investigation sites using the
        TROLLEY system. For each trolley patient one to two comparative matched pairs will be
        generated from mining the database of the Chest Wall and Spine Deformity Study Group
        (CWSDSG) and the Growing Spine Study Group (GSSG).
