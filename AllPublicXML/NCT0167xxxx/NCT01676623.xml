  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alive &amp; Thrive is an initiative that aims to improve infant and young child feeding practices
      and reduce childhood stunting. In Vietnam, Alive &amp; Thrive's primary intervention is
      implemented through a social franchise linked with the government's health system. The impact
      evaluation is conducted using a cluster-randomized design in which 20 commune health centers
      (CHC) were assigned to the social franchise model, and 20 CHC were assigned to routine
      government services. Repeated cross-sectional baseline and endline surveys will be used to
      assess the public health impact of this intervention. The baseline was in 2010 and an endline
      survey in the same communities will be conducted in 2014. Mixed methods process evaluation
      will be conducted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to study the pathways through which the program
      impact is achieved.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exclusive breastfeeding among children 0-6 months of age</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Exclusive breastfeeding in children 0-6 months of age is one of the eight WHO-recommended IYCF core indicators will be measured to capture breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices. It is measured using survey based recall by interviewing mothers of children in the age group for the indicator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Child heights and weights (children 24-60 months of age)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Heights and weights of children in the intervention and comparison communes covered by the CHCs in the study will be assessed in 2014. A new sample of children 24-60 months will be measured in the repeated cross-sectional endline survey to measure these outcomes and compute height-for-age, weight-for-age and weight-for-height z-scores based on the WHO growth reference standards.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Complementary feeding for children 6-23.9 months of age</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Indicators of complementary feeding - diet diversity, minimum acceptable diet, and minimum meal frequency, measured in children 6-23.9 months of age are one of the eight WHO-recommended IYCF core indicators will be measured to capture breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices. These are measured using survey based recall by interviewing mothers of children in the age group for the indicator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early initiation of breastfeeding in children 0-24 months of age</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Early initiation of breastfeeding (in the first hour after birth) is measured in children 0-23.9 months of age and it is one of the eight WHO-recommended IYCF core indicators will be measured to capture breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices. These are measured using survey based recall by interviewing mothers of children in the age group for the indicator. Samples for children 0-6 months and 6-23.9 are combined to calculate this indicator</description>
