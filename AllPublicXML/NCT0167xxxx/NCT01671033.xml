  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From the scarce literature it showed that computer/internet-aided cognitive behavior therapy
      (CBT) was superior to waitlist and placebo assignment across outcome measures, and the
      effects of computer/internet-aided CBT were equal to therapist-delivered treatment across
      anxiety disorders. The aim of this study is to evidence the effectiveness of internet-based
      relaxation with biofeedback treatment for panic disorder.
