  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea is an important cause of morbidity in patients
      treated with antibiotics, especially in hospital. Clinical relapse occurs after up to 30% of
      initially successful treatments for colitis. Preliminary reports suggest that Rifaximin, a
      poorly absorbed antibiotic used to treat travellers diarrhoea can prevent relapse. We plan to
      carry out a randomised placebo controlled trial to test the hypothesis that Rifaximin given
      in a reducing dose over 4 weeks after successful treatment will reduce the relapse rate.

      Aims i) To examine efficacy of a follow-on course of Rifaximin given after a successful
      initial course of standard treatment, in the prevention of relapse in C. difficile associated
      diarrhoea (CDAD).

      ii) To examine changes in faecal microbiota in patients given Rifaximin vs. Placebo.

      Treatment 4 weeks treatment with Rifaximin or Placebo tablets. Tapering dose starting with 2
      x 200mg tablets three times a day (total = 1.2g per day) for the 1st 2 weeks, reduced to 1 x
      200mg tablet three times a day (total = 0.6g per day) for the 2nd 2 weeks.

      Primary endpoint: The difference in % relapse between Rifaximin and placebo at 12 weeks
