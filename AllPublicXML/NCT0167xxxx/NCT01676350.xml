  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn whether patients with difficult to
      obtain IV access who are treated with IO access are more satisfied with their care and have
      better outcomes. The investigators are specifically studying the time difference between
      groups and the difference in the number of attempts required to obtain vascular access and
      begin to treat with fluids and medications. The study will also measure patient satisfaction
      and procedural pain, the frequency of central line placement, the length of stay in the
      hospital and emergency department, and adverse events to intravascular access to determine
      whether IO access can improve these measures.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of a protocol utilizing an IO device for select
      patients with failed IV access will reduce the time requirements to obtain vascular access,
      reduce the number of attempts needed to obtain IV access, reduce the ED LOS, and have no
      negative impact on patient satisfaction compared to the current ED practices.
