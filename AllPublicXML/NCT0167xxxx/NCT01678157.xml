      The objective of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of porcine acellular dermal
      matrix mesh (Strattice; LifeCell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) in crural reinforcement of
      laparoscopic large paraesophageal hernia repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic reinforcements reduce recurrence rates; the choice of optimal prosthetic, either
      synthetic or biosynthetic, for crural reinforcement is controversial. The objective of this
      study is to examine the safety and efficacy of porcine acellular dermal matrix mesh
      (Strattice; LifeCell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) in crural reinforcement of laparoscopic large
      paraesophageal hernia repair. Strattice is a commonly used mesh in hernia repair. 35 adult
      (&gt;19 years of age) patients will be selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Patients who meet the criteria will be enrolled in the study. Information related to
      recurrence rates based on follow-up visits will be analyzed to determine the efficacy of
      Strattice in the prevention of large hernia recurrence.
