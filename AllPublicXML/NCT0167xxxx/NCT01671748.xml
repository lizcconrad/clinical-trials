  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous leg ulcers (VLUs) impact negatively on patients' quality of life. Standard
      treatment in the UK for patients with VLUs is compression bandaging or stockings. The MIST
      ultrasound system is a noncontact device which delivers low frequency ultrasound through a
      gentle saline mist directed at a patient's wound. This study aims to determine whether the
      use of the MIST device used in combination with standard treatments can improve healing of
      VLUs compared to UK standard practice. This will be assessed by measuring any reduction in
      wound size in the two groups after receiving 8 weeks of either Standard Care once a week or
      MIST combined with Standard Care three times a week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are wounds which are often chronic and difficult to heal. VLUs
      affect between 1 and 3.2 people per 1000; they cause pain, reduced mobility and impact
      negatively on patients' quality of life (QoL). Standard treatment for patients with VLUs is
      the application of strong, sustained compression with bandages or stockings. This
      pragmatically-designed study aims to determine whether the use of a device called MIST used
      in combination with standard treatments can improve healing of VLUs compared to UK standard
      practice. It will also show whether the MIST regimen improves participants' QoL and reduces
      the incidence of infection.

      The MIST ultrasound system is a non-contact device which delivers low-frequency ultrasound
      through a gentle saline mist directed at a patient's wound. Patients (over 18 years old) will
      be invited to take part in this study if they have had a VLU for 6 weeks or more, which
      measures between 5 and 100 cm^2, and is not infected. Participants with diabetes must show
      good blood glucose control, and those with underlying chronic disorders which may affect
      wound healing will be excluded.

      All study participants will receive four weeks of standard treatment once a week at a single
      clinic at the Wound Healing Research Unit (WHRU), University Hospital of Wales. Patients
      whose wounds reduce by more than 40% during this time will be withdrawn from the study.
      Remaining patients will be randomly allocated to either the active group or the control group
      to receive a further eight weeks of treatment. Participants in the active group will receive
      treatment with the MIST device three times a week, as well as standard care (change of
      compression bandage and dressings) three times a week. The control group will receive UK
      standard care (which is dressing and compression bandage change at least once a week). The
      participants' ulcers will be measured and photographed once a week, and the wound
      characteristics will be assessed. Changes in participants' health related QoL will be
      assessed using a questionnaire at the beginning and end of the trial. Wound recurrence rates
      90 days after the end of the treatment will be assessed by telephoning patients.

    <description>On the first and final visit participants were invited to complete a Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule (CWIS) a validated questionnaire designed to measure the impact of chronic wounds on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The overall HRQoL question asks patients to rate their overall quality of life over the past week by circling a number between 0 and 10. Low scores indicate poor quality of life, and high score indicate good quality of life. Change in HRQoL was calculated by subtracting week 1 values from week 13 values.
CWIS has been validated in the following paper: Price and Harding (2004) The Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule: the development of a condition specific questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in patients with chronic wounds. International Wound Journal 1(1):10-17</description>

        <title>Change in Overall Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) From Week 1 (Start) and Week 13 (Exit)</title>
        <description>On the first and final visit participants were invited to complete a Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule (CWIS) a validated questionnaire designed to measure the impact of chronic wounds on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The overall HRQoL question asks patients to rate their overall quality of life over the past week by circling a number between 0 and 10. Low scores indicate poor quality of life, and high score indicate good quality of life. Change in HRQoL was calculated by subtracting week 1 values from week 13 values.
