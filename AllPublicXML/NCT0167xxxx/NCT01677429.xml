      Hypotheses

      The investigators hypothesize that among individuals who suffer from panic disorder there is
      higher incidence of co-morbid balance impairment than in the healthy population.

      The investigators hypothesize that the treatment of panic disorder, through the treatment of
      co-morbid balance impairment using virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy environment, is more
      effective than the exposure to still pictures from the same scene in VR without balance
      challenge or comparing to standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of
      panic disorder.

      Rationale

      This research relies on previous studies, which have shown mutuality between anxiety and
      balance impairment, even if only sub-clinical. The VR-based training environment enables
      multi-sensorial stimulus in a dynamic interactively changing setting. With the addition of a
      cognitive task (dual task distracting the fear), the investigators can add cognitive load and
      therefore challenge the control of balance even more. Individuals who suffer from balance
      impairment avoid their exposure to many balance-challenging situations - a fact that may
      increase their anxiety. The investigators assume that a considerable number of PD individuals
      also experience balance control impairments - mostly subclinical ones. Moreover, balance
      impairment accompanies other psychiatric disorders, though not enough literature exists on
      the subject.

      Introduction

      Anxiety disorders are a group of ailments, which are characterized by excessive and abnormal
      vague senses of apprehension followed by stress and restlessness (Berrios 1999). As a group,
      anxiety disorders were found to have the highest lifetime prevalence, i.e. they are the most
      commonly occurring class of mental disorders (Kessler et al. 2010) with 17.7% prevalence in a
      year (Kessler et al. 2005). This group of disorders consists of five main mental disorders:
      specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety and panic
      disorder - which the investigators will be focusing on.

      Panic disorder (PD) is a chronic ailment characterized by spontaneous, unexpected occurrence
      of panic attacks, i.e. periods of intense fear, which vary dramatically in the recurrence of
      panic attacks between patients and within a patient, ranging from a few per day to a few per
      year (American Psychiatric Association 2000). PD often occurs in conjunction with
      agoraphobia, i.e. the fear and avoidance from situations and settings they perceive they have
      little control on, such as public places and 'suffocating' surroundings (Kessler et al.
      2005). PD can reach a lifetime prevalence of 5% (Kessler et al. 2010) and above (Serretti et
      al. 2011) and women are two to three times more likely to be affected than men (Schumacher et
      al. 2011). PD mostly develops in young adulthood (25y mean age), however this is not
      mandatory as onset during childhood or early adolescence most likely remains undiagnosed
      (Schumacher et al. 2011). Individuals suffering from PD are also said to have a deregulated
      autonomic nervous system at rest and during orthostatic challenge (i.e. tilt test), displayed
      by heightened heart rate and diastolic blood pressure compared to those of healthy controls
      (Martinez et al. 2010).

      Many years of research have been invested in seek of an association between anxiety or PD and
      impaired physical balance (Perna et al. 2001; Sklare et al. 2001; Staab and Ruckenstein 2003;
      Staab 2006; Redfern et al. 2007). Many times the treatment of anxiety disorders in general,
      and PD among them, which target limbic areas, fail to succeed; thus it is recommended to
      treat the comorbid balance impairment, which its treatment alone can ameliorate anxiety
      (Shefer et al. 2010). Literature on the subject has indicated high prevalence of comorbid
      balance disorders and anxiety in general (Alvord 1991; Balaban and Jacob 2001; Kalueff et al.
      2008) as well as anxiety disorders specific ranging from agoraphobia, panic attack and
      generalized anxiety (Alvord 1991; Balaban and Jacob 2001; Balaban and Thayer 2001; Jacob and
      Furman 2001). Anxiety in general and PDs are a common co-morbidity in acute and chronic
      vestibular disorders (Eagger et al. 1992; Matheson et al. 1999; Jacob and Furman 2001; Pollak
      et al. 2003), evolving from vestibular deficiency or sensorimotor disintegration. In spite of
      abundant literature supporting anxiety-imbalance relationship, it is still uncertain whether
      they are causality related.

      Further investigation on the subject revealed that individuals who suffer from PD may also
      display altered cognitive patterns (Casey et al. 2004; Starcevic and Berle 2006). In
      addition, last decade research in the cognitive field has been dedicated to evaluating
      cerebellar involvement (Andreasen and Pierson 2008). Studies in animal models (Brodal et al.
      1991; Dum and Strick 2003; Kelly and Strick 2003) have shown cerebellar connection to the
      frontal cortex through the pons and thalamus, suggesting its participation in neural circuits
      mediating higher cognitive functions. While cerebellar lesions in animals have indicated
      motor coordination and motor learning impairments (Thach 1996; Bastian et al. 1998), studies
      in humans have assigned the cerebellum a role in time intervals perception (Akshoomoff and
      Courchesne 1992), rhythm sequences imitation (Fiez et al. 1995) and associative learning
      (Attwell et al. 2002). Hence, the cerebellum seems to act as a modulator of cognitive
      processes performed by the cerebral cortex, which detects patterns and pattern changes as
      well as errors in both motor and cognitive functions and feedbacks the cerebrum (Andreasen
      and Pierson 2008).

      Further support for this association lies in the theory of learning. Erez et al. (Erez et al.
      2004) present a three-stage of learning theory, which includes an acquisition stage and two
      distinct stages of conditioned response (CR): the emotional CR, driven by the autonomic and
      hormonal systems, is fast and non-specific and the motor CR, provides an effective CR and is
      slow but specific. Despite the apparent differences, these two stages seem to be highly
      interrelated as can be explained by a frightening stimulus: fear CRs are acquired, emotional
      fear CRs take over and promote motor CRs. Contrariwise fear CRs may take over, if a
      subclinical balance disorder exists, it could be postulated that intervention of balance may
      reduce PD.

      Balance maintenance itself occurs automatically and is involved in the execution of basic
      motions, which enable daily life activities (Keshner 1994; Kurtzer et al. 2005) as well as
      high performance skills such as ballet (Koutedakis and Jamurtas 2004) and athletics
      (Hrysomallis 2011). Normally, once a balance task becomes automatic, voluntary or cognitive
      action are enabled without a trade-off (Adi-Japha et al 2008). The success of performing any
      motor task lies on the ability to conduct task-related voluntary movements on top of constant
      involuntary postural adjustments (Keshner 1994; Kurtzer et al. 2005). Thus, each task-related
      maneuver involves the contraction of muscles in the limbs and trunk for the maintenance of
      body stability. Balance maintenance also requires constant integration between sensory input
      coming from vestibular, visual, somatosensory (mainly proprioceptive) channels and the motor
      system (Shefer et al. 2010). Converging from different sensory sources, this system addresses
      various balance maintenance aspects (Massion and Woollacott 1996) and so the loss of sensory
      input from either one can result in the alteration of posture (Le and Kapoula 2008).

      Impaired vestibular function causes imbalance, nausea, vertigo and abnormal eye movements
      (Gilman and Newman 1996) and hinders the acquisition and emission of corrective movements.
      Such occasions are associated with limbic-related anxiety, perhaps through the parabrachial
      circuit (Balaban and Thayer 2001). The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is reciprocally connected
      with the spinal cord, hypothalamus, amygdala and limbic cortex, and thus receives vestibular
      nuclear and visceral afferent information; therefore links vestibulo-visceral integrations
      especially in the adjustment to gravito-inertial challenges. In a recent study evaluating
      vestibular mutation in mice, it was found that an elevated plus-maze platform and an
      open-field test contributed greatly to anxiety levels (Shefer et al. 2010). While under
      rotation, extra-cellular recordings gave support to vestibulo-recipient areas of the PBN
      integrate signals from the vestibular nuclei and convey information about whole-body's
      orientation to pathways that produce homeostatic and affective responses (Balaban et al.
      2002); giving further support to panic and impaired balance co-morbidity.

      Individuals who suffer from vestibular or balance disorders many times demonstrate symptoms
      of anxiety, and conversely, patients with anxiety disorders often show abnormalities of
      clinical balance or vestibular function tests (Bronstein et al. 2004; Furman et al. 2005).
      Perna et al. (Perna et al. 2001) showed that PD patients demonstrate larger velocity and
      length in body sway in comparison to healthy controls. An additional study measured postural
      sway in anxiety patients as a response to a moving visual environment and found greater sway
      among the anxiety group comparing to the healthy controls (Redfern et al. 2007). A
      Parkinson's disease study has shown that in most cases they did not suffer from a specific
      vestibular disease, but do have subclinical abnormalities of the balance system. These
      patients control their posture relying on non-vestibular cues, proprioceptive and mostly
      visual input (Staab 2006; Caldirola et al. 2011).

      Despite some considerable evidence in the literature, it is still difficult to isolate and
      verify balance impairment in PD. Thus the investigators propose the implementation of virtual
      reality exposure therapy. The term virtual reality (VR) refers to the use of an interactive
      computerized environment (software and hardware) simulating real world settings, which enable
      the immersion of the individual in trial (Weiss et al. 2005). With its high sensitivity, it
      is possible to create an environment where the individual is gradually led into a motivating
      and challenging environment, which requires his/ her alertness and physical attendance rather
      than imaginational capabilities. Within the VR it is possible to design a setting that
      consists of motivational and challenging elements, which indicate for the individual
      regarding his/ her own capability and competence (in contrast to his/ her impotence and
      passiveness) and from the amended experience (triumph is achieved). In addition, the
      therapist has the unique opportunity to be part of that environment in real-time and
      straightforward.

      VR exposes the examinee as well as the therapist to salient components of the panic evoking
      situation and by visual, auditory and motor elements the stressing environment is
      reconstructed and reveals its panic-provoking roots (Roy et al. 2010). VR exposure enables
      the identification of intimidating moments as well as confident ones, providing the examinee
      with a competing instrument to deal with the stressing moments, while allowing the
      environment to change and adjust exposure levels and challenge the examinee (Wiederhold and
      Wiederhold 2010). VR exposure is done in laboratory conditions and under full supervision,
      thus it addresses individuals who are physically incapable of outdoors training as well. All
      in all, the utilization of the VR method allows the employment of a stepwise exposure
      approach, which is made by computerized and human fine-tuned modifications of the scene
      (Wiederhold and Wiederhold 2010).

      Furthermore, VR exposure therapy, in practice for more than twenty years, supports the
      learning and training of neuro-motor tasks such as in flight, ski and surgery simulators.
      During the last few years, VR exposure method has made its way to clinical utilization in
      rehabilitation centers and hospitals, where balance and motor control are the main focus (Roy
      et al. 2010). The exposure to VR may contribute from several aspects, which are out of the
      reach of conventional therapy methods. VR exposure therapy provides an innovative and
      exceptional opportunity to reconstruct the scene and setting, which lead to panic behavior,
      and expose the examinee to critical factors consisting of the panic root. Altogether, VR
      systems enable the learning of simple and complex skills in a controlled environment, due to
      the endowment of monitored, graded, and adapted exposure of the various components
      constructing the therapy in a systematic manner (Rizzo et al. 1997a; Rizzo et al. 1997b;
      Schultheis and Rizzo 2001; Merians et al. 2002; Deutsch et al. 2004; Weiss et al. 2005).

      Using VR, balance performance is evaluated precisely and efficiently by measuring body sway
      during quiet standing and during a few sets of perturbations (Nashner 1976; Allum and
      Carpenter 2005). The measured factor is the displacement of the center of pressure (CoP),
      i.e. a point at which a counter-reaction force vector of the vertical ground is applied. This
      force vector represents a weighted average of the pressure vectors of each foot on the force
      plates (Winter et al. 1990; Winter 1995). The CoP is a dynamic factor and displaces a few
      centimeters within a plane constantly (Winter 1995; Winter et al. 1996). Body sway is a
      kinematic term and is often estimated from the CoP displacement (in the anterior-posterior
      and medio-lateral axes) which is derived from force plate data, and is assumed to be
      synonymous with the CoP measure (Winter et al. 1998).

      Balance maintenance and postural adjustments are modified by repeating experiences and
      improve with practice (Pollock et al. 2000), less muscles are recruited and responses refine
      and become subtle (Horak and Nashner 1986; Horak et al. 1989; Chong et al. 1999). Besides
      physical conditions, balance maintenance depends also on cognitive aspects such as attention,
      memory and dual tasking. Plotnik et al. (Plotnik et al. 2011) showed a relationship between
      dual tasking abilities and fall risk in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease,
      suggesting that Parkinsonian fallers are easily affected by dual tasking, with a great
      likelihood of loss of balance during the execution of daily attention-drawing activities.
      Thus, motor skills ranging form very simple to most complex ones can be performed and
      monitored for the characterization of learning processes; and training in virtual
      environments provides the opportunity to study learning skills and build learning curves
      (Holden 2005; Carelli et al. 2009). During VR, complete movement sequences are recorded as a
      pattern allowing full investigation motor skills, which is important in accordance with the
      notion that motor skill learning is task specific (Karni et al. 1998; Korman et al. 2007).

      Many researches have recognized the potential of using VR in clinical treatment of
      psychopathologies, especially in the anxiety field. Some evidence on the application of VR
      exposure therapy to the treatment of specific phobias and PD can be recently found in the
      literature (Botella et al. 2004; Pull and Damsa 2008; de Carvalho et al. 2010; Gerardi et al.
      2010; Meyerbroker and Emmelkamp 2010; Perez-Ara et al. 2010; Meyerbroker et al. 2011). A
      Belgian research studying motor vehicle accident trauma examinees showed that the use of VR
      was the most efficient method in treating phobias and that VR exposure provided a safe
      controlled therapeutic environment unrelated to treatment circumstances (Wiederhold and
      Wiederhold 2010). Therefore, VR exposure is applied interactively, since there is more value
      to an exposure where the examinee is active and the environment is dynamic and challenging;
      as exposure of this nature enhances alertness and emotional excitement, which are valuable to
      the treatment's success. The investigators will examine prevalence and severity in PD
      patients taking into consideration that they have higher prevalence of balance impairment.

      The implementation of the VR method involves research and development costs as well as
      maintenance ones, and sometimes technical impediments may take place due to the relying on
      advanced and multisensory method. VR method calls for the recruitment of a technician beyond
      the professional therapist, which will be thoroughly trained and will operate a large number
      of software test-runs (pilots) before introducing it to patients. The common belief that
      multisensory exposure, triggering several systems at the same time distract the examinee's
      mind and prevent him/ her to be fully immersed (Roy et al. 2010) is refuted. In Sheba
      Rehabilitation Center for Advanced Technologies there is a VR laboratory running for years,
      enabling the rapid and successful rehabilitation of many patients. Salient and relevant
      specification of the VR laboratory can be adjusted to the treatment of balance disorder and
      panic. The investigators intend to implement VR method in the treatment of balance disorder
      patients, and to investigate its role in ameliorating panic behavior. The investigators
      further hypothesize that VR treatment can aid patients with challenging situations and
      improve neuro-motor functioning and thus better management in their everyday experiences.

      Objectives

      Stage 1 (evaluation) - to investigate whether there is balance impairment within PD patients
      in comparison to matched healthy subjects.

      Stage 2 (treatment) - to investigate whether balance training using VR exposure therapy is
      significantly more effective in reducing panic symptoms, than the exposure to still pictures
      from the same scene without balance challenge, or from CBT standard protocol for the
      treatment of PD.

      Study population

      Stage 1 Sixty PD patients, men and women at the age of 18-45, will be recruited from Sheba
      Medical Center psychiatric clinics and an ad. PD will be assessed using SCID-1 checklist.
      Patients and 20 healthy controls matched by age, sex and BMI will complete the MINI.

      Stage 2 The same 60 PD patients will be randomized to three treatment groups: (1) 20 through
      VR-based balance training; (2) 20 through exposure to still pictures from the same VR scene
      but no balance challenge; (3) 20 through CBT for PD.

      Ethics

      The following study includes a neurological examination which focuses on balance assessment
      based on questionnaires and a psychiatric examination for PD diagnosis. In addition, this
      research exposes the participants to a medical device (VR), which has been certified by the
      FDA and has received the Israeli Ministry of Health approval. This advanced method is used
      daily at the Advanced Technologies Department of the Rehabilitation Hospital at Sheba Medical
      Center. Furthermore, the identification and contact details of patients and healthy controls
      will be encoded to follow anonymity.

      Methods

      Stage 1: The investigators will collect demographic data such as age, sex and education,
      basic information such as height and weight for BMI calculation for the matching with healthy
      controls. The investigators will also collect medical history and concomitant medicine,
      clinical state as well as general morbidity and sports-related questions.

      Stage 2: The investigators will ask the participants of this research not to take any part in
      psychotherapeutic treatment apart from the ones in this study.

      Panic Disorder Diagnosis

      Patients who participate will be diagnosed using the SCID-1 checklist and MINI for PD
      diagnosis and CGI. In addition the participants will go through the following for the
      assessment of PD severity and functionality under panic attacks:

        -  Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A).

        -  Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)

        -  Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) In addition, the investigators will use visual
           analogue scale (VAS) for the assessment of the panic severity level from one week to the
           other (will be applied in each visit).

      Balance Assessment

      Participants who are recruited will pass a neurological examination which includes a thorough
      balance assessment. Within this assessment the investigators will implement two self-rating
      questionnaires: Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the The Activities-specific Balance
      Confidence (ABC) Scale, as well as the functional assessment tools implemented by the
      neurologist:

        -  Berg Balance Scale

        -  Dynamic Gait Index, DGI

        -  Functional Gait Assessment, FGA Additionally, objective balance assessment will be done
           using VR as given in the detailed description.

      Physiological measures

      The investigators will also collect the following measures: blood pressure, Galvanic Skin
      Conductance and Heart Rate

      CAREN system

      The VR system the investigators will be using is the CAREN™ (Computer Assisted Rehabilitation
      Environment) Integrated Reality System, using the CAREN III software. This system is designed
      by MOTEK BV, (Amsterdam, The Netherlands, www.motekmedical.com). This system works in
      real-time and enables the creation of a variety of controlled and repeatable simulated
      environments via dedicated software with 3D visual, sound, and proprioceptive stimuli. It
      consists of the following components:

      Motion Platform - CAREN™ consists of an electro-hydraulic motion 2 meter diameter motion
      platform (Rexroth Hydraudyne, MOTEK, Micro motion, www.rexroth-hydraudyne.com ) that can be
      manipulated with 6 degrees of freedom (x-y-z translation and pitch-roll-yaw rotation). The
      movement of the platform is either driven by the subject's movements, or preprogrammed in
      synchrony with function curves that define a specific pathway in the virtual environment.

      Force Plates - Two 51 × 47 centimeter force plates (AMTI - Advanced Mechanical Technology,
      INC, Massachusetts, USA, www.amtiweb.com) are embedded in the motion platform. The output of
      the force plates is three dimensional force and moment data from each platform as well as the
      CoP displacement.

      Motion Capture - Up to 41 passive markers are placed on anatomical landmarks and sampled at
      120 Hz to record 3D head, trunk and limb motion. The markers are detected by an optokinetic
      system which consists of 12 Vicon infra-red cameras having a resolution of 2 megapixels
      (www.vicon.com).

      Projection: The Virtual scene is projected on a large screen (3m × 2.5m). Stereo projection
      may be used.

      The 'Road scene' In a virtual reality setting, standing on a moving platform, subjects were
      required to maintain their balance, while advancing along a pre-defined road (the 'road
      scene'). The scene was projected onto a large screen, in front of the subject. The scene
      consisted of a virtual road, bounded on both sides by walls. The road itself had flat,
      straight sections, vertical bumpy sections (movement along the y-axis), right and left tilts
      (rotation of 'z axis' - &quot;roll&quot;) and right and left translations (movement along the 'x axis'
      - &quot;sway&quot;). The platform's movement was correlated with the visual stimulus (i.e., when the
      subject arrived at a bump on the screen, the platform elevated. When the road tilted, the
      platform tilted accordingly in the same direction). The length of the road is 1230m. The
      road's velocity was 30 m/sec, which equals to 1.8 km/min or 108 km/h. The specific parameters
      of the platform excursions in the 'X' (pitch) and 'Z' axis will be determined following a
      pilot study.

      The 'Road scene' with an additional task The voluntary, secondary task consisted of
      intercepting 18 moving targets (colored ball of 12.5 cm diameter) appearing above the road.
      Each target could be intercepted when appearing no further than 20 cm from the subject's
      hands (which are reflected on the screen as a 4.5 cm in diameter ball). The targets appear,
      one at a time, at pre-set points along the road alternately on the right and left sides of
      the subject's body. Each ball is displayed for 5 seconds from its appearance and then
      disappears (unless it has been intercepted). After intercepting a target, the subject was
      instructed to return to the 'home position'.

      On either of the scenes, the challenge level may be heightened by increasing the platform's
      tilt.

      Study Protocol

      Stage 1 A 3-4 hours introductory meeting will take place and will include a couple of hours
      assessment using the SCID-1 checklist for the diagnosis of PD, as well as the implementation
      of the MINI for psychopathology elimination. A general neurological examination for both
      healthy controls and PD patients will include functional balance assessment and self-rating
      questionnaires, VR-based evaluation of objective measures of balance maintenance (described
      in detail). VR exposure will be done in three consecutive exposures: (a) VR road scene (movie
      only) - in case the movie itself evokes anxiety and panic symptoms; (b) balance training
      using VR (no movie); (c) movie +balance challenge.

      The evaluation will be done in conditions, such as entering a dark closed room, assuring the
      minimum of anxiety is evoked. Therefore, the investigators will take VAS subjective report
      and physiological measurements from the participant for cardio-vascular fluent monitoring.

      Stage 2 The same 60 PD patients will be randomized to three treatment groups: (1) 20 through
      VR-based balance training; (2) 20 through exposure to still pictures from the same VR scene
      but no balance challenge; (3) 20 through CBT for PD. At this stage too the investigators will
      use VAS subjective report of the panic levels during the last week as well as objective
      physiological measurements at each visit.

      In addition to the neurologist and psychiatrist at the 5th and last visits, there will be a
      CAREN specialist and a physiotherapist from the VR crew in each visit.

        1. Protocol of imbalance treatment using VR exposure therapy (10 visits) 9 visits of
           VR-training with/ without parallel task: road scene repeating, which takes 24 minutes,
           including preparation and the installment of up to 41 sensors; 45 minutes per visit. The
           challenge increases if possible and will consist of sharp slopes and bumpy roads and/ or
           cognitive load (additional task). In addition, specific balance parameters will be
           collected, HR, GSC and a physiological examination and a verbal conversation at the end
           of each visit will take place and inform the participant on his/ her improvement.

           During the 5th visit there will be another psychiatric evaluation using the same
           questionnaires and assessment tools.

           Last visit: a summary meeting with no VR exposure. The investigators will implement all
           the assessment tools and questionnaires, as well as a neurological examination. In this
           visit the investigators will repeat sway and perturbation measurements and will make a
           summary.

        2. Protocol of imbalance treatment using VR exposure therapy (10 visits) 9 visits of
           exposure to still pictures from the same VR scene: still pictures in a loop, which takes
           24 minutes, including preparation and the installment of up to 41 sensors; 45 minutes
           per visit. In addition, specific balance parameters will be collected, HR, GSC and a
           physiological examination and a verbal conversation at the end of each visit will take
           place and inform the participant on his/ her improvement.

           During the 5th visit there will be another psychiatric evaluation using the same
           questionnaires and assessment tools.

           Last visit: a summary meeting with no VR exposure. The investigators will implement all
           the assessment tools and questionnaires, as well as a neurological examination. In this
           visit the investigators will repeat sway and perturbation measurements and will make a
           summary.

        3. CBT standard protocol for the treatment of PD (10 visits) A CBT standard protocol for
           the treatment of PD will be applied in all 10 visits. Each visit will last 1 hour,
           except for the 5th and last visits, which include a psychiatric assessment using the
           same evaluation scales and questionnaires as in the evaluation, and therefore will last
           1.5 hours. CBT will be implemented by a therapist, i.e., a psychologist or psychiatrist
           trained for the treatment of panic disorder. The therapist evokes emotional feelings
           such as vulnerability, disappointment, frustration, joy etc. This supportive therapy
           helps the individual to normalize his/ her behavior at the time of a panic-evoking
           situation and thereafter. The therapist tries to lead the individual to self-empowerment
           by providing him/ her self-defense mechanisms and inner-strengthening tools.

      Handling the Data

      The investigators will assure anonymity of all data collected and medical discretion.

      Length of Study

      Stage 1: The investigators intend to interview 60 participants in order to recruit 60 PD
      patients, and at the same time the investigators will interview 20 matched healthy controls.

      Stage 2:

      The same 60 PD patients from Stage 1 will participate in a 10-12 weeks experiment. In
      addition, there will be a follow-up within 6 months and 12 months from end of trial, when the
      participants will be asked to fill assessment questionnaires regarding their PD.

      Statistical Analysis

      The investigators will test for normal distribution of the dependent variables and then will
      examine the differences between the groups using univariate analyses: for continuous
      independent variables, such as scores, the investigators will apply t-test and for
      categorical variables, such as sex - chi square. All using SPSS software.

      Any data to be collected during this study will be used for research purposes only and does
      not have diagnostic significance at the moment. However, this study may have clinical
      realizations and application in the future. Should the investigators have important findings,
      this research group has intentions to publish them.
