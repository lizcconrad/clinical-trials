  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of MLN8237 (alisertib) when
      given together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel)
      in treating patients with solid malignancies that are metastatic or cannot be removed by
      surgery. Alisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel work by killing the cells
      or by stopping them from dividing. Giving alisertib together with nab-paclitaxel may provide
      a more effective anticancer treatment with fewer side effects.

          -  Patient must have a histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures to not exist or

             cancer or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumor and must have been treated with a
             regimen with known benefit for pancreatic cancer or poorly differentiated
             neuroendocrine tumor (MTD expansion cohort only).

          -  Patient must have measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with

          -  Patient must have normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance must be &gt; 40 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault)

          -  If a female of childbearing potential (defined as a female who is non-menopausal or
             surgically sterilized), patient must be willing to use an acceptable method of birth
             control (i.e., hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with
             spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. If a
             male with a partner who is a female of childbearing potential, patient must agree to
             use an acceptable method of contraception during the entire study treatment period
             through 4 months after the last dose of MLN8237. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her
             treating physician immediately.

          -  Patient must be able to take oral medication and to maintain a fast as required for 2
             hours before and 1 hour after MLN8237 administration.

             understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not have received chemotherapy or radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks or 5 half-lives
             prior to study entry.

          -  Patient must not have had radiation therapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow. Whole
             pelvic radiation is considered to be over 25%.

          -  Patient must not have a history of other malignancy ≤ 2 years previous with the
             exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which was treated with
             local resection only, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after
             curative therapy.

          -  Patient must not have had a prior allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplantation.

          -  Patient must not have previously received nab-paclitaxel.

          -  Patient must not have received any other investigational agents within 14 days prior
             to study enrollment.

          -  Patient must not have known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases
             must be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because
             they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Patient must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to either MLN8237 or nab-paclitaxel, or other
             agents used in the study.

          -  Patient must not have been treated with clinically significant enzyme inducers, such
             as the enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine, or Phenobarbital,
             or rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, or St. John's wort within 14 days prior to the
             first dose of MLN8237.

          -  Patient must not have received any previous treatment with any Aurora-kinase
             inhibitors (MTD expansion cohort only).

          -  Patient must not have a history of gastric resection (MTD expansion cohort only).

          -  Patient must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited
             to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled diabetes, malabsorption, resection of
             the pancreas or upper small bowel, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Patient must not have ≥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before
             enrollment.

          -  Patient must not have a known history of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other
             conditions that could result in excessive daytime sleepiness, such as severe chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease.

          -  Patient must not have a requirement for supplemental oxygen.

          -  Patient must not require constant administration of a proton pump inhibitor, H2
             antagonist, or pancreatic enzymes. Intermittent uses of antacids or H2 antagonists are
             allowed.

          -  Patient must not have QTc &gt; 500ms within 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Patient must not have had a myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment
             or have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled
             angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence
             of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.

          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

          -  Patient must not be known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with MLN8237 or Abraxane. In addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
