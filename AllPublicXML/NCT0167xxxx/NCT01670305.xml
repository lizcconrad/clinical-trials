    <textblock>
      Residual pockets and furcation defects are challenging sites that require additional
      periodontal therapy. The aim of this study is evaluate 1)the effect of a single photodynamic
      therapy (PDT) as monotherapy residual pockets in single rooted teeth and 2) the effect of PDT
      in association with scaling and root planing (SRP) in class II furcation lesions with probing
      pocket depth (PPD) &gt;5mm and bleeding on probing (BoP). A blind randomized controlled clinical
      trial was conducted in subjects presenting at least three residual pockets in single root
      teeth and subjects with at least one molar presenting class II furcation defect. To evaluate
      the effect of a single PDT as monotherapy in residual pockets, the selected sites were
      assigned to receive: PDT alone, photosensitizer alone or SRP alone. To evaluate the effect of
      PDT in association with SRP in class II furcation lesions, the selected sites were assigned
      to PDT+SRP or SRP alone. Clinical, microbiological and immunoenzymatic analyses were assessed
      at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-therapies.

      Residual pockets and class II furcation lesions are challenging sites that require additional
      periodontal therapy. The aims of this study were to evaluate:

      1) the effect of a single PDT as monotherapy residual pockets in single rooted teeth and 2)
      the effect of PDT in association with SRP in class II furcation lesions.

      A blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in subjects presenting at least
      three residual pockets in single root teeth and subjects with at least one molar presenting
      class II furcation involvement.

      To evaluate the effect of a single PDT as monotherapy in residual pockets, the selected sites
      were assigned to receive one of following therapies: PDT alone, photosensitizer alone or SRP
      alone.

      To evaluate the effect of PDT in association with SRP in class II furcation lesions, the
      selected sites were assigned to receive PDT+SRP or SRP alone. Microbiological,
      immunoenzymatic analyses and clinical parameters: probing pocket depth (PPD), position of the
      gingival margin (PGM), relative clinical attachment level (RCAL), full mouth plaque (FMPS)
      and bleeding score (FMBS), will be assessed at baseline,3 and 6 months post-therapies.
