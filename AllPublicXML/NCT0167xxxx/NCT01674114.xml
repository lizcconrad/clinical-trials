  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a regional-block (TAP block) in Caesarean
      section will give a measurable benefit in form of reducing Morphine consumption as compared
      to local infiltration of the wound with local anesthetic.

    <textblock>
      Caesarean section is one of the most common surgical procedures in the world and
      postoperative pain afflicts both mother and the newborn- especially the first 48 hours after
      birth.

      Pain management at the investigators hospital is multimodal (balanced analgesia).
      Peroperatively the wound is infiltrated with local anaesthetic performed by the obstetrician
      at the end of the procedure. Postoperatively the patient gets routinely a combination of
      Paracetamol and NSAID`s orally and Morphine intravenously as required. The side-effects of
      Morphine (nausea, vomiting, itching and sedation) do interfere, dose dependent, with the
      interaction between mother and child, breastfeeding and postpartum experience.

      Previous studies have compared transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) with reduction
      of morphine consumption in C-section (up to 50%! (1,2). So far no one has compared TAP-block
      with local infiltration in C-section patients.

      Ultrasound guided TAP-block is done by an anaesthesiologist at the end of the operation, and
      it is viewed as a safe and easy procedure to perform. The investigators assumption is that
      the TAP-block reduces the morphine consumption with 50% as compared to local infiltration.
      Due to maximal dosage of Bupivacaine, it is not possible to give both types of anaesthesia at
      the same time.
