      The Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) has a high prevalence among the population. Objectives:
      To evaluate the prevalence of signs and symptoms of TMD. Methodology: 210 randomly selected
      individuals were evaluated, being divided into three groups with seventy individuals each:
      Group 1 - dental students with natural dentition. Group 2 - patients with removable partial
      dentures. And Group 3 - patients with double complete dentures. The questionnaire of the
      American Academy of Orofacial Pain for triage was employed, then, clinical evaluation was
      carried out.
