    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of daily consumption of eggs or egg
      substitute for 6 weeks on endothelial function and on cholesterol and lipoprotein levels in
      participants with clinically established coronary heart disease (CHD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restriction of dietary cholesterol, and thus the avoidance or restriction of egg intake, is
      routinely recommended to patients with coronary disease. However, the relative importance of
      dietary cholesterol to serum lipids has become a subject of active debate. Eggs provide a
      complete array of amino acids and an array of micronutrients, and are low in total fat.
      Epidemiological and clinical studies have showed that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids
      decreases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Endothelial function testing represents a
      uniquely valuable means of assessing aggregated influences on cardiac risk by gauging
      physiologic responses of the vascular endothelium. In prior studies the investigators have
      shown that daily egg ingestion for 6 weeks did not adversely affect endothelial function in
      healthy adults or in hyperlipidemic adults. The investigators now propose a prospective,
      randomized, single-blind crossover study to assess the effects of eggs, egg substitute and
      high-carbohydrate American breakfast on endothelial responses and serum lipids in
      participants with clinically established CHD.

    <description>FMD will be measured as the percent change in brachial artery diameter from pre-cuff inflation to 60-seconds post-cuff release (upper arm cuff position). In addition to brachial diameter at 60 seconds post-cuff release, flow after cuff deflation within the first 15 seconds will be used as an indicator of stimulus strength, hyperemic flow being the stimulus for endothelial reactivity.</description>
