      This study is a post-marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local prospective and
      observational study of patients who have received Ciproxan intravenously as a first-line
      treatment for sepsis, secondary skin infections followed by superficial burn, post-surgical
      or post-traumatic, pneumonia, peritonitis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, anthrax. The objective
      of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of Ciproxan in daily clinical practice. A
      total of 3,000 patients are to be enrolled and assessed during the period of treatment with
      Ciproxan.
