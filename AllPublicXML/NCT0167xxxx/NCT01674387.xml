      Purpose of this test is to observe and objectively evaluate electroacupuncture (EA) therapy
      on the clinical efficacy in patients with chronic neck pain, and provide a reliable clinical
      basis for the chronic neck pain treatment and evaluation of efficacy.

    <textblock>
      According to statistics, the incidence of chronic neck pain has significantly increased year
      by year, particularly tending to younger people, as social competition increase fiercely and
      the pace of people's daily work and life accelerate. Studying the effective treatment and
      prevention of chronic neck pain has obvious medical, social and economic significance.
      Purpose of this trial is to observe and objectively evaluate electroacupuncture (EA) therapy
      on the clinical efficacy in patients with chronic neck pain, and provide a reliable clinical
      basis for the chronic neck pain treatment and evaluation of efficacy.

    <description>30 patients (the EA group) receive the acupuncture treatment at nine acupuncture points: Dazhui (GV14), bilateral Jianzhongshu (SI15), bilateral Jingbailao (EX HN15), bilateral Jiaji (EX-B2) of cervical positive reaction plane (taking two pairs). Besides, bilateral Jianzhongshu (SI15) and bilateral Jiaji (EX-B2) receive the electro acupuncture treatment, with dilatational wave. All the needles retained for 20 minutes, one treatment every other day, 10 times a course, and the treatment assessed after a course.</description>
