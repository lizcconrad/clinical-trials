  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the most effective route to administer steroids to
      patients with chronic sinusitis, specifically a type of chronic sinusitis not associated with
      nasal polyps (CRSsNP). The investigators would like to better understand whether orally
      administered steroids results in superior results when compared with nasally sprayed
      steroids. The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that for patients with
      radiographically proven CRSsNP, routine medical therapy consisting of a short course of
      systemic corticosteroids is superior to topical corticosteroids for relieving inflammation
      and the symptoms of CRS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic sinus infections (chronic sinusitis or CRS) are common conditions that affect
      millions of Americans. While this is a common disorder, medical treatments for this condition
      vary a lot and little is known how and why different treatments work in some individuals and
      not in others. Some physicians commonly utilize a course of oral steroid therapy similar to
      treatment of inflammatory conditions including asthma and arthritis. Other physicians feel
      that oral steroids are not more effective than nasal steroid sprays in reducing inflammation
      and prefer prescribing nasal steroids. There is no conclusive data as to whether oral or
      sprayed nasal steroids are more effective in providing long-term benefit to patients. Nasal
      steroids are FDA approved to treat some types of chronic sinusitis but oral steroids are FDA
      approved medications that are used to treat inflammatory conditions but is not specifically
      indicated for chronic sinusitis and thus should be regarded as investigational drug. The
      purpose of this research study is to better understand whether orally administered steroids
      results in superior results when compared with nasally sprayed steroids. The investigators
      will compare patients with chronic sinusitis who are first treated with antibiotics and oral
      steroids, and compare them to chronic sinusitis patients who receive antibiotics and nasally
      sprayed steroid therapy.

    <description>The Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 is a validated questionnaire that measures 22 nasal and quality of life symptoms (&quot;nasal obstruction&quot; and &quot;loss of smell and taste&quot;) ranked from 0 (not a problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be).
Min score= 0, Max score= 110 (&quot;worst possible problem&quot; on all symptoms)
Change from baseline of the SNOT-22 score. The SNOT-22 questionnaire is a 22-item disease-specific health related quality of life instrument validated for use in chronic rhinosinusitis.</description>

        <description>The Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 is a validated questionnaire that measures 22 nasal and quality of life symptoms (“nasal obstruction” and “loss of smell and taste”) ranked from 0 (not a problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be).
Min score= 0, Max score= 110 (&quot;worst possible problem&quot; on all symptoms)
Change from baseline of the SNOT-22 score. The SNOT-22 questionnaire is a 22-item disease-specific health related quality of life instrument validated for use in chronic rhinosinusitis.</description>
