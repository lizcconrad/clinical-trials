  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among Veterans is a condition that imparts a great burden to
      the patient in terms of serious co-morbidities and results in a great cost to the VA Health
      Care System to treat the co-morbidities, which include heart disease, stroke and
      neuropsychiatric disorders. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is used to treat sleep apnea and
      studies have shown a poor adherence to treatment. The investigators hypothesize that using
      wireless technology will lead to early detection of problems of treatment use and will
      translate into early remedial action which will improve the use and effectiveness of
      treatment. The investigators will compare two methods. Usual care involves downloading data
      from PAP machines at designated 3-month intervals, requiring a face-to-face clinician visit.
      Wireless care involved more frequent monitoring and intervention in the event of anomalies in
      treatment use or effectiveness.

    <description>Evaluate whether patients are effectively being treated with PAP or with alternate means of treatment for OSA at the end of 12 months. We will also assess whether the residual number of respiratory events on treatment (residual AHI), regardless of modality used for treatment, is satisfactory, and whether subjective measures of sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and quality of life (Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index).</description>
