  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) traditionally receive bed rest as part of their
      care. They develop muscle weakness even after only a few days of mechanical ventilation that
      may prolong their time in ICU and in hospital, but the nature of such weakness is poorly
      understood.

      The weakness that develops in ICU is more substantial than that which would result from bed
      rest alone and is referred to as ICU acquired weakness (ICUAW). This weakness might be due to
      the combination of inflammation and immobility. The exact mechanisms leading to the nerve and
      muscle damage which occurs in critical illness are not yet fully understood and require
      further investigation. However, it is known that ICUAW has an effect on a patient's ability
      to breathe without a ventilator, walk and perform simple activities (like washing and
      toileting) and often results in longer mechanical ventilation time and hence, longer hospital
      stays than might otherwise be expected. It may also affect a patient's ability to return home
      after their hospital stay. The recovery period in Australian and New Zealand ICU patients is
      unknown but a trial from Canada has reported ongoing weakness five years after leaving ICU.
      Weakness in survivors of intensive care is known to be a substantial problem. It is currently
      not known whether ICUAW may be avoided or its severity reduced with simple strategies of
      early exercise in ICU.

      There are no data about the level of activity and mobility in critically ill patients in
      Australian and New Zealand ICUs. These data are urgently required to plan a program of
      research to test whether increasing the level of mobility and activity in our critically ill
      patients is safe, feasible and efficacious in terms of reducing the severity of ICUAW and
      improving patient-centred outcomes. The program of research will first include a study to
      observe the mobility levels in 25 ICUs across Australia and New Zealand to determine safety,
      barriers to mobility and what type of activities are undertaken by our patients.

      From the observational data we plan to develop a pilot randomised controlled trial of early
      mobility and activity in intensive care units across Australia and New Zealand. This simple,
      cost-effective strategy may improve functional ability, decrease time on mechanical
      ventilation and improve long term outcomes in this patient group. By initiating such a
      program, ANZ investigators might be able to change future patient outcomes worldwide.
