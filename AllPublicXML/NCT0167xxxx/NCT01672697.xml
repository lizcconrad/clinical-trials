  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is to determine if physical therapy (PT) and behavioral therapy (BT) in
      the post-partum period after a vaginal delivery complicated by genital trauma help to improve
      a woman's quality of life, specifically in regard to anal incontinence. To be able to study
      this, the investigators need to know how well the muscles of a woman's pelvic floor function
      after a vaginal delivery and this requires measuring their strength during a pelvic exam. At
      present, there are no studies that have looked at whether the intervention of PT/BT improves
      a woman's anal incontinence quality of life after sustaining genital trauma during vaginal
      deliveries

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial involving 65 woman who sustained a severe laceration or
      episiotomy during their first vaginal delivery to determine if postpartum intervention with
      physical/behavioral therapy improves their quality of life in regard to anal incontinence.
      The primary outcome measure is functional and based on a change in score of the Fecal
      Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQOL) validated questionnaire from baseline (2-weeks after
      delivery date) to study completion (12-weeks after delivery date). The secondary outcome
      measure is physiologic and reflects a change in anal sphincter resting tone from baseline to
      study completion.

      After the screening questionnaires to determine eligibility in the study, each study subject
      will be consented for participation then undergo a baseline physical exam (including pelvic
      exam and rectal exam) at a range of 2- to 4- weeks after delivery date. In addition, after
      this initial exam, all women will be randomized immediately to receive (1) no further
      treatments, or (2) physical and behavioral therapy.

      The investigators will study these two groups of women for 24 total weeks after the date of
      delivery. The intervention group will include patients randomized to receiving PT/BT for 4
      weekly sessions after their vaginal delivery and laceration (episiotomy) repair. The control
      group (no intervention) will include patients randomized to receiving the standard of care
      (no physical or behavioral therapy) after their vaginal delivery and laceration (episiotomy)
      repair.

      Each group will undergo the baseline testing: a pelvic exam (to measure the strength of your
      muscles) and anal-rectal manometry (i.e. rectal exam with insertion of a small sensor to
      measure the strength of your sphincter); and be asked to complete a series of brief
      questionnaires. These questionnaires will be administered again to both groups at 6-weeks,
      12-weeks, and 24-weeks after their delivery date. Study completion physical exams including a
      repeat pelvic exam and repeat anal-rectal manometry will be conducted at 12-weeks after
      delivery date.

    <description>The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (FIQOL) is a 29-item instrument developed with the support of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons that measures the impact of anal incontinence over four domains: Lifestyle, Coping/behavior, Depression/self-perceptions, and Embarrassment. The FIQL has demonstrated validity and reliability.</description>

    <description>Anal Rectal Manometry (ARM) will be completed by all participants at baseline (week 2 visit) and completion (week 12 visit); a small caliber soft flexible disposable air-filled catheter will be placed in the patient's rectum to a depth of 5cm in order to obtain the resting tone and squeezing pressure of the sphincter, per the protocol and patient preparatory instructions as provided by Laborie Medical Technologies (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for use with their Triton Aquarius Urodynamics® chair and compatible UDS120 software.</description>

    <description>The Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) is a frequency matrix developed with support of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons that assigns patient-weighted values to various frequencies and types of incontinence.

    <description>Physical Therapy (PT) Protocol states that each participant in the treatment arm only will undergo a total of four 45-minute sessions with a certified pelvic floor (PF) physical therapist over the course of the 12 weeks. Routine monitoring of patient progress will be performed. Each session includes using the body core muscles and internal pelvic floor muscles, focusing on PF protection techniques, PF exercises, Core exercises, progression to full ADLs(activities of daily living), and an exercise routine.
Behavioral Therapy (BT) Instructions are given only to participants in the treatment arm after randomization at week-2 visit; handout provides specific instructions about appropriate diet, hygiene and level of activity during the 12 weeks of enrollment.</description>
