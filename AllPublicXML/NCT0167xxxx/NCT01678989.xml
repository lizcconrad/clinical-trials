      Genetic transition is important in the etiology of bipolar disorder (BD). So, evaluation of
      children of BD parents and diagnosed with and BD children whether or not brain has affected
      zones. These groups were compared to healthy controls and whether or not the mental health of
      children is influenced will be evaluated by the clinical investigation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MRI studies in children at risk of BD, our understanding of the neurobiology of BD and
      abnormalities in the studied regions, regions that predispose to the development of our
      understanding of PBB will shed light on the etiology of the disorder. In this study, the
      cranial MRI findings and clinical features in adolescents with bipolar disorder and the same
      age and sex matched children who have parents with BD and healthy controls were investigated.
      Since there is few studies that evaluate these three groups, there is a need to increase our
      knowledge on this issue.
