      The investigators primary aim is to increase chemotherapeutic drug uptake in inoperable
      tumours

      The specific sub-objectives of the studies are:

        -  To quantify tumour sizes and relate it to the patient survival over time, dependent of
           treatment method.

        -  To evaluate and compare the toxic effects and safety of gemcitabine in combination with
           US contrast agent under sonication with gemcitabine alone.

        -  Develop and validate new ultrasound perfusion algorithms based on burst- replenishment
           for diagnosis and monitoring of therapy.

        -  To quantify gemcitabine and its main metabolites in plasma and in circulating
           mononuclear cells before, during and after pancreatic sonication, and to quantify the
           concentration of intracellular endogenous nucleotides in circulating mononuclear cells
           at the same time points.

        -  To assess plasma and tissue concentrations of gemcitabine, its main metabolites and
           endogenous nucleotides in those patients where surgical resection can be performed on
           standard clinical indications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer (ICD-10 C25.0-3) at the Department of
             Surgical Gastroenterology of Haukeland University Hospital, who have volunteered to
             participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient participated in an investigational study within 30 days prior to study entry
             (or, if longer, within five half-lives of the last dose of any investigational drug).

          -  Patient has severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or severe chronic asthma.

          -  Patient has a history of cardiovascular ischemia, acute myocardial infarction or
             unstable angina within 3 months prior to study entry.

          -  Patient has a history of any psychiatric disorder or cognitive impairment that would
             interfere with participation in the study.

          -  Patient has a known history of Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV infection.

          -  Patient requires dialysis or has severely impaired renal function, defined as a serum
             creatinine &gt; 180 mmol/L at the Screening Visit.

          -  Patient has severe impairment of liver function, defined as a serum albumin level ≤ 25
             g/L and/or a Protrombin Time INR &gt; 2.3 (or APTT &gt; 6 seconds above the upper limit of
             normal) at the Screening Visit.

          -  Patient is pregnant or is breast-feeding.

          -  Patient is allergic to or intolerant of gemcitabine

          -  Patient is allergic to or intolerant of SonoVue® BRACCO ultrasound contrast agent

          -  Any reason why, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient should not
             participate.
