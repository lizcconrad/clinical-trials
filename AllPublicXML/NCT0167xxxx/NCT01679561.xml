  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both organ-specific and systemic autoimmunity are associated with an increased prevalence of
      recurrent miscarriage and reproductive failure, rendering the role of the maternal
      immunological system in fertility a key concept. It is believed by some that central to this
      theme is the maternal cytokine profile, with particularly T-helper (Th) cells. Immune
      modulating therapies have therefore been mooted as potential therapeutic strategies. Recent
      reports of high pregnancy rates achievable in women with RIF have added fuel to the debate
      regarding the effectiveness of intralipids in modulating the immune system.

      The investigators would like to assess if that intralipids therapy is an effective treatment
      for women undergoing repeated failed assisted reproduction cycles and recurrent miscarriages
      against traditional methods in randomised clinical trial (RCT).

    <description>Two hundreds patients (group1) with abnormal NK activity results (NKa)will receive intralipids 20% i.v. (9 mg/mL total blood volume -corresponds to 2 mL of intralipids 20% diluted in 250 mL saline; or 18 mg/mL - corresponds to 4 mL of intralipid 20% diluted in 250 mL saline) infusions and their NKa will be tested periodically. The determination of NK cell function will be performed by flow cytometry using K562 cells as targets,then follow up of the patients by the Doppler of endometrial blood follow at the time of luteal phase,and the clinical pregnancy rate.Group(2)of 200 patients will receive other routine measures.</description>
