      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate placing the radiation therapy markers
      (Fiducial) by using an endoscopic procedure. The endoscopic procedure is called an Endoscopic
      Ultrasound (EUS). This is a procedure using a special endoscope that has an ultrasound on the
      end. The ultrasound will allow the doctor's to see where the radiation therapy markers
      (Fiducial) is to be placed as outlined by the Radiation Oncologist.

    <measure>Evaluation of the success and accuracy of endoscopic delivery of the Fiducials into pre-selected targets using dedicated EUS fiducial delivery system.</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately one week</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure for this study is to determine:
The successful delivery, to the targeted tissue,of the fiducials through the fiducial delivery system,
The accuracy of the fiducial delivery into the targeted tissue and
to see if the fiducials can be visualized via Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS), Fluoroscopy and/or CT scan.
The success and accuracy of the delivery will be evaluated by Endoscopic Ultrasound, fluoroscopy and/or CT scan to determine if the fiducials are in the targeted tissue. The subject's Oncologist will inform the endoscopist of the targeted tissue that is to receive the fiducials.</description>
