  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate efficacy and safety of GemOx(Gemcitabine and
      Oxaliplatin) combination with rituximab(R) as first-line treatment of elderly patients with
      DLBCL
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed that the combination of rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
      (R-GemOx) achieved high efficacy with a low toxicity profile in relapsed and refractory
      DLBCL. This regimen might be considered a putative treatment option for elderly patients. To
      our knowledge, the efficacy and safety of R-GemOx when given as first-line therapy in elderly
      patients with DLBCL remains unknown. The investigators therefore developed a two-weekly
      regimen of rituximab combined with GemOx regimen as first line treatment in elderly DLBCL and
      investigate its efficacy and safety.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

        -  overall response rate

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  progression free survival

        -  overall survival

        -  safety and toxicity
