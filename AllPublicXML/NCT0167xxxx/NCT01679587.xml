  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective was to assess in subjects with CKD: Safety and tolerability of molidustat
      (BAY 85-3934), effects of molidustat on non-invasive hemodynamics Secondary objectives were
      to assess: Effects on pharmacodynamic parameters of erythropoiesis (erythropoietin,
      reticulocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit), pharmacokinetics of molidustat,
      exploratory biomarkers, ie, midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, midregional
      pro-adrenomedullin, plasma renin activity, and optionally B-type natriuretic peptide,
      vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, cyclic adenosine
      monophosphate, and noradrenaline
