      Background:

      - Brain metastases are cancer cells that have spread to the brain from primary cancers in
      other organs. These tumors can be removed surgically. However, researchers are trying to find
      better ways to treat brain metastases. A new drug, GRN1005, has been designed to cross into
      the brain and deliver the cancer treatment drug paclitaxel to treat tumors. Researchers want
      to see how well GRN1005 works on brain metastases from breast or lung cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of GRN1005 in treating brain metastases from breast or
      lung cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have breast or lung cancer that has spread to the
      brain.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Tumor tissue samples may also be collected. Imaging studies
           will also be performed.

        -  Participants who have breast cancer will be divided into two groups. Those whose cancer
           contains the HER2 protein will be treated with the drug Herceptin as well as GRN1005.
           Those without HER2 will have only GRN1005.

        -  Participants who have lung cancer will also have only GRN1005.

        -  All participants will have two doses of GRN1005, each 3 weeks apart. On the day the
           second dose of GRN1005 is given, participants will undergo surgery to remove the brain
           tumors.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

      Background:

      Brain metastasis is the most common intra-cranial tumor in adults with approximately 170,000
      new cases being diagnosed in the United States annually. The incidence of brain metastasis is
      increasing. Usually brain metastases of breast cancer occur after the diagnosis of systemic
      metastases; but approximately 10 25% of patients with lung cancer have brain metastases at
      diagnosis and another 40 50% develop them during the course of their disease. Multiple
      factors are contributing to this increase: aging population, improved imaging techniques, and
      improvement in the treatment of tumors leading to prolonged survival, thereby allowing the
      emergence of brain metastases, with the brain being generally regarded as a sanctuary site
      because of the blood brain barrier (BBB). Lung cancer and breast cancer are the leading tumor
      types, accounting for approximately 50% and 15 - 20% of patients with brain metastases. This
      study will evaluate the ability of 18F-FLT to determine if amount of change in the uptake in
      the brain metastases from breast and lung cancer after one dose of therapy with GRN1005,
      correlates with intra-cranial response. FLT-PET utilizes a radiolabeled form of thymidine,
      which is incorporated into DNA in proliferating cells. 18F-FLT uptake correlates better than
      18F-FDG with proliferation, tumor progression, and survival. Because CNS uptake of FLT is low
      in contrast to FDG, this makes it potentially useful in evaluating CNS metastases. We would
      like to see which of these imaging modalities is superior in detection of brain metastases,
      and monitoring response to therapy.

      Objectives:

      -Determine whether one cycle of therapy GRN1005 is associated with a change in FLTPET uptake.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 years)

        -  Histologically or cytologically-documented breast cancer (HER2 status must be known) or
           NSCLC

        -  Presence of resectable brain metastases based on evaluation by neurosurgery.

        -  At least one radiologically-confirmed and measurable metastatic brain lesion.

      Design:

        -  Pilot non-randomized trial with or without trastuzumab

        -  Ten patients with resectable brain metastases from breast cancer and ten patients with
           resectable brain metastases from NSCLC will be studied.

        -  Baseline imaging (brain tumor protocol MRI and DSC-PWI MRI, FLT-PET) 1-14 days prior to
           first dose of GRN1005.

        -  Patients will receive 1 dose of GRN1005 on day 1 of study.

        -  Repeat FLT-PET imaging and MRIs will be done after 1 cycle of therapy and prior to
           surgery, on day 21.

        -  On the day of surgery, patients will receive a second dose of GRN1005 3 to 6 hours prior
           to brain surgery.

        -  PK studies will be done after each dose of GRN1005.

        -  Optional extra-cranial tumor biopsies will be performed before and after GRN1005
           administration.

        -  Following surgery radiation therapy will be offered to patients as clinically indicated
           per radiation oncologist s recommendation.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 years)

          -  Histologically or cytologically-documented breast cancer (HER2 status must be known)
             or NSCLC

          -  Presence of resectable brain metastases with or without prior radiotherapy. Patients
             must be greater than 28 days from WBRT or SRS

          -  Presence of resectable brain metastases, as assessed by neurosurgical evaluation. A
             brain tumor will be considered to be resectable for the purposes of the study if it is
             located in the cerebrum or the cerebellum. Tumors that are located in deep brain
             structures, including the medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and basal ganglia will be
             considered non-resectable. The tumor must be solitary or, if not, accompanied by
             another tumor on the same side of the brain that is also considered to be resectable
             by the same criteria.

          -  At least one radiologically-confirmed and measurable metastatic brain lesion (greater
             than or equal to 1.0 centimeters in the longest diameter) by Gd-MRI of the brain less
             than 14 days prior to first dose of GRN1005 (Cycle 1, Day 1). The spatial resolution
             of the Philips Gemini TOF PET/CT is 4millimeters [FWHM, (full width half maximum)].
             One cm is greater than 2 times this FWHM and it is anticipated that greater than 70%
             of the actual activity in the lesion will be visualized (i.e. recovered). It is
             expected that all lesions greater than or equal to 1 centimeters will have sufficient
             FLT uptake. If no lesions on the baseline image are visualized on FLT PET/CT, then
             post therapy FLT imaging will not be performed. These patients will be replaced.

          -  Patients must be neurologically stable, defined as being on stable doses of

             oxcarbazepine) for greater than or equal to 5 days prior to obtaining the baseline

             (excluding alopecia) must have resolved to less than or equal to CTCAE v4.0 Grade 1.

          -  Completed treatment with non-cytotoxic systemic drugs (e.g., targeted drugs) greater
             than or equal to 14 days for small molecules and greater than or equal to 28 days for
             monoclonal antibodies (e.g., bevacizumab, with the exception of trastuzumab and
             bisphosphonates) prior to first dose of GRN1005 (Cycle 1, Day 1). All clinically
             significant toxicities (excluding alopecia) must have resolved to less than or equal
