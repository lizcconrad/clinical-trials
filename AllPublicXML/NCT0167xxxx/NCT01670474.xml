  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surface thrombogenicity of standard double lumen catheters (stDLC) and surface modified
      film-coated domain structured double lumen catheters (fcDLC) consisting of a novel reactive
      polyurethane copolymer coating showed that in vitro measured surface thrombogenicity was
      reduced in the modified catheter compared with standard catheter. The clinical investigation
      revealed that both number of days before catheter removal according to clinical requirements
      and number of treatments per catheter were significantly higher with the modified catheter as
      compared with the standard catheter.

      Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been used primarily to treat catheter
      thrombosis. The relatively high cost of rt-PA and its theoretical potential to cause
      bleeding, as well as the morbidity and mortality associated with catheter malfunction and
      infection, justify the need for more definitive evidence of the efficacy of rt-PA as a
      locking solution.

      No study aims to evaluate the impact of rt-PA locking in long-term Hemodialysis (HD) uncuffed
      catheters survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The solution instilled into the central venous catheter lumens after each HD session and left
      in the catheter until the next session (catheter locking solution) is used to prevent
      thrombosis during the period between HD sessions and may also prevent catheter-related
      infection. However, evidence supporting the use of various locking solutions to achieve these
      objectives is limited. Heparin has been the traditional locking solution. Several small
      studies have assessed whether citrate and heparin are equally efficacious for maintaining
      catheter patency but the interpretation of the results was limited because the studies had a
      short follow-up period and included both uncuffed and cuffed central venous catheters.

      Thrombosis is a major cause of HD catheter dysfunction, and this problem is rectified by the
      use of thrombolytic agents, invasive procedures for declotting, or catheter replacement. A
      thrombus at the tip of the catheter or a fibrin sheath around it may resist local
      thrombolysis if it is not reached by sufficient concentrations of the drug. Urokinase has
      traditionally been used as the thrombolytic agent for HD vascular access declotting, and
      success rates for declotting vary from 55% to 85%. However, successful treatment of occluded
      central venous catheter (non HD) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or
      alteplase was recently achieved in more than 1,000 patients with success (function restored
      in 798 patients [75.0%; 95% CI: 72.3 to 77.6%]). Serious adverse events monitored within 30
      days was very rare and efficacy was independent of age, sex, body weight, and catheter type.
