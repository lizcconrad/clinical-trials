  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Perjeta (pertuzumab) in combination with
      Herceptin (trastuzumab) in participants with metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on
      trastuzumab-based therapy (Cohorts 1 and 2), and will make a preliminary assessment of the
      efficacy and safety of single-agent pertuzumab (Cohort 3). Objective response rate and
      clinical benefit will be assessed. Pertuzumab will be administered at an initial dose of 840
      milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) on Day 1, followed by 420 mg IV every 3 weeks. Trastuzumab
      will be administered at the same schedule the participant was following before entry into the
      study. An additional cohort of participants at certain centers will receive pertuzumab
      monotherapy at an initial dose of 840 mg IV on Day 1, followed by 420 mg IV every 3 weeks.
      These participants may have trastuzumab added to the regimen in the event of progression
      during single-agent pertuzumab treatment.

    <measure>Cohorts 1 and 2: Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 During Dual-Agent Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 9.5 years (at Screening; on Day 15 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8 [cycle length 3 weeks]; then every 3 months until disease progression)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0 to determine the objective response (OR) rate, or the percentage of participants with either confirmed CR or PR. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter compared to Baseline. Response was to be confirmed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial response was documented. The OR rate was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Cohorts 1 and 2: Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed Best Overall Response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD) According to RECIST Version 1.0 During Dual-Agent Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 9.5 years (at Screening; on Day 15 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8 [cycle length 3 weeks]; then every 3 months until disease progression)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0 to determine the clinical benefit response (CBR) rate, or the percentage of participants with either confirmed CR or PR, or SD lasting at least 6 months. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter compared to Baseline. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient (20%) increase to qualify for disease progression, in addition to no new target lesions. Response was to be confirmed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial response was documented. The CBR rate was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 9.5 years (at Screening; on Day 15 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8 [cycle length 3 weeks]; then every 3 months until disease progression)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0 to determine OR and CBR rates. Duration of OR was defined as time from initial response of CR or PR to time of disease progression or death. Duration of CBR was defined similarly as time from initial response of CR or PR, or SD lasting at least 6 months, to time of disease progression or death. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter compared to Baseline. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient (20%) increase to qualify for disease progression, in addition to no new target lesions. Participants without progression or death following confirmed CR or PR were censored at the last tumor assessment. Duration of response was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and expressed in weeks.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 99 participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer were screened for Cohorts 1 and 2, of whom 66 were recruited. Following primary analysis of Cohorts 1 and 2, a total of 51 new participants were screened for Cohort 3, of whom 29 were recruited.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Females with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer received dual-agent treatment with pertuzumab and trastuzumab. Recruitment for Cohorts 1 and 2 was conducted separately; however, the same regimen was administered to both sets of participants. Trastuzumab was administered via intravenous (IV) infusion as 2 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) once weekly, or as 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Pertuzumab was administered via IV infusion at a loading dose of 840 milligrams (mg) followed by a standard dose of 420 mg every 3 weeks, beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 1. Thereafter, both medications were administered on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Treatment continued for a minimum of 8 cycles and could be extended until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or death.</description>

        <description>Tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0 to determine the clinical benefit response (CBR) rate, or the percentage of participants with either confirmed CR or PR, or SD lasting at least 6 months.

        <title>Cohort 3: Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed Best Overall Response of CR, PR, or SD According to RECIST Version 1.0 During Single-Agent Treatment With Pertuzumab</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0 to determine the CBR rate, or the percentage of participants with either confirmed CR or PR, or SD lasting at least 6 months. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter compared to Baseline. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient (20%) increase to qualify for disease progression, in addition to no new target lesions. Response was to be confirmed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial response was documented. The CBR rate was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>Participants were followed for survival data during and after treatment for a maximum of 3 years after the last dose until death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up. The percentage of participants who died was calculated as [number of participants with event divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</description>

Recruitment for Cohorts 1 and 2 was conducted separately; however, the same regimen was administered to both sets of participants. Trastuzumab was administered via IV infusion as 2 mg/kg once weekly, or as 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Pertuzumab was administered via IV infusion at a loading dose of 840 mg followed by a standard dose of 420 mg every 3 weeks, beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 1. Thereafter, both medications were administered on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Treatment continued for a minimum of 8 cycles and could be extended until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or death.</description>
