    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of monoclonal antibody therapy
      before stem cell transplant in treating patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoid
      malignancies. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium-90 anti-CD45 monoclonal
      antibody BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without
      harming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient
      they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells,
      and platelets. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody before a stem cell transplant may be
      an effective treatment for relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 90Y-BC8-DOTA (anti-cluster of
      differentiation [CD]45) (yttrium-90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8) that can be delivered
      prior to autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), T-cell NHL (T-NHL), and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To optimize the protein dose (antibody [Ab]) to deliver a favorable biodistribution in the
      majority of patients.

      II. To describe the impact of rituximab concentrations, B-cell depletion, and disease burden
      on CD20 and CD45 targeting.

      III. To describe response rates and remission durations in relapsed B-NHL, T-NHL, and HL
      following administration of myeloablative doses of 90Y-BC8-DOTA prior to autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT).

      IV. To assess the correlation of lymphoma biomarkers with outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium-90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8.

      Patients receive indium-111 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8 intravenously (IV) on day -28
      and (if necessary) day -21 to evaluate the antibody's biodistribution. Patients then receive
      yttrium-90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8 IV on day -14. Patients then undergo autologous
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months and then
      annually thereafter.
