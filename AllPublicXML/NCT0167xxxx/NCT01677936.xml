  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effects of Raisins three times per day versus
      alternative snacks three times per day on blood sugar control and cardiovascular risk factors
      (weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol levels) in patients with Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus. These effects will be studied over a 12 week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Raisins are often considered a good food choice because they provide dietary fiber and many
      health-promoting nutrients, antioxidants and phytochemicals. Like most other fruits, raisins
      are devoid of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, and low in sodium; these features, combined
      with their high potassium content, high fiber, and low glycemic index make them potentially
      preferable to other foods in their effects upon glycemic control and cardiovascular risk
      factors.
