      There is a deficit in the number of 'age-appropriate' formulations available for the delivery
      of medicines to children. Liquid preparations are considered the 'gold standard' for
      delivering medicines to children however many of these are formulated using ingredients which
      can be toxic to children (e.g. preservatives, alcohols), particularly to neonatal babies (&lt; 4
      weeks old) who do not possess the metabolic processes and mature organ function of older
      children or adults. Rapidly dissolving oral thin films (OTFs) dissolve quickly in the saliva,
      releasing the active ingredient(s) without the need for chewing or water, making them ideally
      suited to patients who find it difficult to swallow other oral dosage forms such as tablets
      or capsules. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that OTFs can offer a safe and effective
      alternative for oral administration of phosphate supplements to neonatal infants for the
      treatment of hypophosphataemia and osteopenia of prematurity. It is hypothesised that this
      treatment will be equal to standard therapy using an oral solution. Babies born before 32
      weeks gestational age are routinely supplemented with oral phosphate as soon as they have
      been established on oral feeds in order to prevent bone disorders such as osteopenia. Babies
      recruited to this study will be given phosphate supplementation as per NHS Greater Glasgow
      and Clyde guidelines. This single-centre cross-over study will take place in the intensive
      care and special care baby units at the Princess Royal Maternity in Glasgow. The
      investigators aim to recruit 20-30 babies and will use blood phosphate levels (obtained from
      routine sampling only) to evaluate treatment effect. Babies will be randomised to receive
      either OTFs or oral solution of potassium acid phosphate for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks of
      the other therapy. The investigators hypothesise that OTF treatment will be equivalent to
      standard oral solution.

      There is a lack of 'age-appropriate' formulations available for delivering medicines to
      children. Liquid formulations are considered the 'gold standard' for delivering medicines to
      children. However, many of these are formulated using ingredients which can be toxic to
      children, and particularly to neonates (children &lt;4 weeks old), who do not possess the
      metabolic processes and mature organ function of adults. For example, many liquid
      formulations contain preservatives such as benzoic acid to improve the shelf-life of the
      product, or include solvents such as propylene glycol or ethanol to improve solubility. Many
      of these additional, functional ingredients can product toxic effects in children. For
      example, neonates are unable to metabolise benzoic acid, resulting in the accumulation of
      this ingredient and potentially serious neurological and respiratory effects known as
      'gasping syndrome'. Additionally, the lack of suitable licensed formulations for children
      leads to the routine prescribing of medicines outside the terms of their product license
      and/or the manipulation of medicines to make them suitable for children e.g. grinding up
      tablets. Further manipulation of products increases the risk of inaccurate dosages being
      administered, and adds a risk of error where additional calculations are required. There are
      also concerns over compatibility when medicines are, for example, mixed with foods or drinks
      in an attempt to improve acceptability. Looking specifically at prescribing within neonatal
      intensive care, up to 90% of medicines prescribed are unlicensed or off-label i.e. used in a
      way not covered by the product licence. Therefore, there is a need for more age-appropriate
      solid formulations suitable for delivering medicines to children. By formulating the medicine
      in a solid dosage form, the need for excipients such as preservatives can be removed. Within
      the last few years, rapidly dissolving oral thin films (OTFs) have been developed as a novel
      solid dosage platform for drug delivery. They were first established as breath fresheners and
      have since progressed towards delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
      Approximately the size of a postage stamp, OTFs dissolve quickly in the saliva, releasing the
      drug(s) without the need for chewing or water. They are ideally suited to patients who find
      it difficult to swallow other oral dosage forms such as tablets or capsules. Paediatric and
      elderly patients are particularly suited to this dosage design. Flavourings and sweeteners
      can be included in the films to mask a bitter tasting medicine if necessary. The films are
      discreet, easy to use and convenient. They have a history of uses in oral hygiene products
      and medical devices. Recent developments have seen their use in over-the-counter cough and
      cold remedies and anti-allergy products. In 2010, Zuplenz® became the first FDA approved
      prescription only medicine in an OTF formulation for the delivery of ondansetron in the
      treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Most recently in February 2012,
      Applied Pharma Research (APR) were successful in marketing a prescription only zolmitriptan
      based OTF product for the treatment of migraine. A basic thin film formulation can contain
      very few ingredients and since they are presented as a solid dosage form, they do not require
      the addition of preservatives. In the USA, Novartis has already marketed several thin film
      products under the brand Triaminic® which are aimed at children from as young as four for the
      treatment of coughs, colds, and allergies. In order to investigate whether OTFs are a safe
      alternative for drug delivery to neonates, an OTF containing potassium acid phosphate (KAP)
      has been formulated. KAP was chosen for this study since it is a non-toxic mineral supplement
      routinely given to preterm infants to improve bone health. The majority of fetal uptake of
      calcium and phosphorus occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy and so preterm infants
      are born with reduced body stores of these minerals. Hypophosphataemia (low blood phosphorus)
      results in increased levels of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, and subsequent
      demineralisation of bone (osteopenia). The association between low birth weight,
      hypercalcaemia (high blood calcium) and hypophosphataemia was first identified in the early
      1980s. It was identified that active demineralisation of bone was occurring in order to
      maintain the blood levels of phosphate required for other cellular functions and tissue
      growth. Reduced bone mineral density or metabolic bone disease in very low birth weight
      premature infants can lead to complications such as fractures and reduced growth. Preterm
      infant milk formulas and human breast milk fortifiers are supplemented with phosphate, and in
      addition within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde it is routine clinical practice to provide all
      preterm infants born before 32 weeks' gestational age with an oral phosphate supplement.

    <description>The aim of this research is to demonstrate that oral thin films (OTFs) containing potassium acid phosphate are equivalent to standard oral phosphate supplementation using an oral solution in the prevention of hypophosphataemia (low blood phosphorus). The primary outcome measure will be plasma phosphate. We will assume an equivalent therapeutic effect using OTFs if individual plasma levels for these babies are found to lie within an acceptable physiological range, and the difference between the means of the two groups (as determined by a statistical t-test) lies within 20% of the mean plasma level for the control group.</description>

    <description>Secondary objectives will be in terms of age-appropriateness and general acceptability. A lack of any observable adverse effects e.g. choking, vomiting, diarrhoea, will indicate the safety of oral thin films in this age group. Acceptability will be assessed in terms of observed discomfort/distress e.g. grimacing, crying, associated with treatment administration and will be assessed using visual analogue scales.</description>
