  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness and disproportionately affects children
      who are ethnic minorities and poor. Few studies of childhood asthma have been conducted with
      children who live in rural areas or have included Mexican American children in their samples.
      This study builds on the original R01NR007770 with findings that demonstrated the
      intervention could improve children's asthma self-management, asthma knowledge, metered dose
      inhaler skill, asthma severity, and parents' asthma management and access to care. In this
      competing continuation, the investigators added a third arm to the current research design
      with schools randomized into either an in-school asthma intervention, an in-school
      attention-control intervention, or an alternate intervention-delivery format of a single
      5.5-hour asthma day camp. The tri-ethnic sample will be composed of 320 Mexican-American,
      African-American, and White rural school-aged children (grades 2-5) who have asthma and their
      parents. In addition, the investigators propose adding a non-invasive measure of chronic
      airway inflammation (exhaled nitric oxide) to assess the impact of changes in asthma
      management on airway inflammation. Families will be followed for a full year with data
      collection at baseline and at 1-month, 4-months, and 7-months after the intervention to
      assess improvement in children's asthma morbidity, asthma severity, airway inflammation,
      family asthma management and quality of life. Hypotheses (H): Children in the Camp-Workshop
      group and the School-Home group will demonstrate equivalent improvements, but greater
      improvements than the Attention-Control group in:(H1.1) their asthma severity and airway
      inflammation from the Time 1 assessment when compared to Time 4 assessment; (H1.2) office
      visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations for asthma, and absenteeism for the study year (Time
      4) when compared to the pre-study year (Time 1); and (H1.4) Parents in the intervention arms
      will demonstrate sustained improvements in asthma caregiver's quality of life (QOL0 from the
      pre-study year (Time 1) to the end of the study year (Time 4) measurement, when compared to
      the Attention-Control group.

      Families are recruited at the beginning of the school year (Time 1, October-November);
      parents consent and child assent obtained and baseline data collected in fall. The
      intervention is provided in December-January. Follow-up data are collected at February (Time
      2), April (Time 3), and August (Time 4).

          <description>Provided in 16 15-minute sessions (4 hours total didactic time); scheduled 3 sessions/week. The content is provided by trained asthma educators. The Asthma Plan for Kids (AP-K) is a 7-step curriculum for children to use when responding to asthma symptoms. Skills practice with placebo metered dose inhaler (MDI) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) meters with PEF score interpretation. Topics include (a) identifying lung function, asthma warning signs, symptoms, and triggers; (b) learning skills to manage symptoms, including PEF meter score interpretation, communication with adults (e.g. teachers, coaches, family members), medication use and MDI technique; (c) evaluating asthma symptoms and the effectiveness of management; and (d) discussing how to stay active in a safe manner.

The Asthma Plan for Kids (AP-K) is a 7-step curriculum for children to use when responding to asthma symptoms. Skills practice with placebo metered dose inhaler (MDI) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) meters with PEF score interpretation. Topics include (a) identifying lung function, asthma warning signs, symptoms, and triggers; (b) learning skills to manage symptoms, including PEF meter score interpretation, communication with adults (e.g. teachers, coaches, family members), medication use and MDI technique; (c) evaluating asthma symptoms and the effectiveness of management; and (d) discussing how to stay active in a safe manner.
