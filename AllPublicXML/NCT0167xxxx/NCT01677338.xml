  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open-label comparison study and aimed to evaluate the
      preliminary performance of this 13C-uracil GEBT to examine its abilities of identifying
      abnormal (delayed) gastric emptying rates in subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately equal numbers of subjects will be enrolled in each of the 2 groups (with normal
      gastric emptying, and with delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis)) to complete at least 10
      subjects per group.

      The subjects will first have their gastric emptying rates investigated by scintigraphy using
      the Solid Test Meal containing 500 uCi 99mTc sulfur colloid at Visit 1. Second, the subjects
      will have their gastric emptying rates investigated by scintigraphy and 13C-uracil GEBT
      simultaneously using the Semi solid Test Meal containing 500 uCi 99mTc sulfur colloid and 100
      mg of 13C-uracil, respectively, at Visit 2. A comparison will be made between the results
      obtained at Visits 1 and 2 along with a comparison of the data obtained during Visit 2 for
      evaluation of the 13C-uracil GEBT.

    <description>Expired 13CO2 concentrations are obtained from breath test. The values will be calculated to Re(t)[B] semi-solid: remaining (%) of semi-solid test meal in stomach at t, t1/2[B] semi solid: half emptying time of semi-solid test meal , and tlag[B] semi-solid: lag time of semi-solid test meal.</description>

    <description>PK parameters of 13C-uracil and its major metabolites, DHU and UPA, including AUCt, AUC∞, Cmax, tmax, λz, and t1/2,z, will be calculated based on plasma and urine concentration for 13C-uracil and its metabolites, and expired 13CO2-excretion, which calculated based on expired 13CO2 concentrations</description>
