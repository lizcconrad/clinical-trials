  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problem:

      Currently, no system allows precise kinematic assessment of the knee and accurate guiding of
      orthopedic surgical actions in a minimally invasive fashion. However, such a system would
      prove useful in the clinical setting to improve the quality of surgical interventions at the
      knee.

      Hypothesis:

      A novel knee kinematic assessment and surgical guidance tool using 3D personalized imaging
      and minimally invasive bony fixation allows precise kinematic assessment and surgical
      guidance in the routine clinical setting.

      Objectives :

        -  Demonstrating the capacity of the system to precisely measure 3D knee kinematics

        -  Quantifying the reproducibility of the kinematic measurements

        -  Measuring the impact of knee surgical procedures on knee kinematics

        -  Assessing the correlations between measured articular kinematics and clinical results
           after knee surgery

        -  Integrating the novel measuring system to the surgical flow of three knee surgical
           procedures

        -  Quantifying the precision and reproducibility of the surgical actions guided by the
           system

        -  Comparing the clinical results of surgeries guided by the system to those performed with
           the traditional technique
