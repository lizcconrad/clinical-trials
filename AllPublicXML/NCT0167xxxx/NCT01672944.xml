  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate English and Spanish language educational materials
      that inform the community about a type of cancer research that involves the collection,
      storage, and processing of biospecimens. Part A of this study involved creating surveys about
      biospecimen donation and research. Now, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will begin to
      evaluate education materials about biospecimen donation and research.

      Phase II consists of two independent randomized controlled trials. Each trial is being
      conducted independently to test English and Spanish language materials (75 subjects each).

      The project addresses gaps in information by developing and validating English and Spanish
      language instruments to measure knowledge of and attitudes towards biospecimen donation and
      banking, as well as intention to donate biospecimens to a biobank (Part A). Once developed,
      the instruments will be used to evaluate biobanking educational priming tools by conducting
      two independent RCTs. Wherein English educational materials will be tested with 75
      participants recruited from an urban clinic, and Spanish educational materials will be tested
      with 75 participant recruited form a rural community health center network. For each RCT
      following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to either: 1) educational
      priming tools (DVD and booklet) developed by the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN);
      or 2) an NCI-developed brochure entitled &quot;Providing Your Tissue for Research: What You Need
      to Know.&quot; Seven to 28 days later participants will be given a telephone follow up interview.
