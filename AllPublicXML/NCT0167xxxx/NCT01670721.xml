      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety of aflibercept in participants with mCRC treated with
      irinotecan/5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) combination (FOLFIRI) after failure of an oxaliplatin-based
      regimen (participants similar to those evaluated in the VELOUR trial [EFC10262, NCT00561470])
      according to side effects prevention and management guidelines.

      Secondary Objective:

      To document the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of aflibercept in this participant
      population.

      Each participant was treated until disease progression (DP), unacceptable toxicity, death,
      Investigator's decision or participant's refusal for further treatment (whichever come
      first). Participants were followed-up during treatment and for at least 30 days after its
      last study treatment (either Aflibercept or FOLFIRI) administration, up to a maximum of 6
      months.

    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period. On-treatment period was defined as the time from the first dose of treatment to 30 days after the last dose of treatment (either Aflibercept or FOLFIRI). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose at Baseline, Day 1 of every odd cycle; and at end of treatment (30 days after last study treatment) (maximum exposure: 99 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions for evaluation of new chemotherapy and provides an assessment of participant reported outcome dimensions. First 28 questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all,2=a little,3=quite a bit,4=very much) for evaluating 5 functional scales (physical,role,emotional,cognitive,social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue,nausea/vomiting,pain) &amp; other single items. For each item,high score represented high level of symptomatology/problem. Last 2 questions represented participant's assessment of overall health &amp; quality of life, coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). EORTC QLQ-C30 observed values and change from baseline for global health status (scoring of questions 29 &amp; 30) and 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales and other single items (scoring of questions 1 to 28). Answers were converted into grading scale, with values between 0 and 100. A high score represented a favorable outcome with a best quality of life for participant.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HRQL European-Quality of Life-5 Dimension Instrument-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose at Baseline, Day 1 of every odd cycle; and at end of treatment (30 days after last study treatment) (maximum exposure: 99 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D was a standardized HRQL questionnaire consisting of EQ-5D descriptive system and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression measured on 3 levels (no problem, some problems &amp; severe problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. 5 dimensional 3-level system was converted into single index utility score. Possible values for single index utility score ranged from -0.594 (severe problems in all dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in all dimensions) on scale where 1 represented best possible health state.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose at Baseline, Day 1 of every odd cycle; and at end of treatment (30 days after last study treatment) (maximum exposure: 99 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D VAS was used to record a participant's rating for his/her current health-related quality of life state and captured on a vertical VAS (0-100), where 0 = worst imaginable health state and 100 = best imaginable health state. Baseline corresponded to last evaluable assessment before treatment administration.</description>

        <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period. On-treatment period was defined as the time from the first dose of treatment to 30 days after the last dose of treatment (either Aflibercept or FOLFIRI). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

        <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions for evaluation of new chemotherapy and provides an assessment of participant reported outcome dimensions. First 28 questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all,2=a little,3=quite a bit,4=very much) for evaluating 5 functional scales (physical,role,emotional,cognitive,social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue,nausea/vomiting,pain) &amp; other single items. For each item,high score represented high level of symptomatology/problem. Last 2 questions represented participant’s assessment of overall health &amp; quality of life, coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). EORTC QLQ-C30 observed values and change from baseline for global health status (scoring of questions 29 &amp; 30) and 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales and other single items (scoring of questions 1 to 28). Answers were converted into grading scale, with values between 0 and 100. A high score represented a favorable outcome with a best quality of life for participant.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D was a standardized HRQL questionnaire consisting of EQ-5D descriptive system and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). EQ-5D descriptive system comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression measured on 3 levels (no problem, some problems &amp; severe problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. 5 dimensional 3-level system was converted into single index utility score. Possible values for single index utility score ranged from -0.594 (severe problems in all dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in all dimensions) on scale where 1 represented best possible health state.</description>
