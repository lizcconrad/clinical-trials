  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of this study is to characterize the ability of dark chocolate enriched in
      epicatechin (a component of dark chocolate) to improve the structural and functional features
      of mitochondria in two groups

        1. Patients with heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes (DM2) and

        2. Normal yet sedentary individuals with impaired baseline exercise capacity (as assessed
           by VO2 max)

      We propose that a 3 month treatment with dark chocolate will lead to a significant
      improvement in exercise capacity which will be secondary to the improvement in skeletal
      muscle structure from epicatechin.

    <textblock>
      The flavanol epicatechin (which is derived from cocoa and has no known toxicity in humans)
      has been shown in clinical trials to increase levels of nitric oxide (NO) as assessed by
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the brachial artery and measurements of circulating NO in
      plasma. NO is thought to be an activator of PGC-1 alpha [PPAR (peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor) alpha coactivator 1] which stimulates mitochondrial
      biogenesis. In both patients with heart failure and diabetes there is nitric oxide deficiency
      and mitochondrial dysfunction. In our proposed double-blinded placebo controlled clinical
      trial, we will test the hypothesis that chronic administration of epicatechin to patients
      with both heart failure and diabetes will increase levels of NO and PGC-1 alpha leading to
      increased mitochondrial biogenesis and improved mitochondrial function. We believe similar
      changes will occur in sedentary individuals.

      In a preliminary study with 5 patients with heart failure and diabetes (conducted under UCSD
      IRB protocol number #090688) we have shown that epicatechin enriched dark chocolate improves
      mitochondrial structure (Taub PR, Ramirez-Sanchez I, Ciaraldi TP, et al. Alterations in
      Skeletal Muscle Indicators of Mitochondrial Structure and Biogenesis in Patients with Type 2
      Diabetes and Heart Failure: Effects of Epicatechin Rich Cocoa. Clin Transl Sci.
