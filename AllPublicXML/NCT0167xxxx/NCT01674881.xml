  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent epidemiologic survey has indicated that approx. 42% of Danish women treated for
      breast cancer experience negative sequelae in the form of pain following treatment. Chronic
      pain is known to be associated with impaired social and emotional functioning, and thus
      presents a particular concern.

      Mindfulness-based intervention is among the complementary, psychological treatments, which
      cancer patients commonly seek out in relation to the course of their illness. Despite the
      popularity of mindfulness-based intervention among cancer patients, no studies have so far
      investigated the effect of mindfulness-based intervention on chronic pain in breast cancer
      patients. While no studies so far have focused on pain, there is evidence to suggest that
      mindfulness-based intervention is associated with improved psychosocial adaption to cancer.
      Furthermore, non-cancer research suggests that mindfulness-based intervention is associated
      with reduced pain experiences.

      The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy
      (MBCT) on chronic pain in breast cancer patients. Women who have completed their treatment
      for breast cancer and who experience chronic pain, will be randomized to an intervention
      group (MBCT) or a treatment-as-usual control group. All participants will be assessed at the
      same time points, i.e. before the intervention (baseline), and three times after the
      intervention/control condition, with the last follow-up 6 months after the intervention. In
      addition, a number of potential moderators and mediators of the outcome will be explored. For
      example, recent studies indicate that adult attachment style may constitute an important
      moderator and/or mediator in the development of pain, and preliminary research has suggested
      that attachment style may moderate the effect of mindfulness-based intervention.

      The results will provide valuable new knowledge about the potential of MBCT as a treatment
      strategy for chronic pain in breast cancer patients, will contribute to the clarification of
      underlying mechanisms in the experience of and coping with pain, which could help the
      development of more effective, individualized interventions.
