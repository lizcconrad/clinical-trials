      Wound Drains after Thyroid- and Parathyroid Surgery Impact on Postoperative Nausea and
      Vomiting (PONV)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common after thyroid surgery. Many patients
      describe PONV as more irritant in the postoperative course than the endured pain.
      Postoperative drains are put after thyroid surgery to early recognize bleeding and to collect
      wound secretion to avoid pressure on the trachea. Whether wound drains do impact on PONV is
      not known. Therefore, we tested the impact of wound drains on PONV after thyroid- and
      parathyroid surgery in a randomized controlled clinical trial.

    <time_frame>24 hours post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The development of postoperative nausea was determined using a standard visual analogue scale (VAS) with range of 0 to 10. 0 indicated no nausea, 10 indicated very severe nausea. The patients indicated their felt degree of nausea a number between 0 to 10.</description>

    <measure>Antiemetic therapy post surgery in patients with and without postoperative drainage</measure>
    <time_frame>after 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>In the postoperative course, we counted the amount of anti-emetic interventions for patients post surgery over the first 48 hours. The givage of anti-emetic drugs was based on a prior determined protocol, that was strictly followed.
The protocol was as follows for antiemetic drugs:
First line Drug: Tropisetron 2 mg i.v. when patient is vomiting, max. twice a day. Second line therapy: Haloperidol 0.5 mg i.v. with a maximum of 3 mg every 24 hours, when first line therapy is not sufficient. The change to second line therapy is controlled by the study physician.</description>
