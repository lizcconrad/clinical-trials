  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility affects approximately one in six couples1. In approximately one third of cases,
      there is no cause found as to why a couple are unable to conceive2. In order for natural
      pregnancy to occur, sperm must pass through the cervix (neck of the womb) and swim to the
      woman's Fallopian tubes so that fertilisation of one of the woman's eggs can occur. It is
      known that mid-cycle mucus at the cervix is essential for sperm to gain access to the uterus
      and tubes.

      There is evidence that the composition of this mucus in women may affect fertility but this
      area has not been studied well in recent years, partly because fertility treatments such as
      IVF bypass the cervix.

      Research in sheep and cows in UCD has shown interesting differences in the cervical mucus of
      fertile and infertile animals. It appears that the mucus not only helps sperm to get to the
      uterus but may also help the sperm to mature and be ready to fertilise an egg. This mucus may
      also help prevent bacteria and infection reaching the womb.

      In conjunction with colleagues in UCD, under the leadership of Professor S Carrington, the
      investigators would like to investigate some of the properties of human cervical mucus.The
      investigators propose to do this by taking samples of cervical mucus around the time of
      ovulation and also approximately one week later in fertile women and sub-fertile women. Then
      to monitor ovulation with an ultrasound scan (follicle tracking) of the woman's ovaries and
      urinary ovulation kits and take blood for oestrogen, progesterone, LH and FSH levels.

      The investigators wish to determine if there are differences between the mucus of these women
      and how it may impact on sperm function and on fertility.

      This study will investigate functional, biochemical and molecular properties of cervical
      mucus at various times of the menstrual cycle in fertile and sub-fertile women. The
      investigators would aim to also investigate the interaction of cervical mucus with sperm and
      capacitation and to investigate the impact cervical surgery and differing diagnoses of
      sub-fertility have on cervical mucus.

      Study aims:

        1. To determine the functional, biochemical and molecular properties of cervical mucus
           through out the menstrual cycle in fertile women.

        2. To determine if there is a difference in these properties of cervical mucus in fertile
           and sub-fertile women.

        3. To determine whether these properties are influenced by the sub-fertility diagnostic
           group eg unexplained, endometriosis, tubal factor, sperm factor.

        4. To examine the interaction between cervical mucus and sperm in women with normal
           fertility and sub-fertility.

        5. To examine the impact of cervical surgery on cervical mucus functional, biochemical and
           molecular properties and sperm interaction.
