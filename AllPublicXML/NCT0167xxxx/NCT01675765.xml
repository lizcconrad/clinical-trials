  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and immune response of the sequential
      administration cancer vaccine CRS-207 (with or without cyclophosphamide) followed by standard
      of care chemotherapy (pemetrexed and cisplatin). CRS-207 is a weakened (attenuated) form of
      Listeria monocytogenes that has been genetically-modified to reduce its capacity to cause
      disease, while maintaining its ability to stimulate potent immune responses. CRS-207 has been
      engineered to elicit an immune response against the tumor-associated antigen mesothelin,
      which has been shown to be present at higher levels on certain tumor cells (such as
      mesothelioma) than on normal cells. Pemetrexed and cisplatin are the standard chemotherapy
      regimen to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma. This trial will evaluate whether giving
      CRS-207 cancer vaccine with chemotherapy will induce anti-tumor immune responses and/or
      objective tumor response.

  <detailed_description>

      Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Eligible subjects will receive 2 prime
      vaccinations of CRS-207 (1×10^9 colony-forming units [CFU] given intravenously [i.v.] over 2
      hours) (with or without cyclophosphamide) 2 weeks apart followed 2 weeks later by up to 6
      cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin 21 days apart. Three weeks after completion of
      chemotherapy, subjects will receive an additional 2 infusions (boost vaccinations) of CRS-207
      3 weeks apart. Subjects will be followed every 8 weeks until disease progression by
      immune-related response criteria. Subjects who continue to meet dosing eligibility may
      receive additional CRS-207 (with or without cyclophosphamide) infusions (maintenance
      vaccinations) at each follow-up visit.

      Study assessments include blood draws for safety and immune response monitoring and CT scans
      [with optional fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)] or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor disease status. In addition, optional tumor biopsies may
      be performed before, during and after treatment.
