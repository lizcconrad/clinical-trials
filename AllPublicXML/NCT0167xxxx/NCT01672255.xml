  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a cornerstone of diabetes management. It helps reduce blood pressure, promote
      weight loss, lower insulin resistance and improve glucose and lipid (triglyceride and
      HDL-cholesterol) profiles. Unfortunately, the benefits of exercise are often not embraced by
      diabetic individuals because of the fear of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). My laboratory has
      demonstrated that Autonomic nervous system (ANS) counterregulatory failure plays an important
      role in exercise associated hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM. ANS responses are significantly
      reduced in Type 1 DM and are further blunted by antecedent episodes of hypoglycemia.
      Furthermore, there is a large sexual dimorphism of reduced ANS responses during submaximal
      exercise in both Type 1 DM and healthy individuals that is unexplained. Accumulating data are
      demonstrating that serotonergic pathways can regulate ANS discharge. Generally, serotonergic
      pathways are inhibitory but both single and longer term administration of selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) such as Prozac has been demonstrated to increase basal
      epinephrine levels and enhance baroreflex control of Sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
      activity. What is unknown is whether fluoxetine can also enhance SNS responses and also
      override the large ANS sexual dimorphism present during sub maximal exercise. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to determine if the SSRI fluoxetine (Prozac) can improve SNS
      responses during exercise.
