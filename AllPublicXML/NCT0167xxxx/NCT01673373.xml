  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test how well the iCAST™ RX Stent works in patients diagnosed
      with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and whether or not increased blood flow by the
      stent will help to control blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial that will take place at up to
      25 US/ Outside US (OUS) sites. Primary endpoints have been determined to show the safety,
      effectiveness, and clinical outcomes of the iCAST™ RX Stent System. Safety and effectiveness
      will be evaluated based on the primary patency rate at 9-months on a per lesion basis
      evaluated against a performance goal of published studies with bare-metal stents. The primary
      clinical endpoint will assess the improvement in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) at 9-months as
      compared to baseline Systolic Blood Pressure.

      Eligible subjects will undergo a two-week Medical Documentation Screening period to confirm
      resistant hypertension (SBP ≥ 155mmHg) while on maximum tolerable doses of ≥ three
      anti-hypertensive medications from at least three distinct classes of drugs, one of which
      must be a diuretic.

      There must be documented clinical evidence to support likelihood of angiographic findings &gt;
      80% whether it is Duplex Ultrasound (DUS), Computed Tomography angiogram (CTa), Magnetic
      Resonance angiogram (MRa) or other medical evidence. After meeting screening and clinical
      eligibility criteria, subjects will undergo a baseline assessment for angiographic
      eligibility. After angiographic documentation of a ≥ 80% renal artery stenosis or Fraction
      Flow Reserve (FFR) &lt; 0.8 is confirmed, the subject may be enrolled in the trial by placement
      of the investigational device.

      The 9-month visit will include a follow-up DUS of the target renal artery. If the DUS is
      non-diagnostic due to an imaging problem, such as overlying bowel gas or body habitus, a
      second DUS may be attempted. If the DUS is indicative of ≥ 60% stenosis as determined by the
      core laboratory, or the second DUS remains non-diagnostic, a contrast angiogram will be used
      to assess the degree of restenosis of the covered stent(s).

      Clinical follow-up visits will be required for all enrolled subjects at 30-days, 9-months,
      12-months, 24-months, and 36-months. A 6-month and 18-month visit will occur via telephone to
      collect medication usage and Adverse Events (AEs) only. The 36-month clinic office visit will
      be required as the final safety visit.

        General Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 at the time of informed consent.

          2. Subject or subject's legal representative have been informed of the nature of the
             trial, agrees to participate, and has signed an Institutional Review Board
             (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          3. Subjects that have bilateral kidneys or a solitary functioning kidney with Renal
             Artery Stenosis in at least one kidney and an average Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≥
             155mmHg.

          4. Subject has a history of maximum tolerable dose of ≥ 3 anti-hypertensive medications
             of different classes, one of which must be a diuretic (for at least two weeks prior to
             Medical Documentation Screening period).

             a. A documented history for a minimum of 3 months showing reasonable and aggressive
             efforts to manage hypertension prior to consent. This must include the use of a broad
             variety of medications that have been used and failed or not tolerated.

          5. Subject must have documented clinical evidence to support likelihood of angiographic
             findings &gt; 80% whether it is DUS, CTa, MRa or other medical evidence.

          6. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, II, or III the time of trial enrollment.

        NOTE: When a subject has bilateral Renal Artery Stenosis both of which require stenting, it
        is recommended to treat both kidneys with an iCAST™ RX Stent System during the index
        procedure. In the event that a subject needs a renal stenting procedure staged for renal
        protection, it is important that the Investigator treats the second renal artery with an
        iCAST™ RX Stent System after 30 days of the index procedure. If subjects with bilateral
        stenosis have only one lesion that meets protocol inclusion criteria that lesion should be
        treated per protocol. The recommendation is to NOT treat the second non-qualifying lesion,
        however if the operator feels strongly it is indicated, then they should treat per standard
        of care after 30-days post index procedure in order to comply with exclusion criteria #10.

        Subjects with flash pulmonary edema are allowed into the trial should they meet all other
        Inclusion and Exclusion criteria.

             iii. Measured translesional peak pressure gradient of &gt; 21mmHg after induced hyperemia
             via dopamine or papaverine using a 4Fr or less catheter or pressure wire.
