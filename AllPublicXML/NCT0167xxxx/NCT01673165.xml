  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of fortified skimmed mother's milk is a
      safe alternative to specialized formula in the treatment of chylothorax following
      cardiothoracic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A chylothorax is a collection of fluid around the lungs that can occur after cardiac surgery.
      The fluid contains chyle, a milky fluid consisting of fat droplets. The standard treatment is
      to feed an infant with a specialized low fat formula for up to 6 weeks until the chest has
      time to heal. This formula is generally not well tolerated and mother's of our patients have
      expressed a desire to continue using breast milk. A few case reports have been published, but
      there have not been any studies to date looking at this. Data will be collected to include
      information about nutrition, weight gain, teaching needs, surgical, hospital, and discharge
      information.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the time to resolution of chylothorax of infants receiving skimmed mother's milk versus specialized formula.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Fluid around the lungs is assessed by chest radiographs (x-rays) as per our usual standard of care. Cloudy fluid will be sent for analysis (chylomicrons, cell count, lymphocytes, and triglycerides) to confirm the diagnosis. The date of diagnosis, the date of chest tube removal, and the date of resolution of effusion by chest xrays</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the recurrence rate of chylous effusion in infants receiving skimmed mother's milk versus specialized formula.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 months after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>All patients receive a standard chest x-ray prior to discharge from the hospital and again in two weeks at their follow up appointment. If symptoms of respiratory difficulty occur prior to or following this time, additional chest x-rays may be obtained based on exam findings and clinical judgment. The date of recurrence of effusion will be recorded as will the date of chest tube insertion if required.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the technique of skimming and fortifying breast milk</measure>
    <time_frame>the first 30 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The skimming technique will be taught to participating mothers and nurses caring for their infants. A sample of the skim milk will be analyzed by a creamatocrit for fat and caloric content.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare feeding tolerance, growth, and nutrition in infants who receive fortified skimmed mother's milk versus specialized formula</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feeding symptoms observed by clinical staff and parents will be recorded. Parents will complete a questionnaire and score symptoms based on severity. Infants will be monitored as per our usual standard of care with weights, length measurements, and monitoring intake to ensure adequate growth</description>
