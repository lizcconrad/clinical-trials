    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well eribulin mesylate works in treating patients with
      advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the activity of eribulin (eribulin mesylate) in the management of advanced or
      recurrent cervical cancer (progression-free survival [PFS].

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profile of eribulin in patients with advanced or recurrent
      cervical cancer.

      II. To estimate the survival of patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer treated
      with eribulin.

      III. To evaluate potential correlative studies as predictive or prognostic makers in this
      patient population (glucose-regulated protein 78 [GRP78] levels in tissue and blood, tumor
      protein p53 [p53] expression, apoptosis with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
      end labeling [TUNEL] assay, apoptosis-related proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl-2] and
      Bcl2-associated X protein [Bax] using immunohistochemistry [IHC], proliferation with Ki-67
      IHC, and expression levels of microtubule-associated variables, including tau protein, total
      alpha- and beta-tubulin, and classes II-IV beta-tubulin isotopes with IHC.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) bolus over 2-5
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
