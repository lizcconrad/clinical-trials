      Introduction

      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the Western world. The main cause for
      cardiovascular events is the development of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. In more
      than 70% of cases, myocardial infarctions are caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which
      results in subsequent formation of an occluding thrombus. Plaques that have a high risk of
      rupture are called vulnerable plaques. Cardiovascular imaging provides a complementary
      diagnostic approach in the assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients. However, the lack
      of biological detection possibilities of current imaging technologies limits their predictive
      value. For instance, multi detector computed tomography (MDCT) is an excellent tool to
      visualize coronary atherosclerosis. However, individual risk assessment is still problematic.
      Which of the diagnosed atherosclerotic plaques will undergo plaque rupture and lead to acute
      vascular events is currently hard to predict. Potentially, serum biomarkers could help
      identify the patient at risk. A wide variety of prognostic markers related to atherosclerosis
      have been identified in the past to predict for cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, their
      predictive value in individual patients is still limited. A difficulty in serum biomarker
      research is the requirement of large patient cohorts to study the relation between event rate
      and serum biomarker levels. The necessity to perform lengthy and costly studies, hinders the
      translation of novel cardiovascular serum biomarkers into the clinic. An alternative approach
      could be to study the correlation between levels of serum biomarkers and the presence of
      atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries.

      Study objectives

      Primary objective of the present analysis is to investigate the predictive value of a variety
      of serum biomarkers to predict atherosclerosis in the coronary tree of patients undergoing
      cardiac MDCT.

      Design and Methods

      Patients undergoing cardiac MDCT are eligible for the study. Excluded are patients with acute
      coronary syndrome, hemodynamic instability, pregnancy, severe renal insufficiency, allergy
      for contrast medium and inability to obtain informed consent. Permission to store the serum
      samples for future analysis of new prognostic markers for cardiovascular events will be
      acquired from the patients. Written information is send to the patient at least 1 week prior
      to CT. The samples will be stored coded, at the Biobank Maastricht, for a maximum duration of
      15 years. Once measurements from the samples will be performed, the serum samples will be
      sent by the Biobank coded to the analyzing researchers, which have no access to the key file
      where codes are linked to the specific hospital identity number. This file will be stored by
      an independent researcher at the Cardiology department of the Maastricht University Medical
      Center. The assessment of atherosclerotic burden of the coronary tree will be performed by
      cardiac MDCT specialists blinded to the clinical data and serum biomarker outcome. Biomarker
      levels are correlated to the severity and amount of coronary artery disease as assessed by
      cardiac MDCT.
