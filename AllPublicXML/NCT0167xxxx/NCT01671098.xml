  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sinonasal gas exchange is facilitated by the unique anatomy and topography of the sinonasal
      interface that represents a collection of airfoils creating an aerodynamic structure. The
      airflow during respiration generates positive and negative pressures that power the gas
      exchange between the sinuses and the nose. Major surgical alteration of the interface reduces
      the rate and velocity of the exchange. Minimally invasive procedures aimed at preserving the
      natural anatomy, topography and aerodynamic configuration of the interface will have
      negligible effects on sinonasal gas exchange.
