  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients are increasingly admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. Short-term outcome
      (e.g. hospital survival) of an ICU stay is improving in this population but little data have
      been published on long-term outcome. Beyond survival, outcome assessment in the elderly
      requires to evaluate several aspects of health: mental status, activity of daily living,
      pain, depression, frailtyâ€¦ referred by geriatrician as &quot;comprehensive geriatric assessment'
      (CGA).

      The purpose of the SENIOREA study is to evaluate one year outcome of elderly patients
      mechanically ventilated in the ICU by performing CGA one year after ICU admission. CGA will
      be performed on the patients' site of living.

      This prospective multicentric trial will be conducted over 8 medico-surgical ICUs.
