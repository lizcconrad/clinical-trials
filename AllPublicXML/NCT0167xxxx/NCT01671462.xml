      The purpose of the study is to compare the results of the Becton Dickinson (BD) Human
      Papilloma Virus (HPV) Assay on the Viper LT instrument from SurePath media diluted in HPV
      diluent (pre-quot and/or residual), PreservCyt media diluted in HPV diluent (pre-quot and/or
      residual) and a BD cervical brush in BD transport medium to reference histology results from
      biopsy.

      This is a multicenter study consisting of 2-3 European clinical trial sites, and up to 2 BD
      Viper LT Systems.

      The BD HPV Diluent tube will be run on the BD HPV assay with the Viper LT instrument and
      compared to histology, Digene hybrid capture 2 (HC2), and Roche LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping
      Test results.
