  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune response at primary tumor has a major role in the prognosis of colorectal cancer
      (CRC). Some studies suggest a prognosis value of cytotoxic T cell and memory T cells at
      primary tumor greater than tumoral stage. There is no work in the literature that has
      examined the prognosis value of the immune response in liver metastases. To study immune
      cells (histology) and inflammatory response (cytokines) in liver metastases is a challenge to
      understand the effectiveness of chemotherapy used in this situation.

      The chemotherapy used in liver metastases of colorectal cancer also have effects on
      non-tumoral liver tumor and therefore can interfere with postoperative complications of
      hepatic resection. Sinusoidal dilatation is present in 20% to 80% of patients who received
      oxaliplatin before hepatectomy. Steatosis is frequently observed after administration of 5-FU
      alone or in combination with irinotecan. This steatosis may also be accompanied by
      inflammatory lesions (steatohepatitis), especially after administration of oxaliplatin or
      irinotecan and is associated with increased postoperative mortality. The hepatic toxicity of
      new biological agents is not well known (cetuximab and bevacizumab). The mechanisms of
      chemotherapy-induced toxicities are currently unknown. The main objective is to analyze the
      profile of the immune response in liver metastases of CRC and find the link with the
      radiological response. Measurements will be made by quantitative RT-PCR on frozen liver
      biopsies. Secondary objective is to seek a correlation between the histological lesions
      induced by chemotherapy and non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis. The secondary endpoints
      are rate of immune cells, histologic response (percentage of tumor necrosis), disease-free
      survival, the non-invasive test of fibrosis, the chemotherapy-induced liver injury, cytokines
      and circulating angiogenic factors.
