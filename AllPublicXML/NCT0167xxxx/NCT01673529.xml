      This study is a two part, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to investigate
      the effects of topical doses of SB705498 on capsaicin, histamine, and cowhage responses in
      healthy volunteers. Part A has been designed to establish whether the topical formulation is
      capable of delivering SB705498 to the proposed site of action, and to select an appropriate
      dose for Part B. Part B will examine the effects of SB705498 on pruritus initiated by a
      histaminergic and a non-histaminergic pathway, using two different challenge agents;
      histamine and cowhage. This may provide important information about the role of TRPV1 in
      pruritus and the therapeutic potential of SB705498.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy Caucasian volunteers aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at time of
             signing the informed consent. Healthy subjects are defined as individuals who are not
             taking any regular medication and are free from clinically significant illness or
             disease as determined by their medical history (including family history), physical
             examination, 12-lead ECG, laboratory studies, and other tests specified in this
             protocol.

          -  Subject has the ability to read, comprehend, and record information required by
             protocol, and is willing and able to provide signed and dated written informed consent
             prior to study participation, including compliance with the requirements and
             restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Non smoker who has not smoked or used nicotine containing products for a minimum
             period of 6 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Subject must score greater than 40 on a COVAS scale of 0-100 for itch induced by both
             cowhage and histamine at screening and show a flare response with capsaicin measured
             by LDI scan.

          -  Is willing to avoid UV exposure. i.e. use of Sun beds and sunbathing for 7 days prior
             to screening, throughout the study and and until a week after the last dose. Subjects
             who require treatment with photosensitizing drugs (e.g, tetracycline, thiazides,
             fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, or sulfonamides) will withdrawn. Subjects must also
             be willing to use sunscreen of SPF30 or above on the volar surface of the forearms for
             a week after the last dose.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40
             MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 147 pmol/L) is confirmatory].
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt
             will be required to use one of the contraception methods in the protocol if they wish
             to continue their HRT during the study.

        Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status prior
        to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
        cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of
        HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
        during the study without use of a contraceptive method.]; Child-bearing potential and
        agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol. Female subjects
        willing to participate in the study must agree to use contraception from the screening
        visit until 15 days post-last treatment administration.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. For male subjects willing to participate in the study this criterion must be
             followed from the time of the screening visit until 15 days post-last treatment

          -  BMI within the range 19.0 - 32.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  AST and ALT less than 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than and equal to
             1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin greater than 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin.

          -  QTcB or QTcF less than 450 msec. Note that if the initial QTc value is prolonged, the
             ECG should be repeated two more times (with 5 minutes between ECG readings) and the
             average of the three QTc values used to determine eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Suffers from skin infection or inflammation of the forearm, or has other arm skin
             irregularities that may in the opinion of the investigator interfere with study

          -  The subject suffers from eczema, psoriasis or any other acute or chronic
             dermatological problem if, in the opinion of the investigator this is likely to
