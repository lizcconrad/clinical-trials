  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increased body mass impairs vascular function (VF), an important characteristic of
      subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes and a risk marker for cardiovascular diseases.
      However, a wide variety of in vivo VF markers exists each measuring different aspects of VF.
      Each of these markers addresses a different aspect of the vasculature. Studies comparing
      under standardized conditions the differences and relationships of the many different VF
      measurements in lean and abdominally overweight / obese subjects are missing. Also, there is
      a great need to know which of these markers are sensitive to dietary challenges.

      Therefore, it is imperative to conduct an extensive study on dietary effects and
      interrelationships of a broad spectrum of VF measurements and plasma biomarkers in lean and
      overweight / obese subjects. Focus will be on FMD, a well accepted biomarker for
      cardiovascular disease. The investigators propose to examine, in a two-way
      parallel-randomized human intervention study, the effects of weight-loss in abdominally
      overweight / obese men on VF markers and plasma biomarkers related to low-grade inflammation
      and vascular activity during the fasting and both the postprandial and hyperinsulinemic
      state. Furthermore, differences - and relations between - VF measurements and plasma
      biomarkers will be compared cross-sectionally between lean and abdominally overweight / obese
      male subjects.
