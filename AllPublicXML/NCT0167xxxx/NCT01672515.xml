  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the three leading causes of human death, and a major cause of adult
      disability. Our pre-clinical studies confirmed that ischemic preconditioning can prevent
      cerebral infarction. Animal studies confirmed that ischemic postconditioning can reduce
      infarct size of cerebral infarction. Investigators hypothesized that postconditioning would
      reduce infarct volume of ischemic stroke patients.

      This study explored the neuroprotective effects of post-positioning on ischemic stroke
      patients with randomized, double-blinded and controlled method. Patients are divided into
      experimental and placebo groups to receive remote ischemic post-conditioning for 30 days.
      Remote ischemic post-conditioning is performed by the inflating tourniquets to certain
      extents on bilateral arms with 5 cycles of 5min inflation and 5min relax alternation for the
      total of 30 consecutive days. It is 200mmHg for RIPC group and 60mmHg for control group.
      Evaluation parameters include CRP, TNF-α, ICAM-1 and GFAP in blood at 0, 3, 7, 15 and 30 days
      after treatment; and MRI at 0 and 30 days after treatment.
