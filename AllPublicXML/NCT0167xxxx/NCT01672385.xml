    <textblock>
      Background: Older hospitalized adults frequently experience preventable short-term
      readmissions due to inadequate transition support. Although proactive telephone follow-up
      improves transition outcomes, these services often are unsystematic and of low intensity.
      Informal caregivers are invaluable for ensuring successful transitions, but many patients
      live alone, have an in-home caregiver who is struggling with competing demands, or live at a
      distance from adult children or other potential sources of support. New models are needed for
      transition support that include low-cost technologies and more structured assistance for
      patients' informal caregiving network, while providing patients' clinical teams with the
      information they need to avert health crises.

      Objectives: Consistent with NIA's goals to improve transition outcomes, we will evaluate a
      novel intervention designed to improve the effectiveness of transition support for older
      adults with common chronic conditions via three mechanisms of action: (a) direct tailored
      communication to patients via regular automated calls post discharge, (b) support for
      informal caregivers living outside of the patient's household via structured feedback about
      the patient's status and advice about how they can help, and (c) support for proactive care
      management including a web-based disease management tool, automated alerts about potential
      problems, and the capacity for asynchronous communication with patients and their caregivers.
      Specifically, the trial will determine: 1) whether the CarePartner intervention improves
      patients' readmission risk and functional status; 2) the impact of the intervention on
      patients' self-care behaviors and the quality of the transition process; and 3) whether the
      intervention improves caregiver burden and stress levels.

      Methods: 846 older adults with complex chronic conditions will be identified upon admission
      to two community-based acute care medical services. Patients will be asked to identify a
      CarePartner (CP) living outside their household, i.e., an adult child or other social network
      member willing to play an active role in their transition support and organizing their
      broader network of informal caregivers. Patients will be randomized to the intervention or
      usual care. Intervention patients will receive automated assessment and behavior change
      calls, and their CPs will receive structured feedback and advice following each assessment.
      Patients' clinical team will have access to patients' assessment results via the web, will
      receive automated reports about urgent health problems, and will be able to communicate
      asynchronously with patients and CPs using a secure web page and a specially designed
      voicemail service. Patients will complete surveys at baseline, 30- and 90- days post
      discharge; utilization data will be obtained from hospital records. CPs, other caregivers,
      and clinicians will be interviewed to evaluate intervention effects on processes of self-care
      support, caregiver stress and communication, and the intervention's potential for broader
      implementation. The primary outcomes will be 30 day readmission rates; 2ndary outcomes
      measured at 30 and 90 days include functional status, self-care behaviors, and mortality
      risk.
