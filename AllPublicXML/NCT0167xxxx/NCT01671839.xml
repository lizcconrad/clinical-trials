    <measure>Mean Change in Cellulite Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Achievement of ≥1 point mean reduction in the 0-5 point Cellulite Severity Scale as determined by independent physician assessment of subject photographs taken before and 3 years after treatment. Cellulite severity was graded on a 0 (no cellulite) to 5 (severe cellulite) for each subject photograph taken at baseline (before treatment) and 1 year after treatment by an independent and blinded physician panel. The primary endpoint was achievement of a mean post-treatment severity at 1-year for the study population which was a minimum of 1 point lower than the baseline severity. Paired t-test test with a critical 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 was carried out on the mean Cellulite Severity Scale (0-5) change between 3 year and baseline visits.</description>

    <description>Improvement in subject's cellulite appearance according to a Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) evaluated by independent and blinded physician panel assessment of subject photographs taken before and 1 year after treatment. Change in the cellulite severity was rated according to 5 measures:
Very much improved: Optimal cosmetic result in the treated areas for this subject
Much improved: Marked or significant improvement in appearance of the treated areas from the initial condition
Improved: Noticeable improvement in appearance of the treated areas from the initial condition but more subtle in magnitude
No Change: The appearance of the treated areas is essentially the same as the original condition
Worse: The appearance of the treated areas is worse than the original condition</description>
