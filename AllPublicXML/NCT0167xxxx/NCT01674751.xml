  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a novel approach to
      improve food choices by employees about what to eat for lunch. The intervention involves the
      testing of an on-line pre-ordering food program with nutritional information linked to a
      hospital cafeteria. In this study, the investigators use positive reinforcement of feedback
      and price discounts during the intervention phase, and then withdraw those components in
      order to assess the potential for changes to be retained after the study is over.

      The study draws on principles from the field of behavioral economics and behavioral change.
      The investigators test the effectiveness of the intervention with 30 employees (study
      participants) who are overweight or obese. Based on a recent screening of over 5600 Einstein
      employees, 66% of those screened were identified as either overweight or obese. There are 3
      phases to the trial: baseline (P1), 4 week intervention, (P2) and tapering (intervention
      without reinforcement) (P3). Participants are randomized to one of two groups (intervention
      and wait-listed controls).

      Our primary hypotheses are that:

        1. Participants will purchase lunches with fewer calories during the intervention compared
           to baseline.

        2. Participants will purchases lunches with fewer calories in the tapering phase compared
           to baseline.

      Secondary hypotheses include that, compared with baseline, participants will order lunches
      with less fat. Changes in participant weight based on self selected goals, and in a measure
      of mindful eating will also be investigated. The investigators expect that participant
      adherence will be associated with improved outcomes compared to those who are less adherent.

    <description>During the 4 week intervention phase, participants use the pre-ordering program, receive a novel, &quot;smart receipt&quot; upon checkout that will detail the caloric and fat content of what they ordered, and receive price discounts for select low calorie and low fat items. The pre-ordering system is designed to provide the opportunity for the individual to see what is available along with nutritional information and to make a selection ahead of time.</description>
