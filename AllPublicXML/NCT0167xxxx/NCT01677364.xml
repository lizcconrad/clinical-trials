  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty pregnant patients with acquired and congenital heart disease between 38-41 weeks were
      randomised into elective induction and spontaneous labour groups only after bishop score was
      equal to or more than 6.It was concluded that induction of labour with oxytocin is a
      relatively safe procedure in women with low risk heart disease with NYHA class I and II. It
      resulted in a similar caesarean delivery rate and was not associated with more maternal and
      neonatal complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labour was done with oxytocin. An infusion of 30U oxytocin diluted in 500ml
      normal saline was prepared and given through infusion pump at initial rate of 3mU/min.
      Subsequently dose was increased 3mU/min every 45 min till adequate uterine contractions were
      established.

      Epidural analgesia was provided wherever feasible or Injection Morphine 2-5mg was given
      intravenously for pain relief.
