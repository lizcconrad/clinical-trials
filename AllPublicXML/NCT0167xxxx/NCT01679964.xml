      Switching from the ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor component to raltegravir in stable
      HIV-infected adult patients receiving combination therapy will demonstrate improved clinical
      tolerability or lipid profiles with sustained plasma virological response (&lt;50 copies/ml).

      A. Objectives To compare the treatment-emerged AEs and virological suppression after switch
      to raltegravir-based therapy in stable HIV-infected patients who receiving ritonavir-boosted
      protease inhibitor antiretroviral regimen

      Primary endpoints:

      1) The changes in overall incidence and severity of patient-reported clinical adverse events
      (based on &quot;symptom distress module) after switch to raltegravir-based therapy.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. The proportion of patients who are free of &quot;virological failure&quot; at week 48 after switch

        2. The change from baseline in CD4 cell counts at week 48 after switch

        3. The change in quality of life by assess the changes in the domain scores of MOS-HIV
           questionnaire at baseline and different study time points.

        4. The changes in laboratory adverse event, e.g., the mean percent changes from baseline to
           48 weeks in plasma lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDLCholesterol, HDL Cholesterol,
           triglycerides) after switch

        5. The proportion of patients who are free of &quot;treatment failure&quot; at week 48 after switch

      Safety endpoints

        1. Incidence of adverse events

        2. The proportion of patients with treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events and
           laboratory abnormalities
