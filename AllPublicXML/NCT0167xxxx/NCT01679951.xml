    <textblock>
      The purpose of this dose range finding study is to assess the effectiveness, safety and
      tolerability of JNJ-38518168 at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/d compared with placebo in patients
      with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite concomitant methotrexate (MTX) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), multicenter,
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), parallel-group (each group of patients will be
      treated at the same time), dose range finding study of JNJ-38518168 in patients with active
      RA despite concomitant MTX therapy. The study will consist a screening period, a 24-week
      placebo-controlled period and a 4-week follow-up period between the last dose and the last
      visit. The duration of participation in the study for an individual patient will be up to 34
      weeks (including screening). The patients will be assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a
      1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo and JNJ-38518168 (3 mg or 10 mg or 30 mg). Safety assessments and
      evaluations to determine the efficacy of JNJ-38518168 to reduce the signs and symptoms of RA
      will be performed at study visits. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The DAS28 using CRP is a statistically derived index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP, and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst.</description>

Swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) 2. greater than or equal to 50 percentage improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: a. Patient's assessment of pain (VAS) (0-10 cm) b.Patient's Global Assessment of Disease activity (VAS) (0-10 cm) c. Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) (0-10 cm) d.

    <description>According to the ACR/EULAR provisional definition, a patients RA can be defined as being in remission based on either of 2 definitions:
when scores on the tender joint count, swollen joint count, CRP (in mg/dL), and patient global assessment (0-10 scale) are all less than or equal to 1 OR when the score on the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) is less than or equal to 3.3 Analyses based on each definition will be performed.</description>
