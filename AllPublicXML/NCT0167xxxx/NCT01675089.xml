    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether zolendronic acid, a third generation
      bisphosphonate, is effective in preventing bone loss in the first year after kidney
      transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the treatment of osteoporosis in the general population, a number of drugs reduce BMD
      (bone mineral density) loss and the rate of incident fractures. For instance, bisphosphonates
      improve BMD, reduce hip fracture rates and decrease mortality in post-menopausal women.
      Because of lack of data on safety and an increased risk of adverse effects, the use of these
      drugs is controversial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and abnormalities of PTH
      or vitamin D, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 30 ml/min/1.73m² (CKD
      stages 4 and 5) and after transplantation. The efficacy of short and long term bisphosphonate
      treatment after kidney transplantation has been examined; however, histomorphometric and
      fracture rate reduction data are lacking.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether zolendronic acid, a third generation
      bisphosphonate, is effective in preventing bone loss in the first year after kidney
      transplantation.
