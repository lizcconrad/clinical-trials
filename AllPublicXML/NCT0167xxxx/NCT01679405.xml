      of BIBW 2992 added to the standard therapy of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin in chemo-naïve patients
      with advanced and/or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract

    <time_frame>No DLT within 21 days after start of therapy; safety and toxicity assessment from time of signing informed consent up to 30 days after end of therapy. Treatment period: up to eight cycles. 12 months follow-up period.</time_frame>
    <description>In part A the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BIBW 2992 administered continuously to the standard therapy of Gemcitabine / Cisplatin (Gem/Cis) (administered together on day 1 and 8 of a three-week cycle) will be evaluated in a 2 step dose escalation.

    <description>Progression free survival and overall survival curves will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Median progression-free survival time and median overall survival time including the 95% confidence intervals will be determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates, if possible.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from start of treatment to death due to any cause. Time to last observation will be used if a patient has not died and OS for the patient will be considered censored. Estimated time period: up to 76 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Objective response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Objective Response rate is defined as a best response rating of Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) according to Recist 1.1. Estimated time period: up to 76 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate and tumour control rate will be analysed by providing absolute and relative frequencies of the categories.
Best response is defined as the best tumour response (confirmed partial or complete response, stable disease) that is achieved until PD according to Recist 1.1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor control rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumour control rate is defined as a best response rating of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) according to Recist 1.1. Estimated time period: up to 76 weeks</time_frame>

In part B (phase Ib) of this study, the MTD cohort may be expanded up to 7 further patients and one or two additional study centers may be recruited.
During Part B dose adjustments, based on individual patient's tolerability, are possible. A dose increase of BIBW 2992 higher than 40 mg daily per os is not permitted.</description>
