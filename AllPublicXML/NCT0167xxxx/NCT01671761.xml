      Currently, there is no reliable, practical, and non-invasive method for assessing changes in
      electrophysiological activity of the brain associated with brain-related pathologies, e.g.,
      concussion, ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), etc. Event Related Potentials (ERPs),
      which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific
      regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they
      provide both a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent
      temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited.
      However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for
      ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine
      neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition
      methods (BNA) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and
      synchronization.

      The need of objective measures that will help the clinician in its decision making in
      brain-related pathologies is recognized. BNA is a new imaging modality that has been
      developed to fill this gap.
