  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has steadily increased in the United States. This can lead to the
      worsening of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep apnea, coronary artery disease and
      osteoarthritis. The medical management of obesity involves dietary counseling and education,
      behavioral counseling with goal setting, and exercise. Patients with short sleep periods in
      the range of 5 to 7 hours per night are often heavier than normal sleepers even after
      controlling for other factors. We hypothesize that the addition of focused counseling on
      healthy sleeping to counseling on healthy eating (dieting) and healthy exercise can help
      women lose weight.
