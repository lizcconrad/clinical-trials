  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized study. Patients will receive ASP7487
      (OSI-906) in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Phase 1 involves dose escalation
      of the combination, whereas Phase 2 involves the expansion of ASP7487 (OSI-906) combined with
      bortezomib and dexamethasone at the MTD to establish the ORR. This trial will accrue patients
      with relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM - a disease state for which bortezomib is approved to
      treat by the FDA and Health Canada. The combination of ASP7487 (OSI-906) with bortezomib is
      supported by pre-clinical work in MM in which the combination with an IGF1-R inhibitor
      enhances anti-tumor activity of bortezomib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of the study will determine the MTD and DLTs of bortezomib administered
      on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle combined with ASP7487 (OSI-906) dosed twice daily
      orally continuously. The combination of ASP7487 (OSI-906) with bortezomib has not previously
      been tested. The active agent bortezomib will be used during Cycle 1 - 8 at the recommended
      treatment dose of 1.3 mg/m2 days 1, 4, 8 and 11 and Cycles 9+ on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a
      5-week cycle and ASP7487 (OSI-906) will be dose escalated form 75 mg to 150mg utilizing 3+3
      design
