  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of P2202 in patients of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, inadequately controlled with a stable dose of metformin or
      sulfonylurea or both.

    <textblock>
      It is a phase II, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging,
      multi-centre, two-staged, fixed-design study of P2202 in patients of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, inadequately controlled with a stable dose of metformin or sulfonylurea or both.
      This study will consist of accrual in Stage I (n=56/arm, which is 70% of the total sample
      size required), followed by an interim analysis on completion of the treatment period, to aid
      further decisions on accrual and dose selection in Stage II of the study, and completion of
      Stage I.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to non-recruitment, the study is being halted. There are no major safety or tolerability
    concerns in the study conducted so far.

    <description>Safety assessment will be done by eliciting information regarding AEs including evaluation of hypoglycemic events, physical examination, vital signs assessment, 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, markers of HPA axis function, plasma ACTH and free testosterone, plasma rennin and serum aldosterone and self-monitoring of blood glucose profiles.</description>
