      The purpose of this study is to determine whether therapy that has been shown to be
      beneficial for mitochondrial diseases is also beneficial for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)
      patients. This study is a chart review of previous CFS patients who received daily
      conditioning exercise, a high protein diet and nutraceutical therapy (ENT). Prescribed
      nutraceutical supplements included alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, omega-3fatty acids
      (maxDHA), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), plus a multivitamin.

      Twelve CFS male and female patients between the ages of 20-70 years will be recruited to
      participate in this pilot study. Subjects will be eligible to participate if they meet the
      criteria for CFS of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These include
      persistent, unexplained fatigue for at least 6 months, concurrent with four of the following:
      impaired memory/concentration, sore throat, new headaches, unrefreshing sleep, muscle pain,
      multi-joint pain, tender lymph nodes, and post-exertional malaise.

    <textblock>
      The etiology and pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is poorly understood.
      Although therapies have been proposed, none has been particularly effective. A preceding
      viral infection is believed to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in genetically susceptible
      individuals, resulting in overwhelming fatigue, myalgia and brain fuzziness. The purpose of
      this study was to determine whether therapy that has been shown to be beneficial for
      mitochondrial diseases is also beneficial for CFS.

      Patients received daily conditioning exercise, a high protein diet and nutraceutical therapy
      (ENT). Prescribed nutraceutical supplements incldued alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine,
      omega-3fatty acids (maxDHA), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), plus a multivitamin, which were selected
      to enhance mitochondrial function and antioxidant action. Following the institution of ENT,
      patients had received this therapy for varying lengths of time, ranging from 12 to 40 months.

        will be screened for eligibility; the study will be explained and a verbal consent will be
        given over the telephone. If the subject agrees, they will be sent a questionnaire
        assessing their clinical and fatigue status prior to starting ENT and their present
        clinical and fatigue status, as well as their compliance to ENT.
