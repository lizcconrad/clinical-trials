  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue reconstruction in the finger continues to evolve. The dorsum of the finger is a
      reliable flap donor site in reconstructive hand surgery because of its similar quality to the
      original. The dorsal homodigital island flap can be used as a reliable alternative for
      reconstructing small to moderate defects of the fingers. In this retrospective study, the
      investigators would evaluate the efficacy of the technique for tissue reconstruction in
      different regions of the finger, with an emphasis on sensibility, pain and donor site
      morbidity.

      At final follow-up, sensory restoration of the flap is measured using the static 2-point
      discrimination test and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. We evaluate pain sensations of
      the reconstructed fingers and donor sites with a visual analog scale. The system consist of a
      10 cm line that is grouped into mild (0-3 cm), moderate (4-6 cm) and severe (7-10 cm). Active
      motion of the joints is measured using a goniometer. The motion arcs of the reconstructed
      fingers are compared with the opposite side.
