    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the predictive value of a composite of 3 simple
      clinically practical diagnostic tests (Mekhail's test, Patrick's and Thigh thrust) combined
      with a pain referral diagram in predicting response to a single diagnostic SIJ injection.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the predictive value of a composite of 3 simple,
      clinically practical, diagnostic tests (Mekhail, Patrick's and Thigh thrust) combined with a
      pain referral diagram in predicting response to a single diagnostic SIJ injection. The goal
      is to test these 3 tests and compare their predictive value to the 6 tests commonly reported
      in the literature in order to provide a clinician with clinically practical special tests to
      aide in the diagnosis and treatment of SIJ mediated pain. . Specifically, we seek to evaluate
      the prognostic capacity for a series of three clinical tests (Mekhail's Test, thigh thrust
      and Patrick's Test) combined with a pain referral diagram to accurately predict the response
      (change in VAS) of a single diagnostic Sacroiliac joint and extra-capsular joint injection.

    <description>The three diagnostic exercises will be administered in random order to minimize effects of order and period on the results. Enrollment logs and study randomization will be administered electronically via a respective REDCap data modules. The enrollment, randomization and diagnostic tests will be administered by research coordinator or PI. The patients will be independently evaluated and scheduled for SIJ injection by Cleveland Clinic pain clinic staff and fellow pain physicians.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  any patient presenting with low back pain with or without radicular symptoms,
             regardless of prior history of back surgery from 18-90 years old whom after being
