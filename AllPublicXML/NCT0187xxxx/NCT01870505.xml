  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a drug called BYL719 at different dose
      levels. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, BYL719 has on the
      patient and breast cancer. BYL719 will be given with either letrozole or exemestane to
      patients with HR+ locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer. When the recommended phase II
      dose of BYL719 in combination with letrozole or exemestane has been determined in the
      dose-finding phase, an additional 10 patients will be enrolled onto each arm in an expansion
      phase of the study. The purpose of the expansion phase is to further define the safety and
      feasibility of BYL719 in combination with letrozole or exemestane at the recommended phase II
      dose, and to estimate efficacy.
