      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase II dose of nilotinib when
      used in combination with cetuximab in the treatment of patients with recurrent and/or
      metastatic Kras wildtype colorectal cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      ABL1 has been suggested to play a key role in the resistance mechanism to anti EGFR therapy
      in cancer. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the safety and possible effect of targeting
      both EGFR using cetuximab along with ABL1 using nilotinib. Correlative studies assess the
      changes in tumor proteome in response to therapy and magnitude of ADCC as a marker of
      antibody activity.

Three dose levels for nilotinib:
Dose level -1 200-mg daily Dose level 1 200-mg BID Dose level 2 300-mg BID
Cycle duration will be 4 weeks, with weekly evaluation of toxicity. Assessment of tumor progression will occur every 2 cycles. Subjects will be treated until disease progression or cessation due to intolerable toxicity.</description>

          2. Previous therapy:

               1. Patients must have progressed after standard therapy for metastatic/recurrent
                  disease, including irinotecan and oxaliplatin-containing regimens for patients
