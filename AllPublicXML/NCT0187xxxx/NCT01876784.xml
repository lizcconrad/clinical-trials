      Primary Objective:

      To determine the efficacy (as assessed by progression-free survival [PFS]) of vandetanib when
      compared to placebo in participants with differentiated thyroid cancer that is either locally
      advanced or metastatic who are refractory or unsuitable for radioiodine therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the efficacy of vandetanib when compared to placebo in this participant
           population as assessed by efficacy variables including duration of response (DOR),
           objective response rate (ORR), change in tumour size (TS) and overall survival (OS).

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of vandetanib in this participant population and
           potentially investigate any influence of participant demography and pathophysiology on
           vandetanib PK.

        -  To demonstrate an improvement in time to worsening of pain (TWP) in participants treated
           with vandetanib when compared to placebo in this participant population.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of vandetanib treatment in this participant
           population.

      Participants who were receiving vandetanib as randomized treatment will be allowed, upon
      re-consent, to continue on open-label vandetanib if in the opinion of the Investigator the
      participant is still receiving benefit. Placebo participants who experience disease
      progression within 60 days of unblinding may be offered the option of treatment with
      open-label vandetanib if, in the Investigator's opinion, such treatment may be of clinical
      benefit to the participant. Approximately 2 years; duration will vary depending on individual
      participant response.

    <description>The PFS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization until the date of first documented disease progression or death (from any cause), whichever came first. Disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) was defined as: at least a 20% increase and absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>The PFS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization until the date of first documented disease progression or death (from any cause), whichever came first. Disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) was defined as: at least a 20% increase and absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

          <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
          <description>The PFS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization until the date of first documented disease progression or death (from any cause), whichever came first. Disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) was defined as: at least a 20% increase and absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
