    <textblock>
      After successful screening diagnosis of cirrhosis and/or acute or chronic liver failure will
      be made. These patients will undergo detail clinical, biochemical and microbiological
      examination at baseline. Clinical examination and Biochemical evaluation will be done daily
      and signs of infection will be noted. Patients will undergo microbiological screening for
      infection every 48 hours. Patients suspected or diagnosed to be suffering from infections
      will be treated as per ILBS (Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences) antibiotic policy. Site
      and etiology (bacterial and/or fungal) of infections will be noted in all patients at
      admission in liver specialty ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and during the ICU (Intensive Care
      Unit) stay. All the patients will be followed until discharge or death in ICU (Intensive Care
      Unit).
