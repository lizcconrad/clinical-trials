    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 works in treating patients
      with small cell lung cancer that has returned after a period of improvement. Pegylated
      irinotecan NKTR 102 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the 18-week progression free survival (PFS) rate of relapsed small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC) patients treated with NKTR-102 (pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate. II. To evaluate the duration of response. III. To
      evaluate the overall survival. IV. To evaluate the toxicity of NKTR-102 in this patient
      population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the correlation between UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A
      cluster (UGTIA1) polymorphisms and NKTR-102 toxicities.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
