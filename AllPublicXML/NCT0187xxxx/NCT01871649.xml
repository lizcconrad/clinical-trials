  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a 22-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      of golimumab + methotrexate (MTX) versus methotrexate alone in methotrexate-naïve patients
      with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). Afterwards, a 28 week open label phase with methotrexate
      alone is started. Golimumab will be discontinued.

      Hypotheses:

      First, the investigators hypothesize that initiation of a combination therapy with golimumab
      + MTX will be safe and superior to MTX alone in MTX-naïve PsA patients, as assessed by the
      percentage of patients achieving Disease Activity Score (the investigators hypothesize that
      more patients with the early combination treatment will respond (according to Disease
      Activity Score (DAS), American college of Rheumatology (ACR), or Psoriatic Arthritis Response
      Criteria (PsARC) responses) and achieve a state of Low Disease Activity (LDA) or Minimal
      Disease Activity (MDA) than patients on MTX alone.

      Third, the investigators hypothesize that a significant proportion of the patients will
      continue to benefit from this early aggressive treatment initiation even after stopping
      golimumab treatment.

             medical history, physical examination, laboratory profile, chest X-ray and
             electrocardiography (ECG).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a concomitant rheumatic condition other than PsA

          -  Positivity for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti CCP)

             may enter the study if prophylaxis with isoniazide is begun prior to administration of
             study medication). If a patient has an adequately treated tuberculosis in the past,
             he/she may enter the trial.

             Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gammaglutamyl
             transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, or serum bilirubin. The Investigator
             should be guided by the following criteria: Any single parameter may not exceed 2 x
