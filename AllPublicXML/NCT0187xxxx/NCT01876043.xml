  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liposarcomas are soft tissue sarcomas most frequent. We distinguish three subtypes on the
      basis of their histological and cytogenetic characteristics: well-differentiated liposarcoma
      / dedifferentiated, myxoid liposarcoma and / or round cell liposarcoma and pleomorphic.
      Dedifferentiated liposarcomas (LDD) represent 20% of liposarcomas and are characterized by
      well-differentiated component associated with a contingent sarcomatous differentiation and
      fat-usually high grade. The LDD are most often rétropértionéal seat. Thus, their development
      is very long asymptomatic. At diagnosis, tumor volume is often very important making surgical
      removal impossible in a high proportion of cases. Operable tumors have also a risk of local
      recurrence by about 50% and about 20% metastatic. Chemotherapy is the only treatment of these
      advanced forms. However, the currently available drugs (adriamycin, ifosfamide) have only
      very limited effectiveness. Progression-free survival of patients does not exceed 2 months.
      The LDD is characterized cytogenetically by the constant presence of two amplicons (1p32 and
      6q23) respectively targeting genes MAP3K5 and JUN. These two genes encode proteins involved
      in the signaling pathway Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Activation of JNK is involved in the
      loss of adipose differentiation and tumor aggressiveness of LDD. The plitidepsin is a drug
      capable of inducing apoptosis of tumor cells carrying a functional activation of the JNK
      pathway. This drug has such a pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative in vitro models of LDD.
      plitidepsin could represent the treatment of choice for patients with advanced LDD. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of plitidepsin patients with
      locally advanced dedifferentiated liposarcomas and / or metastatic.
