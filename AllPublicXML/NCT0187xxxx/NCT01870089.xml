  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge-based systems were initially developped to automatically adapt pressure support
      settings during invasive ventilation, and proved to be at least as efficient as experienced
      clinicians.

      Non-invasive ventilation has become the standard of care for patients suffering from acute
      hypercapnic respiratory failure (ARF)and has reduced the need for endotracheal intubation in
      these patients, thus reducing their hospital mortality.

      NIV success or failure is closely related to the tolerance of NIV treatment, which is tightly
      correlated to patient-ventilator synchrony. As severe asynchronies frequently occurs during
      NIV (namely in more than 40% of patients) and as the occurence of asynchronies is related to
      the use of high pressure support levels, to the presence of leaks and/or to non optimal
      expiratory trigger settings, very frequent ventilator settings adaptations should allow
      reducing patient-ventilator asynchronies but require the presence of an experienced clinician
      at the bedside during NIV treatment.

      A computer-driven ventilator settings adaptation has the adavantage of permitting very
      frequent ventilator settings adaptation whithout requiring the presence of an experienced
      clinician at the bedside and could possibly improve patient-ventilator interaction.

      The aim of the present study is to test the faisability of using the Smartcare NIV
      computer-driven system to automatically adapt ventilator settings during non invasive
      ventilation delivered because of acute respiratory failure.

    <description>The main aim of the study is to explore the feasibility of using the Smartcare-NIV system to deliver non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in case of acute respiratory failure. Practically, we will describe how the NIV tratment will go on when using the Smartcare system and report how the system automatically adapt the ventilator settings.</description>
