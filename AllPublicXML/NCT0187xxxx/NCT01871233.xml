  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Extended Access Program (EAP) is a managed access programme for Perampanel. The main
      objective of this EAP is to ensure that patients participating in studies E2007-A001-207,
      E2007-G000-307, or E2007-G000-235 continue to have access to perampanel until such time
      perampanel tablets become commercially available for the treatment of Partial Onset Seizures
      (POS) in the country in which they reside. This EAP will consist of 2 phases:

        -  Screening: The patient will start the program once the Screening assessments are
           completed and the patient is qualified for participation.

        -  Treatment: Additional assessments, physical examinations, and dosage changes will be
           clinically determined by the treating physician.

      Patients will enter this program on the same dose of perampanel that they were receiving at
      the end of their participation in previous study. Doses of perampanel and of concomitant
      anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can be adjusted (i.e., added,removed, or changed in dose) based
      on clinical judgment.

      Treatment will be prescribed as long as clinically appropriate according to the judgement of
      the treating physician and the approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

      The program will complete in a staggered fashion, country by country, as and when perampanel
      becomes commercially available for the treatment of POS in each country.

    <description>Patients will enter this program on the same dose of perampanel that they were receiving at the end of their participation in Studies 207, 307, or 235. Doses of perampanel and of concomitant anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can be adjusted based on clinical judgment. A minimum daily dose permitted will be 12 mg per day. Treatment will be prescribed as long as clinically appropriate according to the judgment of the treating physician and the approved summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Tablets will be available in strengths of 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 mg. Patients will be instructed to take their perampanel tablets once daily, by mouth, before bedtime, and with food.</description>
