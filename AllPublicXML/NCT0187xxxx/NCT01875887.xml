    <textblock>
      Combined application of surgery planning software and rapid prototyping technology and
      preshaped titanium plates can effectively promote the accuracy of the diagnosis and treatment
      of bilateral maxillofacial post traumatic deformities, reduce operation time and improve
      surgical effect.

      All patients underwent preoperative CT scan. Firstly, SurgiCase were used to analyze CT data
      and design preliminary surgery plans. Secondly, three-dimensions resin skull models were
      produced by rapid prototyping technology. Model surgeries were performed to determine the
      location, reduction direction and shift distance of osteotomy. Based on the surgical
      simulation, the preliminary surgery plans were validated and optimized. Then, the titanium
      plates and mesh were preshaped on the models. Finally, according to the final surgery plans
      the operations were performed. The operation time, therapeutic effects and complications were
      observed. The follow-up periods were 1-12 months.
