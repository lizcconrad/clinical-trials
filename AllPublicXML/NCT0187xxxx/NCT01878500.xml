      The aim of this study is to investigate the use of intraoperative stereotactic imaging of the
      pelvic floor musculature during closure of bladder exstrophy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Much of the long-term success of classic bladder exstrophy closures depends on the initial
      closure. Several studies have demonstrated that a key to successful initial closure involves
      deep dissection of the pelvic floor so that the bladder can be placed in the most posterior
      and inferior position possible. Oftentimes, the need for repeat closure of the abdomen is
      required if the initial surgeon failed to properly dissect deep enough into the child's
      pelvic floor. Many surgeons are unfamiliar with the complex anatomy and are unable to verify
      that they have properly reached the true pelvic floor during this initial surgery. This often
      leads to failed closures, which result in poor continence rates later in life.

      The investigators are attempting to determine the safety and efficacy of the use the
      Brainlab, Inc. VisionVector速 Cranial Image Guided Surgery System during closure of bladder
      exstrophy. The value of this research is two-fold. Firstly, the project will help us to
      verify if the investigators are indeed dissecting down to the proper plane required for
      successful initial closure of bladder exstrophy. Secondly, this project will help others with
      relatively less experience with bladder exstrophy to properly identify where they are
      anatomically during closure of exstrophy, thus yielding higher success rates and better
      patient care at other centers.

    <description>Surgeon will use intraoperative stereotactic imaging with VectorVision速 Cranial Guided Image System by Brainlab Inc. to assist in bladder exstrophy closure. Prior to the operation a team consisting of pediatric urologist, pediatric radiologists, and a VectorVision rep will use pre-operative MRI to map out specific bony and muscular structures of the pelvic floor. Doing so will allow the pediatric urologist to use these markers intraoperatively to help guide his closure and also allow for future surgeons who use this technology to understand the correct planes to develop for the same surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 0-7 years

          2. Diagnosis of classic bladder exstrophy

          3. Scheduled to undergo bladder exstrophy closure by the principal investigator at Johns
             Hopkins Hospital's Broadway campus.

          4. All eligible participants will be children whose parents or legally authorized
             representatives have already agreed and are being scheduled for osteotomy and bladder
             exstrophy closure as determined by their pediatric urologist.

          5. Parent or legally authorized representative who is, in the opinion of the
             investigator, reliable and willing to make themselves and patient available for the
             duration of the study.

          6. Parent or legally authorized representative is able to complete and sign the informed
             consent document.

          7. Patient judged by the investigator to have bladders of sufficient size and elasticity
             to be suitable for immediate closure as evidenced by the PI's assessment of the
             patient's bladder template [16].

          8. Patient with cardiopulmonary function sufficient to tolerate general anesthesia as
             evidenced by the pediatrician's and anesthesiologists assessment of the patient's
             overall cardio-pulmonary status.

          9. Patients requiring ferromagnetic metal objects such as a metal pace maker during the
             OR procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lack or withdrawal of consent for primary operative procedure.

          2. Parent or legally authorized representative who is, in the opinion of the
             investigator, not reliable or unwilling to make themselves and patient available for
             the duration of the study.

          3. Parent or legally authorized representative who is unable to understand, complete
             and/or sign the informed consent document. Non-English speaking parents will
             automatically be excluded if they are unable to read and understand the consent form.

          4. Patient who will not undergo osteotomy prior to closure for any reason
