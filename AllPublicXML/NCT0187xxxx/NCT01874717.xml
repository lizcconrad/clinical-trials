    <textblock>
      The progress of the study is described below:

      Session 1: intravenous administration of midazolam. Establishment of the individual dose.

      Randomisation.

      Session 2 :

      Group A : oral administration of midazolam : the dose administered is twice the individual
      dose determined in session 1.

      Group B : intravenous administration of midazolam at the individual dose determined in
      session 1.

      Session 3 : reversal of the procedures :

      Group A : intravenous administration of midazolam at the individual dose determined in
      session 1.

      Group B : oral administration of midazolam : the dose administered is twice the individual
      dose determined in session 1.

             inhalation sedation (poor cooperation is defined as a score of 3 or more on the French
             modified version of the Venham scale), or following good cooperation during short and
             simple treatment under inhalation sedation but in need of more complex rehabilitation.

          -  Written consent signed by the patient or his legal guardian

          -  Patient accompanied by an accountable person
