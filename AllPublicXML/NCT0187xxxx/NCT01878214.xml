  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an innovative and sustainable intervention to increase
      participation in a union-sponsored smoking cessation program among carpenters and floor
      layers. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing targeted
      messaging versus standard messaging. All subjects will receive information about the free,
      union-sponsored smoking cessation program. Subjects randomized to the intervention group will
      receive additional targeted materials to encourage enrollment in the union's smoking
      cessation program. The intervention will include monthly mailed and text messages. The
      investigators hypothesize that subjects who receive targeted messages will be more likely to
      enroll in the union-sponsored smoking cessation program, be more likely to show change in
      readiness to quit smoking, and be more likely to quit smoking compared to subjects who
      receive only standard messaging.

      Specific Aim 1: Develop targeted health messages based on audience segmentation to encourage
      smokers to enroll in a comprehensive union-sponsored smoking cessation program.

      We will craft six specific health messages that appeal to four different audience segments:
      workers under 30 years old without children, workers under 30 with children, workers 30 years
      old or older without children, and workers 30 or older with children.

      Specific Aim 2: Conduct a randomized controlled trial of targeted messaging based on audience
      segmentation versus standard smoking cessation messaging.

      After conducting baseline surveys with union carpenters and floor layers, we will randomize
      current smokers (smoked within the last 30 days) into either the intervention or control
      group.

        -  Control subjects will receive one standard mailing informing them about the free smoking
           cessation program available to union members.

        -  Intervention subjects will receive the standard mailing in addition to six targeted
           smoking cessation messages delivered monthly by mail to their homes. Messages will be
           specific to one of four audience segments determined by age and parental status. In
           addition to a segment-specific anti-smoking message, each mailing will have contact
           information for the union smoking cessation program. Intervention subjects who consented
           to text messaging will also receive one booster text message each month with a shortened
           targeted message.

    <measure>Changes in Smoking Behaviors (Frequency and Quantity)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months after recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline and follow-up, subjects will report smoking frequency (&quot;How often do you smoke?&quot; [everyday, at least 4 days/week, 1-3 days/week, less than one day/week]) and quantity (&quot;On days that you smoke, how many cigarettes do you have per day?&quot; [10 or less, 11-20, 21-30, 31 or more]). We will report the % of subjects who smoke less frequently and smoke fewer cigarettes per day at follow-up compared to baseline.

    <description>Subjects will answer the following question at both baseline and follow-up surveys: &quot;Are you seriously considering quitting smoking in the next 6 months?&quot; [yes/no]. We will report % of subjects who said &quot;no&quot; at baseline and &quot;yes&quot; at follow-up to determine changes in readiness to quit smoking and compare between intervention and control groups.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Motivation to Quit Smoking and Thinking About Quitting Smoking</measure>

    <description>At baseline and follow-up, subjects will answer questions about motivation to quit smoking (&quot;How motivated are you to quit smoking at this time? [scale: 1 (not at all) - 10 (extremely)]) and thinking about quitting smoking (&quot;Each rung on this ladder represents where various smokers are in their thinking about quitting. Circle the number that indicates where you are now. [0 (no thoughts of quitting) -10 (taking action to quit)]). We will report the % of subjects who reported more motivation to quit and greater thinking about quitting at follow-up compared to baseline.

      <recruitment_details>We invited 1937 union members to participate; 1638 members completed the baseline survey (84.6%). Of those, 553 were current smokers, 1066 were non-smokers, and the smoking status was unknown for 19 individuals. The smoking rate was 33.8%, slightly lower than expected based on previous studies in this population.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 553 current smokers, 111 were not eligible for study inclusion because they either did not sign a consent form (n=49), were not eligible for union benefits (n=57), or had too much data missing at baseline (n=5). The 442 eligible smokers were separated into the four segments and then randomized into the intervention group or the control group.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>At baseline and follow-up, subjects will answer questions about motivation to quit smoking (&quot;How motivated are you to quit smoking at this time?

Circle the number that indicates where you are now. [0 (no thoughts of quitting) -10 (taking action to quit)]). We will report the % of subjects who reported more motivation to quit and greater thinking about quitting at follow-up compared to baseline.
