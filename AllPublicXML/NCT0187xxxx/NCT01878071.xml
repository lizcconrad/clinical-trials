  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on the link between oral and systemic
      health. Obesity, a growing medical problem worldwide, has been associated with multiple
      chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. With
      respect to the effect of obesity on periodontal health, it has been shown that obese subjects
      exhibit higher inflammation around natural teeth and are at increased risk of tooth loss than
      individuals with normal weight. Peri-implantitis, an inflammatory condition of bacterial
      origin that occurs around oral implants and resembles periodontal disease, has become a
      serious concern for the dental profession given its increasing prevalence and challenging
      treatment. There is also strong evidence that individuals with a history of periodontitis are
      also at risk for peri-implantitis. However, knowledge about the pathogenesis and treatment of
      peri-implantitis is scarce. Hence, it is extremely important to understand the implications
      of excessive body fat on peri-implant health. Based on the current understanding on the
      effect of obesity on systemic and local inflammation around natural teeth, the investigators
      hypothesize that obesity will have a significant impact on peri-implant health by inducing an
      increased inflammatory response as measured by clinical as well as molecular markers of
      inflammation.
