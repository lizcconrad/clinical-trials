      This Clinical Trial is being conducted to study an adjunctive treatment for rotator cuff
      repair; bone trephination. &quot;Trephination&quot; is a procedure that involves making small
      perforations in the bone that the tendon is repaired to. The rotator cuff is repaired by
      sewing the tendon down to the bone in the shoulder. Trephination is a new technique that is
      used in addition to the standard method of repairing the rotator cuff tendon. The control
      group will undergo the standard repair for rotator cuff tears.

      It is the investigators' hypothesis that healing rates in patients who undergo bone
      trephination will be higher compared with surgery without trephination in arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair at 24 months post-operatively.

    <description>High-resolution ultrasound will be used as the primary outcome measure to determine the re-tear rate at 6 and 24 months following repair. Ultrasound was chosen as it has been shown to have a high degree of accuracy for the diagnosis of rotator tears that is equivalent but less expensive than MRI.
The interpretation of the high-resolution ultrasound is based on healing status and will be carried out by a trained MSK radiologist. Healing status will be documented at both 6 and 24 months as either completely healed, partially healed, or not healed. For tendons partially healed or not healed, the size of the defect will be compared with the size of the tear pre-operatively.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have failed standard non-surgical management of their rotator cuff tear,
             and who would benefit from a surgical repair of the cuff.

             Failed medical management will be defined as persistent pain and disability despite
             adequate standard non-operative management for 6 months. Medical management will be
             defined as:

               1. The use of drugs including analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

               2. Physiotherapy consisting of stretching, strengthening and local modalities
                  (ultrasound, cryotherapy, etc)

               3. Activity modification

          2. Imaging, and intra-operative findings confirming a full thickness tear of the rotator
             cuff.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Characteristics of the cuff tear that render the cuff irrepairable:

             fatty infiltration in the muscles grade III (50%) or greater; superior subluxation of
             the humeral head; retraction of the cuff to the level of the glenoid rim.

          2. Partial thickness cuff tears.

          3. Significant shoulder comorbidities e.g. Bankart lesion, osteoarthritis

          4. Previous surgery on affected shoulder e.g. Previous rotator cuff repair.

          5. Isolated subscapularis tendon tears

          6. Active joint or systemic infection

          7. Significant muscle paralysis

          8. Rotator cuff tear arthropathy

          9. Charcot's arthropathy

         10. Significant medical comorbidity that could alter the effectiveness of the surgical
             intervention (eg. Cervical radiculopathy, polymyalgia rheumatica)

         11. Major medical illness (life expectancy less then 1 year or unacceptably high operative
             risk)

         12. Unable to speak or read English/French

         13. Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent

         14. Unwilling to be followed for 24 months

         15. Advanced physiologic age
