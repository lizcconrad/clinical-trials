      The aim of this prospective single-center study is to evaluate sympathetic nervous system
      directly measured by microneurography, 24-hour blood pressure, endothelial function, vascular
      compliance, quality of life and platelet adhesion in patients with sleep apnea syndrome
      (defined by a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness, an Epworth sleepiness score&gt;8[10],
      and an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI&gt;15/h) before and after catheter-based radiofrequency
      ablation of renal nerve. If the selected patients are treated with CPAP, this therapy should
      be stable during the whole study time. Primary and secondary end-point will be measured
      before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after renal sympathetic denervation.

        Inclusion criteria: We plan to include male or female subjects, age 18-80 with a diagnosis
        of medium-severe sleep apnea syndrome (defined by symptoms, a complaint of excessive
        daytime sleepiness, an Epworth sleepiness score &gt;8, and an apnea / hypopnea index &gt;15/h)
        and a resistant hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or &gt;130 mmHg in patients
        with type II diabetes or chronic kidney disease, under treatment with three
        antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic).

        If the selected patients are treated with CPAP, this therapy should be stable during the
        whole study time.

        Every patient will be asked for a written informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria: - Heart failure (normal ejection fractions on echocardiography and no
        clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure).

          -  Long acting nitrates, or PDE-5-Hemmer

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse,

          -  Malignancy (unless healed or remission &gt; 5 years)

          -  Disease with systemic inflammation (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, M. Crohn)

          -  Pulmonary Hypertension (PAP&gt;50 mmHg)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Anatomical contraindication to renal denervation

          -  Know allergy to contrast

          -  Participation in another study within the last month
