  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the Boussignac positive airway
      pressure system (a mask) applied immediately following post-operative extubation in improving
      lung function in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Assessments will be done before
      surgery and then at 1, 2 and 24 hours following extubation and will be compared to standard
      care for perioperative airway support. The study aims to give a broader and more inclusive
      picture (than the current literature) in terms of whether the Boussignac CPAP system should
      be considered for utilization by anesthesiologists caring for surgical patients with OSA.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Most OSA patients were not obese and/or admitted over night so the study was not feasible.

    <description>Is a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system marketed in Canada and the US for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea. The main difference is that this system is portable wheres the standard hospital CPAP is not. This allows for the application immediately post-extubation.</description>
