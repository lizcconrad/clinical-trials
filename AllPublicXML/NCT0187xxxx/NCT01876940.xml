  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective randomized study is to compare the effect of operator experience
      on the ability to use fiberoptic-guided intubation in children less than two years old, with
      and without the use of an air-Q as a conduit. The question the investigators are trying to
      answer is: Does the operator experience make a significant difference in the time for
      successful fiberoptic guided tracheal intubation with and without the use of an air-Q
      intubating laryngeal airway?

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of operator experience on the ability to use
      fiberoptic-guided intubation in children less than two years old, with and without the use of
      an air-Q as a conduit. The ease and time for placement of the air-Q, fiberoptic grade of
      laryngeal view, time for fiberoptic tracheal intubation, and peri-operative complications
      will also be assessed.
