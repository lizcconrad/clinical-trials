  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-agricultural societies almost universally used healing ceremonies that involved
      reverence, rhythm and dance in the presence of a healer. It is believed that we are &quot;wired&quot;
      for such experiences and they foster an integrative mode of consciousness similar to that of
      mindfulness based stress reduction, which has been shown to have therapeutic effects in a
      variety of conditions. Collaborator Ava Lavonne Vinesett of the Duke Dance Program has
      developed a healing ceremony based in sub-Saharan African traditions. The investigators plan
      is to have 25 subjects with a variety of clinical conditions participate in this ceremony.
      Subjects will then be asked to write a commentary about their experience and to participate
      in a focus group discussion. It is anticipated that the study will give us some idea of how
      promising this approach would be and what kinds of patients might benefit. Safety issues are
      minimal and include the possibility of injury (though the dancing is not strenuous) and
      psychological distress.
