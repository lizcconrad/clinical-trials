      Background:

      - Researchers want to look at how the brain responds to painful stimulations. They also want
      to see if these responses are different in people with and without chronic pain. To test the
      brain s response, they will use a chemical called naloxone. Naloxone is used to treat
      overdoses of painkilling drugs like morphine. It may be able to block the effect of a
      pain-relieving cream. Researchers will apply a pain-relieving cream to a person s lower leg
      and look at the results of sensitivity tests with either naloxone or a placebo. This study
      will compare the results from people with chronic pain (like fibromyalgia) to those of people
      without chronic pain.

      Objectives:

      - To look at the brain s response to pain in people with and without chronic pain.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have fibromyalgia.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve a screening visit and two testing visits. The testing visits
           will be about a week apart.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. After the screening participants will be administered several
           questionnaires about their personality, and their thoughts and feelings.

        -  At the first visit, participants will try out the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
           before using it at the next visit. They will then have the painkilling cream applied on
           one part of their lower leg and a normal moisturizing cream on the other part of their
           lower leg. They will have heat pulses on these skin areas and rate the pain.

        -  At the second visit, participants will have tests in the MRI scanner. The heat pulse
           tests will be repeated after an infusion of either naloxone or a placebo.

      Different pain reducing drugs work in different ways to reduce pain. Many drugs, including
      morphine and codeine, reduce pain by binding to opiate receptors in the brain. Another
      chemical, naloxone, can block the effect of these drugs. In this study, we are looking at
      brain responses to a pain-relieving cream and whether naloxone blocks the effect of the
      cream. We will compare the results of people with chronic pain (fibromyalgia) to those of
      people without chronic pain.

      Design:

      The study compares MRI response to painful stimulation between people with fibromyalgia and
      healthy volunteers under two conditions: 1) naloxone, 2) placebo.

      Outcome measures: Pain ratings and pain-related MRI responses are compared between people
      with fibromyalgia and healthy volunteers

          4. Patient must have had chronic widespread pain for at least one year prior to
             participation with an average daily intensity at least 4 out of 10.

        Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls:

          1. Healthy control must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age

          2. Healthy control must be able to comprehend English.

          3. Healthy control must be able to provide written informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion criteria for patients:

          1. Patient is unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits
