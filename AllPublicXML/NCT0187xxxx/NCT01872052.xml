      Study to determine the feasibility of the Acutus Medical System in obtaining data to create
      Dipole Density Maps of electrical activation in the right atrium in patients with typical
      atrial flutter.

    <description>Proprietary software algorithms will be used generate electrical activation maps based dipole density data acquired by the Acutus Medical Catheter during the procedures. These activation maps will then be applied to a 3D model of the endocardial surface to create a 3D activation map.</description>
