      This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the influence of somatic symptom load
      and anxiety sensitivity as risk factors for the occurrence of postoperative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV). Physiological and psychological variables are assessed in female patients
      with an increased risk for PONV prior to a planned surgical intervention with a 33-item
      questionnaire composed of the ASI-3 and the PHQ-15. Postoperative evaluation includes the
      occurrence of nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hours after surgery. It is hypothesized
      that patients with high sum scores for somatic symptom load (measured with the Patient Health
      Questionnaire, PHQ-15) and with increased levels for anxiety sensitivity (measured with the
      Anxiety Sensitivity Index, ASI-3) experience more frequently postoperative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV) than patients with low scores in both self-rating instruments.
