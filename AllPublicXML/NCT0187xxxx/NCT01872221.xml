  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective biomedical study of interventional type which includes 16 patients on
      52 months (24 months of inclusion and 28 months of follow up).

      This pilot study, combining a metabolic imaging approach (Proton Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy = 1HMRSI) and a biological one, will be performed in patients harbouring a
      Glioblastoma (GBM)to determine whether MRI markers of aggressiveness (CNI2) are associated
      with specific biological patterns as regards to GBMSC (GBM contains tumor stem cell).

      In the first part of the study, patients with radiological criteria of GBM amenable to
      surgical resection will be included ; pre-operative multimodal MRI scans will be done and all
      data acquired (including H1MRS and DTI data) will be integrated in the image-guided surgical
      device (ie neuronavigation system) to be used intraoperatively. During tumor resection,
      tissue samples will be individualized, based on their multimodal imaging characteristics and
      sent to the radiobiology laboratory INSERM for biological analysis.

      After surgery, patient will be treated by the standard radio-chemotherapy stupp protocol and
      will be followed according to standard practices; multimodal MRI will be performed every 2
      months during the first year and then every 3 months until progression.
