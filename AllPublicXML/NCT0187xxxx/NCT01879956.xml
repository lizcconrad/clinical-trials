      Primary Objective:

      Efficacy of Occupational Therapy (OT) based Occupational Goal Intervention (OGI) in improving
      executive functions in patients with refractory schizophrenia as measured by the BADS.

      Secondary Objectives: improvement of functional aspects,basic and instrumental activities of
      daily living,negative symptoms and cognitive functions improvement

      Hypothesis: OT is more effective than control group to improve executive functions in
      patients with refractory schizophrenia.

      A single-center, randomized, single blind, controlled study, lasting one year, including the
      follow-up.

      The study is conducted in two groups:the experimental group is based on the OGI method (N=30
      patients) and the control group receives craft activities (N = 30 patients).

      Psychiatric, neuropsychological and functional aspects are assessed at the beginning, after
      30 sessions and 6 months after the intervention. The scale PANSS (Positive and Negative
      Syndrome Scale) is used for monitoring psychopathological symptoms during the study.

      Scales BADS, DAFS-R, ILSS-BR respectively assess executive functions, functionality and basic
      and instrumental activities of daily living. The neuropsychological evaluation includes a
      battery to measure attention, executive functions, memory and estimated intellectual
      efficiency.

      Statistical analysis to be used: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)for repeated measures; data are
      also calculated to messure clinical efficacy, effect size and needed number to treat.
