  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of SPG
      stimulation with the ISS in a 24 hour window, in patients with an acute ischemic stroke in
      the anterior circulation, who received Mechanical Thrombectomy and/or IV-rtPA and Standard of
      Care.

      This will be a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double blind, sham control,
      adjunctive to Standard of Care, parallel arm study and will include ongoing DSMB review of
      accumulated safety data.

      The study has three phases:

      Phase I - Implantation Safety Assessment

        -  Number of patients: 20 (at least 10 implantations)

        -  Implanters: only certified implanters who already performed implantation of ISS in
           previous studies

        -  Continue to the next phase if there are no serious procedure complications related to
           IV-rtPA (as determined by the implanter). Otherwise, implement retirements and continue
           only after DSMB approval.

      DSMB meetings: after 10 implantations

      Phase II - Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage Assessment (sICH):

        -  Number of patients: 50 (additional 30)

        -  Implanters: all certified implanters

        -  Verify no clinically meaningful difference between treated and control. A clinically
           meaningful difference is a difference of more than 3 sICH cases within the first 5 days
           of treatment, in the treated arm compared to the control arm.

      In case of clinically meaningful difference, implement retirements.

        -  Continue to phase III after DSMB approval.

        -  DSMB meetings: after 30 and 50 patients

      Phase III - Entire study population, DSMB meetings at 100 and 150 patients
