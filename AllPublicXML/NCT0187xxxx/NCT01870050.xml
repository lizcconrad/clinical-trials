      Principal aim of this study is to assess whether a combination of topical dapsone and
      clobetasol as a topical steroid is superior to clobetasol alone as treatment of prurigo
      nodularis or lichen simplex chronicus in a side to side comparison. The study is primarily
      exploratory and essentially meant to inform the sponsor whether further development of a
      combination treatment formulation is warranted

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Active prurigo nodularis or lichen simplex chronicus - diagnosed by clinical exam

               -  For lichen simplex chronicus patients: Severity of maximum pruritus in the last
                  24 hrs at least 5 out of 10 on a visual analogue scale.

               -  For prurigo nodularis patients: Excoriations or signs of other scratch related
                  activity at presentation to demonstrate active disease

               -  Symmetrical disease/excoriations allowing for a side-by-side comparison (eg,
                  bilateral lichen simplex chronicus or bilateral prurigo nodularis) - genitals,
                  face, axillae or neck cannot be used for side-to-side comparison

               -  Willing to refrain from use of all other topical medications in the treatment
                  areas.

               -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent

               -  Willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study,
                  apply the treatment combinations as instructs, attend required study visits,
                  comply with study prohibitions and able to complete the study.

               -  Male or non-preganant, non-lactating female between 18 and 75 years of age,

                  during the study conduct

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • History of non-compliance with follow up visits

               -  Should we exclude failure to certain treatments as an exclusion criterion?
                  Patients who failed oral dapsone should be excluded

               -  Presence of any skin condition on the treatment areas that would interfere with
                  the diagnosis or assessment of active lichen simplex chronicus and/or prurigo
                  nodularis (eg, rosacea, dermatitis, psoriasis, squamous cell carcinoma, eczema,
                  acneform eruptions caused by medications, steroid acne, steroid folliculitis or
                  bacterial folliculitis)

               -  Excessive hair in the treatment area that would interfere with diagnosis or
                  assessment of lichen simplex chronicus and/or prurigo nodularis

               -  History of hypersensitivity or allergy to topical steroids, dapsone, or any other
                  treatment product components
