  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapeutic approaches available for patients with advanced-stage melanoma remain
      inadequate, and existing approaches including those involving immunotherapy with cytokines
      and/or targeted strategies have resulted in disappointingly low rates of durable and complete
      responses. Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using
      tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's
      immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens
      expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the
      genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage
      melanoma patient.

      This is a single-center, prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity, safety
      and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1 polarized
      Dendritic Cell (αDC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2 study to
      determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of αDC1s loaded with a
      mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of, or immediately after, an initial therapy
      cycle with the TKI dasatinib.

      Dasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70
      mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to, or
      concomitant with, the initiation of dasatinib administration. All patients will receive
      dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting
      approximately every 12 hours, at the same time each day.

      The DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7
      cells, with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient
      basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center (UPCI-CTRC).

      Patients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while those
      patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1).

      Men and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed
      melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard
      curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.

    <description>Translation and clinical vaccine trials have demonstrated that DC/peptide-based vaccines effectively activate specific CD8+ T cells in tumor-bearing hosts that may be detected in peripheral blood, and that individuals that exhibit objective clinical response to such vaccine therapies tend to derive from the cohort of patients that display detectable increases in T cell responses post-vaccination. Our own pre-clinical studies support the effectiveness of DC1/peptide vaccination to elicit protective/therapeutic T cell-mediated immunity in melanoma models in vivo, supporting the hypothesis that DC1/peptide vaccination of advanced stage melanoma patients will result in increased quantities of specific CD8+ T cells in patient peripheral blood and that those individuals in which improved response to many peptides can be observed are those that are more likely to demonstrate clinical benefit.</description>

    <description>Although objective tumor response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, patients with measurable disease will be assessed by standard criteria. For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated every 8 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans will also be obtained ≥ 4 weeks following initial documentation of an objective response.</description>

    <description>Tumor progression is believed to be linked to the accumulation of suppressor cell populations (both MDSC and Treg) and strong pro-angiogenic signals, as well as, &quot;prevention&quot; of Type-1 T cell recruitment within the tumor microenvironment. Our preliminary data in murine melanoma models support the ability of dasatinib (particularly when combined with DC1/peptide vaccines) to counteract these biologic endpoints in vivo. We hypothesize that such changes may also be evidenced in effectively treated melanoma patients by analyzing melanoma biopsies taken post- versus pre-treatment and that the greatest &quot;normalization&quot; of the tumor microenvironment will be observed after treatment with combined dasatinib + vaccine therapy.</description>

    <description>Cancer patients have commonly also been shown to have elevated populational frequencies of Treg (based on the CD4+Foxp3+ phenotype) circulating in the peripheral blood. Alternate TKI, such as sunitinib, have been shown capable of reducing peripheral blood Treg levels within the first 4 week cycle of drug administration, in concert with a rebound in Type-1 T cell numbers and function in PBMC (59). Based on our pre-clinical data (Fig. 1), we hypothesize that dasatinib with provide a similar effect in melanoma patients and that those patients exhibiting the greatest degree of Treg reduction post-therapy will be more likely to respond favorably against the peptide epitopes contained in the vaccine formulation.</description>

    <measure>Level of EphA2 protein expression in tumor biopsies</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 of cycles 2, 4, &amp; 6.</time_frame>
    <description>We have previously shown that drug treatments (including dasatinib in vitro) that promote the proteasome-dependent degradation of the tumor (and tumor vascular endothelial) cell-associated protein EphA2 lead to improved recognition by specific CD8+ T cells. We hypothesize that administration of dasatinib to melanoma patients will promote the loss of EphA2 protein within the tumor lesion, leading to an enhancement in the sensitivity of EphA2+ cells in the tumor microenvironment to EphA2-specific CD8+ T cells that have been activated as a consequence of DC1/peptide-based vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Serum concentration of the T cell-recruiting chemokine CXCL10/IP-10</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at weeks 1 &amp; 3 for at least 6 cycles.</time_frame>
    <description>We and others have recently shown that therapeutic CD8+ T cells require the production of CXCR3 ligand chemokines within the tumor microenvironment in order to effectively home to these disease sites. Two recent clinical trials, including our DC1/glioma peptide vaccination trial in patients with brain tumors strongly support CXCL10 (aka IP-10) as a chemokine associated with superior clinical outcome to immune-based therapy. We hypothesize that this will also be the case in our DC1/TBVA peptide vaccinated patients with melanoma where Type-1 CXCR3+ responder T cells require a gradient of CXCL10/IP-10 (as detected in serum) in order to traffic to tumor sites in vivo.</description>

             measures do not exist or are no longer effective.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1, defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be
             recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt; 20 mm with
             conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by
             clinical exam. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.

          -  Patients should have at least 2 subcutaneous, intracutaneous, and accessible tumor
             deposits, lymph node or other site available for biopsy purposes. Patients that have

             not include dasatinib.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of dasatinib in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study,
             but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt; 60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/µL

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/µL

             method of birth control during the course of the study and for up to 3 months
             following the last dose of the study drug, in a manner such that risk of pregnancy is
             minimized. Surgical sterilization, intrauterine device or barrier method (e.g. condom
             and/or diaphragm with spermicidal agents) are acceptable forms of birth control. Women
             of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum) within 7 days
             prior to treatment. A pregnancy test is not required for registration. Women who have
             not menstruated for more than 2 years will be considered postmenopausal, thus not of
             childbearing potential.

             composition to dasatinib or any of the components of the vaccine being administered as
             part of this study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing/breastfeeding.

          -  History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including:

               -  Diagnosed congenital bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease)

               -  Diagnosed acquired bleeding disorder within one year (e.g., acquired anti-factor
                  VIII antibodies)

          -  Patients currently taking medications that inhibit platelet function (i.e., aspirin,
             dipyridamole, epoprostenol, eptifibatide, clopidogrel, cilostazol, abciximab,
             ticlopidine, and any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) because of a potential
             increased risk of bleeding from dasatinib.

          -  Patients currently taking anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin/low molecular weight
             heparin [e.g., danaparoid, dalteparin, tinzaparin, enoxaparin]) because of a potential
             increased risk of bleeding from dasatinib.

          -  Diagnosis of unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 6 months of study entry.

          -  Patients currently taking one or more of the following drugs that are generally
             accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes:

               -  quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide

               -  amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide

               -  erythromycins, clarithromycin

             prior to study registration.

          -  Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular
             tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with dasatinib. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
