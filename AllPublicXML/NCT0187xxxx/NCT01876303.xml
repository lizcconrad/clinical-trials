    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies genetic biomarkers from saliva samples in patients with Ewing
      sarcoma. Studying samples of saliva from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between the length of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region
      1-Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion protein binding sites
      (microsatellites) and risk of Ewing's sarcoma (ES).

      II. To determine the frequency and commonality of Caucasian ancestral markers in cases of ES
      self-identified as non-Caucasian (African-American, Asian, Hispanic).

      III. To determine the association between genomic variants in ES-related genes and hernia
      development (i.e. the integrin signaling pathway) and risk of ES.

      OUTLINE:

      Genomic DNA is extracted from participants' saliva samples and analyzed for expression of
      EWS-FLI1 and other ES-target genes.
