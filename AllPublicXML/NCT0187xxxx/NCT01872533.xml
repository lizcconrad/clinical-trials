  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how a reduction in oxygen levels (hypoxia) influences
      insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate metabolism. It is expected that 10 nights of exposure to
      moderate hypoxia (~ 15% O2, similar to conditions at an altitude of ~7500 feet) will improve
      glucose metabolism.
