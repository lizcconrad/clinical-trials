  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On a previous study conducted in Brazil. The MMR vaccine from 2 different producers had a
      mumps seroconversion much lower (71%) than the expected 95%, according to the package insert.
      This could indicate that a substantial proportion of children was not protected after MMR
      dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the above and considering: (1) future clinical study with the MMR vaccine produced
      entirely in Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz from technology transfer from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), (2)
      the importance to the National Immunization Program (NIP) to provide the population a MMR
      vaccine to ensure high protection against mumps, similar to what occurs with measles and
      rubella components, it was considered essential to conduct a preliminary immunogenicity
      assessment of the MMR vaccine produced by BioManguinhos.
