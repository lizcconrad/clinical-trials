  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The higher prevalence of overweight and obesity among the population contributes to increased
      incidences of chronic metabolic diseases. Obesity is considered a low-grade systemic
      inflammatory condition through 1) production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by adipose tissue
      and 2) alterations in intestinal microbiota composition and associated increase in intestinal
      permeability. Healthcare costs related to these diseases are rising; prevention or delay of
      onset of disorders associated with overweight is needed. Administration of wheat
      arabinoxylans (NAXUS), a non-digestible carbohydrate, may change the intestinal microbiota
      composition and have beneficial effects on gut epithelial barrier, especially on permeability
      and innate immune function.

      Objective: To assess the effects of NAXUS on intestinal barrier function, immune system
      performance and metabolic control. Prebiotic properties of NAXUS will be studied. Tolerance
      of the product in different doses will also be investigated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary objective of this study is to assess the change from baseline intestinal barrier function at 6 weeks, by performing a gut sugar permeability test.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks of administration</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the change from baseline intestinal barrier function at 6 weeks, by assessing the tight junction structure and proteins in colonic biopsies.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks of administration</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will take place by immunofluorescent labelling and Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification of zonulin-1, claudin-3, occluding, myosin light chain kinase and phosphorylated myosin light chain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the change from baseline local and systemic immune system performance at 6 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks administration</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome will be measured by the expression of immune parameters in colonic biopsies, by multiplex cytokine analysis in blood and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell stimulation assays.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the change from baseline prebiotic properties at 3 and 6 weeks, by collecting faecal samples, intestinal contents and mucosal contents.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 3 and after 6 weeks of administration</time_frame>
    <description>The microbial community composition, Short-chain Fatty Acid profiles in intestinal content and faeces and proteolytic activity markers in intestinal content and faeces will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the change from baseline glucose and lipid metabolism at 3 and 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 3 and after 6 weeks of adminstration</time_frame>
    <description>By determining glucose, insulin and triglyceride in blood samples. Cholesterol and free fatty acids will be measured as part of general blood profiling. Moreover effects on insulin sensitivity will be estimated by measuring HOMA-IR. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is a method for assessing β-cell function and insulin resistance (IR) from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin or C-peptide concentrations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the effect of different doses of NAXUS administration on tolerance and digestive (dys)comfort.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after 1 wk of administration, after 2 wks of administration, after 3 wks of administration, after 4 wks of administration, after 5 wks of administration, after 6 wks of administration (in total 7 times)</time_frame>
    <description>Via questionnaires stool frequency, stool consistency and gastrointestinal symptoms will be measured.</description>
