  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell
      therapy.

      This research study is evaluating if a patient-specific experimental therapy for metastatic
      melanoma will lengthen survival with minimal harmful effects. It is called an experimental
      therapy (or &quot;study therapy&quot;) because it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). This research study will use the patient's own tumor cells,the
      patient's own dendritic cells (a type of immune cell), and a granulocyte-macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF, a type of growth factor). GM-CSF is a natural growth factor that
      stimulates growth of white blood cells in the body. Since 1991, GM-CSF has been used as a
      standard treatment to help increase the number of white blood cells after chemotherapy.

      The patient's dendritic cells are grown in a test-tube with the patient's tumor cells and the
      growth factor. The resulting solution is called the study therapy. The intent of the study
      therapy is to make the dendritic cells more effective at fighting the tumor when they are
      injected back into the patient.

             unstable angina related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

          4. Diagnosis of any other invasive cancer that requires ongoing treatment or for which
             there is evidence of active disease.

          5. Active, unresolved infection and/or receiving concurrent treatment with parenteral
             antibiotics (patients are eligible after antibiotics have been discontinued for at
             least 7 days prior to first dose and evidence of infection has resolved).

          6. Other active medical condition that could be imminently life threatening, in the
             opinion of the investigator, including no active blood clotting or bleeding diathesis.

          7. New or uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease and/or taking
             pharmacological doses of corticosteroids. Brain metastases treated by gamma knife or
             stereotactic radiotherapy are considered controlled, unless patient requires
             pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids. It is recognized that tumor necrosis may be
             confused with tumor progression in interpretation of Brain MRI.

          8. Known autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, or disease process that involves the use
             of immunosuppressive therapy.

          9. Taking other anticancer therapy.
