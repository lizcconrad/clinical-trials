    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause.

    <measure>Evaluation of systemic symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of efficacy of ruxolitinib on systemic symptoms such as fever, sweating, fatigue and itching will be done via systemic symptoms Questionnaire designed for this purpose and completed at Baseline and then at Day1 of each visit during Induction and Maintenance period of the study</description>

Maintenance period: patients who achieve at least a stable disease (according Cheson 2007) at the end of cycle 6 and for whose a clinical benefit is observed according to the Investigator's opinion will be eligible for maintenance treatment by ruxolitinib twice daily every day of 28-day cycles.</description>
