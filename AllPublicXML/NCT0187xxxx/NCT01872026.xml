      To examine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety in patients with chronic kidney
      disease undergoing hemodialysis.

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and the effect of
           hemodialysis on PK of single oral administration of ASP7991 in Part 1.

        -  To assess the safety, PK and PD of repeated oral administration of ASP7991 in part 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:
