  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if taking a low dose of naltrexone in
      addition to an antidepressant medication can help treat relapse or recurrence in people with
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
      naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, but the FDA has not
      approved naltrexone to treat depression. The investigators hypothesize that patients with
      breakthrough depression on an antidepressant regimen containing a pro-dopaminergic agent
      assigned to treatment with low dose naltrexone will demonstrate higher rates of response
      compared to those patients taking placebo.

      We carried out a pilot double-blind, randomized, controlled study of low-dose naltrexone
      (LDN) 1 mg b.i.d. versus placebo augmentation in MDD patients who relapsed on dopaminergic
      agents. The primary aim was to test the hypothesis that patients experiencing depressive
      breakthrough would demonstrate greater improvement in their depression when supplementing
      their current antidepressant regimen with LDN versus placebo, with no significant difference
      in side effects.

      Boston area men and women with MDD were recruited from 01/13/2014-11/11/2014 via
      Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved newspaper, television, internet, and radio ads
      initiated by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Boston Clinical Trials (BCT). Screened
      and eligible patients returned one week later for a baseline visit and were randomized
      consecutively to double-blind treatment with placebo or LDN 1 mg b.i.d. The randomization
      list was generated by an online randomization program and maintained by the research
      pharmacist. Subjects were treated for 3 weeks, with weekly assessments. All subjects were
      required to continue on their baseline antidepressant regimen without changes for the
      duration of the study; they were likewise asked not to modify any other allowed baseline
      medications that they had been taking prior to entering the study. Adherence was determined
      by weekly pill counts; protocol violation was defined as less than 80% adherence.

      Side effects were assessed at every visit using the Systematic Assessment for Treatment
      Emergent Effects-Specific Inquiry (SAFTEE-SI) scale (Levine and Schooler, 1992) and
      categorized by severity as: 0-none, 1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe. Because some SAFTEE items
      could be present at baseline, particularly in a sample of subjects taking antidepressants
      that could themselves produce side effects, we defined as treatment-emergent any SAFTEE side
      effect for which severity increased by two or more levels (e.g. from none to moderate or from
      mild to severe) from baseline (Mischoulon et al., 2014). Frequency of side effect was based
      on the number of patients reporting the side effect at any time during the study.

      Suicidal ideation was assessed at each visit using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HAM-D). Subjects considered to be at high risk for suicide were discontinued and referred
      for further evaluation and hospitalization if clinically indicated. Subjects were also
      discontinued for any emergence of hypomania, mania, or psychosis; a Clinical Global
      Improvement (CGI-I) score greater than 5 (e.g., score of 6 or 7); evidence of illicit drug
      use or problematic alcohol use.

      At the end of the double-blind study, both responders and non-responders who completed the
      double-blind phase had the option of receiving open-label adjunctive treatment with LDN for 3
      more weeks.

      Paired and independent samples t-tests and their nonparametric counterparts (Wilcoxon's
      signed ranks and Mann-Whitney U tests) were used to examine and compare outcomes for each
      treatment arm. All analyses were two-tailed. Response and remission rates, and emergence of
      side effects were compared by Fisher's exact test. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated by
      Cohen's d (Cohen, 1988), for between-subjects comparisons (changes in depression scales from
      baseline to end for LDN vs. placebo) and for within-subjects comparisons (changes in
      depression scales from baseline to end for each separate treatment group). Correlation
      coefficients were calculated for use in within-subjects comparisons. Statistical analyses
      were carried out using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).

    <measure>Change in HAM-D-17 Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAM-D-17) item. The change in scores depends on the difference between the initial (baseline) score and the final score at the conclusion of the double blind treatment period. There is no formal range of score changes, since they depend on the initial and final score. A negative score represents a lowering in the score from baseline to end (improvement), and a positive score indicates an increase in score from baseline to end (worsening). A zero score would indicate no change. In theory, the maximum drop in score would be from 52 to zero, or -52. A maximum increase would be from 18 (the minimum score required for admission) to 52, or +34.</description>

The change in scores depends on the difference between the initial (baseline) score and the final score at the conclusion of the double blind treatment period. There is no formal range of score changes, since they depend on the initial and final score. A negative score represents a lowering in the score from baseline to end (improvement), and a positive score indicates an increase in score from baseline to end (worsening). A zero score would indicate no change. In theory, the maximum drop in score would be from 81 to zero, or -81. A maximum increase would be from 18 (the minimum score required for admission) to 81, or +63.</description>

    <measure>Change in MADRS-10 Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale- 10 item. The change in scores depends on the difference between the initial (baseline) score and the final score at the conclusion of the double blind treatment period. There is no formal range of score changes, since they depend on the initial and final score. A negative score represents a lowering in the score from baseline to end (improvement), and a positive score indicates an increase in score from baseline to end (worsening). A zero score would indicate no change. In theory, the maximum drop in score would be from 60 to zero, or -60. There is no minimum score on the MADRS-10 required for study entry, since the HAMD-17 was the sole entry criteria. However, a score of 18 on the HAMD17 corresponds to approximately a score of 21 on the MADRS-10. A maximum estimated increase would thus be from 21 to 60, or +39.</description>

The change in scores depends on the difference between the initial (baseline) score and the final score at the conclusion of the double blind treatment period. There is no formal range of score changes, since they depend on the initial and final score. A negative score represents a lowering in the score from baseline to end (improvement), and a positive score indicates an increase in score from baseline to end (worsening). A zero score would indicate no change. In theory, the maximum drop in score would be from 90 to zero, or -90. There is no minimum score on the MADRS-15 required for study entry, since the HAMD-17 was the sole entry criteria. However, a score of 18 on the HAMD17 corresponds to approximately a score of 21 on the MADRS-10. A maximum estimated increase would thus be from 21 to 90, or +69.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CGI-S Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Improvement-Severity Scale. The CGI-S score is a one-item scale that measures severity of depression, scored from 1-7, where 1 = no depression is present, 2 = borderline depression, 3 = mild depression, 4 = moderate depression, 5 = marked depression, 6 = severe depression, and 7 = among the most extremely depressed patient. Thus higher scores indicate greater depressive severity. The change in CGI-S score can represent a drop from 7 (maximum severity) to 1 (no depression) or -6. There is no minimum CGI-S score required for admission, but a minimum score of 18 on the HAMD17 corresponds to approximately a score of 4 on the CGI-S. Thus a maximum worsening would be from 4 to 7, or +3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Final CGI-I Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Improvement-Improvement Scale. The CGI-I scale is a one item scale that measures overall change in patient's global condition compared to when they were entered into the study. The scale is graded from 1-7, where 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Thus higher scores indicate greater worsening, and lower scores indicate greater improvement. The lowest possible score (indicating maximum improvement) is 1, and the highest possible score (indicating greatest worsening) is 7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Response rate after 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as an improvement in HAM-D-17 score of greater than or equal to 50% compared to baseline score. Response rate is the percent of patients who attain this threshold degree of improvement.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-65.

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria by Structured Clinical
             Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I/P) for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), current.

          -  Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self-Rated (QIDS-SR) score of at least
             12 at both screen and baseline visits.

          -  Received treatment with either an Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) in
             combination with a dopaminergic agent, or with an antidepressant with a dopaminergic
             mechanism of action in adequate doses, achieved remission per American College of
             Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) Task Force guidelines for ≥3 months, currently in
             relapse or recurrence without dose change for at least the past 4 weeks, based on
             meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD.

               1. Dopaminergic agents here include classical stimulants from the amphetamine or
                  methylphenidate families; dopamine agonists (e.g. pramipexole); or dopamine
                  active antidepressants like bupropion.

               2. Additionally, low dose (&lt; 2.5 mg) Abilify, a D2 partial agonist, is believed to
                  exert pro-dopaminergic effects and will therefore be included as a dopamine
                  agent.

               3. Sertraline, although classified as an SSRI, has dopamine reuptake inhibiting
                  properties believed to be relevant at higher doses (&gt; 150 mg of sertraline), and
                  will also therefore be considered a dopaminergic antidepressant at dose range
                  above.

               4. Based on the finding that the norepinephrine transporter is the reuptake
                  inhibitor for dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and the robust sustained clinical
                  response of a patient on duloxetine and low dose naltrexone, we include
                  duloxetine, traditionally classed as an SNRI, among the dopamine acting
                  antidepressants.)

          -  During the baseline visit, patients must be on a stable dose of antidepressant regimen
             for the past 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women or women of child bearing potential who are not using a medically
             accepted means of contraception (to include oral contraceptive or implant, condom,
             diaphragm, spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or partner with
             vasectomy).

          -  Patients who no longer meet DSM-IV criteria for MDD during the baseline visit.

          -  Patients who demonstrate a greater than 25% decrease in depressive symptoms as
             reflected by the QIDS-SR total score - screen to baseline.

          -  Serious suicide or homicide risk, as assessed by evaluating clinician.

          -  Unstable medical illness including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory,
             endocrine, neurological, or hematological disease.

          -  Substance use disorders active within the last six months, any bipolar disorder
             (current or past), any psychotic disorder (current or past).

          -  History of a seizure disorder or clinical evidence of untreated hypothyroidism.

          -  Patients requiring excluded medications (including but not limited to chronic or
             episodic use of anorexiants, episodic hormones, episodic benzodiazepines, episodic
             insulin, episodic and other episodic psychotropic medications).

          -  Psychotic features in the current episode or a history of psychotic features, as
             assessed by SCID.

          -  History of naltrexone intolerance at any dose.

          -  Patients with a history of antidepressant-induced hypomania.

          -  Inadequate exposure time or dose of current SSRI or Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
             inhibitor (SNRI); failure to comply with at least 80% of doses.

          <description>The HAMD-17 contains 17 items covering different depression symptoms. Items are rated on a 0-4 point or 0-2 point scale, where 0 means the symptom is NOT present; higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. Nine items are graded from 0-4 and eight items are rated from 0-2. The highest possible total score on the instrument is 52 and the lowest score is zero. The higher the total score, the greater the depressive severity. As a general guideline, the following total score ranges suggest differing degrees of depression: None = 0-7, Mild = 8-15, Moderate = 16-25, Severe = 26 or greater.</description>

Twelve items are graded from 0-4, one from 0-3, and fifteen from 0-2. The highest possible score is 81 and the lowest is 0. higher score means greater severity. Items 18-28 characterize additional symptoms--hypersomnia, hyperphagia, depersonalization, paranoia, and obsessive-compulsive. Overall severity is assessedon the basis of the total score from the first 17 items: None:0-7, Mild:8-15, Moderate:16-25, Severe: &gt;=26.</description>

Items are equally weighted and scored from 0-6, where 0 indicates that the symptom is NOT present and higher scores indicate greater severity. Thus the highest possible total score on the instrument is 60 and the lowest possible score is zero. The higher the total score, the greater the depressive severity. As a general guideline, the following total score ranges suggest differing degrees of depression: None = 0-6, Mild = 7-19, Moderate = 20-34, Severe = 35 or greater.</description>

          <description>The CGI-S score is a one-item scale that measures severity of depression, scored from 1-7, where 1 = no depression is present, 2 = borderline depression, 3 = mild depression, 4 = moderate depression, 5 = marked depression, 6 = severe depression, and 7 = among the most extremely depressed patient. Thus higher scores indicate greater depressive severity.</description>

        <title>Change in HAM-D-17 Total Score</title>
        <description>Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAM-D-17) item. The change in scores depends on the difference between the initial (baseline) score and the final score at the conclusion of the double blind treatment period. There is no formal range of score changes, since they depend on the initial and final score. A negative score represents a lowering in the score from baseline to end (improvement), and a positive score indicates an increase in score from baseline to end (worsening). A zero score would indicate no change. In theory, the maximum drop in score would be from 52 to zero, or -52. A maximum increase would be from 18 (the minimum score required for admission) to 52, or +34.</description>

There is no formal range of score changes, since they depend on the initial and final score.

A zero score would indicate no change. In theory, the maximum drop in score would be from 60 to zero, or -60. There is no minimum score on the MADRS-10 required for study entry, since the HAMD-17 was the sole entry criteria. However, a score of 18 on the HAMD17 corresponds to approximately a score of 21 on the MADRS-10. A maximum estimated increase would thus be from 21 to 60, or +39.</description>

        <description>Clinical Global Improvement-Improvement Scale. The CGI-I scale is a one item scale that measures overall change in patient’s global condition compared to when they were entered into the study. The scale is graded from 1-7, where 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Thus higher scores indicate greater worsening, and lower scores indicate greater improvement. The lowest possible score (indicating maximum improvement) is 1, and the highest possible score (indicating greatest worsening) is 7.</description>
