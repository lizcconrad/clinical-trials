  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of tissue pressure
      monitoring only (Control group) vs. tissue pressure monitoring plus tissue ultrafiltration
      (Treatment group) in patients with tibia fractures presenting to the trauma or emergency
      departments at participating clinical sites. Tissue ultrafiltration refers to the removal of
      muscle interstitial fluid by the ECSPRESS PMFC. The primary objective of the study is to
      demonstrate whether the removal of interstitial fluid by the ECSPRESS PMFC/FC catheters
      decrease the incidence of fasciotomy in the Treatment group when compared to the Control
      group. Fasciotomy was chosen as the primary outcome because it is clearly defined and
      clinically relevant; reduction of fasciotomy is of clear clinical benefit. Enrolled patients
      may have isolated tibia fractures OR be multiple trauma patients (those with another major
      fracture in a different body region or two distinct body system injuries, excluding those
      with injuries to the opposite leg that would preclude them from completing required tests).

      Eligible patients who are enrolled in the study will receive standard surgical stabilization
      within 72 hours of injury. All Subjects will receive the Twin Star ECSPRESS catheters, which
      will be inserted at the end of the surgical procedure to stabilize the tibia fracture and
      will be connected to the pressure monitor in the operating room or immediately upon arrival
      in the recovery room. The catheters will be used for up to 24-hours after surgical fixation
      of the affected lower leg in order to (1) measure and record muscle compartment pressure, and
      (2) remove interstitial fluid in the subset of subjects that are randomized to the Treatment
      Group. Subjects will be followed closely during the 24 hours the catheter is inserted to
      gather muscle pressure data, occurrance of a fasciotomy, adverse events, etc. and then
      followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study enrollment after which
      the subjects participation in the study will be completed. There will no interim data
      analysis of the study outcomes during the conduct of this study. Data analysis and
      presentation of the data will be made after study closure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Subject with an isolated tibial shaft fracture requiring intramedullary nailing, or
             bicondylar tibial plateau fracture or tibial plateau fracture-knee dislocation
             requiring application of a knee-spanning external fixator. OR Subject with an isolated
             tibial shaft fracture requiring intramedullary nailing, or bicondylar tibial plateau
             fracture or tibial plateau fracture-knee dislocation requiring application of a
             knee-spanning external fixator AND another major fracture in a different body region
             or injuries to one other major organ system (head, chest, abdomen, pelvis,
             genitourinary, or spine) excluding those with injuries to the opposite leg that would
             preclude them from completing required tests (see exclusion criteria).

          -  • Subject with an isolated tibial shaft fracture requiring intramedullary nailing, or
             bicondylar tibial plateau fracture or tibial plateau fracture-knee dislocation
             requiring application of a knee-spanning external fixator AND another major fracture
             in a different body region or injuries to one other major organ system (head, chest,
             abdomen, pelvis, genitourinary, or spine) excluding those with injuries to the
             opposite leg that would preclude them from completing required tests (see exclusion
             criteria).

        All Subjects

          -  Operative procedure (nailing or external fixation) performed within 72 hours of
             injury.

          -  The Subject is at least 18 years of age and no older than 44 years of age. Subject or
             legally acceptable representative must able to understand what he/she is being asked
             to do, willing/able to understand and sign the Informed Consent to return for the
             required follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-surgery.
             A legally acceptable representative may sign the Informed Consent on the patient's
             behalf.

          -  In the study investigators opinion, patient's co-morbidity condition(s) at enrollment
             WILL allow patient to return and complete the required testing for all return visits
             for the duration of this 12-month clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Current evidence of CS prior to the decision regarding enrollment. Surgical
             stabilization that resulted in the presence of a bead pouch, VAC, negative-pressure
             wound therapy device, or other dressing that would interfere with placement of any of
             the four catheters in the anterior deep posterior compartments.

               -  The Subject has a medical condition(s) that precludes use of catheters, such as
                  dermatologic conditions, immunological deficits, or traumatic skin lesions that
                  interfere with Catheter placement.

               -  An Injury to the ipsilateral knee, ankle, and/or foot that would influence
                  results of muscle testing.

               -  Opposite leg knee injury or tibia, ankle, foot fracture, or any other injury that
                  would preclude or influence the results of mechanical muscle testing.

               -  Incision into the anterior or deep posterior compartments of the leg to be
                  studied that would release the fascia as this would constitute a partial
                  fasciotomy and would affect leg pressures.

               -  The Subject is currently enrolled in one or more clinical studies.

               -  Likely problems, in the investigator's judgment, with maintaining follow-up
                  (including developmental delay, address greater than 2 hours drive from the
                  treating institution, substance abuse problems, intoxication, current or pending
                  incarceration, etc.).
