    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind (evaluator) study. Enrolled patients had a
      traumatic meniscal tear and underwent meniscectomy. The study included 6 weeks (12 visits) of
      standard or quadriceps intensive rehabilitation. The objective of the study was to determine
      the effect of quadriceps intensive rehabilitation on knee function and articular cartilage.

    <measure>Change in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery) to 7 weeks post-surgery (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC is a measure of self-reported knee function and includes items related to symptoms and functional activity. Responses on the IKDC subjective knee form will be recorded on hard-copy and the summary score computed. The highest (best) possible score is 100 points and the lowest (worst) possible score is 0 points.</description>

    <measure>Change in Tibial Articular Cartilage Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery) to 1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the knee will be acquired and software will be used to quantify tibial articular cartilage volume.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single Leg Forward Hop Index</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks post-surgery (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Three trials of the single leg forward hop will be collected on each side. Distance will be averaged across trials. The single leg hop index will be computed as [(distance on the surgical side/distance on the non-surgical side) *100]</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Urinary Concentrations of C-terminal Crosslinking Telopeptide of Type II Collagen (CTX-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-surgery) to 7 weeks post-surgery (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>CTX-II is a biomarker of Type II collagen degradation. Early-morning, second void, fasting urine samples will be collected and stored. Concentrations of CTX-II will be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, corrected for creatine concentration, and log-transformed. Creatinine concentration will also be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</description>
