      STUDY OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of
      implementing measures in the ICU, based on a physiological algorithm, to reverse decreases in
      cerebral oxygen saturation using, near infrared-reflected spectroscopy (NIRS).

      WHAT IS INVOLVED: Randomization of 50 patients is balanced by experimental group; control and
      intervention, with an allocation sequence based on a block size of ten, generated with a
      computer random number generator. In the INTERVENTION group ICU Staff will use NIRS to follow
      a physiologically guided strategy to maintain rSO2 within 90% of baseline values. In the
      CONTROL group ICU Staff will provide standard of care without the use of NIRS.

      Background and Rationale Cerebral desaturation has previously been shown to be associated
      with significant morbidity in cardiac surgery postoperatively. As such, previously reported
      efforts have been aimed at treating intraoperative desaturation events, with early evidence
      suggesting that this may reduce the incidence of these adverse events. Our previous study,
      NIRS ICU (B2011:110) has demonstrated that significant cerebral oxygen desaturation [measured
      using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) derived cerebral oximetry] frequently occurs in the
      intensive care unit (ICU) within the first 24 hours following cardiac surgery. To date, no
      studies have addressed the early postoperative period (i.e. in the ICU) with respect to
      treating (and/or preventing) these desaturation events.

      Specific Aims and Experimental Design The specific aim of this pilot prospective
      interventional trial is to determine the feasibility/efficacy of treating cerebral oxygen
      desaturation in the ICU following cardiac surgery. Two groups of patients will be studied.
      Both groups will have cerebral saturation measured continuously both intraoperatively and
      postoperatively. The control group however, will have these measurements blinded to the
      intraoperative and postoperative caregivers. The interventional group will have the cerebral
      oximetry measurements available to the intraoperative and postoperative care team allowing
      them to intervene when a desaturation event occurs. If a cerebral desaturation occurs,
      defined as a decline in saturation of 10% from the patient's preoperative baseline, then a
      previously utilized interventional algorithm, NORMOSAT (B2012:005), will be instituted to
      reverse the decrease in cerebral saturation, ideally preventing it from becoming a clinically
      meaningful desaturation (previously defined by others as saturation decline of 25% from the
      baseline). The algorithm used addresses many of the known causes of desaturation, including
      low arterial oxygen content (both saturation and hemoglobin) and cardiac output influences on
      cerebral blood flow. As such, if a desaturation occurs, the patient will first have the PaO2
      increased by increasing the inspired oxygen content. The PaCO2 will also be normalized by
      adjusting the ventilator settings. The cardiac output will be optimized and the blood
      pressure will be increased with standard ICU protocols to administer phenylephrine. If
      remaining low, the patients will be transfused to standard of care hemoglobin levels.

      In this pilot trial, a convenience sample of 50 consecutive consenting patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery employing CPB will be studied. After obtaining consent, bilateral cerebral
      oximetry sensors will be placed on the forehead of patients prior to the induction of
      anesthesia. Baseline (breathing room air) regional cerebral saturation (rSO2) will be
      recorded. Following this, induction of anesthesia will occur and continuous NIRS measurements
      will be collected during the surgical procedure with continued monitoring occurring for the
      first 24 hours (or until discharge) within the ICU. In the control group, conventional
      anesthesia and ICU standards of care will be carried out throughout the study period. In the
      interventional group, an algorithm based on the modification of previously defined important
      physiologic variables will be initiated to reverse the desaturation (beginning when the
      saturation drops at least 10% from the baseline) that occurs in the OR and ICU.

    <description>Following the end of the 24 hour time period, the NIRS data will be downloaded and analyzed to determine the incidence in the two groups of postoperative cerebral desaturation, primarily defined by a relative reduction in the rSO2 more than 25% from the baseline pre-anesthesia induction. Furthermore, to determine the overall severity of desaturation, the area under the curve (AUC) for a desaturation less than the previously defined 75% of the baseline will be determined. In addition to assessments of endothelial function and delirium, additional patient data on any adverse events will be collected by reviewing the patient charts as well as by phone interview on post-operation day 30.</description>
