    <textblock>
      This Trial offers a reduction in patient burden, which is especially preferable in children
      with a poor compliance and poor performance status. This prospective randomized trial was
      extension to the previous controlled prospective study performed in Children's Cancer
      Hospital, Egypt and registered at clinicaltrials.com (NCT01635140). The ultimate aim of this
      work is to demonstrate noninferiority of the hypofractionated regimens relative to the
      conventional regimen in a controlled randomized clinical study.

      In this study will add a third arm in which we will increase in the total dose to 4500 cGy in
      15 fractions in 3 weeks may lead to improvement in Over-all survival or Progression-Free
      Survival.
