  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Desmoids tumors are benign soft tissues tumors characterized by aggressiveness and potential
      local recurrence. There is a female predominance with a sex ratio of 2/1 and median age at
      diagnosis is about 30 years.

      Only a complete surgical excision is recommended in desmoids tumors. Some forms of desmoid
      tumors are recurrent and/or symptomatic and are not accessible to a conservative surgical
      treatment. In these clinical situations, only a medical treatment may achieve tumor control
      and quality of life maintenance. Place of systemic treatments in the management of desmoids
      tumors is poorly evaluated. Regarding chemotherapy, methotrexate and vinblastine protocol is
      actually the best evaluated combination, which allowed observing objective response rate
      between 40 and 75%. Toxicity was mainly marked by the risk of haematological toxicity.

      Pazopanib is an inhibitor of multi-target tyrosine kinase, in oral form, with selective type
      receptors -1, -2 and -3 of VEGF receptors on the PDGFA and B, and c-Kit. It is currently
      under clinical development in humans in the treatment of several tumor types.

      This is a Phase II, randomized, multicenter, open label trial, evaluating efficacy and safety
      of pazopanib versus a chemotherapy protocol combining methotrexate and vinblastine in
      progressive and symptomatic desmoid tumors.

      This study will include 72 patients in 15 centers of the French Sarcoma Group.

      Patients will be treated according to therapeutic strategy allocated by randomization until
      documented RECIST progression and for a maximum of 12 months :

        -  Arm A = experimental strategy: daily oral administration of pazopanib.

        -  Arm B = reference strategy: methotrexate-vinblastine.

      In case of documented radiological progression (RECIST criteria):

        -  Patients initially included in arm A will have the opportunity, as determined by the
           investigator, to receive arm B treatment, or leave the study,

        -  Patients initially included in arm B will have the opportunity, as determined by the
           investigator, to receive arm A treatment, or leave the study.
