      The propose of study is to study if an informative intervention and a structured follow-up
      carried out in health centres of primary care in patients with chronic kidney failure, stage
      3, is more effective than the current follow-up in slowing the disease progression measured
      by the glomerular filtration rate.

      Main objective: To study if an informative intervention and a structured follow-up carried
      out in health centres of primary care in patients with chronic kidney failure, stages 3, is
      more effective than the current follow-up in slowing the disease progression measured by the
      glomerular filtration rate .

      Secondary objectives: Determining the effectiveness of the intervention to improve the blood
      pressure control of the patients with chronic kidney failure and to improve the degree of
      control of the glucose levels and glycosylated haemoglobin of the diabetic patients with
      chronic kidney failure.

      Design: A clinical trial controlled with a random assignment by conglomerates with parallel
      groups.

      Setting: Multi-centre study in Primary Care Health Centres(Madrid Health Service).

      Subjects of the study: 540 patients over 18 years old, diagnosed of light-moderate chronic
      kidney failure that consent to participate.

      Data collection: The variable of the main answer will be the creatinine clearance measured in
      ml/min. Demographic variables of morbidity and prognosis: clinical, analytical,
      anthropometrical, adherence to processing and consumption of medicines will be collected.

      Intervention: Initial educational session based on the significant learning and quarterly
      follow-up in surgery of medicine and nursing for 2 years.

      Analysis: By intention of treating. Descriptive statistics of each variable and statistical
      analytical univariate and multivariate (multiple linear regression) will be carried out. The
      explanatory variable in the analysis multivariate will be the intervention group.
