    <textblock>
      This study compares the effects of isovolumetric (325 ml) preloads of chocolate milk
      supplemented with sodium alginates at incremental doses on inter-meal glucose levels,
      appetite scores and food intake in healthy adult men. The findings of this study will
      illustrate whether the addition of sodium alginate to chocolate milk will improve the
      glycemic properties of chocolate milk and will potentiate its satiating characteristics. This
      study will also elucidate whether sodium alginates, incorporated into chocolate milk, will
      influence glycemia, appetite sensations and food intake in a dose-dependent manner. It is
      hypothesized that there will be a synergy between milk and sodium alginate beyond either
      alone. When combined with milk components, sodium alginate is expected to improve glycemia
      and induce satiety more than does either milk alone or alginate alone.

Satiety scores (mm) were assessed using 100-mm &quot;Motivation to Eat&quot; visual analog scale questionnaires. A composite score of the four appetite questions, including Desire to Eat, Hunger, Fullness and Prospective Food Consumption, in the &quot;Motivation to Eat&quot; visual analog scale was calculated to obtain the average appetite score for statistical analysis.</description>

    <description>Food intake (kCal) was assessed 120 min after consumption of the treatments, using an ad libitum pizza lunch meal. Participants were asked to eat, during a 20-min period, until feeling comfortably full.</description>
