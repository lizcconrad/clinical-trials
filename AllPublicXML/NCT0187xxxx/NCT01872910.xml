    <measure>Part A: Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity Over the First 8 Hours Post-Dose Using VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 8 h post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was rated by the participant on a 100-mm VAS: 0 mm (no pain) and 100 mm (worst pain imaginable). The participant marked the line at the point that corresponded with his or her perception of pain. Weighted mean change from baseline was calculated as: [the area under the change in pain intensity versus time curve] / 8 hours (h). The baseline pain intensity was the pain assessment prior to dosing of study medication (0 h). Least Squares (LS) mean were calculated using a Bayesian analysis of covariance analysis (ANCOVA) adjusted for treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain VAS as a continuous covariate. The measure of dispersion reported is 95% Credible Interval (CrI) not Confidence Interval (CI). A negative direction indicates a pain reduction from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOPAR) Score at 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 Hours Post-Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 4, 0 to 6, 0 to 8, 0 to 12, and 0 to 24 h post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>TOPAR was calculated as the area under the pain relief versus time curve of the participant reported pain relief scores from the 5-point pain relief scale of 0 (no pain relief) to 4 (complete pain relief). LS mean were calculated using ANCOVA adjusted for treatment as a fixed effect. The measure of dispersion reported is CrI not CI. A negative direction indicated a pain relief from baseline.
Pre-Part B used 3 participants in order for the study site to develop proficiency in the dialysate placement, collection, and maintenance techniques. There were no planned efficacy analysis for Pre-Part B per protocol.</description>

    <measure>Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity Over the First 24 Hours Post-Dose as Measured by VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Part A and B: 0 to 4, 0 to 6, 0 to 12, and 0 to 24 h post-dose and Part B 0 to 8 h post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was rated by the participant on a 100-mm VAS: 0 mm (no pain) and 100 mm (worst pain imaginable). The participant marked the line at the point that corresponded with his or her perception of post oral surgery pain. Weighted mean change from baseline was calculated as: [area under the change in pain intensity versus time curve] / [time period that is (i.e.) 24 h for 0 to 24 h endpoint]. The baseline pain intensity was the pain assessment prior to dosing of study medication. LS mean were calculated using ANCOVA adjusted for treatment, time and interaction of treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain VAS as a continuous covariate. The measure of dispersion reported is the 95% CrI not CI. A negative direction indicated a pain reduction from baseline.
Pre-Part B used 3 participants in order for the study site to develop proficiency in the dialysate placement, collection, and maintenance techniques. There were no planned efficacy analysis for Pre-Part B per protocol.</description>

    <measure>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over the First 24 Hours Post-Dose as Measured by a 4-point Categorical Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 4, 0 to 6, 0 to 8, 0 to 12, and 0 to 24 h post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The summed (time-weighted) pain intensity difference to baseline (SPID) at 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h post-dosing, as measured by a participant-rated 4-point categorical scale of 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain) and was calculated as: the area under the change in pain intensity versus time curve. Total scores range: -24 (best) to 8 (worst) for SPID 0 to 8 h. Score ranges for SPID(0-4h), SPID(0-6), SPID(0-12) and SPID(0-24) are -12 to 4, -18 to 6, -36 to 12 and -72 to 24 respectively. Participants were required to have moderate (score=2) or severe (score=3) pain at baseline in order to be eligible for randomization.LS mean were calculated using ANCOVA and was adjusted for treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain intensity as a continuous covariate. The measure of dispersion reported is 95% CrI not CI. A negative direction indicated a pain reduction from baseline.
There were no planned efficacy analysis for Pre-Part B per protocol.</description>

        <title>Part A: Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity Over the First 8 Hours Post-Dose Using VAS</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was rated by the participant on a 100-mm VAS: 0 mm (no pain) and 100 mm (worst pain imaginable). The participant marked the line at the point that corresponded with his or her perception of pain. Weighted mean change from baseline was calculated as: [the area under the change in pain intensity versus time curve] / 8 hours (h). The baseline pain intensity was the pain assessment prior to dosing of study medication (0 h). Least Squares (LS) mean were calculated using a Bayesian analysis of covariance analysis (ANCOVA) adjusted for treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain VAS as a continuous covariate. The measure of dispersion reported is 95% Credible Interval (CrI) not Confidence Interval (CI). A negative direction indicates a pain reduction from baseline.</description>

          <title>Part A: Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity Over the First 8 Hours Post-Dose Using VAS</title>
          <description>Pain intensity was rated by the participant on a 100-mm VAS: 0 mm (no pain) and 100 mm (worst pain imaginable). The participant marked the line at the point that corresponded with his or her perception of pain. Weighted mean change from baseline was calculated as: [the area under the change in pain intensity versus time curve] / 8 hours (h). The baseline pain intensity was the pain assessment prior to dosing of study medication (0 h). Least Squares (LS) mean were calculated using a Bayesian analysis of covariance analysis (ANCOVA) adjusted for treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain VAS as a continuous covariate. The measure of dispersion reported is 95% Credible Interval (CrI) not Confidence Interval (CI). A negative direction indicates a pain reduction from baseline.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS): Part A participants who were randomly assigned to treatment who received at least 1 dose of study medication and who had at least 1 postdose efficacy assessment. Pain assessments after rescue medication were imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) from the pain assessment prior to rescue therapy.</population>

        <title>Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity Over the First 24 Hours Post-Dose as Measured by VAS</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was rated by the participant on a 100-mm VAS: 0 mm (no pain) and 100 mm (worst pain imaginable). The participant marked the line at the point that corresponded with his or her perception of post oral surgery pain. Weighted mean change from baseline was calculated as: [area under the change in pain intensity versus time curve] / [time period that is (i.e.) 24 h for 0 to 24 h endpoint]. The baseline pain intensity was the pain assessment prior to dosing of study medication. LS mean were calculated using ANCOVA adjusted for treatment, time and interaction of treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain VAS as a continuous covariate. The measure of dispersion reported is the 95% CrI not CI. A negative direction indicated a pain reduction from baseline.
Pre-Part B used 3 participants in order for the study site to develop proficiency in the dialysate placement, collection, and maintenance techniques. There were no planned efficacy analysis for Pre-Part B per protocol.</description>

        <population>FAS: All data from all participants randomly assigned to treatment who received at least 1 dose of study medication and who had at least 1 post-dose efficacy assessment. Pain assessments after rescue medication were imputed using LOCF from the pain assessment prior to rescue therapy.</population>

        <title>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over the First 24 Hours Post-Dose as Measured by a 4-point Categorical Scale</title>
        <description>The summed (time-weighted) pain intensity difference to baseline (SPID) at 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h post-dosing, as measured by a participant-rated 4-point categorical scale of 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain) and was calculated as: the area under the change in pain intensity versus time curve. Total scores range: -24 (best) to 8 (worst) for SPID 0 to 8 h. Score ranges for SPID(0-4h), SPID(0-6), SPID(0-12) and SPID(0-24) are -12 to 4, -18 to 6, -36 to 12 and -72 to 24 respectively. Participants were required to have moderate (score=2) or severe (score=3) pain at baseline in order to be eligible for randomization.LS mean were calculated using ANCOVA and was adjusted for treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain intensity as a continuous covariate.

          <title>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over the First 24 Hours Post-Dose as Measured by a 4-point Categorical Scale</title>
          <description>The summed (time-weighted) pain intensity difference to baseline (SPID) at 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h post-dosing, as measured by a participant-rated 4-point categorical scale of 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain) and was calculated as: the area under the change in pain intensity versus time curve. Total scores range: -24 (best) to 8 (worst) for SPID 0 to 8 h. Score ranges for SPID(0-4h), SPID(0-6), SPID(0-12) and SPID(0-24) are -12 to 4, -18 to 6, -36 to 12 and -72 to 24 respectively. Participants were required to have moderate (score=2) or severe (score=3) pain at baseline in order to be eligible for randomization.LS mean were calculated using ANCOVA and was adjusted for treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain intensity as a continuous covariate. The measure of dispersion reported is 95% CrI not CI. A negative direction indicated a pain reduction from baseline.
