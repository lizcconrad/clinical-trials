      This is a prospective non-interventional observational study to evaluate the treatment of
      moderately active RA patients in every day clinical practice in Austria. Patients will be
      observed over 52 weeks. The primary endpoint will be percentage of patients who reach CDAI
      remission after 24 weeks.

        Patients with moderately active RA that are treated with Etanercept will be studied. All
        patients enrolled should meet the usual prescribing criteria for Etanercept as per the
        Austrian SmPC and should be entered into the study at the investigator's discretion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is eligible to receive Etanercept treatment according to the Austrian
             SmPC.

          2. The decision to treat the patient with Etanercept has been made independently by the
             physician and is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the
             study. The treatment decision was made in advance and is not dependent on the
             protocol.

          3. The patient was informed about the study and gave his/her consent and signed an
             Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) submitted written Informed Consent form on use of
             the data.

          4. The patient has moderately active RA, defined as a disease activity of CDAI &gt;10 and
             ≤22 and/or DAS28 (CRP)&gt;3.2 and ≤ 5.1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any contraindication according to the Austrian SmPC, which includes:

             A hypersensitivity to any component of Etanercept, active tuberculosis or any other
             serious infection.

          2. Patient has previously participated in this study.
