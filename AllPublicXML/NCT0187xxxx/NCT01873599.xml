  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators plan to recruit 70 patients reporting high levels of stress
      to test the impact of Positive Affect Journaling. Patients randomized to use the online
      intervention will be asked to journal about one of seven topics, several days each week, for
      three months. The topics (e.g., &quot;What went well&quot;) are designed to help the individual focus
      on some positive aspect of their life or themselves over the past day. Each topic is based on
      prompts shown to be effective in studies of up to one week in duration. In the summer of
      2012, our research team pilot tested each prompt with 20 patients with high levels of
      anxiety, which led to important changes to the prompts, to increase their potential impact.
      The main aim is to understand the impact of Positive Affect Journaling on psychological
      distress, as measured by the National Health Interview Survey.
