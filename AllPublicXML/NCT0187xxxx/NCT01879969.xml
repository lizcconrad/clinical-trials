  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the study were to measure and compare the rates of alignment and cant
      reduction of the dental and facial midlines among the two groups.

      The purpose of this randomized, controlled, clinical study, was to evaluate the most accurate
      procedure for orthognathic correction of facial asymmetry. The investigators compared two
      different methods of surgical planning: classical (esthetic analysis of the face,
      cephalometric study of the skull in lateral and posteroanterior cephalograms, analysis and
      surgical simulation of plaster casts mounted in semi-individual articulators, development of
      a surgical acrylic resin intermediate splint) and digital planning (cone-beam computed
      tomography, data acquisition, software-assisted virtual surgery -Maxilim; Medicim, Mechelen,
      Belgium- and CAD/CAM processing of the surgical intermediate splint).
