      The purpose of the trial is to confirm the validity and reliability of diagnostic SI joint
      blocks.

      Subjects with suspected SI joint pain will undergo 3 SI joint blocks, 2 with local anesthetic
      and 1 sham block.

      The sequence of blocks is randomly assigned. This study examines both the test-retest
      reliability of response to diagnostic sacroiliac (SI) joint injection and the specificity of
      response to local anesthetic or sham block. The goal of the study is to validate the use of
      diagnostic SI joint block.

      Subjects with pain suspected to be generated by one SI joint will undergo three diagnostic SI
      joint blocks each separated by one week. Two blocks will be with local anesthetic (LA) and
      one will be a sham block (SB). Both the Coordinator (collecting pain assessments) and subject
      will be blinded to the sequence of blocks (LA or SB each time). The sequence of blocks will
      be randomly assigned for each subject on study. The subject's participation in the study is
      complete after 6-month post-procedure assessment.
