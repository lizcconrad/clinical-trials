      This phase II trial studies how well bevacizumab, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and
      oxaliplatin before surgery works in treating patients with stage II-III rectal cancer.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil,
      leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab
      together with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin may be an effective treatment
      for rectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if six cycles of modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin
      (mFOLFOX7) plus bevacizumab (Avastin) will yield complete pathologic response (cPR) of 25% or
      more in the primary tumor of patients with stage II and III rectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the rate of tumor regression (pathologic stage lower than clinical stage) after
      6 cycles of mFOLFOX7 and bevacizumab in the primary rectal cancer.

      II. To assess local recurrence rate over 3 years after 6 cycles of mFOLFOX7 and bevacizumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of the following marker with response (defined as CPR or down staging):

        -  Intratumoral Gene expression and germline polymorphism of genes involved in the vascular
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF independent pathways (VEGF, vascular
           endothelial growth factor receptor 1 [VEGFR1], VEGFR2, interleukin-8 [IL8], chemokine
           (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 [CXCR2], intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], VEGFR1 and
           VEGFR2, neuropilin 1 or 2 [NRP1,2], cluster of differentiation [CD] 44, aldehyde
           dehydrogenase [ALDH], leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like [LRIG].

        -  Circulating tumor cells (CTC) and VEGF-factor A (A) on the CTC.

      II. Prediction of surgical resection margin by pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 6-8 weeks after treatment, patients undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
