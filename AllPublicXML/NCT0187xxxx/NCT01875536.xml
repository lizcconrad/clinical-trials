  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given previous evidence that non invasive brain stimulation enhances the effects of
      conventional therapies, this randomized sham-controlled trial with 4-weeks follow-up aimed to
      determine if the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)combined with
      conventional physical therapy (VRT) would be superior to physical therapy in improving upper
      limb function and quality of life with chronic stroke individuals.

    <measure>Change from Modified Ashworth scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 1 month and 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) uses a 6-point scale to score the average resistance to passive movement for each joint. In this study, the tonus of the wrist flexor muscles was tested</description>

    <description>assess the effects of the intervention (rTMS and physical therapy) on spinal excitability as measured by the change The Hmax/Mmax ratio (calculated by dividing the maximal amplitude of the H wave by that of the M wave in median nerve) before (baseline), after treatment and after follow-up</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change from Fugl-Meyer assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 1 month and 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) is considered the gold standard for evaluating the motor function recovery. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation, and joint functioning. It is applied within clinical and in research contexts to determine the disease severity, describe motor recovery, and plan and assess interventions. In the present study, the 33-item of the UL section was employed. The items are rated on 3-point ordinal scale, as follows: 0= unable to perform; 1= partial ability to perform; and 2= near normal ability to perform. The UL subscale evaluates motor function recovery in six domains: flexor and extensor synergies, non-synergic movements, wrist and hand movements, and coordination and speed</description>

    <measure>change from cortical excitability via single transcranial magnetic stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>per-session: at baseline and one hour (after physical therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>assess the effects of the intervention (rTMS and physical therapy) on motor cortex excitability as measured by the change in motor evoked potential (using transcranial magnetic stimulation) before and after each session</description>

    <measure>change from stroke specific quality of life scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 1 month and 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>the stroke specific quality of life scale (SSQOL) is used to provide an assessment of health-related quality of life specific to patients with stroke. The scale is a self-report (reference to the past two weeks) containing 49 items distributed into 12 domains (mobility, energy, upper extremity function, work/productivity, mood, self-care, social roles, family roles, vision, language, thinking and personality), rated on a 5-point scale. The total score (maximum 245) and the upper extremity function scores (maximum of 25) can be considered for analyses. The Brazilian version of the SSQOL was used in this study</description>
