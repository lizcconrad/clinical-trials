  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is developed to evaluate the effect of ELAD on overall survival (OS) in
      subjects with acute liver failure (ALF) compared to matched historical controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VTI-212 is an open-label, multicenter, historically-controlled study of subjects with acute
      liver failure (ALF). Approximately 40 subjects who meet the eligibility requirements of the
      study will receive ELAD treatment in addition to standard of care treatment for ALF. The
      outcomes of these subjects will be compared with matched historical controls drawn from
      existing databases.

      Subjects will undergo ELAD treatment for a minimum of 3 days (72 hours). It is recommended
      ELAD treatment be continued up to 10 days (240 hours).

      Following ELAD treatment, subjects will continue standard medical therapy as defined by the
      institution and be followed through Study Day 28.

      Subjects' diagnosis of ALF will be attributed to one of the following:

        1. FHF (acute liver failure with no preexisting liver disease);

        2. Primary Graft Non-Function (PNF);

        3. Surgically-Induced Liver Failure (including subjects with small for size liver
           transplants, living donor liver transplants, and subjects with risk of ALF following
           liver cancer surgery.

      Screening evaluations and assessments will be completed for subjects and reviewed against
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Enrollment will define the time of study entry (Hour 0, Study Day 1, study baseline) and
      inclusion in the ITT population. Subjects will be evaluated throughout the 28-day study
      period.

      If standard medical therapy, as defined by the institution and this protocol is consistent
      with discharging the subject home, then the subject should be discharged. Prior to discharge,
      the subject will be advised to attend all follow-up visits.

      An extension of this study, VTI-212E, will provide additional ELAD survival data, as
      available, through VTI-212 study termination (after the last surviving enrolled ELAD subject
      completes Study Day 28). This registry protocol segment of VTI-212 extends the safety
      monitoring period to 5 years to assess survival, incidence and characterization of tumor (in
      particular hepatocellular tumor), incidence of liver transplant, and assess quality of life
      using a standard, validated questionnaire.

    <description>A chi-square test will be used to evaluate and compare the proportion of ITT ELAD vs matched historical control subjects who survived at the End of Study Day 28 or who received orthotopic liver transplantation on or before that Study Day. In addition, the above proportion for ELAD subjects will be compared with the comparable aggregate historical control proportion from the historical control population that most closely matches the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this protocol.</description>
