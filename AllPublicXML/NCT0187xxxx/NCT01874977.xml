  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of this project is to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of the impact of
      a practical, low cost physical activity intervention on fatigue among persons with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). Fatigue has been identified as a major concern for individuals with RA, and
      is considered a core outcome measure for RA. Our recent study of the sources of fatigue
      identified physical inactivity as a primary predictor of fatigue. Studies have examined the
      impact of exercise interventions on RA outcomes, but most of these interventions have focused
      on pain or function as outcomes. The few exercise studies examining fatigue suggest that
      increasing physical activity reduces fatigue, but the interventions have been
      resource-intensive, requiring specially trained personnel to administer them, highly
      structured activities, and/or attendance at classes or a specified facility. Each of these
      components increases the cost and barriers to implementation of an intervention. Pedometers
      have been shown to be an effective means of increasing physical activity, and could form the
      basis of a simple means to increase physical activity.

      This project will test the effect of a simple pedometer-based intervention, with two
      incremental degrees of guidance, on increasing physical activity and decreasing fatigue.
      Three groups (n=40 in each) will be studied: a control group with an educational pamphlet
      only, a pedometer-only intervention group, and a pedometer group with step targets. Both
      intervention groups will keep step-count diaries. Groups will be followed over 20 weeks. We
      expect that (1) the pedometer-only intervention group will increase activity more than the
      education group, and the group with step-count targets will demonstrate even greater
      increases in activity; and (2) greater increases in activity will be associated with greater
      decreases in fatigue. Secondary outcome measures will include depressive symptoms,
      self-reported sleep quality, and body composition. Our overall goal is to demonstrate an
      effective, yet simple and low cost, physical activity intervention to decrease fatigue that
      could be broadly accessible and have the potential for wide implementation.

    <description>This group will receive the educational booklet and discussion, plus a pedometer and a diary to record their daily step counts from the pedometer. Participants will be shown how to wear the pedometer, and instructed to wear it from the time they get out of bed in the morning until they go to bed at night, except while showering or bathing. (If any subjects begin a swimming- or cycling-based activity program, we will ask them to remove the pedometer at that time but track the time they are in the water. Step counts will be adjusted to account for this time by adding 150 steps for every minute engaged in swimming and/or cycling.)</description>
