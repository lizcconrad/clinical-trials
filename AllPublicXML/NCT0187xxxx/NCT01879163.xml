        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to enter the trial:

          -  Healthy adult aged 18-55 years

          -  Resident in or near Oxford (for CCVTM) or Birmingham (for WTCRF) and able to travel to
             Oxford for vaccination for the duration of the trial period

          -  No relevant findings in medical history or on physical examination

          -  Confirmation of prior vaccination with BCG not less than 6 months prior to projected
             trial vaccination date (by visible BCG scar on examination or written documentation)

          -  Allow the Investigators to discuss the individual's medical history with their GP

          -  Use effective contraception for the duration of the trial period (females only)

          -  Refrain from blood donation during the trial

          -  Give written informed consent

          -  Allow the Investigator to register subject details with a confidential database to
             prevent concurrent entry into clinical trials

          -  Able and willing (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with all the trial
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet none of the following criteria to enter the trial:

          -  Laboratory evidence at screening of latent M. tb infection as indicated by a positive
             ELISPOT response to ESAT6 or CFP10 antigens

          -  Clinical, radiological, or laboratory evidence of current active TB disease

          -  Previous vaccination with candidate vaccine MVA85A or candidate vaccine FP85A or any
             other recombinant MVA vaccine

          -  Clinically significant history of skin disorder, allergy, immunodeficiency (including
             HIV), autoimmune disease, cancer (except BCC or CIS), cardiovascular disease,
             respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, renal disease, endocrine
             disorder, neurological illness, psychiatric disorder, drug or alcohol abuse

          -  History of serious psychiatric condition

          -  Concurrent oral or systemic steroid medication or the concurrent use of other
             immunosuppressive agents

          -  History of anaphylaxis to vaccination or any allergy likely to be exacerbated by any
             component of the trial vaccine, including eggs

          -  Any abnormality of screening blood or urine tests that is deemed to be clinically
             significant or that may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial

          -  Positive HBsAg, HCV or HIV antibodies

          -  Female currently lactating, confirmed pregnancy or intention to become pregnant during
             trial period

          -  Use of an investigational medicinal product or non-registered drug, live vaccine, or
             medical device other than the trial vaccine for 30 days prior to dosing with the trial
             vaccine, or planned use during the trial period

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned trial vaccination date

          -  Any other significant disease, disorder, or finding, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk or may influence the result of the
             trial or may affect the subject's ability to participate in the trial
