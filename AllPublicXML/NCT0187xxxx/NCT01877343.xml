    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, non-randomized study.Enrolled patients will be placed on a tilt
      table and a stress test will be performed in a total of 4 different positions. Their blood
      pressure will be measured at each position. Also, a pulse oximeter will be placed on the
      forehead to measure pulse rate and strength. These results will be compared to cardiac
      functional classifications defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria for adults
      and New York Pediatric Heart Failure (NYPHF) index for our pediatric age patients. The
      primary aim of this initiative is to assess the discriminatory value of a cardiac functional
      health classification based upon the degree of dependency of cardiac function on changes in
      cardiac preload and afterload circulatory volume.

      Participants will be asked to review the informed consent and consent to the study prior to
      any study procedures. The study will consist of a single visit to the Medical Plaza at the
      University of Florida. During this visit, Enrolled patients will be placed on a tilt table
      and their position changed to a total of 4 different positions. Their blood pressure will be
      measured at each position. Also, a pulse oximeter will be placed on the forehead to measure
      pulse rate and strength. The study will take approximately 25 minutes. Data collected shall
      include a questionnaire for the patient, a list of the patient's co-morbidities, an
      echocardiogram or catheter lab data if available, and a list of the patient's current
      medications.

    <description>Continuous change of pulse rate from baseline through the end of the study will be followed. Changes in pulse rate will be plotted against the four tilt table positions. Four positions will be explored, Mounting position, baseline, passive leg raise (cardiac preload dependent) and orthostasis head raise (cardiac afterload dependent). Patients go from mounting position, to baseline, to the corresponding position (passive leg raise or orthostasis head raise) and back to baseline. The assessment will take 30 minutes. From the graph, average pulse rate is calculated.</description>

    <description>Continuous change of pulse strength from baseline through the end of the study. Pulse strength is measured as volts by the system. Changes in pulse strength will be plotted against the four tilt table positions. Four positions will be explored, Mounting position, baseline, passive leg raise (cardiac preload dependent) and orthostasis head raise (cardiac afterload dependent). Patients go from mounting position, to baseline, to the corresponding position (passive leg raise or orthostasis head raise) and back to baseline. The assessment will take 30 minutes. Cardiac function curves will be constructed with the data collected and average pulse strength from baseline to 30 minutes will be reported.</description>

        <title>Pulse Rate</title>
        <description>Continuous change of pulse rate from baseline through the end of the study will be followed. Changes in pulse rate will be plotted against the four tilt table positions. Four positions will be explored, Mounting position, baseline, passive leg raise (cardiac preload dependent) and orthostasis head raise (cardiac afterload dependent). Patients go from mounting position, to baseline, to the corresponding position (passive leg raise or orthostasis head raise) and back to baseline. The assessment will take 30 minutes. From the graph, average pulse rate is calculated.</description>

        <title>Pulse Strength</title>
        <description>Continuous change of pulse strength from baseline through the end of the study. Pulse strength is measured as volts by the system. Changes in pulse strength will be plotted against the four tilt table positions.

Patients go from mounting position, to baseline, to the corresponding position (passive leg raise or orthostasis head raise) and back to baseline. The assessment will take 30 minutes. Cardiac function curves will be constructed with the data collected and average pulse strength from baseline to 30 minutes will be reported.</description>
