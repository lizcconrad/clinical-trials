      The study objectives are to assess the safety and clinical performance of the CoreValve™
      Evolut R™ System in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered at
      high through extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. These objectives will be
      accomplished by a prospective clinical study involving up to 60 implanted subjects among up
      to six study centers.
