  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult recipients of cochlear implants (CI) generally loose interest in listening to music.
      This may be due to the rather limited spectral resolution of CI. However, child
      CI-recipients, if offered the opportunity, like to listen to music. They participate actively
      in musical acitivities, such as singing, dancing or playing an instrument. Thus, there seems
      to be a fundamental difference in the music perception of people who receive CI as child or
      as adult.

      This study assesses music perception skills of child, teen and adult cochlear implant
      recipients in settings with simple tone sequences and in a more complex, melodious context.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Does the age at which a person receives a cochlear implant influence music perception skills?</measure>
    <time_frame>Test and retest are taken within 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test assesses wether cochlear implant carriers are able to hear the difference betweent two sequences of sounds, where in the second sequence on tone is different from the first sequence. If a difference is perceived, then the test assesses how big this difference has to be in order to be heard.
The first and the second test are no more than six months apart; both times the same procedure is followed.
The test is carried out with three age groups:
Children aged 3-10 years
Teenagers aged 11 - 14 years
Persons above 15 years</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Do the results of the primary outcome measure depend on the tone sequence presented to the cochlear implant recipients?</measure>
    <time_frame>Test and retest are no more than 6 months apart</time_frame>
    <description>The test is carried out with three different tone sequences:
Same tone at three different octaves (control tune: 131 Hz, 262 Hz, 523 Hz)
Tune of rising, then falling notes
Tune of rising notes only</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>How can the findings of the primary and the secondary outcome measure be used to improve music perception with existing cochlear implants?</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Can the results of the primary and the secondary outcome measure be applied to improve music perception with existing cochlear implants - e.g. by changing / adapting algorithms?</description>

    <description>A sequence of tones is presented to participants. Then the same sequence is presented again, with the 4th tone being one to six half tones different from the first sequence. Participants are asked to indicate when they hear a difference betweent the first and the second sequence.</description>
