    <textblock>
      For this human research, 17 treatment-refractory OCD patients who already received DBS
      implants for treatment refractory OCD between June 1998 and October 2007 will be included.
      New patients that complete the protocol on &quot;refining the target for DBS in OCD&quot; will be
      included in this follow-up study as well. They will be psychiatrically evaluated on regular
      bases: at least twice yearly in the years two to five after surgery, at least once a year for
      the years thereafter. The duration of this protocol is indefinite, but spans at least 10
      years. The main aim of this study is to investigate the long-term effect of DBS in OCD
      patients.
