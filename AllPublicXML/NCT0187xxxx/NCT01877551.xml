  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes are more than 2-fold greater in HIV infected
      people than the general population. Protease inhibitor booster antiretroviral therapy
      (PI-ART) which is used by ~50% of HIV infected people in the USA is an established risk
      factor for diabetes. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a naturally occurring bile salt,
      improves insulin sensitivity in HIV uninfected subjects, although the mechanisms for these
      benefits are unclear. This study will explore the hypothesis that TUDCA will improve insulin
      action in people with HIV who are receiving PI-ART. Further, this project will clarify the
      molecular mechanisms responsible for these improvements potentially benefiting society,
      irrespective of HIV status.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if, and through which mechanisms,
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid improves insulin sensitivity in subjects with protease-inhibitor
      associated insulin resistance.

      The investigators will perform body composition analysis by using a DEXA machine, liver fat
      measurement by using an MRI, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedures in 48 HIV
      infected, insulin-resistant/prediabetic subjects before and after 30 days of treatment with
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid or matching placebo. Biopsies of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle
      will be taken during fasting conditions and during insulin infusion, before and after
      treatment to measure markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and thyroid hormone deiodinase.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measures will be change in glucose clearance during insulin infusion,
      change in markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and change in content of D2 in muscle.

    <measure>Insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine the ability of insulin to cause muscle to take up insulin. Each subject will receive intravenous insulin for 6 hours to see how much sugar needs to be given intravenously to keep the blood sugar normal, a measure called glucose uptake. We will compare glucose uptake during insulin infusion before and after 30 days of treatment with drug or placebo.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoplasmic reticulum stress</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>It is believed that protease inhibitors cause stress to the part of the fat cell that folds proteins; referred to as endoplasmic reticulum stress. When endoplasmic reticulum stress increases, and changes in protein levels in fat cells occur. We will measure markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress in fat samples taken from subjects before and after 30 days of treatment with TUDCA or placebo.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure changes in proteins that metabolize thyroid hormone in muscle at baseline and after 30 days of treatment with TUDCA or placebo to determine if this is one of the mechanisms by which TUDCA improves how well insulin works in the body.</description>
