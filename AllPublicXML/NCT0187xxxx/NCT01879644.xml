    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback has proved to be effective in treating Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) in experimental settings. This study investigates whether neurofeedback can be used as
      a therapeutic intervention in regular outpatient care. The investigators compare high
      frequent neurofeedback with high frequent self-management therapy and suppose that both
      result in comparable effects.
