  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the ERAMUNE-01 and -02 studies, the HIV-DNA quantification in the PBMCs (Peripheral
      Blood Mononuclear Cells) showed showed that some patients had a very low or undetectable
      reservoir.

      Recent studies showed that a low reservoir is associated to a spontaneous virologic control
      in three specific categories of patients:

        -  &quot;Elite Controllers&quot;: these rare patients are able to spontaneously maintain an HIV-RNA
           viral load below 50 copies/mL and elevated CD4 counts without any treatment. These
           patients belong to the B27/B57 haplotypes associated to a reduced risk of HIV
           contamination but these haplotypes are very rare in the global population (0,3 %)

        -  &quot;Visconti&quot; patients: early-treated patients, during the primo-infection stage. After 3
           to 5 years of treatment, these patients are able to maintain an undetectable HIV-RNA
           viral load.

        -  &quot;Salto&quot; patients: these patients are treated a bit later compared to the Visconti
           cohort, when their CD4 count was above 350 cells/mm3 and their HIV-RNA viral load below
           50 000 copies/mL. The follow-up of these patients showed the same capacity of control of
           the HIV infection for at least 2 years following treatment interruption.

      Taking into account these 3 categories of patients which common characteristics is a low
      reservoir, our objective is to answer the 2 following questions:

        1. Is it possible to discontinue the treatment in chronically-infected patients with a
           &quot;normal&quot; immune system and with an undetectable HIV-DNA reservoir?

        2. Is a low viral reservoir predictive of a treatment-free remission of the HIV infection
           in chronically-infected patients?

      The main objective of the proof-of-concept ERAMUNE-03 trial is to evaluate the proportion of
      patients in success (i.e. able to maintain a virologic and an immunologic control of the
      infection) after treatment discontinuation, failure is defined as:

        -  An HIV-RNA viral load &gt; 400 copies/mL on 2 consecutive tests starting from Week 4

        -  Or CD4 count &lt; 400 cells/mm3 on 2 consecutive measures starting from Week 4

        -  Or the onset of an AIDS-related event
