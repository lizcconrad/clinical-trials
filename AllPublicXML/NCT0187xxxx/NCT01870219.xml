    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sevoflurane or ketamine on the QTc and
      Tp-e interval during in patients with major depression.

      Patients enrolled in the study are randomly allocated by computer-generated random numbers to
      receive either sevoflurane or ketamine for their initial ECT session. They subsequently
      receive an alternative study drug in their next session, continuing to alternate between
      drugs at each session until the sixth session. In group S, sevoflurane are initiated at %8
      sevoflurane for anesthesia induction and maintained at 2% to %4 until the electrical stimulus
      is delivered, In group K, ketamine are given to 1mg/kg ıv bolus.

      Electrical stimulus is delivered via bilateral frontotemporal electrodes.The mean arterial
      pressure (MAP), HR, and ECG are recorded before anesthetic induction (T1), after anesthetic
      induction (T2) and at 0, 1, 3, 10 min after the seizure ended (T3, T4, T5 and T6,
      respectively).The QT interval and Tp-e interval are measured by one author, who was unaware
      of group allocation.
