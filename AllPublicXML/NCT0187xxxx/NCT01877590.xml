  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular complications account for the highest mortality in type 2 diabetic patients,
      mainly due to coronary artery disease (CAD). Most of the attention in treating CAD in type 2
      diabetes is understandably directed toward treating coronary artery conditions. However there
      are other treatable culprits in these patients.

      Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, even
      in the absence of hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and
      all-cause mortality. Regression of LVH has been associated with an improved prognosis,
      independent of change in blood pressure (BP). Therefore, cardiovascular events and mortality
      in type 2 diabetes with CAD might will be reduced if the investigators can find novel
      therapies to regress LVH.

      Alpha-lipoic acid reduces oxidative stress which then regresses LVH. Alpha-lipoic acid can
      improve endothelial function in diabetic conditions. Hence, the main aim of this study was to
      assess whether alpha-lipoic acid could regress LVM in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD.
