      Pilot prospective two group observational study to create a model of the carotid plaque
      composition based on ultrasonic backscattered signals and select clinical data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with cardiovascular disease
      and the major cause of long-term disability in the United States. Current imaging modalities
      can determine the severity of luminal stenosis resulting from plaque, as in the carotid
      arteries. However, cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) are often associated with the rupture of
      unstable plaques located in regions with a non-significant degree of luminal stenosis. Thus
      up to 50% of high-risk atherosclerotic plaques may go undetected and untreated. Plaque
      composition is an additional and perhaps, more important risk factor for CVA rather than
      stenosis severity alone. Accurate identification of these high-risk, rupture-prone plaques
      may potentially prevent CVAs in a significant number of patients.

      The data collected during this study (ultrasonic backscatter and histologically processed
      carotid plaque) will provide the basis for a novel algorithm to add plaque composition
      information to the plaque size and location information that is currently provided by
      standard ultrasound imaging. The input parameters for the algorithm are derived from two
      types of non-invasive ultrasound data: quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and acoustic radiation
      force impulse (ARFI) imaging data. QUS analyzes the frequency content of the backscattered
      diagnostic ultrasound signals. These are the same signals currently used for imaging,
      however, imaging relies solely on the strength of the signal to form the image and ignores
      the spectral information. Thus QUS is an approach to use the spectral information which is
      sensitive to the number and nature of the scatterers. In contrast ARFI techniques are provide
      information on the stiffness and shear modulus of the tissue. Two ARFI techniques will be
      used to gather information on the carotid plaque and related tissue. ARFI is based on using a
      ultrasonic push pulse to slightly move the tissue (displacement on the order of microns).
      From this initial start two types of ARFI data are collected: image of the relative
      displacements of the tissue (ARFI image) and the measurement of the speed of the shear wave
      created by the tissue displacement (shear wave speed).

      The ARFI derived data and the QUS derived data will be combined with clinically available
      measures currently used for diagnosis of carotid stenosis to form the input parameters for
      the algorithm. In order to train and test the algorithm the plaque removed during CEA
      procedure will be collected and the histology slides prepared from these plaques will be
      analyzed for the same regions where ARFI and QUS data were collected. This histology review
      provides the 'gold' standard for training and testing the algorithm. The majority of these
      matched sets (75%) will be used for training the algorithm. While the remainder (25%) will
      provide a test of the accuracy of the algorithm for these types of matched data. The
      sensitivity and specificity for each tissue type defined during the histology review will be
      reported.

    <description>Classification of carotid artery plaque is produced by an algorithm that uses the QUS and ARFI derived parameters corresponding to a given region in the plaque to produce a classification of the plaque region into one of the following: calcium, fibrous, necrotic, or hemorrhagic. Error rates from both the training and test data sets will be reported.</description>

        People 40 years old or older who are scheduled for a CEA for atherosclerotic plaque removal
        within the carotid artery will be considered for enrollement in the CEA Cohort (anticipated
        enrollment of 50). A small number of people 40 years old or older with no CEA scheduled and
        no prior carotid intervention will be enrolled into the Normal Cohort (anticipated
