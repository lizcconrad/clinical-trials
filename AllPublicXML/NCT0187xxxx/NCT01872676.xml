      The aim of the present study was to assess the immediate effects of upper thoracic
      manipulation on skin surface temperature in the region of the T3 vertebra and biceps brachii
      muscle in healthy women. It is a randomized controlled blind study. Twenty-six healthy women
      of the university community were randomly allocated to an experimental group (n = 13) and a
      placebo group (n = 13). A single session of the upper thoracic spine manipulation (segment
      T3)was performed. Infrared thermography was used to determine changes in skin surface
      temperature in the region of T3 and the biceps brachii muscle, which would indirectly reflect
      sympathetic activity. Images were taken prior to manipulation, immediately after and both
      five and 10 minutes after manipulation. Repeated measures ANOVA with the post hoc Bonferroni
      test and the independent samples t-test were used for the intragroup and intergroup
      comparisons, respectively, with the level of significance set to 5%.

    <description>The experimental group received upper thoracic manipulation of the T3 vertebra. The volunteer was instructed to lie in the supine position, interlace her fingers and position her hands in the posterior region of the base of the neck. The therapist than positioned a stabilizing hand in a pistol grip immediately caudal to the T3 vertebra, pushing the volunteer's arms downward to generate flexion of the upper thoracic spine.</description>

    <description>The placebo group was placed precisely as the experimental group, with the exception of the positioning of the therapist's hand, which remained with the palm open and not in a pistol grip. Once positioned, the volunteers were instructed to breathe deeply. The maneuver was terminated after one cycle of deep breathing.</description>
