  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid cancers worldwide, and chronic
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common etiology of HCC in Asia. Transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for patients with unresectable HCC in the
      BCLC intermediate stage, but the HCC recurrence rates and long-term mortality rates are quite
      high. These intermediate-staged HCC patients usually need repeated TACE due to tumor
      recurrence, and they may die of HCC progression or liver decompensation after repeated TACE.
      Improved liver function and decreased liver disease progression due to oral antiviral therapy
      have been proven to be effective for chronic hepatitis B, and oral antiviral therapy may keep
      better liver reserve and provide better chance for HCC patients received TACE. In addition,
      chronic HBV infection is one of the most important factors for HCC development, and antiviral
      therapy can improve the outcomes after curative treatment. However, the evidence of improving
      outcomes of HCC patients underwent TACE by oral antiviral therapy is lacking. Moreover,
      Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) is one of the most potent oral antiviral agents, and its
      safety and very low long-term viral resistance rate have been also reported. There is no
      study to evaluate the impacts of TDF for HBV-related HCC patients underwent TACE. Until now,
      routine antiviral therapy for HBV-related HCC patients underwent TACE has still not been
      recommended by current guidelines. The hypothesis of this study is that a potent oral
      antiviral therapy for patients with HBV-related HCC patients receiving TACE improve patients'
      outcomes

      This is randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial that will be conducted in referral
      teaching hospitals in Taiwan. This trial will recruit 320 patients fulfilling all of the
      following criteria: patients more than 20 years old, HCCs diagnosed by AASLD image criteria
      or pathology, medium-sized HCCs in BCLC intermediate stage and not more than 5 cm in maximum
      diameter and not more than 5 tumors that TACE is indicated, chronic HBV carrier (HBsAg+) with
      detectable HBV DNA in blood, ECOG performance status (PST) 0-2, Child-Pugh score ≦7, serum
      bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL and prothrombin time (PT) prolongation &lt; 3 seconds, and willingness to
      adhere to treatment and follow-up plans. Patients are ineligible if they have any of the
      following exclusion criteria: any vascular invasion by tumors, extra-hepatic metastasis,
      concurrent any other malignancy, concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, previous any HCC
      treatment, previous or current any antiviral therapy for HBV, concomitant other therapies for
      HCC except TACE, liver cirrhosis with severe gastroesophageal varices (EVF3 or with red color
      sign), poorly-controlled ascites or hepatic encephalopathy, contraindication for invasive
      procedures such as recent gastrointestinal bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage, contraindication
      to TACE such as allergy to contrast, pregnancy, sepsis, etc., chronic renal failure with eGFR
      &lt; 60, concurrent any other chronic viral hepatitis with HCV, HDV, or HIV). The Primary
      endpoints of this study will be 1-, 3-year overall survival, and the secondary endpoints of
      this study will be time to tumor progression and time to liver decompensation.
