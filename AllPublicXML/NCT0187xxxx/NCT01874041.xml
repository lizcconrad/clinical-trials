    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of massage therapy and occlusal
      splint therapy in the electromyographic activity and mandibular range of motion (ROM) in
      individuals with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and compare the results with those obtained
      in a group of individuals without this disorder. Twenty-eight volunteers with TMD were
      randomly distributed into two groups, massage therapy and occlusal splint. Both treatments
      lasted 4 weeks. Fourteen individuals without TMD were consecutively allocated to the control
      group. The Fonseca's anamnestic index was used to characterize TMD and allocate the
      volunteers to either the intervention groups or control group. The electromyographic activity
      and Mandibular ROM was evaluated before and after treatment using a digital caliper. Two-way
      analysis of variance with the Bonferroni test was used for inter and intragroup comparisons
      (level of significance was set to 5%). Cohen's d was used to calculate the effect size.
