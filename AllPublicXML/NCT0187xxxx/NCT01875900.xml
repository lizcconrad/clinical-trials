  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simulation-based training has been widely implemented in medical education. According to
      educational theories, simulation-based medical education (SBME) is associated with
      significant advantages, which has been investigated and proved by many studies. However, the
      value of SBME in comparison to other instructional methodologies remains largely unknown.
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to directly compare two instructional methods for
      neonatal resuscitation training.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Fifth-year medical students prior to their mandatory OSCE

          -  Signing of informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal to participate in the study

        The first two OSCEs in July and August will be part of a pilot study. The combined results
        of both examinations will be used for a sample size calculation.
