  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a feasibility study to assess the performance of an Artificial
      Pancreas (AP) device using the Artificial Pancreas System (APS©) platform for subjects with
      type 1 diabetes using rapid-acting insulin as well as preprandial inhaled insulin
      (Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation System by MannKind Corporation). The goal of this proposed
      study is to explore the feasibility of using multiple insulin delivery routes in order to
      mimic the physiology of both first- and second-phase insulin secretion. The intent is to
      exploit the rapid action achieved by inhaled insulin to compensate for part of the meals and
      utilize the conventional subcutaneous route for management of basal insulin and as
      second-phase meal-related insulin.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Test the safety of the AP device while the subject is under close medical supervision in the Clinical Research Center (CRC) setting.</measure>
    <time_frame>25-28 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This objective will be assessed by subjecting the AP device (combined with the Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation Powder) and the subject to several challenging situations, such as meals, exercise, and nocturnal period. The study will evaluate the percent of time the glucose level of the subject remains within pre-specified target ranges:
Target range (unless described otherwise): [80-140] mg/dL
Overnight target range: [80-140] mg/dL
Target range 5 hours after meal: [70-180] mg/dL
Target range during exercise: [70-150] mg/dL
Target range 3 hours after exercise: [70-150] mg/dL
The study will also evaluate the glucose level at 1- and 2-hour postprandial and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) at 6-hour post-prandial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test the benefits of the AP device combined with the Technosphere® Insulin Powder System</measure>
    <time_frame>25-28 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the performance of the AP device combined with the Technosphere® Insulin Powder System:
when glucose values are outside of the desirable ranges,
in analyzing the values and duration of the extremes, in particular if &lt;70 mg/dL and &lt;60 mg/dL.
in analyzing adverse events,
in analyzing outside interventions not following the recommendation of the HMS,
if the same subjects were enrolled in this study and the original IDE G110093 study (protocol revision 2.2): comparing the glucose profile between the two clinical studies with and without the Technosphere® Insulin.</description>
