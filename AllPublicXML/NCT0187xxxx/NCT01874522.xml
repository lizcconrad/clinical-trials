  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability of TAS-102 tablets to an oral
      solution containing equivalent amounts FTD and TPI.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, 3-period crossover study evaluating
      the relative bioavailability of TAS-102 tablets compared to an oral solution in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 2 parts. The crossover bioavailability
      part will be followed by an extension conducted with TAS-102 tablets only.
