    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a feasibility survey of the prevalence of spasticity
      at a single long-term care facility for veterans and their spouses in Murfreesboro,
      Tennessee. These data will be used to strengthen a future grant application to the Department
      of Defense in response to their ongoing Traumatic Brain Injury initiative.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this feasibility survey is to determine the prevalence of spasticity that
      interferes with care or function at the Tennessee State Veterans Home (TSVH), which is a
      long-term care facility for veterans and their spouses in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In order
      to accomplish this goal, each of the 140 residents will be examined by the principal
      investigator and a medical record review will be performed; also, each patient and their
      medical decision-maker (if applicable), direct caregiver, and treating physician will be
      surveyed in order to further elucidate the barriers to treatment in this population. All
      consenting residents of the TSVH will be examined, but the data will be separated prior to
      analysis based on whether the resident is a veteran or a veteran's relative.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spasticity diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to three months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>There is no biomarker for spasticity. Therefore, the diagnosis will be made on physician impression. A neurologist trained in movement disorders will examine each consented patient to determine if they have spasticity. The severity of the veteran's spasticity will be documented, including the following measures: presence of fixed contractures and presence of pain on movement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spasticity treatment awareness and preferences survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to three months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use a structured interview to assess each subject's level of awareness of available treatments for spasticity. Subjects will be asked if they are aware of specific treatments for spasticity and asked to answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.
This interview is also designed to capture subjects' spasticity treatment preferences. Subjects will be asked if they are interested in receiving a variety of available spasticity treatments and asked to answer &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot;.</description>
