      Objectives:

        1. Primary Objective:

           To bridge the data of efficacy in term of overall response rate of TS-1 plus cisplatin
           in Taiwanese advanced NSCLC patients from that gained from Japanese population

        2. Secondary Objectives:

      A. To assess progression free survival B. To assess overall survival C. To bridge the safety
      profile by assessing the toxicities and tolerability

          2. Stage IIIb or IV disease

          3. presence of at least one measurable disease which is defined as lesion that can be
             measured in at least 1 dimension as ≥20 mm with conventional CT/MRI or ≥10 mm with
             spiral CT scan
