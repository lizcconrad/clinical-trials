      The objective of this study is to screen treated Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) positive women
      weekly using culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to determine how long TV DNA is
      detectable post treatment and to examine potential confounders to clearance such as bacterial
      vaginosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world, is
      associated with inflammation of the vagina, cervix, and urethra; low birth weight; preterm
      delivery; pelvic inflammatory disease; and may increase the risk of acquiring and
      transmitting genital herpes and HIV. Repeat infections are common, ranging from 5% - 31%, and
      have similar health outcomes as primary infections. Given the high prevalence of TV, the
      absence of a national screening program, the deleterious reproductive outcomes associated
      with TV and the potential for a TV infection to increase HIV transmission, reducing repeat TV
      infections is an important targeted public health approach. However, rescreening for TV
      should not happen until there is sufficient time for the parasites and DNA to clear from the
      vaginal cavity after treatment. HIV negative women who attend Delgado Personal Health Center
      will be asked to enroll in the screening component in order to test them for TV using InPouch
      culture along with the standard TV screening of wet preparation. The objective of this study
      is to screen treated TV positive women weekly using culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction to
      determine how long TV DNA is detectable post treatment and to examine potential confounders
      to clearance such as bacterial vaginosis. The outcome of interest will be a negative PCR
      result indicating that TV DNA has cleared.
