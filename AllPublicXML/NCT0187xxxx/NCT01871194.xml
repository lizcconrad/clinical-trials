  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the use of rivaroxaban and its short term safety when used by
      patients for the new indications of prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients
      with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
      embolism (PE) and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. Any adult patient started by their care
      team on rivaroxaban or an alternative anticoagulant for the specified indications during the
      study period will be eligible to take part. A questionnaire will be completed by the care
      team of each patient at the start of treatment and again 12 weeks later. The care team will
      complete the questionnaires using information from the patient's medical notes, not by asking
      the patient directly. If a participant has an adverse event during the 12 week period, we may
      ask the patient's care team to fill out a further follow up questionnaire. No other
      examinations or tests will be performed. Patients will only be recruited to the study after
      the clinical decision to prescribe rivaroxaban or an alternative anticoagulant has been made,
      so that prescribing behaviour is not altered by the study. It is an observational,
      non-interventional study covering the whole of England and Wales.

    <time_frame>During 12 weeks after initiation of treatment with rivaroxaban or alternative anticoagulant therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence will be calculated according to the formula:
Total number of new cases during 12 week observation period x 100 / Population initially at risk
If the observed cumulative incidence from this study falls within the range expected as set by the precision limits of cumulative incidence from clinical trial data, then the null hypothesis (of no difference) will not be rejected.</description>
