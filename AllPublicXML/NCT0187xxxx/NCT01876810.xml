  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of gemfibrozil on nicotine
      reinforcement and cue-elicited craving. Other objectives of this study include screening for
      the ability of gemfibrozil to aid smoking abstinence during a brief quit attempt and
      examining the validity of using laboratory measures of tobacco dependence to predict smoking
      abstinence. It is hypothesized that gemfibrozil will result in diminished nicotine
      reinforcement, an attenuated response to smoking cues, and an increase in smoking abstinence
      compared with placebo. It is also hypothesized that the laboratory measures will prove valid
      in predicting abstinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Animal studies have shown that drugs acting as agonists at alpha-type peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα) suppress nicotine self-administration, attenuate
      relapse to nicotine-seeking behavior in the reinstatement model, and block nicotine-induced
      neuronal firing and dopamine release in reward pathways of the brain. These results have been
      demonstrated with synthetic PPARα agonists and with fibrate drugs (clofibrate, fenofibrate),
      which are used clinically to treat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides levels. Thus, PPARα
      is a potential target for the treatment of tobacco addiction. This is the first human study
      to investigate whether a fibrate drug (gemfibrozil, Lopid®) can reduce nicotine reward and
      aid smokers in becoming tobacco abstinent.

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. to investigate the effect of gemfibrozil on laboratory measures of nicotine
           reinforcement and cue-elicited craving

        2. to screen for the ability of gemfibrozil to aid smoking abstinence during a brief quit
           attempt

        3. to examine the validity of using laboratory measures of tobacco dependence to predict
           smoking abstinence and possible gemfibrozil-related increases in smoking abstinence

      This outpatient study will be conducted at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH)
      in Toronto, Canada. This site will enroll 40 adult smokers who intend to quit smoking in the
      next 3 months.

      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design comparing the effects of
      gemfibrozil and placebo. The study will comprise two 2-week medication phases with a washout
      period of at least one week. At the end of the first medication week laboratory measures will
      be taken and during the second medication week participants will make a quit attempt and
      abstinence will be assessed.

      Outcome measures include laboratory assessments of nicotine reinforcement and smoking cue
      reactivity. The measure of nicotine reinforcement is the percentage of nicotine cigarette
      puffs chosen during a forced-choice task. Measures of cue reactivity include tobacco craving,
      mood, and autonomic responsivity. Other measures are days of smoking abstinence during the
      quit-attempt weeks. Abstinence is assessed by self-reports of no smoking and by breath carbon
      monoxide &lt; 5 ppm on clinic visits. Other assessments of abstinence include self-reported
      tobacco craving and withdrawal.

    <measure>The Percentage of Choice of Nicotinized Cigarettes After 1 Week of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>during the lab forced choice paradigm after 1 week of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of choice of Nicotinized cigarettes was calculated for each participant during the lab session which took place after 1 week of treatment.
Each session started with participants taking four puffs of their preferred-brand cigarette to standardize the time from last nicotine exposure. Participants were asked to complete some questionnaires at baseline. Then, they were asked to relax for 30 min listening to music or reading. Four exposure trials followed that were separated by 30 min of relaxation. In each exposure trial, participants took four puffs of a Nicotinized (A) or Denicotinized (less than 0.05 mg nicotine.) (B) cigarette in the order of ABAB or BABA. Cigarettes were color-coded. Participants then began four choice trials separated by 30 min of relaxation. In each trial, participants chose any combination of 4 puffs from the two cigarettes.</description>

    <measure>Cue- Reactivity Visual Analogue Scale for Craving After 1 Week of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>during the lab Cue- reactivity paradigm after 1 week of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>In this study, each session started with participants taking four puffs of their preferred-brand cigarette to standardize the time from last nicotine exposure. Participants were then seated in a comfortable chair and completed the baseline Visual Analogue Scale for craving 0-100 mm (The higher the number the more is the craving). The smoking cue was a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. Participants were instructed to light the cigarette without puffing and hold it for 30 sec while the physiological recordings were measured. Then the participant was asked to extinguish the cigarette. The neutral cue was an unsharpened pencil, a notepad, and a sharpener. Participants were instructed to sharpen the pencil and hold it as if writing for 30 sec. Participants completed the Visual Analogue Scale for craving during the cue, and 15 and 30 min after cue presentation.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Choice of Nicotinized Cigarettes After 1 Week of Treatment</title>
        <description>Percentage of choice of Nicotinized cigarettes was calculated for each participant during the lab session which took place after 1 week of treatment.
Each session started with participants taking four puffs of their preferred-brand cigarette to standardize the time from last nicotine exposure. Participants were asked to complete some questionnaires at baseline. Then, they were asked to relax for 30 min listening to music or reading. Four exposure trials followed that were separated by 30 min of relaxation. In each exposure trial, participants took four puffs of a Nicotinized (A) or Denicotinized (less than 0.05 mg nicotine.) (B) cigarette in the order of ABAB or BABA. Cigarettes were color-coded. Participants then began four choice trials separated by 30 min of relaxation. In each trial, participants chose any combination of 4 puffs from the two cigarettes.</description>

        <title>Cue- Reactivity Visual Analogue Scale for Craving After 1 Week of Treatment</title>
        <description>In this study, each session started with participants taking four puffs of their preferred-brand cigarette to standardize the time from last nicotine exposure. Participants were then seated in a comfortable chair and completed the baseline Visual Analogue Scale for craving 0-100 mm (The higher the number the more is the craving). The smoking cue was a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. Participants were instructed to light the cigarette without puffing and hold it for 30 sec while the physiological recordings were measured. Then the participant was asked to extinguish the cigarette. The neutral cue was an unsharpened pencil, a notepad, and a sharpener. Participants were instructed to sharpen the pencil and hold it as if writing for 30 sec. Participants completed the Visual Analogue Scale for craving during the cue, and 15 and 30 min after cue presentation.</description>
