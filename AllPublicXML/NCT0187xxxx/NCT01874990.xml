  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the principal cause of death in women in developed and developing
      countries and are importantly promoted by hypertension. Salt sensitivity of the blood
      pressure is considered as an important cardiovascular risk factor at any blood pressure
      level. Severe preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of the pregnancy that also arises as a
      risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases.

      The major aim of this study is to examine the salt sensitivity of the ambulatory blood
      pressure in women with a history of severe preeclampsia (&lt; 34 weeks gestation) compared with
      women with no history of pregnancy-related hypertensive complications. We plan to recruit 20
      non-menopausal women with a history of severe preeclampsia, and 20 age, parity, race- matched
      premenopausal women as controls. The study has a case control randomized design. The salt
      sensitivity of the ambulatory blood pressure is defined as an increase of ≥4 mmHg in 24h
      ambulatory blood pressure on a high sodium diet. The high sodium diet is obtained by adding
      capsules of 6gr of NaCl/ day in the usual diet.

      The participants are identified as women discharged from the Maternity of University Hospital
      of Geneva between 1999 and 2001 with a preeclampsia coding. Fetal and maternal data will be
      carefully recovered from hospital records to identify severe preeclampsia (PE), based on
      International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy criteria. These criteria are
      systolic blood pressure ≥160mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg with severe
      proteinuria (≥ 5g /24h or 3+ dipstick) and one or more signs of multisystem disease
      developing after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive women. Severe preeclampsia
      was also defined as occurring before 34wk of gestation. Women with a history of hypertension,
      diabetes mellitus, renal or cardiac impairment, polycystic ovary syndrome will be excluded.
      Other exclusion criteria are anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, aspirin, oral contraceptives
      and hormonal replacement therapy. The protocol is approved by the University Hospital Ethical
      Committee and written informed consent will be obtained from each individual in accordance
      with the declaration of Helsinki. The study is conducted between 2009 and 2012 at the
      University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland.

    <description>The women receive a low-sodium (LS) and a high-sodium (HS) diet for 1 week. The sequence of the diets is randomized in order to prevent a sequence effect. Between the two periods, they retain their usual diet for 3 weeks. The high-sodium diet is obtained by adding 6g of sodium chloride to the individual's regular diet. On day 7 of each dietary period, 24h ambulatory BP is recorded. Automated measurements are performed every 30 min intervals from 08:00 to 22:00 hours and at 60 min from 22:00 to 08:00 hours. The primary measure outcome is the response of the mean, or systolic, or diastolic ambulatory blood pressure to a high salt diet compared with low salt diet in PEC women and in controls. Salt-sensitivity is defined by an increase of at least 4 mmHg on a high salt diet.</description>
