  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' long-term goal is to employ novel methods to improve bone formation and
      bone density in women (and men) with osteopenia or osteoporosis while also decreasing signs
      and symptoms of degenerative joint and disc disease that commonly accompany bone loss as well
      as improve quality of life (QOL). These conditions generally begin silently as early as the
      menopause transition and progress to osteopenia and osteoporosis during the post-menopausal
      years in aging women. The investigators also envision this will be beneficial in aging
      andropausal men with these conditions. The investigators postulate that melatonin in novel
      combination with other natural bone-protective agents may act in a &quot;chronosynergy&quot; manner to
      prevent and correct these perturbations, reducing the risk of bone fractures, and lessening
      the stiffness and pain associated with bone, joint and cartilage degeneration and improving
      quality of life (QOL). The objective here, which is the investigators' next step in pursuit
      of our goal, is to assess the efficacy of an alternative therapy that uses a novel
      combination of bone-forming agents, melatonin, strontium (citrate)/ vitamin K2 (MK7), and
      vitamin D3 on bone health in a postmenopausal population. Melatonin is a novel alternative to
      current treatment(s) because it has multiple bone-protective and sleep-promoting activities
      within the body, and it is relatively safe so it can be used in an aging population without
      untoward side effects; strontium and vitamin D3 are shown to enhance bone mineralization and
      improve post-menopausal osteoporosis. The project goal is to identify if this combination
      therapy improves bone health and QOL compared to women taking placebo. The investigators'
      central hypothesis is that combination therapy using melatonin, strontium, vitamin K2, and
      vitamin D3 will improve bone health and overall QOL in postmenopausal women not taking this
      regimen by reducing osteoclast activity and increasing osteoblast activity and by improving
      subjective measures of stress, anxiety, depression and menopause-related symptoms.
