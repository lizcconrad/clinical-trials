  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether silibinin plus ribavirin with/without
      peg-interferon can be more effective than the peg-interferon plus ribavirin based standard of
      care (SoC) in the treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 4.
