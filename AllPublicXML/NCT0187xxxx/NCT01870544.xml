  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the weight-loss study is to characterize the effect of LGG supplementation on
      the relative abundance of phyla in the gut microbiota of patients undergoing gastric bypass
      and sleeve gastrectomy surgery, and to elucidate a relationship between the gut microbiota
      pattern and the degree of weight-loss post-surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that LGG administration will result in a &quot;leaner&quot; pattern of
      gut microbiota that will lead to higher weight loss at 3 months post-surgery.
