      The proposed study will evaluate the unmet therapy need in seasonal rhinitis by aiming to
      answer the following research questions

        1. What is the first prescription of the hay-fever season and how many of these patients
           are on some form of combination therapy?

        2. To what extent does initial therapy not meet clinical need (as measured by need for
           additional medical intervention in terms of consultations and changes in therapy)?

        3. Does treatment for allergic rhinitis differ for asthma Vs non-asthma and seasonal Vs
           perennial patients?

    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis is a chronic respiratory disease with a major impact on quality of life. In
      a study looking at the burden of allergic rhinitis amongst UK patients 75% reported some
      impact of their allergic rhinitis symptoms on health-related quality of life. Allergic
      rhinitis currently affects 10-30% of the world population with prevalence and impact
      continuing to increase. This leads to substantial economic costs both of prescription
      medication and time taken off work by both patients and carers due to the disease. In view of
      this, there may be a substantial need for improved therapy or management to ensure that
      patients with allergic rhinitis can carry out a normal lifestyle.

      The proposed study will evaluate the unmet therapy need in seasonal rhinitis by examining the
      current medication requirements of patients who suffer from seasonal grass-pollen hay fever
      and determining whether current therapies are sufficient for managing rhinitis.

      This study aims to evaluate the unmet therapy need in seasonal rhinitis by -

        1. Examining and describing current medication requirements

        2. Quantifying the extent of co-prescribing of multiple agents

        3. Comparing the effectiveness of current prescription drugs for managing and controlling
           patient's seasonal rhinitis and using changes in treatment during the hay fever season
           to determine the effectiveness of current therapy options.

      for managing and controlling seasonal rhinitis in primary care patients who suffer from
      seasonal grass-pollen hay fever.
