  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an assisted exercise trial involving exercise on a stationary bike, brain imaging and
      DNA(genetics)sampling. The purpose of this study is to find out if performing a progressive,
      supervised assisted exercise program on a stationary bike improves quality of life, increases
      motivation to continue to exercise, improves dietary behavior and leads to sustained weight
      loss in women who have had early-stage endometrial cancer. Questionnaires will be used to
      assess exercise motivation and dietary behavior. Brain's responses to different visual images
      will also be assessed.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate changes in body weight, fitness, bi-manual dexterity, exercise motivation and
      self-reported eating behavior (via questionnaires) before and after a 16-week exercise
      intervention (EOT) and 12 and 24 weeks post-EOT, in obese EC patients who will be randomized
      to perform 'assisted' or voluntary exercise.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Objective 1: To objectively examine food behavior as determined by neuronal response to high-
      versus low-calorie visual stimuli under fasted (hunger) and fed (satiated) states and stop/go
      signaling (SST) in fed states in brain regions of interest (reward and motivation circuitry)
      using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI before and after a 16-week
      exercise intervention (EOT) and 12 and 24 weeks post-intervention in obese EC patients
      performing 'assisted' and voluntary exercise.

      Objective 2: To examine the modification of the neuronal response to high vs. low calorie
      food images in regions of interest by polymorphisms in key genes (e.g., dopamine receptor and
      dopamine transporter) and serum biomarkers (e.g., leptin, BDNF) involved in regulating
      homeostatic and non-homeostatic energy systems.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either the assisted exercise (n=60) or voluntary
      exercise (n=60) group. Subjects in the voluntary group will exercise on a stationary
      recumbent exercise cycle and pedal at their preferred rate. Subjects in the assisted exercise
      group will cycle on the same stationary exercise bike; however, a motor will provide
      assistance to the patient in order to maintain a pedaling rate 35% greater than their
      voluntary rate. Subjects in the exercise groups will complete 45 minute to 1-hour sessions,
      three times per week for eight weeks. The control group will be asked to complete all
      exercise, body composition and fMRI testing similar to the exercise groups.

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) is a 27-item core questionnaire evaluating various domains of QoL including, physical, functional, family-social, and emotional well-being. The FACT-En is a 16-item subscale specific for endometrial cancer (EC) and assesses hormone withdrawal, pelvic symptoms, and possible adjuvant therapy side effects. Short-form Medical Outcomes (SF-36) consists of 36 questions scored on a Likert scale, producing overall physical and mental component summary measures.</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, Likert-scaled instrument of depressive symptoms that is well-validated and frequently used in lifestyle research studies. Each item is rated on a 4- point scale ranging from 0 to 3 (higher scores are associated with greater symptoms).</description>

    <description>Barriers to adhering to the exercise protocol will be assessed prospectively using an elicitation procedure similar to that suggested in the theory of planned behavior, whereby an open-ended question is asked to solicit the barrier without any preconceived notion of what the barrier might be. Specifically, participants in the exercise groups will be asked to book their weekly supervised exercise sessions with the Exercise Specialist/Physiologist. Participants cancelling an exercise session or requesting to be removed from the study will be asked why they are no longer interested in completed the program.</description>
