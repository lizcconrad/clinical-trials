  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label study consisting of 2 phases. Phase 1 is a
      dose escalation study of RXDX-105 (formerly known as CEP-32496) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors aimed at defining the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule for
      administration. Phase 1b is a dose expansion in approximately 90 patients with advanced solid
      tumors with specific histologies and/or molecular alterations of interest. Patients in Phase
      1b will be treated at the RP2D determined in Phase 1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      RXDX-105. The primary objective of Phase 1b is to further assess the safety profile and
      tolerability of RXDX-105 at the RP2D The secondary objective is to evaluate the antitumor
      activity of RXDX-105 at the RP2D, as assessed by objective response rate (ORR) (complete
      response [CR] or partial response [PR]) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in patients with advanced solid tumors with RET or BRAF mutations
      or rearrangements.

      The RP2D has been determined and Phase 1 portion of the study is now closed to new patient
      enrollment.

      Phase 1 b is open and enrolling patients with solid tumors harboring a RET rearrangement or
      mutation, or a BRAF rearrangement or mutation. Additionally, patients with Squamous NSCLC and
      lung adenocarcinomas with other alterations than RET or BRAF such as KRAS mutations, etc.
      will also be enrolled. Approximately 90 patients will be enrolled in Phase 1b.

      Each phase of this study will consist of a 28-day screening period. Patients will be treated
      in 28-day treatment cycles until documented radiographic progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, or protocol specified parameters to stop treatment. Patients in Phase
      1 and 1b will be followed for 6 months after the last dose of study treatment.
