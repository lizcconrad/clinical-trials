      The objective of this study is to prospectively evaluate the performance of Integra's
      OsteoStrux Collagen Ceramic Scaffold combined with bone marrow aspirate as an adjunct for
      instrumented posterolateral spine fusion, as compared to local autograft.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are 18 (eighteen) years of age or older at the time of surgery.

          2. Require spinal fusion using TLIF, PLF or PLIF, with or without the use of an interbody
             spacer, at 1 to 3 levels between L3-S1.

          3. Are willing and able to return for the scheduled follow-up visits, follow
             post-operative instructions and undergo the required radiographic exams (A/P, Lateral
             Neutral and Lateral Flexion/Extension X-rays) for up to 4 time points between 3 weeks
             and 12 months post-surgery (3 months ± 2 weeks, 6±1 months, 12±2 months and if
             required 24±3 months post-surgery), including one CT-scan at 12±2 months.

          4. Are unresponsive to conservative care over a period of at least 6 months or have signs
             and/or symptoms that mandate urgent surgical intervention.

          5. Are willing and able to sign study specific informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are long term users of medications (i.e. steroids greater than 8 days) that are known
             to inhibit fusion or bone metabolism at any time within 6 months prior to surgery.
             Exceptions are inhaled steroids for asthma treatment (i.e. patients on inhaled
             steroids are allowed), or epidural steroid injections.

          2. Are taking immunosuppressive agents (Cancer chemotherapy, treatment with Disease
             Modifying Anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or any similar immunomodulating drugs) or are
             treated with Growth Factors or Insulin at any time within 6 months prior to surgery.

          3. Are being treated with radiotherapy.

          4. Are having medical conditions, known to impact bone metabolism, such as Paget's
             disease, or has established osteoporosis (i.e. has had one or more fragility
             fractures).

          5. Are pregnant, lactating or women wishing to become pregnant.

          6. Are a prisoner.

          7. BMI ≥ 40

          8. Are smokers and/or nicotine/tobacco users

          9. Are currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that
             has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the study
             endpoints.

         10. Had prior spine surgery at the index level except posterior decompressive surgery
             where the posterior elements are preserved e.g. facet saving techniques such as
             discectomy, laminotomy, and intradiscal procedures.

         11. Use of routine prophylactic NSAIDS for 3 months post-operatively, but low dose
             concomitant pain medications e.g. aspirin should be continued and recorded on the
             Concomitant Pain Medications case report form (CRF).
