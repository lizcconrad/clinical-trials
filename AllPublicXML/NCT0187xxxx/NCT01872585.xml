      The purpose of this two-year pilot study is to adapt a 12-week attachment-based parenting
      intervention for implementation with female adult caregivers who have or are at risk for
      long-term interpersonal conflict with family members, children, or significant others and are
      caring for a child between the ages of birth and 7 years.

      The purpose of this two-year pilot study is to adapt a 12-week attachment-based parenting
      intervention (Parenting from the Inside Out or PIO) originally developed for substance
      abusing mothers (as part of an ongoing NIDA-funded treatment development study; R01 DA17294)
      for implementation with female adult caregivers who have or are at risk for long-term
      interpersonal conflict with family members, children, or significant others and are caring
      for a child between the ages of birth and 7 years. The PIO intervention involves 12-24 weekly
      1 hour individual therapy sessions with Masters level therapists who are trained and
      supervised by Dr. Suchman (the Principal Investigator) in the PIO approach.

    <description>The caregiver-child dyad will be given age-appropriate toys and instructed to interact freely and session is videotaped and coded using CIB. Composite scores are scored on a 1 - 5 scale. Composite maternal scales include Sensitivity, Intrusiveness, Limit Setting, and Negative Emotion. Composite Child Scales include Child Involvement, Withdrawal and Compliance. Composite Dyadic Scales include Reciprocity and Dyadic Negative States.</description>

    <description>The composite Global Severity Index (GSI) from the Brief Symptom Inventory measures current overall symptomatology across multiple domains (e.g., depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, somatic complaints, paranoid ideation) and has demonstrated good reliability and validity. T scores above 60 on the GSI indicate risk for a clinical disorder.</description>
