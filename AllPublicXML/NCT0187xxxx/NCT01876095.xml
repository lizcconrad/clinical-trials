  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing home residents are among the frailest patient groups with a high number of
      co-morbidities and a high use of medicines. Inappropriate polypharmacy (i.e. often
      overprescribing) is one of the major problems in the nursing home population increasing the
      number of adverse drug reactions, falls, hospital admissions, mortality as well as having an
      impact on health care utilization. Multidisciplinary medication reviews have a great
      potential to reduce inappropriate medication use. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the efficacy of a multidisciplinary medication review model focussing on discontinuing
      inappropriate medication in a cluster randomized controlled trial in 600 nursing home
      residents. The primary outcome measure is the difference in proportion of residents who
      successfully discontinued medication between intervention and control group after four
      months. Secondary outcome measures will be the drug burden index, adverse drug withdrawal
      events related to the discontinued medication, death, referral to hospitals and quality of
      life.

    <description>The multidisciplinary medication review consists of 5 steps:
Step #1: Assessing patients' experiences and preferences regarding medicine use en assessing their medical history, allergies and lab results Step #2: Drug reviewing to assess contra-indicated medication and duplicate medication using consensus criteria e.g. START STOPP Beers criteria Step #3: Reflecting on results of drug reviewing Step #4: Setting up a pharmacotherapeutical action plan Step #5: Execution of pharmacotherapeutical action plan</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Multidisciplinary medication review</intervention_name>
    <description>Consists of the following steps:
1. Elderly care physician and nursing staff evaluate with the patient the experience of taking medicines, adverse drug reactions and patient's preferences.
2. Pharmacist reviews medication to identify drug related problems using START/STOPP en Beers criteria.
3/4. Meeting of elderly care physician, pharmacist. Possibilities to discontinue prescribed medication will be examined resulting in pharmaceutical care plan that optimizes the patient's medication i.e. which inappropriate medication should be discontinued following a prioritization and time schedule.
5. Execution of pharmaceutical care plan according to agreed schedule.</description>
