    <textblock>
      Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
      disease (ADPKD) have opened up possibilities of new therapies to prevent disease progression.
      High quality clinical investigations in patients with ADPKD, however, pose significant
      challenges to investigators including limited access to patients with ADPKD,insufficient
      guidance by experienced investigators and lack of resources to conduct these studies.

      The Polycystic Kidney Disease Research Clinical and Translational Core (P30) aims to
      establish an infrastructure that will assist investigators in designing and conducting
      highest quality clinical and translational research focused on a diverse group of patients
      with ADPKD.

      Objective 1: To establish a Mid-Atlantic cohort of ADPKD patients (N=200) with baseline
      clinical phenotyping performed at the General Clinical Research Unit of the University of
      Maryland School of Medicine.

      Objective 2: To establish a state-of-the-art biobank of specimens from the ADPKD cohort
      including serum, plasma,urine and DNA.

      Objective 3: To develop a collaborative network of physicians and practices in the
      Mid-Atlantic region who will contribute to the ADPKD cohort and will be willing to refer
      patients for future studies and trials.

      Objective 4: To establish a web-based registry of ADPKD patients in the Mid-Atlantic area.

      The purpose of this study is to establish a prospective observational cohort of 200
      well-characterized adults with ADPKD, and an associated biorepository of DNA, plasma, serum,
      and urine. Baseline clinical phenotyping includes measurement of renal filtration function,
      total kidney volume, clinical and family history, presence and history of renal and
      extra-renal ADPKD manifestations, cardiac function, vascular stiffness, and health-related
      quality of life.

      Prospective characterization will include the development of ADPKD complications (e.g.,
      infection, stones, cyst hemorrhage) and other acute medical events, and changes in symptoms
      and QoL.

      In addition, an electronic PKD patient registry will collect demographic and contact
      information on adults with ADPKD interested in participating in future clinical trials and/or
      observational cohort studies.

      No treatment interventions will be performed in these observational studies
