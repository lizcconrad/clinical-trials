      To investigate whether prolonged period of treatment (6 months) can have a better therapeutic
      outcome than conventional period (3 months) of antimuscarinics.

    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), with or without urge incontinence, is characterized by
      urinary urgency, frequency and nocturia. Thus, patients with OAB could be considered to have
      a reduced quality of life. Patients with overactive bladder syndrome have a higher risk of
      falling and fracture due to nocturia. OAB affects around 17 % of female population. At
      present, muscarinic receptor antagonists are the ﬁrst-line pharmacotherapeutic agents for
      OAB. However, discontinuation of the treatment often results in symptom relapse. Until now,
      optimal duration of the treatment and durability of the efﬁcacy have not been determined. We
      plan to use urodynamic studies outcome to evaluate therapeutic effect, with the change of
      urinary nerve growth factor level. This study is a randomized prospective study, comparing
      female OAB patient after 3 months and 6 months of antimuscarinic treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference of urodynamic effects, therapeutic
      effect and urinary urinary nerve growth factor level between OAB females after 3 months and 6
      months antimuscarinic treatment.
