  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised cross-over study comparing two methods of local anaesthesia for patients
      diagnosed with periodontitis undergoing scaling and root planning. 40 patients will be
      included in the study, which aims to demonstrate that the effect of a bupivacaine lozenge is
      non-inferior to lidocaine-adrenalin injections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 periodontitis patients undergoing scaling and root planning (SRP) will be randomised to
      receive local anaesthesia by either a bupivacaine lozenge or lidocaine-adrenalin injection at
      their first visit. At the following visit, the patients will receive the opposite treatment.

      At each visit the patient will evaluate pain before, during and after SRP by:

        -  Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 0-10 where 0 = no pain, 10 = extreme pain.

        -  McGills Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), which gives a qualitative pain profile.

      At each visit the patient will evaluate discomfort before, during and after the SRP by:

      - Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 0-10 where 0 = no discomfort, 10 = extreme discomfort.

      Additionally the patient assesses the comfort of administration of the two local anaesthesia
      as well as the taste of the bupivacaine lozenge. The investigator also evaluates the scaling
      procedure.
