  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore the effects of a 6-week phospholipid drink intervention on the
      cognitive performance and physiological and subjective stress parameters of males following a
      repeated psychosocial/physical stressor.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study conforms to a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel groups design
      examining cognitive performance and physiological/subjective stress responses after a
      psychosocial/physical stressor before and after a six week daily intake of an phospholipid
      containing drink vs. placebo.

      The study will examine:

      Cognitive performance following acute stress prior to, and following 6-weeks intake of a
      phospholipid containing drink or a placebo analogue.

      Physiological and subjective stress responses following acute stress prior to, and following
      6-weeks intake of a phospholipid containing drink or a placebo analogue
