  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the comparability of the safety and
      efficacy of Mupirocin Calcium Cream, 2% and Bactroban® Cream in subjects with secondarily
      infected traumatic skin lesions. It will also be determined whether the efficacy of each of
      the active treatments is superior to that of the vehicle cream (placebo).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or nonpregnant females aged 18 months or older with a secondarily
             infected traumatic skin lesion such as a laceration, sutured wound, or abrasion.

          -  The laceration or sutured wound should not exceed 10 cm in length with surrounding
             erythema not more than 2 cm from the edge of the lesion. An abrasion should not exceed
             100 cm2 in total area with surrounding erythema not more than 2 cm from the edge of
             the abrasion.

          -  Positive baseline culture for S. aureus and/or S. pyogenes from a sample taken from
             the secondarily infected traumatic skin lesion.

          -  Positive Gram stain or Wright stain for confirmation of white blood cells in the
             pus/exudate from the secondarily infected traumatic skin lesion.

          -  Skin Infection Rating Scale total score for the secondarily infected traumatic skin
             lesion of at least 8 at baseline.

          -  Women of childbearing potential, in addition to having a negative urine pregnancy
             test, must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control during the study.

          -  Subjects must be in good health and free from any clinically significant disease,
             other than secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions, that might interfere with the
             study evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy within the study
             participation period.

          -  Bacterial skin infection that, because of depth or severity, could not be
             appropriately treated with a topical antibiotic.

          -  Secondarily infected bite or puncture wound.

          -  Systemic signs or symptoms of infection.
