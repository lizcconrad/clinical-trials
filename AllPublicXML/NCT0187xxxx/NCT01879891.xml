  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to test the hypothesis high interval exercise increases energy
      expenditure and Insulin sensitivity more than 2 days of rest or moderate intensity exercise
      cumulatively over 23 hours during and following the exercise. Secondary goals are to evaluate
      exercise difficulty during moderate intensity exercise and high interval exercise as well as
      difficulty of activities of daily living and free living physical activity following rest,
      moderate intensity exercise and high interval exercise.

      A secondary study is designed to evaluate potential mechanism. Hypotheses are that changes in
      muscle lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, fat and cellular insulin signals will be
      increased following the high intensity interval exercise. In addition, these changes will be
      related to changes in insulin sensitivity and increases in protein metabolism and muscle
      damage.

    <description>The Non-Biopsy group will complete a VO2 maximum test, are provided food 2 days prior to assessments, exercise in the metabolic chamber, have a Resting Energy Expenditure test, complete a DEXA and have blood drawn. This group will stay overnight in the metabolic chamber and have the clamp procedure. Exercise training is exactly the same for both groups.
Those who select the Non-Biopsy group, in lieu of the biopsy test, will complete an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) test that involves sub-maximal VO2 assessment. The participants will also be asked to where an accelerometer home for 4 consecutive days after the ADL test.</description>

    <description>The Biopsy group will also complete a VO2 maximum test, are provided food 2 days prior to assessments, exercise in the metabolic chamber, have a Resting Energy Expenditure test, complete a DEXA and have blood drawn. As with the Non-Biopsy group, this group will stay overnight in the metabolic chamber and have the clamp procedure. Exercise training is exactly the same for both groups. One week following the overnight metabolic chamber visit, participants in this group will undergo a muscle biopsy. This group will not complete the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) test nor will they be asked to wear an accelerometer.</description>

    <description>Exercise training will consist of bicycle ergometer riding starting at 67% of heart rate max for 20 minutes. Exercise Intensity will be progressively increased every week until 80% of heart rate max for 40 minute sessions is reached.</description>
