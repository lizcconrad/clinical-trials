    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to determine the role of renal sympathetic denervation in the
      prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in patients with hypertension for whom a
      catheter-based AF ablation procedure is planned. Patients will be randomized to either AF
      catheter ablation (usual therapy) or AF catheter ablation plus renal sympathetic denervation.

    <description>Patient anesthesia will be administered according to standard EP lab protocol. Arterial and venous access will be achieved through cannulation of the right and/or left femoral arteries and veins as per the usual practice of the EP lab. Full systemic anticoagulation will be instituted as per standard hospital procedures to a target ACT of approximately 300 seconds or greater. Intravascular ultrasound may be used to assist in the positioning of study catheters during the procedure. The AF ablation procedure will be performed using a cryoballoon ablation catheter. Complete pulmonary vein isolation will be the goal of the ablation procedure and PV isolation must be confirmed by a multielectrode mapping catheter within each PV. Pulmonary vein isolation is the only intervention. A cavo-tricuspid isthmus line may be placed in patients with either a history of ECG-determined typical flutter or induced typical flutter during the procedure.</description>

    <description>Right or left femoral artery access. Real-time 3D aorta-renal artery maps constructed with the use of a navigation system and ablation catheter. Mapping and ablation performed after PVI and under identical sedation protocol used for AF ablation. RF delivery of 6 watts to be applied discretely from the first distal main renal artery bifurcation all the way back to the ostium; RF duration of each delivery 1.5 mins; lesions delivered at multiple sites based on multipolar catheter position within renal artery. Use of specifically designed RF delivery system for renal artery denervation is mandatory (RDN). To confirm renal denervation, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) will be applied before the initial and after each RF delivery within the renal artery. Rectangular electrical stimuli will be delivered at the ostium of the targeted renal artery at a frequency of 20 Hz, with an amplitude 15 V and pulse duration of 10 ms for 10 secs.</description>
