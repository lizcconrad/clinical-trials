  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project goal is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether mobile
      phone short message system (SMS) reminders, either with or without mobile-phone based travel
      subsidies will improve timeliness, coverage, and drop-out rates of routine EPI vaccines in
      rural western Kenya.

    <measure>Percent of fully immunized children (FIC) by study arm</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>FIC = One dose bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, three doses pentavalent (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccine, three doses polio vaccine and one dose measles vaccine. The proportion of FIC infants by 10 months of age in each of the intervention arms (SMS only and SMS + subsidy) will be separately compared to the control arm using statistical analyses that adjust for the cluster design and any socio-demographic variables that may be unequally distributed across study arms</description>

    <description>The proportion of intervention arm infants that receive vaccination within 2 weeks of the scheduled date will be calculated for each dose of vaccine and compared to the control arm using statistical analyses that adjust for our cluster design and any socio-demographic variables that may be unequally distributed across study arms</description>

    <measure>Proportion of children dropping out between doses</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Direct costs for each intervention arm</measure>
    <time_frame>25 months, approximate time period for deploying interventions</time_frame>
    <description>Costs include SMS messages, the amount of travel subsidy transferred, and the tariffs and fees that are associated with using mobile-money. For each arm, these costs will be divided by the number of children vaccinated and comparisons will be made across study arms</description>
