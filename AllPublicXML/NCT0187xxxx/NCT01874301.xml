  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal discomfort regularly affects &gt;25% of the population worldwide. One of the
      major contributors to Gastrointestinal discomfort is constipation, which has a prevalence of
      ~15%, and symptoms of which have a significant negative impact on the sufferer's quality of
      life. One of the hallmarks of chronic constipation is slow progression of contents through
      the gut (i.e. slow gut / colonic transit time), which may be associated with hard stools that
      are difficult to expel. Previous studies have shown that probiotics improve colonic transit
      times in constipated patients. In addition, several other studies, employing a range of
      different probiotic strains, have shown a significant increase in defaecation frequency and
      improvement in stool consistency. However, the clinical relevance of these results is
      uncertain, due to small sample sizes and limitations in study methodology. The current study
      is designed to compare changes in gut transit time and gastrointestinal symptoms following 4
      weeks consumption of a probiotic strain in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      manner, in adults with constipation.

  <detailed_description>

      This is an adaptive, parallel, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, stratified
      clinical study, comparing three study arms (two quantities of the probiotic active component
      and one placebo)with equal allocation ratio. Recruitment of subjects to the low quantity of
      the probiotic will be after fulfilling certain criteria at interim. After half of the
      subjects in the two study groups of high quantity and placebo have completed the study (40
      subjects), an interim analysis will be performed. Depending on the observed effect size and
      the conditional power, the study may be stopped for futility, continued with the two groups
      or continued with inclusion of the third group of low dose probiotics.
