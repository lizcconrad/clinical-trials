      This project was aimed to identify the risk factors associated with the occurrence of
      respiratory complications in post anesthesia care unit. The primary outcome was the composite
      measure of occurrence of complications in PACU. The components were apnea or hypopnea,
      laryngospasm, bronchospasm and prolonged oxygen requirement.

      This is a retrospective project. Data will be used from Quality Improvement database for
      publication purpose. Data was collected from a prospectively collected database that was done
      as a Quality Improvement Project. The study sites included post anesthesia care units (PACU)
      of the main and ambulatory campuses of our hospital. The data was collected from surgical and
      radiology PACU's. Data was collected each quarter for 2 weeks in the surgical PACU, and for 1
      month in Radiology PACU, from Sep 2007 through Mar 2012. Trained perioperative nurses and
      Certified Registered Nurse Anesthesiologist did data collection. This ensured a sample
      representative of at least 10% of patients anesthetized for surgical and radiological
      procedures. The independent variables (risk factors) collected included age, American Society
      of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status, obesity, preexisting airway or lung disease,
      preexisting neuromuscular disease or hypotonia, morbid obesity, intraoperative bronchospasm
      and intraoperative laryngospasm. The primary outcome variables collected were Apnea or
      hypopnea, Laryngospasm, Bronchospasm, and prolonged Oxygen requirement. Apnea or hypopnea was
      defined by the need for bag mask ventilation, Laryngospasm by the requirement of a positive
      pressure ventilation of &gt; 20 cmH2O or administration of succinylcholine, Bronchospasm by use
      of albuterol, and Oxygen requirement by continued oxygen administration to maintain SpO2&gt;92%
      for 2 hours postoperatively.
