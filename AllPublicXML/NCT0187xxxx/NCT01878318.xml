      This open-label, single arm study will evaluate the effect of RoActemra/Actemra in
      combination with methotrexate on articular damage in the hand (synovitis/osteitis and
      erosions) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate
      response to non-biological disease-modifying ante-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients will
      receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks.
