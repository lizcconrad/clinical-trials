      Background:

      Aim:

      Clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of two different polyethylene glycol doses for the
      maintenance treatment of functional constipation in children.

      Study design:

      Randomized, open-label trial.

      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children will be randomly assigned into 2 groups receiving polyethylene glycol 4000 (Forlax)
      with an initial dose of either 0.3g/kg, or 0.7 g / kg.

      In case of ineffectiveness the dose of medication will be increased every two weeks with 0.2
      g/kg. The indication for the increase in dose will be less than 3 bowel movements per week.
      For children with diarrhea defined as more than 3 loose stools for minimum 2 days or/and
      severe abdominal pain the macrogol dose of will be reduced every two weeks by 0.2 g/kg. The
      intervention will last 6 weeks.
