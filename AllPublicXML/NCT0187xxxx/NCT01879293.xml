  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the world. Most of the attention
      in treating ischemic heart disease (IHD) is understandably directed toward treating coronary
      artery disease. However there are other treatable culprits in these patients.

      Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in IHD patients, even in the absence of
      hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In
      one study, the presence of LVH was a stronger predictor of mortality than either multivessel
      cor-onary disease or impaired LV function.

      Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent with a history of successful use in type 2 diabetes.
      In the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study), metformin was associated with a 39%
      lower risk of myocardial infarction compared with conventional therapy. Metformin also
      offered dual benefits of improving vascular function and lessening ischemia in nondiabetic
      patients.

      Hence, the main aim of this study was to assess whether metformin could regress LVM in
      patients with IHD. The secondary aim was to assess the effect of metformin on LV volumes and
      endothelial function in this patient group.
