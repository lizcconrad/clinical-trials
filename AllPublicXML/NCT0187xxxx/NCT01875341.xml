  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetic patients (NIDDM) with nephropathy, and is
      the single most important determinant of the rate of renal function loss. In many of these
      patients, hypertension is resistant to therapy. Although increased sympathetic activity is
      also highly prevalent in NIDDM patients with nephropathy and chronic renal insufficiency,
      little attention has been paid to sleep apnea as the cause of both resistant hypertension and
      sympathetic hyperactivity in this population. Since the prevalence of sleep apnea is
      increased in patients with either NIDDM, or resistant hypertension, or chronic renal
      insufficiency, it is almost certain that sleep apnea has a high prevalence in patients in
      whom all three states co-exist, i.e. NIDDM patients with nephropathy and hypertension
      resistant to therapy. As a consequence of undetected and untreated sleep apnea, resistant
      hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, and sympathetic hyperactivity likely contribute to
      accelerated loss of renal function and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
      these patients.

      Hypothesis: A. Sleep apnea is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic
      nephropathy and hypertension resistant to therapy. Treatment with nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (NCPAP) will result in a decrease in blood pressure and restore normal
      diurnal blood pressure pattern.

      B. Sleep apnea-caused hypertension is mediated by sympathetic hyperactivity and increased
      activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in type 2 diabetic patients with
      nephropathy. A decrease in sympathetic hyperactivity in response to NCPAP therapy will result
      in a decrease in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concomitant with decreases in
      blood pressure.

      Randomized, double blind, parallel comparative (two groups) one center trial.

      The study will be double blind and consist of two parallel groups. Patients with type 2
      diabetes with a creatinine clearance above 20 ml/min and with microalbuminuria or proteinuria
      who have both resistant hypertension and sleep apnea will be studied. Creatinine clearance
      and proteinuria will be assessed from a 24 hour urine collection not older than 6 months.
      Microalbuminuria will be assessed from at least 2 out of 3 positive random urine samples with
      the last one not older than 6 months. Blood pressure will be considered as resistive to
      treatment if the patient is on 3 or more antihypertensive medications with blood pressure
      readings of greater than 140/90 mmHg on the last 2 out of 3 office visits. Sleep apnea
      syndrome will be defined by the presence of at least 5 apneic or hypopneic episodes per hour
      during an overnight sleep study.

      Screening will be done in the following manner: Patients seen in the Hypertension Unit at the
      University of Ottawa Heart Institute, General Nephrology Clinic and Progressive Renal
      Insufficiency Clinic at the Ottawa Hospital, will be screened by the study coordinator. For
      the patients who meet the study criteria, the attending physician is asked for permission to
      contact each patient. If patients agree to participate, they will undergo a sleep study.
      Screening of patients and subsequent sleep studies will continue until 54 consecutive
      patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea (15 apneic or hypopneic episodes per hr) are
      found and enrolled into the study. The prevalence of sleep apnea in the specialty clinic
      population will be calculated as the number of patients with sleep apnea diagnosed based on a
      sleep study divided by the total number of clinic patients screened who underwent a sleep
      study.

      After the baseline visit and completion of all preliminary procedures, specific studies for
      microneurography, plasma renin and aldosterone will be performed. Consequently, a 24 hour
      blood pressure monitor and a 24 hour urine collection for creatinine clearance,
      microalbuminuria and proteinuria will be done. Once all the testing has been completed, the
      patient will be randomized to therapeutic or sub-therapeutic treatment with nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks of treatment the specific studies, 24
      hour blood pressure monitoring and 24 hour urine collection will be repeated.

    <description>microneurography,will assess sympathetic hyperactivity measuring Muscle sympathetic-nerve activity from the peroneal nerve. A tungsten micro electrode will be inserted into the peroneal nerve. A reference electrode will be placed subcutaneously 1 to 2 cm from the recording electrode. The sympathetic activity will be amplified, filtered, integrated and displayed on a computer monitor. In addition, the signal will be digitized and recorded on a computer with a sampling rate of 2,000 Hz. All recordings will be done in a similar manner after at least 20 minutes of rest and will be combined with continuous blood pressure and heart rate measurements.
Muscle sympathetic-nerve activity will be expressed as the number of bursts per minute and as the number of bursts per 100 heart beats, to correct for differences in heart rate.</description>
