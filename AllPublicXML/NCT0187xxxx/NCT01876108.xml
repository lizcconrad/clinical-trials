  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of Helicobacter pylori(HP)in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD) is controversial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized double blind clinical trial was performed in dyspeptic patients with positive
      antibody to HP and the evidence of fatty liver in ultrasonography. After excluding other
      causes, participants with persistent elevated serum aminotransferase levels were presumed to
      have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver fat score greater than (-0.64) and positive urea breath
      test (UBT) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle modification alone or
      lifestyle modification plus HP eradication groups. Quadruple therapy (omeprazole,
      amoxicillin, bismuth subcitrate, and clarithromycin) for HP eradication was performed in two
      weeks. HP eradication was documented by UBT. Liver fat content, fasting serum glucose,
      alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride,
      cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein,homeostasis model assessment-insulin
      resistance(HOMA-IR), and anthropometric measurements (body mass index and waist
      circumference) were checked at baseline and six months later.
