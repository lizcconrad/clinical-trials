      There will be 200 participants, who aged 30 years or older with TBI in 1,5,10,15 years ago
      and GCS=13-15 will be recruited. Another group of 200 participants with the same age and
      gender and without TBI will be recruited as the controls. All of them will undergo AD8
      questionnaire for dementia screening and APOE4 genotyping. Further CASI and CDR will be
      tested for the confirmation of dementia diagnosis for the individuals with AD8 scaore &gt;/=2.
      10 TBI with dementia, 20 TBI without dementia and 10 controls will be selected randomly for
      AV45 amylid PET study.

      There will also be 10 participants without traumatic brain injury and interested in this
      study, aged 55 years or older better.

      We will examine the mTBI patients in a long-term follow-up manner by cognitive tests and
      A-PET. This is a novel study for linking mTBI and AD by solid, reliable methods, in terms of
      A-PET and cognitive function tests. In addition, we will figure out the importance of APOE
      genotypes for amyloid accumulation and cognitive impairment. These results should shed light
      on the further clinical studies and amyloid-cleaning therapy for prevention and treatment for
      dementia after mTBI.
