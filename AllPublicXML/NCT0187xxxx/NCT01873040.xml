  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of social media website devoted to vaccines to
      change immunization knowledge, perceptions and behavior. If effective, this intervention will
      represent an innovative, low cost and broadly applicable resource to reduce parental
      vaccination concerns.

      The study has two hypothesis:

        1. Parents receiving usual care plus social media website will demonstrate higher early
           childhood immunization rates to parents receiving either usual plus non interactive
           website or usual care only.

        2. Parents receiving usual care plus social media website will demonstrate positive changes
           in knowledge, attitudes and beliefs supporting vaccination compared to parents receiving
           either usual care plus non-interactive website or usual care only.

    <measure>Days under-immunized</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Days under-immunized is a metric to identify immunization delay. For each vaccine dose calculate the difference between when the vaccine dose was actually administered and when the vaccine dose should have been administered according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) schedule. That difference is summed across all doses and vaccines for a total number of days under-immunized for each child. Total days under immunized was calculated 200 days after life or after enrollment. If someone had 0 days at that time they were considered &quot;up to date&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Child age 3-5 months, Child age 12-15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs will be measured with a survey at up to 3 time points during the study: 1) Initial enrollment in the study, 2) child's ag=4-6 months and 3) child's age=11-13 months.</description>
