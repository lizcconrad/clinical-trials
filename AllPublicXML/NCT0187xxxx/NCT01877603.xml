  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irisin is a signaling protein that is released into the blood from skeletal muscle after
      proteolysis of the membrane protein FNDC5 . FNDC5, encoded by the Fndc5 gene. Irisin activity
      on subcutaneous white adipose tissue, both in culture and in vivo, stimulated UCP1 expression
      and induction of brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue depots, a process known as white
      fat ''browning''. Irisin increases total energy expenditure in animal models, and irisin
      expression in mice fed a high fat diet resulted in a significant improvement in glucose
      tolerance and a reduction in fasting insulin levels. Collectively, these data suggest that
      decreased serum irisin levels may be associated with the development of insulin resistance
      and Type 2 diabetes. Indeed, some studies showed that irisin levels were decreased in newly
      diagnosed Type 2 diabetes.

      Endothelial dysfunction is an early physiological event in atherosclerosis. However, to date,
      no data are available on the relationship between circulating irisin and endothelial
      dysfunction in diabetes. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that circulating irisin
      level is associated with endothelial dysfunction.

        From July 2013 to Dec 2013, a total of 200 Chinese Han newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic
        patients were selected. They had been referred to our hospital and were aged 40～70 years.

        During the same period, 50 healthy subjects (all from medical staff in our hospital) were
        selected as control subjects.

             and/or intermittent claudication and/or a past history of revascularization of the
             lower limbs) were excluded from the study.
