  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) is one of the most severe rare inherited
      skin disorders affecting children and adults. Current medical care protocols for RDEB
      patients are limited to palliative procedures to treat blistering and erosive lesions,
      wounds, and severe local and systemic complications such as fusion and contracture of the
      digits, skin cancer, esophageal stricture, severe anemia, infections, malnutrition and growth
      retardation. However, current medical treatments still cannot prevent the recurrence of the
      lesions arising from defective expression of type VII collagen (COL7A1), the main constituent
      of anchoring fibrils which form essential structures for dermal-epidermal adherence.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the capacity of keratinocytes and fibroblasts to
      repair skin wounds in patients suffering from Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa
      (RDEB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the perspective of future therapeutic interventions, which could involve protein, cellular
      and/or gene therapy, it is essential to investigate RDEB patients with regards to their
      immune tolerance to type VII collagen and their capacity of their cells for tissue
      reconstruction.

      All patients will have a blood sample of 5 ml on EDTA, 10 ml on heparin and 5 ml on dry tube
      collected for genomic DNA extraction to identify or verify COL7A1 mutations: mutation
      screening of the patients will be performed to identify COL7A1 mutations on both alleles. 2)
      HLA genotyping: patients selected on the clinical and molecular criteria will be
      HLA-genotyped by PCR to determine the likelihood of an immune response to the type VII
      collagen wild-type protein. A 5-mm punch skin biopsy performed under local anaesthesic will
      be undertaken during visit 1 for diagnostic purposes .The consequences of COL7A1 mutations on
      collagen VII protein expression will be determined, if not performed previously. Two
      additional 5-mm punch skin biopsies will be taken from different areas from up to 10 patients
      during the second visit. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts will be expanded and stored in
      vapor-phase liquid-nitrogen.
