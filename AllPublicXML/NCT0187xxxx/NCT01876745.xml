    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Asia. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of NovoSeven® (activated recombinant factor VII, eptacog alfa (activated)) during bleeding
      episodes and for the prevention of bleeding during surgery/delivery in patients with
      Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT)/Glanzmann's disease.
