  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preparation of patients for discharge is a primary function of hospital-based nursing care
      and readiness for discharge is an important outcome of hospital care. Inadequacies in
      discharge preparation have been well-documented and linked to difficulty with self-management
      after hospital discharge and with increased likelihood of emergency department (ED) use and
      readmission. Prior studies by the research team have led to recommendations for
      implementation of discharge readiness assessment as a standard nursing practice for hospital
      discharge.

      The investigators will conduct a multi-site study to determine the impact on post-discharge
      utilization (readmission and ED visits) and costs of implementing discharge readiness
      assessment as a standard nursing practice for adult medical-surgical patients discharged to
      home. The study tests, in a stepped approach, the impact of implementing discharge readiness
      assessment by the discharging nurse as standard nursing practice (RN-RHDS protocol), the
      incremental value of informing the nurse assessment with the patient's perspective
      (RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS protocol), and of requiring that the nurse initiates and documents
      risk-mitigating actions for patients with low readiness scores (RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS+NIAF
      protocol).

      HYPOTHESIS 1: Patients discharged using the RN-RHDS protocol will have fewer hospital
      readmissions and ED visits within 30 days post-discharge compared to patients discharged
      under usual care conditions.

      HYPOTHESIS 2: Patients discharged using the RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS protocol will have fewer hospital
      readmissions and ED visits within 30 days post-discharge compared to patients discharged
      using the RN-RHDS protocol.

      HYPOTHESIS 3: Patients discharged by nurses using the RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS protocol plus a
      Nurse-Initiated Action Form [NIAF] (RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS+NIAF protocol) will have fewer
      post-discharge readmissions and ED visits than patients discharged using the RN-RHDS+PT-RHDS
      protocol; the effect will be strongest for patients with low RHDS scores.

      Aim 4: Conduct cost-benefit analysis of implementing discharge readiness assessment as
      standard practice, by comparing cost-savings from reduced post-discharge utilization against
      implementation costs.
