      To explore the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of two different formulations of
      ACT-129968, i.e., tablet versus capsule and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a
      single dose of two different formulations of ACT-129968, i.e., tablet versus capsule.

    <textblock>
      A total of 10 female and 10 male healthy subjects will be enrolled and will attend two
      treatment periods, separated by a 7-9 day washout. Over these two periods, two formulations
      of ACT-129968 (Treatment A: two capsules, 250 mg each; Treatment B: one tablet, 500 mg) will
      be administered in the sequence A/B or B/A to 10 subjects (5 females and 5 males) per
      sequence as determined by randomization.

             administration.

          -  Loss of 250 mL or more of blood within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Positive results from the hepatitis serology (Hepatitis B surface antigen and
             anti-hepatitis C virus), except for vaccinated subjects or subjects with past but
             resolved hepatitis (defined as positive finding for antibodies but negative findings
             for antigens), at screening.

          -  Positive results from the human immunodeficiency virus serology at screening.
