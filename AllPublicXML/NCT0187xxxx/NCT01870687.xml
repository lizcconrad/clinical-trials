      The purpose of this study is to proof the efficacy and safety of 20 mg (2 tablets of 10 mg)
      VAC BNO 1095 film-coated tablets in patients suffering from cyclic mastodynia and PMS (pre
      menstrual syndrome).

      The study consists of a 2-cycle run-in period, followed by 3 cycles of treatment. After first
      screening at S-2 further visits are scheduled after the end of each of the first and second
      run-in cycle, and after the first, second and third treatment cycle, respectively.

      At least 220 patients should be eligible for randomisation, 110 to each treatment group, of
      which 160 (80 per group) will be available for data evaluation.
