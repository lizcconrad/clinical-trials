          -  Body Mass Index : ≥17.6, &lt;26.4

          -  Healthy, as judged by the investigator/subinvestigator based on the results of
             physical examinations (subjective symptoms and objective findings) and all tests
             obtained at screening and during the period from hospital admission in Period 1 to
             immediately before study medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with the following history.

               1. Hepatic disease (e.g. viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury).

               2. Heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, arrhythmia
                  requiring

                  treatment).

               3. Respiratory disease (e.g. serious bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis)

               4. Gastrointestinal disease (e.g. serious peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux
                  esophagitis;

                  diseases requiring several selections except for appendicitis)

               5. Renal disease (e.g. acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis, interstitial
                  nephritis).

               6. Cerebrovascular disorder (e.g. cerebral infarction).

               7. Malignant tumor.

               8. Drug allergies. Allergic disorders (except for hay fever)

             the day of study medication).

          -  Any deviation of the following criteria for clinical laboratory tests at screening or
             upon admission in Period 1 (day preceding the day of study medication). The normal
             reference ranges specified at the study site will be used as the normal reference
             ranges in the present study.

                       other items than the above.

                    -  However, the lower limit of the normal range will not be established for
                       items for which a deviation from the lower limit is not considered
                       clinically significant[AST, ALT, total bilirubin (T-Bil), ALP, γ-GTP, LDH,
                       CK, Cre, uric acid (UA)and total cholesterol (T-Cho)].

                    -  U-Uro ≥+2

               4. Urinary drug test: A positive result for phencyclidine, benzodiazepine, cocaine,
                  amphetamines, cannabis, opiates, barbiturates or tricyclic antidepressants

               5. Immunological test: A positive result for HBs antigen, HCV antibody, syphilis, or

             120 days before the screening assessment

          -  Previous treatment with FK949E

          -  Donated more than 400 mL of whole blood within 90 days, more than 200 mL of whole
             blood within 30 days, or blood components within 14 days before the screening
             assessment

          -  Excessive smoking or drinking habit (measure of &quot;excessive&quot;: alcohol: 45 g/day [a 633
