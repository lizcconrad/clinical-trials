  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and quality of
      life (QOL) questionnaires for their accuracy, sensitivity, and ability to reliably measure
      the severity of cough, breathlessness, and changes in cough and disease-related quality of
      life over time in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients. These questionnaires have
      been used in other types of disease, but have not all been tested and validated in patients
      with cough due to IPF. Our hypothesis is that worsening of cough, dyspnea, and cough-related
      QOL questionnaire scores will correlate with physiologic markers of IPF severity and
      worsening of disease. Written, valid questionnaires measuring cough, dyspnea, and QOL are
      important to assess the benefit of investigational drugs under development to treat patients
      with IPF.

      This study in patients with IPF will determine the validity, responsiveness, and reliability
      of two cough measures (the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), as well as Visual Analogue
      Scales (VASs) for cough severity and distress; one dyspnea measure (the Baseline and
      Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI); and two health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures
      (the obstructive lung disease-specific Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and
      the IPF-specific 'A Tool to Assess QOL in IPF' (ATAQ-IPF). Both the SGRQ and ATAQ include
      cough questions. Study participants will complete all questionnaires at baseline, 6, 12, and
      18 months at the time of their usual clinic visits. Physiologic data will be collected at the
      same time of these visits including pulmonary function testing, exercise oxygen saturation,
      and changes in medications and health status. Changes in cough, dyspnea and QOL scores will
      be correlated with concurrent changes in physiologic markers of IPF severity. If a study
      participant has an acute worsening of their IPF, or undergoes lung transplantation, study
      questionnaires may be given at these additional timepoints when possible.
