  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ultrasonographic airway measurement in
      pediatric patients to compare the correct size of an uncuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) with
      the minimal transverse airway diameter (MTAD) with tube size predicted by different
      age-related formulas and diameter of little finger.

      Previous studies already showed that a prediction of pediatric ETT is possible with the
      ultrasonographic measurement of the MTAD. In this study measurements are performed at three
      predefined anatomic structures of the airway with each of These at two airway pressures.

      The investigators hypothesize that one of the specific measurements predicts the fitting ETT
      size better than age-related formulas or diameter of little finger.
