    <textblock>
      The investigators know that metformin works at the level of the cells in the body by acting
      on a protein called Cyclic amine monophosphate- Response Binding Elements (CREB) binding
      protein or Constitutive Reverter of eIF2α Phosphorylation (CREP) Binding Protein (CBP). What
      the investigators do not know is how this process is affected when the dose of the metformin
      is increased or changed.

      Currently the same doses of metformin are often used in both children and adults, but it is
      possible that the dose of metformin should be based on age and weight. Understanding how CBP
      works could potentially help us to tailor metformin treatment individually for patients based
      on their age, weight and CBP response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our studies have shown that metformin acts at the cellular level by acting on a target
      protein, Cyclic amine monophosphate-Response Binding Elements (CREB) binding protein or CREP
      Binding Protein (CBP). Patients are treated with many different doses of metformin, some
      patients respond well to low doses while others require much higher doses. The investigators
      do not understand why this may be and are interested in knowing if the investigators can
      treat patents effectively with low doses. What the investigators do not know is how this
      process is affected when the dose of the metformin is increased or changed. Changes in
      metformin's target protein will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the dose.

      Also, currently the same doses of metformin are often used in both children and adults, but
      it is possible that the dose of metformin should be based on age and weight. Understanding
      how CBP works could potentially help us to tailor metformin treatment individually for
      patients based on their age, weight and CBP response.

    <description>A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. If a subject has a blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests, they are diagnosed with diabetes. Metformin decreases fasting blood sugar.</description>

    <time_frame>Approximately Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the effect of dose escalation of metformin on CBP phosphorylation in white blood cells in both in vivo and ex vivo assays to subsequent physiological changes in vivo for adults and children. CBP phosphorylation will be measured by western blot analysis using a probe that is specific for the phosphorylated CBP protein. The outcome will be the % difference between the patient before starting metformin and at each dose increment.</description>

          <title>Metformin</title>
          <description>Doses will be increased incrementally. Decisions to escalate the metformin dose will be made based upon tolerability of side effects as described in the schedule of evaluations to follow. All subjects will be monitored for safety while receiving metformin. Any participant with blood glucose of &lt;60mg/dl at any time while receiving metformin will have therapy stopped and will be withdrawn from the study.
For children &lt;50kg:
Baseline:250mg po qd, Week 2:250mg po bid, Week 4:500mg po AM/250mg po PM, Week 8:500mg po bid.
For children ≥50kg:
Baseline:500mg po qd, Week 2:500mg po bid, Week 4:1000mg po AM/500mg po PM, Week 8:1000mg po bid.
For adults:
Baseline:500mg po qd,Week2:500mg po bid,Week 4:1000mg po AM/500mg po PM,Week 8:1000mg po bid.
