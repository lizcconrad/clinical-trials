  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization increases the risk for new disability in older adults. In the current health
      care system, home health physical therapy is understudied and often does not return older
      adults to prior levels of function. The proposed evidence-based multicomponent intervention
      that combines high intensity strength training and motor control based systems of gait and
      balance training will advance clinical practice by providing an intervention strategy for
      practitioners. If successful, improving patient function and decreasing re-hospitalization
      rates and falls will have large cost saving implications.

      Background: Hospitalized older adults are 59.8 times more likely to develop disability than
      those who are not hospitalized. No studies have examined the effectiveness of Home Health
      (HH) physical therapy on improving function in older adults with multiple co-morbidities
      after hospitalization. Our goal is to enable older adults with multiple chronic conditions to
      recover function by providing adequate content and dose of intervention after
      hospitalization. This intervention is designed to work within the existing Medicare system
      and has potential for immediate clinical impact.

      Purpose: The primary aim of our study is to determine if a progressive multi-component (PMC)
      intervention, initiated upon discharge from an acute care hospital, improves gait speed at
      the end of one 60-day episode of care, more than documented usual care (UC) physical therapy.
      We hypothesize that there will be a greater improvement in gait speed measured for the PMC
      group compared to the UC group following one episode of care. Benefits of PMC will be
      apparent at the end of usual care and will increase further at the end of the 60 day episode
      of care (primary endpoint).

      Design: We propose to conduct a single blind randomized two arm clinical trial (RCT) in older
      adults discharged from acute care and referred to HH physical therapy. Both interventions
      (PMC &amp; UC) will be Medicare-reimbursed. All assessments and interventions will occur in the
      patients' homes.

      Methods: Twenty individuals who are 65 years of age or older with multiple co-morbid
      conditions will be enrolled.

    <description>Patients in this exercise group will receive 10-18, 45-60 minute, physical therapy visits in their home. This group will consist of progressive resistance exercises for the upper and lower extremity with a portable training device, a motor control-based program of gait/balance training, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) training, and mobility training.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Usual Care Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The patients in this group will receive approximately five visits of &quot;usual home care&quot; but the total number of visits will be determined by the therapist as part of usual care. These visits will likely occur at 1-2 times per week for 3-4 weeks. This group will receive intervention as determined by the physical therapist's initial examination. Interventions may include patient education, home exercises, low intensity strengthening exercise, training in gait, balance and transfers; home safety and assistive device assessment.</description>
