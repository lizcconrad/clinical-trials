    <textblock>
      Following medical history and clinical examination the children which are scheduled for
      treatment with suspected pulpary involved primary teeth will be selected. During the regular
      treatment if a pulp of primary teeth is opened and before the regular pulpotomy procedure is
      performed the blood that is flowing out of the pulp will be collected and stored until
      analyzed for the present of inflammatory markers. Clinical and radiographic evaluation will
      be obtained in follow up appointments if the child will remain in regular treatments in our
      clinic.
