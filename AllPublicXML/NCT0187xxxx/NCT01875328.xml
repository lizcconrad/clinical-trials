      This study aims to determine whether patients who have had a stroke caused by a blockage of
      blood flow to the brain can have medical follow up after they leave the hospital in their
      home using a camera connected to a computer, also called telemedicine. Patients who have
      follow-up with telemedicine will be compared with patients following up in the usual way, by
      coming to clinic, and will have the same expectations for medical care and lifestyle changes
      like quitting smoking, exercising, and controlling their cholesterol. The study will try to
      show those stroke patients who live 75 miles or more from Oregon Health &amp; Science University
      (OHSU) and use a computer for follow up: 1) Will be able to complete the recommended visits
      using telemedicine in the home as well as those who come to clinic; 2) Will have blood
      pressures controlled at one year's time as well as those who follow up in the usual way by
      coming into clinic; 3) The patients followed with telemedicine will be as satisfied with the
      type of follow up they had as those followed in the usual way in the clinic. In the future,
      more patients who live at a distance from a major hospital might be able to get quality
      stroke care follow up using telemedicine if the study finds that telemedicine does meet these
      goals.
