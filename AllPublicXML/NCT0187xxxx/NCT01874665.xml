    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ponatinib in participants
      with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) following failure
      of prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, multi-center phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ponatinib in participants with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST after failure of
      prior TKI therapy. Participants whose tumors have an activating mutation in exon 11 of
      cellular KIT (KIT) will be enrolled into Cohort A. Participants whose tumors have other
      activating mutations will be enrolled into in Cohort B.

      The primary objective is to assess clinical benefit in participants with KIT exon 11-mutant
      GIST (Cohort A) defined as clinical benefit rate (CBR), which is the composite of complete
      response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) lasting greater than or equal to
      (&gt;=) 16 weeks per modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1) as a
      measure of disease control. The secondary objective is to assess clinical benefit in
      participants with GIST that lacks an activating KIT exon 11 mutation (Cohort B) and in the
      total participant population. The efficacy assessments are tumor response using RECIST
      Version 1.1, modified for GIST and assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS). The safety assessments include routine physical and laboratory evaluations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), and adverse event (AE) monitoring. Other
      assessments include optional 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET);
      optional pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsy for pharmacodynamic studies; and
      pharmacokinetics (PK). It is estimated that accrual will be complete within 1 year; the total
      estimated duration of the study is 3 years.

               2. Participants in Cohort A must have evidence of activation mutations in exon 11 of
                  KIT in their tumors. Demonstration of an exon 11 mutation may be based on prior

        <title>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) in Cohort B</title>
        <description>To assess clinical benefit rate in participants with GIST that lacks KIT exon 11 mutations (Cohort B) and in the total participant population. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 millimeter [mm]). No new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, PD.</description>
