      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference of the duration of weaning process
      from the ventilator between protocol-driven weaned patients and clinical judgment driven
      weaned patients.

      All patients with prolonged weaning and who required tracheostomy are enrolled in the study.
      These patients are randomized as &quot;Case or Control&quot; by a computer program.

      Patients can start the weaning process when the acute phase of the respiratory failure has
      been resolved and pressure support ventilation was setted.

      For all this patients are calculated modified-BWAP(BWAP-M) and TOBIN indexes. The &quot;Case&quot;
      patients started the weaning protocol process only if BWAP-M value is more than 15 or BWAP-M
      10-15 with Tobin index &lt; 100.

      If not, the BWAP-M and Tobin will be calculated every day. The Control patients will start
      weaning by clinical judgement even if the BWAP-M value is less than 10.

      For all patients are calculated: the duration of weaning process, the ICU length of stay and
      the duration of the mechanical ventilation.

    <description>Reduction of pressure support ventilation (PSV) by 2cmH2O at a time to a maximum of 4cmH2O per day.
When a patient was able to tolerate PSV less than 8 cmH2O for at least 120 minutes, the nurses started to reduce End Expiratory Positive Pressure (PEEP) by 2cmH2O at a time to a maximum of 4cmH2O per day.
When a patient was able to tolerate PSV less than 8 cmH2O with PEEP less than 6 cmH2O, the nurses started SBT trial: Continuos Positive Pressure Airways of 6cmH2O for at least 120 minutes and following discontinuation from ventilator.</description>
