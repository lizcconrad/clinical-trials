      An intervention program targeting patients and caregivers based on education about their
      condition and training in the use of portable coagulomenter to self monitor and training on
      the treatment adjustment to self manage, can be effective to enable patients in OACs to self
      manage as well as to identify determinant factors associated with the success and failure of
      the program.

      BACKGROUND: The skills of patients on oral anticoagulants are critical for achieving good
      outcomes with this treatment. Self-management, or the capacity of patients to control their
      INR (International Normalized Ratio)level and adjust their treatment, is an effective
      strategy of treatment. Capacity of patients to self manage is determined by a range of
      factors. The identification of these factors would improve the design of self management
      programmes and in turn increase the number of patients able to self-manage. The objective of
      our study is to identify those factors that determine the ability of patients on oral
      anticoagulant therapy to achieve self-management of their treatment.

      METHOD: This will be a three year quasi- experimental prospective study with a control group.
      333 patients on anticoagulant therapy from five health centres of the Basque Health Service
      are to be followed up for a period of six months each after the intervention, to assess their
      ability to self-test and self-manage. The intervention will consist of a patient training
      programme involving the provision of information and practical training concerning their
      condition and its treatment, as well as how to use a portable blood coagulation monitoring
      device and adjust their anticoagulant dose.

      DISCUSSION: Training programmes for self-management are effective in terms of enabling
      patients to acquire the necessary skills, though the level of success seems to depend on
      various patient-related factors. Given the proven benefits of self-management, it would be
      useful to properly characterise these factors and use this information to successfully
      increase the percentage of patients on on oral anticoagulants able to self-manage their own
      treatment.

    <description>So the primary objectives of this study are to assess the ability of patients/caregivers to test INR (International Normalized Ratio) levels with a portable coagulometer and capillary whole blood from a finger prick and the impact of a range of factors on the ability of patients on OACs to self-monitor and self-manage their treatment.
If the INR is within the personal range above 80% it will consider a good control</description>
