  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To relate two different predictive values of sleep apnea: the STOP score (snoring while
      sleeping, daytime tiredness, observed breathing stoppages, and high blood pressure) and the
      estimated respiratory disturbance index (eRDI) with the occurrence of apnea-hypopnea during
      propofol sedation,thirty four middle-aged male patients who underwent urologic surgery under
      spinal anaesthesia will be enrolled. Before surgery, patients will be asked to complete a
      STOP-questionnaire. The eRDI will be calculated using the modified Mallampati's grade, tonsil
      grade, and the body mass index. After performing spinal anaesthesia, propofol will be infused
      and adjusted to BIS 70-75. An ApneaLinkTM, which measures airflow through a nasal cannula,
      will be then applied to estimate the level of apnea-hypopnea.

      The investigators will evaluate correlation between STOP scor and AHI(apnea hypopnea index)
      or eRDI and AHI. After then the investigators will compare AHI severity between high risk
      group and low risk group subgrouped according to STOP score or eRDI.

    <description>After surgery, an ApneaLinkTM was connected to a personal computer to record and auto-analyze AHIs. Aopnea was defined as a cessation of airflow for 10s or longer. Hypopnea was defined as a greater than 50% reduction in airflow for 10s or longer. AHI was defined as the number of aopnea and hypopnea incidents per hour.</description>

        We expected a correlation coefficient of ~0.5 in this study, which meant that for a level
        of significance of 5% and a power of 80%, we required 29 analyzable subjects. Based on a
        predicted exclusion rate of 15%, 34 patients were included.
