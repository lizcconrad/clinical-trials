    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>7 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability was assessed by the number of participants with adverse events (AE). An AE was defined as any new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a subject while enrolled in the study, whether or not it was considered drug-related by the investigator. Abnormal laboratory test findings were considered AEs if, in the opinion of the investigator, they represented an abnormal (ie, clinically significant) change from baseline for that individual participant.</description>

    <description>The PANSS consisted of 3 subscales with a total of 30 symptom constructs each rated on a 7-point scale where 1=absence of symptoms to 7=extremely severe symptoms. The Positive Subscale consisted of 7 positive symptom constructs with a possible subscale score of 7 to 49, the Negative Subscale consisted of 7 negative symptom constructs with a possible subscale score of 7 to 49 and the General Psychopathology Subscale consisted of 16 symptom constructs for a possible subscale score of 16 to 112.

    <description>The severity of illness for each participant was rated using the CGI-S scale. The investigator answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; using an 8-point scale where 0=not assessed to 7=among the most extremely ill patients.

    <description>The participant's overall improvement was rated for each participant using the CGI-I scale. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement by answering the following question: &quot;Compared to his/her condition at baseline (prior to randomization), how much has the patient changed?&quot; using an 8-point scale where 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved to 7=very much worse.

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety</title>
        <description>Safety and tolerability was assessed by the number of participants with adverse events (AE). An AE was defined as any new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a subject while enrolled in the study, whether or not it was considered drug-related by the investigator. Abnormal laboratory test findings were considered AEs if, in the opinion of the investigator, they represented an abnormal (ie, clinically significant) change from baseline for that individual participant.</description>

The Positive Subscale consisted of 7 positive symptom constructs with a possible subscale score of 7 to 49, the Negative Subscale consisted of 7 negative symptom constructs with a possible subscale score of 7 to 49 and the General Psychopathology Subscale consisted of 16 symptom constructs for a possible subscale score of 16 to 112. The PANSS Total Score ranged from 30 (best) to 210 (worst; indicating more severe symptoms). A Negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 12 and Week 24</title>
          <description>The PANSS consisted of 3 subscales with a total of 30 symptom constructs each rated on a 7-point scale where 1=absence of symptoms to 7=extremely severe symptoms. The Positive Subscale consisted of 7 positive symptom constructs with a possible subscale score of 7 to 49, the Negative Subscale consisted of 7 negative symptom constructs with a possible subscale score of 7 to 49 and the General Psychopathology Subscale consisted of 16 symptom constructs for a possible subscale score of 16 to 112. The PANSS Total Score ranged from 30 (best) to 210 (worst; indicating more severe symptoms). A Negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>
