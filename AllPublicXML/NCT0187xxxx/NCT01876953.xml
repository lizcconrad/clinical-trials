    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of dasatinib when given together
      with cytarabine and idarubicin hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is likely to come back or spread. Dasatinib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and idarubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving dasatinib together with cytarabine and idarubicin hydrochloride may be a
      better treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Of the dose levels studied, to determine the maximum tolerated dose of dasatinib when
      given in combination with cytarabine and idarubicin for treatment of high risk acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). (Phase I)

      II. To determine the anti-tumor activity of dasatinib when given in combination with
      cytarabine and idarubicin, as assessed by complete remission rate (CR) and remission
      duration. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document CR and survival outcomes (overall, event-free). (Phase I)

      II. To estimate the survival probabilities (overall and event-free) and cumulative incidence
      of relapse/progression. (Phase II)

      III. To describe and summarize all toxicities by organ and severity. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of dasatinib, followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously over 168 hours on days 1-7,
      dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, and idarubicin hydrochloride IV on days
      1-3. Patients with non-responsive disease on day 30 may receive a second course of therapy
      (re-induction therapy) within 1 week in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2
      months for up to 2 years.
