  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the standard treatment for locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer
      consists either of chemotherapy by itself or a combination of chemotherapy plus radiation
      therapy or no treatment at all. Unfortunately, no treatment thus far has been able to provide
      patients with a consistent chance for a cure although there are rare patients who will live
      for many years after treatment. For most patients the chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus
      radiation will maintain or improve quality of life by keeping the cancer under control for a
      period of time.

      Approximately 25-30% of patients with early pancreatic cancer who are able to have the cancer
      completely removed surgically will live beyond 5 years and will be considered cured. This
      tells us that aggressive treatment directed at the tumour in the pancreas can lead to cure.
      For the majority of patients who can not have an operation, giving more radiation as part of
      the treatment may be a strategy that results in better control of the tumour in the pancreas
      which may or may not result in patients living longer.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of adding a higher dose (a &quot;boost&quot; dose) of
      radiation using a radiation unit called CyberKnife when combined with standard chemotherapy
      and radiation for patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      Participants on this study will receive a 'boost' dose of radiation which consists of 3
      treatments over 1 week. The participants will then receive the standard of care treatment of
      chemotherapy and standard radiation therapy over a 5 week period, which will be followed by
      the conventional 20 weeks of chemotherapy alone. The participants will then be followed for
      progression of disease and toxicity related to the boost treatment for up to 5 years.

    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a minimally invasive treatment technique that allows
      for ultra-high doses of radiation to be delivered to small areas with precision not
      previously possible using older equipment. The CyberKnife® Robotic Radiosurgery System
      (Accuray, Sunnyvale California, USA) is a radiation unit specifically designed to focus beams
      of radiation accurately anywhere in the body. It is able to track, detect and correct for any
      tumor movement during treatment by using a sophisticated image guidance system.

    <description>Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a minimally invasive treatment technique that allows for ultra-high doses of radiation to be delivered to small areas with precision. In this study all participants will receive one of 5 dose levels that will be assigned according to Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method (TITE-CRM). Three fractions of various dose levels would be delivered over 5 to 10 days (typically Monday, Wednesday and Friday) with at least 36 hours between two sessions. In case of technical or medical problem, the authorized total treatment time is 12 days.</description>
