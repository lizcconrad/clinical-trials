  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether nocturnal breathing and sleep of patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are disturbed during a stay at moderate
      altitude.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized cross-over trial evaluates the hypothesis that patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease experience nocturnal hypoxemia, periodic breathing and sleep
      disturbances when staying at moderate altitude. Sleep studies and clinical evaluations will
      be performed during 2 days in Zurich (490 m, low altitude baseline) and during 2 days at
      Davos Clavadel (1650 m), and 2 days at Davos Jakobshorn (2590 m).
