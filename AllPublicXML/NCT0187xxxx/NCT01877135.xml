      Evaluation of the 3-years anal carcinoma (AC) incidence in patient with anal AIN3 lesions,
      and factors associated with this AC. A retrospective cohort study will be conducted
      (2000-2013) followed by a prospective cohort study (starting in 2013) with new diagnoses of
      anal AIN3 lesion. The main outcome is histology proven AC. The 3-years incidence rate of AC
      will be calculated. Factors associated with AC will be estimated using a multivariate Cox
      regression model.

      &quot;Background : Incidence of anal carcinoma (AC) is considerably increasing, but no data on
      risk of AC in patient with anal AIN3 lesions are available, nor french recommendations about
      screening and treatment of anal AIN3 lesions.

      Objective : Evaluation of the AC incidence in patient with anal AIN3 lesions, and factors
      associated with this AC.

      Population : Patients with a diagnosis of anal AIN3 lesion will be included and followed for
      3 years. Patients with past history of AC won't be included.

      Study design : Retrospective cohort study will be conducted from 2000 using diagnostic codes
      of anal AIN3 lesion in histo-pathology departments. Then a prospective cohort study will be
      conducted with new diagnoses of anal AIN3 lesion.

      Outcome : The main outcome is histology proven AC. AC identification can be done either by
      using diagnostic codes of AC in histo-pathology departments (for retrospective cases), or
      prospectively.

      Statistics : The incidence rate of AC will be calculated. Factors associated with AC will be
      estimated using a multivariate Cox regression model.

      Number of patients : 1000 Number of centers : 35 Length of follow-up: 3 years at least Length
      of study : 3 years of inclusion and 3 years of follow-up at least&quot;

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in the cohort, patients have to:

        - have an anal AIN3 (including Bowen's disease) diagnosed by histology (screening
        population, post-operative discovery…)

          -  Aposteriori for patients with a history of anal AIN3 complicated or not by an anal
             cancer. These cases will be identified from data bases of anatomopathology
             laboratories in hospitals since January 1st 2000.

          -  At the diagnostic for the new anal AIN3 Units care involved in the study are those
             involved in the follow-up of patients with anal pathologies en France, especially anal
             cancer. Samples are analyzed by the laboratories of anatomopathology of the hospitals
             where the patients are diagnosed. These points make the histological data bases
             reliable and allow clearly identifying cases of anal ain3 retrospectively since 2000.

        Taking in account the number and quality of the units care involved in the study and the
        way cases are identified, we think our recruitment will be exhaustive in France, to limit
        selection bias.

        - Patient's non opposition to study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of anal carcinoma without any history of anal AIN3 lesion

          -  impossible follow-up for the duration of the study (3 years or more)

          -  patient aged under 18
