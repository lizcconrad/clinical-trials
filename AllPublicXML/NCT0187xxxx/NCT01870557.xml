      Objective To collate the bone status in type 1 and type 2 diabetics using biochemical markers
      and bone scans.

      Methods:

      This is a multicenter trial involving the University Hospitals of three major danish cities:
      Aalborg, Aarhus and Odense. The trial is of cross-sectional design and consists of
      examinations including:

        -  Blood samples to analyze bone markers, glycemic state, kidney function and sex-hormones.

        -  24 hour urine sample to analyze bone markers and kidney function.

        -  Bone scans including dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high resolution
           peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) to evaluate Bone Mineral Density,
           t-score and bone structure.

      Participants:

      100 type 1 diabetics and 100 type 2 diabetics recruited from outpatient clinics at Aalborg,
      Aarhus and Odense, general practitioners and flyers.

      Diabetes Mellitus and Osteoporosis are common conditions. Patients with Diabetes Mellitus are
      known to have more fractures than their non-diabetic counterparts. However bone mineral
      density (BMD) which is the most commonly used measure of fracture risk seems to be
      insensitive in diabetes, thus BMD is lowered in type 1 diabetes but not enough to explain an
      almost seven fold in fracture risk. BMD is increased in type 2 diabetes although they still
      have an increased fracture risk.

      The investigators investigate this paradox in diabetes by assessing type 1 and type 2
      diabetes patients bone status by blood- and urine samples (assessing markers of bone- and
      glycemic state) and two types of bone scans comprising of DXA and HRpQCT scan.

      The diabetes mellitus patients are recruited from outpatients clinics in the three study
      sites (Aalborg, Aarhus and Odense) as well as general practitioners and by flyers and adds.

        200 Diabetes Mellitus patients. 100 with type 1 diabetes and 100 with type 2 diabetes. Of
        the 100 type 2 diabetes patients half should be treated with insulin (n=50) and the other
        half treated with other oral antidiabetics and not insulin.
