      The aim of this study is to confirm the Efficacy,the Safety and the Quality of Life after
      TOOKAD® Soluble VTP in localized prostate cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a multicenter, single-arm, open label, 12 months follow-up clinical
      trial. Men with localized prostate cancer will be treated with TOOKAD® Soluble VTP under
      general anesthesia.

      Patients will be followed-up for 12 months with patient questionnaires on QoL, erectile and
      urinary functions, clinical evaluation with study visits at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months , Prostate
      Specific Antigen(PSA) testing at 3, 6 and 12 months. In addition, they will have biopsy at 6
      months (± 2) and 12 months.

    <description>The VTP procedure will consist of a single, 10 minute infusion of 4mg/kg TOOKAD® Soluble. The drug will be activated by laser light at 753nm, with a fixed energy of 200Joules/cm, and a fixed power of 150mWatts/cm, delivered through transperineal interstitial optical fibers. The needles are positioned in the prostate under ultra sound image guidance.</description>
