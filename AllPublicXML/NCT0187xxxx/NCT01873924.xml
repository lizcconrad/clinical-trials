    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the natural history of Batten disease by obtaining information
      about the motor, behavioral, and functional capabilities of individuals with Batten disease
      (Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis). This study will also refine and validate the Unified Batten
      Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS) as a clinical rating instrument for Batten disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Batten Disease is an inherited disorder that causes progressive cognitive and behavioral
      decline in children. There have been no systematic clinical studies of Batten Disease using
      standardized rating instruments with known inter-rater reliability and validity.

      The Batten Study Group developed the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS), a clinical
      rating instrument used to assess the motor, behavioral, and functional capabilities of
      individuals with Batten disease. The UBDRS will be refined and targeted as a clinical tool
      and research instrument. Using the UBDRS, study physicians may evaluate participants every
      year to track disease progression and to determine whether the UBDRS is sensitive to symptom
      changes. Participants will be examined at the University of Rochester Batten Center or at the
      Batten Disease Support and Research Association annual meeting, which is held every summer.

      Study personnel may also conduct neuropsychological testing with participants who have Batten
      Disease in order to enhance our understanding of their cognitive functioning.

      Participants with Batten Disease may also be asked to have an electrocardiogram (ECG)
      obtained. This will provide information about cardiac changes that might occur in children
      with Batten Disease.

      Additionally, parents or legal guardians of participants with Batten disease may be asked to
      complete interviews and questionnaires involving the following topics:

        -  racial and ethnic background, medical history, medications, and symptoms

        -  family history, parent education, and the type of training the child received when his
           or her vision began to decline

        -  previous testing that may have been done to confirm a Batten Disease diagnosis

        -  child's mood and behavior (if child is 5 - 18 years old)

        -  parental beliefs regarding the placement of pacemakers

        -  beliefs regarding procedures and other surgeries for children with Batten disease

        -  opinions regarding supportive care during the various stages of Batten disease

      If genetic testing has not yet been done, blood or cheek cells may be collected to confirm a
      Batten Disease diagnosis. Blood and cheek samples from participants with Batten Disease and
      their parents may also be collected and used in an attempt to better understand the genetic
      changes that cause Batten Disease and influence its severity. Furthermore, female siblings
      may participate by providing a blood sample. These samples will be examined to see how the
      amount of estrogen in the blood of females with Batten Disease compares to the amount of
      estrogen in the blood of their sisters who do not have Batten Disease.

      Participants will be added to a database of children with Batten Disease whose parents have
      consented to be contacted about possible participation in future studies. This registry
      serves as a vehicle for recruitment.
