  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of TAK-063 when
      administered as multiple oral doses at escalating dose levels in participants with stable
      schizophrenia and in healthy Japanese participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-063. TAK-063 is being tested to find a
      well-tolerated dose and also to treat schizophrenia. This study will look at how well
      different doses of TAK-063 are tolerated in healthy people of Japanese descent and in people
      with stable schizophrenia.

      Five dose levels will be examined, starting at the lowest, in each population with 10
      participants in each dose level. These participants will be randomized to receive TAK-063 (8
      subjects) and placebo (2 subjects) once daily (QD) for 7 days.

      In total, approximately 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. This trial will be
      conducted in single site in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study
      is up to 42 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic, including 8-10 days
      confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 7 days after last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.

      Dose escalation and the actual choice of the subsequent dose level will only occur following
      a review of the blinded data from the previous cohorts.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

             medication dose.

          2. Is an adult male or female with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective
             disorder.

          3. Weighs at least 45 kg and has a BMI between 18.0 and 35.0 kg/m^2, inclusive at
             Screening.

          4. Has been receiving a stable dose of antipsychotic monotherapy for at least 1 month
             prior to Screening.

          5. Has not had an acute exacerbation of psychosis or been hospitalization for the

        All Participants:

          1. Has uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other abnormality
             (other than the disease being studied), which may impact the ability of the
             participant to participate or potentially confound the study results.

          2. If female, the participant is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant,
             or intending to donate ova, before, during the course of the study or within 12 weeks

             in the participant's medical history, physical examination, or safety laboratory tests
             giving reasonable suspicion of a disease that would contraindicate taking TAK-063, or
             a similar drug in the same class, or that might interfere with the conduct of the
             study. This includes, but is not limited to, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorders,
             and cardiac arrhythmias.

             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) such as depression,
             anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
             autism spectrum disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or schizophrenia within
             the past 3 years.

          2. Has used nicotine-containing products (including but not limited to cigarettes, pipes,
             cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch or nicotine gum) within 28 days prior to
             Check-in Day -1. Cotinine test is positive at Screening or Check-in (Day -1).

        Participants with Stable Schizophrenia:

          1. Has a history of a primary DSM-IV axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia or
             schizoaffective disorder.

          2. Has not discontinued antipsychotic or other psychotropic medications or is unable to
             discontinue antipsychotic or other psychotropic medications at Day -7 (or five
             half-lives prior to Day -1).

          3. Is taking a concomitant medication for a medical condition at a stable dose or regimen
             for less than two months or is taking a concomitant medication for a medical condition
             for less than two months and for which the discontinuation for the study period is not
             medically permissible.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experience at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) After 7 Days of Dosing</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experience at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) After 7 Days of Dosing</title>
          <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
