      The objective of this study is to investigate the absorption of menaquinone-7 from a
      nutrient-enriched dairy product compared to a general dairy product enriched with
      menaquinone-7 and a menaquinone-7-containing supplement.

      In an earlier study, beneficial effects of a nutrient-enriched dairy product on vitamin
      K-status were observed. The study product contained menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and omega-3 fatty
      acids for vascular health and extra minerals and antioxidants to support general health. It
      was the first time that such low dose of MK-7 (50 µg) could significantly improve vascular
      and general vitamin K-status already after short-term treatment. From the results of this
      study, it was assumed that the matrix of the dairy product and/or other components in the
      product, in which the vitamin was offered, contributed to optimal absorption and availability
      of vitamin K2. In this new study, the uptake and efficacy of MK-7 from the nutrient enriched
      product is investigated and compared to the uptake and efficacy from a MK-7-containing
      supplement and a basic dairy product enriched with MK-7.
