    <measure>Mean Percent of Successful HD Sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>20 HD sessions (up to 4 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>A successful HD session is defined in terms of efficacy of the drug where the HD session had completed as planned: there was no premature termination due to Grade 3 or 4 clotting or saline flush to prevent the loss of the extracorporeal circuit due to clotting; it was not possible to return the participant's blood or assess the exact extent of clotting. HD sessions which terminated prematurely due to Grade 1 or 2 clotting, safety event, machine failure, or access site displacement were excluded from the analysis. The point estimate and 95% CI were computed based on generalized estimating equation (GEE) model for clustered binomial data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percent of HD Sessions With an Acceptable Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>20 HD sessions (up to 4 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>A HD session with an acceptable dose is defined in terms of efficacy of the drug: an HD session for which the dose at the next HD session did not need to be changed due to Grade 3 or 4 clotting, bleeding, access compression time &gt; 10 minutes, or other clinical event. The point estimate and 95% CI were computed based on GEE model for clustered binomial.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in 12 sites in Canada, 10 of which enrolled participants. A total of 152 participants with chronic renal failure, who had at least 30 previous days of hemodialysis (HD) and had received ≤10,000 IU unfractionated heparin or low molectular weight heparin for anticoagulation during the past month were enrolled in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Screening Visit was performed within 9 days preceding first HD session where FRAGMIN was administered. The Final Study Visit took place 5 to 15 days after the final study HD session where the participant was treated with Fragmin (# 20 or the last HD session that was completed, if the partcipant prematurely terminated).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Percent of Successful HD Sessions</title>
        <description>A successful HD session is defined in terms of efficacy of the drug where the HD session had completed as planned: there was no premature termination due to Grade 3 or 4 clotting or saline flush to prevent the loss of the extracorporeal circuit due to clotting; it was not possible to return the participant’s blood or assess the exact extent of clotting. HD sessions which terminated prematurely due to Grade 1 or 2 clotting, safety event, machine failure, or access site displacement were excluded from the analysis. The point estimate and 95% CI were computed based on generalized estimating equation (GEE) model for clustered binomial data.</description>

        <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was used for all efficacy analyses which included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication. There were 2776 HD sessions from 151 participants included in the primary analysis.</population>

        <title>Mean Percent of HD Sessions With an Acceptable Dose</title>
        <description>A HD session with an acceptable dose is defined in terms of efficacy of the drug: an HD session for which the dose at the next HD session did not need to be changed due to Grade 3 or 4 clotting, bleeding, access compression time &gt; 10 minutes, or other clinical event. The point estimate and 95% CI were computed based on GEE model for clustered binomial.</description>
