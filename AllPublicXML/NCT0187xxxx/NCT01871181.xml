  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injection of local anesthetic drugs is an effective way to freeze (block) nerves to achieve
      loss of sensation during surgery and satisfactory pain control afterwards. Many studies have
      shown that nerve block is associated with higher degree of success in controlling pain after
      open inguinal hernia repair. Nerve block can be administered by a single injection with a
      long acting local anesthetic agent using ultrasound guidance. This study is to compare
      different techniques for freezing the nerves responsible for pain after open inguinal hernia
      repair. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups. In the first group, participants
      will receive ultrasound-guided nerve block following induction of general anesthesia but
      prior to surgical procedure. In the second group, participants will receive local anesthetic
      injection directly into the wound by the surgeon prior to closure. The investigators will
      assess the level of pain control for 48 hours after the surgical procedure. Patients will be
      provided with additional medications for pain relief if necessary. The investigators will
      also contact participants to follow-up with regard to possible chronic groin pain after 3
      months following the surgical procedure.

      populations. It is well-known that inguinal hernia surgery can lead to significant degree of
      acute perioperative pain. At the same time, patients undergoing inguinal hernia operation are
      at increased risk to develop chronic neuropathic groin pain. In the literature, several
      approaches to prophylaxis and treatment of perioperative pain have been described including:
      infiltration of local anesthetics by surgeons, ilioinguonal/iliohypogastric nerve blocks,
      neuroaxial blockade, and caudal block in pediatric petients.

      Recent studies have shown that ultrasound guided ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block is
      associated with increased level of safety, improved success rate, and reduction in dose of
      local anesthetic required compared to the &quot;blind&quot; technique.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the role of ultrasound guided
      ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block in prevention of perioperative and persistent
      neuropathic pain following open inguinal hernia repair in comparison with infiltration of
      local anesthetics by surgeons. In the first randomized group of patients we will perform
      ultrasound guided ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block using the same types and amount of
      local anesthetics. In the second group, patients will receive infiltration of the same type
      and amount of local anesthetics by surgeons.
