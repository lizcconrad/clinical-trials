  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to investigate the effects of using physical therapy resources
      in the postoperative morbidly obese individuals undergoing gastroplasty.

      It is believed that the application of these various features of physiotherapy after
      abdominal surgery may contribute differently in restoring lung function and prevention of
      pulmonary complications and can thus identify the resources that can contribute more
      effectively in post-operative bariatric surgery.

      The aim of this study will be to investigate the effects of using physical therapy resources
      in the postoperative morbidly obese individuals undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric by-pass with
      regard to: lung volumes and capacities, prevalence of atelectasis, thoracoabdominal mobility
      and evaluation of peak flow of cough, evaluated pre and post operative.

      Individuals with BMI between 40 and 55 Kg/m², aged between 25 and 55 years, underwent the
      surgical procedure Roux-en-Y type gastric by-pass by laparotomy and normal preoperative
      pulmonary function will be included.

      The volunteers will be divided into seven different groups, according to the treatment
      received during hospitalization after surgery:

      G control: subjects treated with conventional physiotherapy according to the routine service
      of physiotherapy of the hospital; G Voldyne: subjects treated with incentive spirometry,
      Voldyne Model 5000® (Sherwood Medical, USA); G CPAP: subjects treated with &quot;continuous
      positive airway pressure&quot;; G EPAP: subjects treated with &quot;expiratory positive airway
      pressure&quot;; G IPPB: subjects treated with &quot;intermittent positive pressure breathing&quot;; G BIPAP:
      subjects treated with &quot;bi-level positive airway pressure&quot;; G BS: subjects treated with
      &quot;breath stacking&quot; (siliconized mask connected to a unidirectional valve allowing only
      inspiration).

      The application of resources will be held twice a day in the immediate and in the first
      postoperative sessions in 6 sets of 15 reps or 30 continuous minutes, with an interval of 4
      hours between sessions. The researcher will remain alongside the volunteers, following them
      and monitoring vital signs and respiratory comfort.

    <description>Spirometry was carried out according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) (2005). Three types of maneuver were used in order to evaluate the lung volumes and flows: Slow Vital Capacity (SVC), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV). The maneuvers were carried out until three acceptable and reproducible curves were obtained, not exceeding more than eight attempts. The values extracted from each maneuver were selected according to Pereira (2002), and the predicted values calculated using the equation proposed by Pereira et al. (1992) for Brazilians.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of atelectasis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The radiological report on the inspiration radiography, issued by the hospital radiologist, was used to analyze the presence of atelectasis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thoracoabdominal mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of thoracoabdominal mobility was performed by using a tape scaled in centimeters. In the standing position, the measurements were made at levels axillary, xiphoid and abdominal during rest, and at maximal inspiration and maximal expiration. At each level, the measurements were performed three times. It computed the highest value of inspiration and the lowest of expiration. The absolute difference between these values was considered the thoracoabdominal mobility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak cough flow</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The peak flow measured during a cough maneuver will be measured by the equipment Peak Flow ®. For this, the volunteer will be instructed to place the mouthpiece between the lips of the equipment and play a cough with nostrils occluded nose clip. The maneuver should be repeated three times and the best preoperative measures will be compared to the best postoperative measurement.</description>
