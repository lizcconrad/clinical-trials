  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All Danish trainees in surgery in a two-year period asked for participation when enrolled in
      the formal five-year training program for specialty in surgery. The participants are
      randomized for either educational intervention or control (without intervention). The
      intervention group receive a skills-lab course in hernia repair followed by an opportunity to
      perform 20 groin hernia repairs in their departments within 4-8 weeks. Their performance will
      be video recorded three times during the intervention and as follow-up at end of the first
      year of training. After termination of the hernia training program a similar program for
      laparoscopic cholecystectomies are made. Each participant receive both intervention. The
      control group are video recorded at start of their first year and at end. All videos are
      blindly assessed with a validated rating scale of operative performance. The purpose is to
      assess if a fast-track program improves technical skills and if a change is sustained.
      Furthermore we want to compare outcome in similar training programs in open and laparoscopic
      skills.
