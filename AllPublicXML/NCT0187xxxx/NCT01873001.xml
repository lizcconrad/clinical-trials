  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of abiraterone on the pharmacokinetics
      (study of what the body does to a drug) of pioglitazone when coadministered with abiraterone
      acetate in healthy adult male participants.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) single-dose drug-drug
      interaction study to assess the effect of abiraterone on pioglitazone. Approximately 16
      healthy adult male participants will be enrolled in this study. The study consists of a
      screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 2 single-dose treatment periods,
      end-of-study or withdrawal assessments done upon completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic
      sampling on Day 11 of Period 2 or upon withdrawal, and a follow-up visit 5 to 7 days after
      the last study procedure. The total study length is 32 days. Participants will receive
      pioglitazone alone on Day 1 (Period 1) of the study. On Day 8 (Period 2), participants will
      receive a single dose of abiraterone acetate followed by a single dose of pioglitazone one
      hour later. Successive pioglitazone administrations will be separated by a washout period of
      7 days. Participants will be confined to the study center from Day -1 to Day 4 of Period 1
      and from Day 7 to Day 11 of Period 2, at least 10 hours before each study drug administration
      until completion of the 72-hour blood sample collection for each period. A pharmacogenomic
      blood sample will be collected from all participants on Day -1. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
