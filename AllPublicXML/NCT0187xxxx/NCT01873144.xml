  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula
      (HHHFNC) is superior to hypertonic saline solution (HSS) in the treatment of moderate acute
      viral bronchiolitis in infants in improving respiratory distress and comfort and reducing
      length of hospital stay (LOS) and admission to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in mean Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) between groups in every time considered</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4h for three consecutive times beginning in the moment of inclusion in the study and after every 8h for three consecutive times (average of 36h)</time_frame>
    <description>RACS is calculated by combining 2 values: the difference between the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) score before and after treatment, plus a value of +1 for each 10% improvement (decrease) in the posttreatment respiratory rate (RR) or a value of -1 for each 10% worsening (increase) in RR.</description>

    <measure>Difference in mean comfort score along the monitoring period between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8h for 6 consecutive times (two days) beginning in the moment of inclusion in the study</time_frame>
    <description>A scale was used for comfort evaluation . It is based on 4 items: rest, feeding, alertness and facial expression (facial pictures).Minimum 4-Maximum 16</description>
