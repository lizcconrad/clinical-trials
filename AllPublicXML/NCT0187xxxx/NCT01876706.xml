    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate procedure tolerability and surgical recovery
      following the UroLift® system procedure when conducted with local anesthesia in subjects with
      symptomatic benign hyperplasia (BPH). Primary effectiveness will be achieved by looking at
      the Quality of Recovery Visual Analog Scale (QoR VAS) by the one month follow-up visit.

      The randomized portion of the study is a prospective, multicenter, non-blinded, single arm
      trial evaluating procedure tolerability and surgical recovery following the UroLift® system
      procedure when conducted with local anesthesia. All subjects undergo UroLift system treatment
      and will be followed through 5 years after receiving the investigational device.

Over the past month how much physical discomfort did any urinary problems cause you? &amp;
Over the past month, how much did you worry about your health because of any urinary problems? 0 None, 1, 2, 3 A lot.
Overall, how bothersome has any trouble with urination been during the past month? 0 Not at all bothersome,1,2,3 Bothers me a lot.

    <description>The NeoTract UroLift System is a medical device approved for sale in the European Union, Australia, and Canada. The UroLift® System is indicated for the treatment of symptoms due to urinary outflow obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men 50 years of age or older. During the procedure, an implant is delivered into the prostatic lobe obstructing the urethra and restricting urine flow. The distal end of the device is used to compress the lobe then the implant is delivered to retain the lobe in position, thereby increasing the urethral opening and reducing the fluid obstruction through the prostatic urethra.</description>

        <description>BPH Impact Index (BPH II) A validated questionnaire to measure how much urinary problems of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia affect domains of health. BPHII total score is the combined (sum) of scores for Questions 1-4 (sum range of 0-13 scoring is presented below) MAX of 13 would be 3,3,3,and 4: A score of zero = Patient experiences no BPH impact and does not add any to score.
Questions 1-4:
Over the past month how much physical discomfort did any urinary problems cause you? &amp;
Over the past month, how much did you worry about your health because of any urinary problems? 0 None, 1, 2, 3 A lot.
Overall, how bothersome has any trouble with urination been during the past month? 0 Not at all bothersome,1,2,3 Bothers me a lot.

        <title>BPHII Baseline and 12 Month Median Score, 95% CI</title>
        <description>BPH Impact Index (BPH II) A validated questionnaire to measure how much urinary problems of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia affect domains of health. BPHII total score is the combined (sum) of scores for Questions 1-4 (sum range of 0-13 scoring is presented below) MAX of 13 would be 3,3,3,and 4: A score of zero = Patient experiences no BPH impact and does not add any to score.
Questions 1-4:
Over the past month how much physical discomfort did any urinary problems cause you? &amp;
Over the past month, how much did you worry about your health because of any urinary problems? 0 None, 1, 2, 3 A lot.
