  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroenterological disorders are disorders affecting the stomach, intestines and associated
      organs. Symptoms of these types of disorders vary but often include vomiting, diarrhoea,
      weight loss and loss of appetite. Due to the nature and symptomatology of these disorders
      research has suggested that sufferers may be vulnerable to developing disordered eating
      behaviours. Treatment of such disorders often requires dietary restriction which has been
      found to lead to an obsessive preoccupation with food and in some cases to an increase in
      binge eating. Further to this, symptoms of Gastroenterological disorders such as vomiting
      have also been suggested to be linked with disordered eating. At the present there is limited
      research in this area and as such evidence is inconclusive. Particularly little research has
      looked at this area in relation to adolescents, who have been recognised as being at
      increased risk for the development of disordered eating . Gastroenterological disorders are
      likely to affect the typical development of eating habits and therefore it seems plausible
      they may also predispose adolescents to developing abnormal eating behaviours /weight
      concerns.

      The aim of this study is to further investigate the possibility that Gastroenterological
      disorders may be a risk factor for disordered eating in children and adolescents. This study
      will recruit children/ adolescents aged 5-17 and their parents, who are attending Great
      Ormond Street Gastroenterology Clinic and ask them to complete a screening questionnaire. The
      recruitment process will be on going for around 5 months until the study has around 300
      participants. Following this initial questionnaire, participants who are categorised as
      screening positively for disordered eating and a 10% sample of participants that screen
      negatively, will be contacted to complete a further questionnaire interview that will look
      more specifically into this area.
