    <textblock>
      The seizure detection and warning system is an ambulatory system designed to monitor and
      analyze EMG data to detect the onset of GTC seizures and to provide a warning signal to alert
      caregivers that a seizure is occurring.

    <time_frame>less than 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the research is to determine the ability of the Brain Sentinel Seizure Detection System to accurately detect GTC seizures in comparison to the recognized &quot;gold standard&quot; for seizure detection, video Electroencephalography (vEEG).The primary endpoint will be the sensitivity of GTC seizure detection (defined as within 30 seconds of motor manifestation via vEEG analysis) in a hospital setting.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of study device to self reporting of seizures using a seizure diary.</measure>
    <time_frame>Less than 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective is to assess the operation of the Brain Sentinel Seizure Detection System when used in the subject's home and to compare the GTC seizure reporting of the device to a standard seizure diary completed by the subject/caregiver.</description>

             seizures with secondary generalization.

          2. Is being admitted to a hospital for routine vEEG monitoring related to seizures.

          3. Male or female between the ages of 13-21.

          4. If female and of childbearing potential, has a negative pregnancy urine test, and must
             also not be nursing.

          5. Can understand and sign written informed consent, or will have a parent or a legally
             authorized representative (LAR) who can do so, prior to the performance of any study
             assessments.

          6. Subject and/or Primary Caregiver must be competent to follow all study procedures.

          7. Is able to read, speak, and understand English or has a LAR that does so.

          8. Subject/LAR consents to the use of vEEG files, including video/audio recordings, for
             purposes of this research study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has not had a GTC seizure within the last year AND is not expected to have a reduction
             of anti-epileptic drugs during their hospital admission.

          2. Intracranial EEG electrodes are being used.

          3. The subject is allergic to adhesives or any component of the electrode patch assembly
