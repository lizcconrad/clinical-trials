    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of E7777 (improved purity
      ONTAK) in patients with persistent and recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A lead-in
      dose-finding part will be used to determine the dose of E7777 that should be used to test
      efficacy and safety.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of E7777 in participants with recurrent
      or persistent Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL). The study will consist of an initial lead-in
      phase (in which a dose of E7777 will be selected), followed by the Main Study. Participants
      will move through three phases while on study: Pretreatment Phase, Treatment Phase, and
      Extension Phase and a Follow-up Period.
