    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a stay at moderate altitude on
      exercise performance of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate to severe COPD living below 800 m, will be recruited to participate in
      a randomized cross-over field trial evaluating the hypothesis that exercise capacity during a
      4 day sojourn at moderate altitude is reduced in comparison to low altitude. Outcomes will be
      assessed during 2 days in Zurich (490 m, low altitude baseline), 2 days at Davos Clavadel
      (1650 m), and 2 days at Davos Jakobshorn (2590 m). The main outcome is the 6 minute walk
      distance.
