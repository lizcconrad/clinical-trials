    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence suggests that psychological disorders play an important role in the
      development and worsening of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Among the spectrum of psychological
      disorders, there is a wide literature about the association between depression and T2D and
      current data show an approximately two-fold prevalence of depression in adults affected by
      diabetes compared to un-affected subjects. Moreover, depression in diabetic patients is
      associated with higher blood glucose levels, poorer adherence to therapeutic regimens
      (whether pharmacological or therapeutic lifestyle changes), more medical complications, and
      higher hospitalization rates. Nevertheless, at the best of our knowledge, the mechanism
      underlying the association between depression and adverse diabetes-related outcomes is
      currently unresolved.

      Aim of this project is to assess the efficacy of a psychological treatment for diabetic
      patients with suboptimal level of Hemoglobin A1c. This project is a RCT that seeks to address
      the question if type 2 diabetic patients with suboptimal glycaemic control would benefit from
      a specific psychological intervention, as specified below. A total of 80 diabetic patients
      will be recruited and randomly assigned to two treatment arms:

        1. Standard diabetes care

        2. 24 individual sessions of psychological intervention The expected main outcome is the
           improvement of glycaemic control under psychological intervention in 38 weeks of follow
           up.

      Secondary outcomes: reduction of depression and anxiety, improvement in self-efficacy,
      perceived interference caused by diabetes, family support and eating problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have reported higher level of psychological disorders in people with diabetes
      such as depression and anxiety. A recent meta-analysis suggests that the odds of depression
      in the diabetic patients is twice than in nondiabetic subjects and this difference persists
      even after adjustment for sex, type of diabetes or assessment method. Furthermore, depression
      is significantly associated with hyperglycemia. Several proposals exist to explain this
      association.

      The aim of this project is to study the effect of a psychological intervention based on
      cognitive-behavioural strategies in patients with type II diabetes. The effect will be
      evaluate on both physiological and psychosocial parameters. The hypothesis is that a
      psychological intervention based on cognitive behavioural strategies increases patient's
      belief in his self-efficacy to succeed in diabetes care. The improvement in self-efficacy
      will therefore lead to improve the psychological status, i.e. depression.

      Material and Methods: The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A
      sample of 80 type 2 diabetic patients will be recruited at Endocrinology Unit of Verona
      Hospital during routine medical examination and then randomly assigned to intervention or
      control arm. In details, patients will be first recruited for participation in the study by
      their physician. Thereafter, patients will be approached by psychologist who will explain
      research and its goals. Control group will receive current standard of diabetes care.
      Intervention group will receive a weekly psychological intervention based on cognitive
      behavioural strategies. Each session will be based on self-monitoring, problem solving and
      goal setting. The first session will be held two weeks after the enrollment and the last one
      will take place at twenty-sixth week. Subjects will be given a food and physical activity
      diary as well as a pedometer. Study participants will weekly fill in the diary starting from
      2nd session until the 19th session for a total of 18 weeks. Subjects will carry the pedometer
      for the same time window.

      The psychological intervention comprises three phases:

      PHASE 1 (1°-2° session):

        -  Psychological testing

        -  Therapeutic alliance formation

        -  Goal definition

      PHASE 2 (3°-19°)

        -  Food and physical activity self-monitoring

        -  Identifying unhealthy behaviours and helping subject to change them

        -  Identifying negative beliefs and replace them with positive and healthy ones

        -  Providing coping strategies to stress and emotions

      PHASE 3 (20°-24°)

        -  Reinforcing behaviour modification

        -  Identifying possible barriers

        -  Activation of personal and social resources

      Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline (pre-treatment), after 26 weeks treatment
      (post-treatment) and at 38 weeks follow up (follow-up).

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory II is a 21-item questionnaire developed to assess the intensity of depression as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). The BDI-II items include (1) cognitive symptoms such as sadness and pessimism, (2) affective symptoms such as loss of pleasure and loss of interest, (3) somatic symptoms such as loss of energy, appetite changes and changes in sleep pattern.
The BDI-II is calculated by summing the ratings for the 21 items. The 4-point scale ranges from 0 to 3 for each item. The maximum total score is 63.
The measurement of outcome variables will be conducted 38 weeks after termination of the treatment (38 weeks follow up). The difference of the BDI-II scores among baseline (pretreatment), at the end of the 26 weeks treatment (post-treatment), and at 38 weeks follow up (follow-up) will be also calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks (post-treatment)-38 weeks (FU)]</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire (MDQ) was designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of diabetes-related cognitive and social factors. It includes 41 items subcategorized in three sections. The first section assesses the general perceptions of diabetes and related social support. It is comprised of three scales. These scales targets:
perceived interference caused by diabetes to daily activities, work and social activities (9 items);
perceived severity of diabetes ( 3 items);
perceived diabetes-related social support from a significant other such as family, friends and health professionals (4 items).
Responses were rated on 7-point rating scales (from 0 to 6), with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived interference, social support and severity.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline family support at 26th and 38th weeks (MDQ section II score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks (post-treatment)-38 weeks (FU)]</time_frame>
    <description>This section of the MDQ measures social incentives in relation to self-care activities. The scales included in this section were designed to measure the frequency of positive reinforcing behaviour (8 items) and the frequency of non supportive behaviours (4 items). Subjects recorded their responses on 7-point Likert scales (from 0 to 6) with higher scores indicating higher levels of positive and negative reinforcement behaviours.</description>
