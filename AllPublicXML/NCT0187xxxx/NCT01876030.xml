    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the gait pattern of following the utilization of a
      functional electrical stimulation device will be much improved when compared to the effect of
      regular gait re-education with ankle-foot-orthosis (AFO) fitting in patients in early stages
      following stroke.

    <description>Surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes will be attached to 6 muscles for evaluation of dynamic muscle activation pattern during gait without the intervention. Specifically, we will monitor the medial gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior, bilaterally.</description>

    <description>Selective motor control during dorsiflexion will be tested with and without flexed knee according to the classification of three levels: normal, impaired, and unable. This test will be utilized for matching of the test group and control group. Physical evaluation will be conducted to assess the muscle tonus of the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and quadriceps according to Ashwart scale. Passive joint range of motion will also be assessed.
Functional evaluation of each subject will be accomplished using the 10-meter walk. The Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) will also be applied in order to obtain a patient prognosis level with regard to ambulation.
Time up and Go (TUG) test will be performed in the in gait laboratory so that the performance of the subjects during the trials can be videotaped.</description>

When the subjects achieves the ability to walk with supervision, but with no physical assistance, safely and consistently during the physiotherapy sessions, then either the FES will be provided to the subject to allow ongoing gait practice with the nursing staff in the ward environment. After discharge, the assistive device will be provided for home usage till the end of the research.</description>
