      Background:

      - An ongoing study is looking at American Indians who have kidney problems caused by type 2
      diabetes. Kidney disease due to type 2 diabetes is a major problem in American Indians. We
      previously found that early treatment of kidney disease with losartan was probably beneficial
      for reducing progression of the disease. Researchers now want to see if these benefits
      continue to be seen several years after the end of the treatment study.

      Objectives:

      - To study long-term benefit of losartan treatment for diabetic kidney disease in American
      Indians with type 2 diabetes.

      Eligibility:

      - Participants in the American Indian diabetic kidney disease study (OH95-DK-N037).

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history before starting the study.
           Blood and urine samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will have a set of tests as part of this study. Those who have severe
           kidney problems, such as kidney failure, will only have a basic kidney exam with scans.
           The remaining participants will have a full urine collection and analysis. They will
           also provide a kidney biopsy.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      The purpose of this protocol is to examine the long-term impact of treatment with the
      angiotensin receptor blocker losartan on progression of diabetic kidney disease in American
      Indians with type 2 diabetes. Data from this protocol will also be used to guide the search
      for candidate biomarkers of diabetic end-organ damage in serum and urine and to identify
      mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease that may be amenable to new treatment strategies. All
      participants previously enrolled in a 6-year randomized clinical trial under Protocol
      OH95-DK-N037 and their first-degree relatives who have type 2 diabetes will be invited to
      participate. Participants in this protocol will undergo annual renal clearance studies to
      measure glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, unless they have developed kidney
      failure. At each visit, we will also conduct tests of the peripheral and autonomic nervous
      system to determine the frequency, severity, and rate of progression of diabetic neuropathy
      in this cohort and identify linkages between diabetic kidney disease and diabetic neuropathy.
      We will also perform a kidney biopsy at the initial visit. In those who had a previous
      research kidney biopsy during the clinical trial, we will examine the extent of structural
      changes that occurred since their last kidney biopsy done at the end of the clinical trial.
      First-degree relatives and those who were enrolled in the clinical trial, but did not undergo
      a research kidney biopsy as part of that trial, will be invited to undergo a second kidney
      biopsy after 5-years of follow-up. Tissue from these biopsies will undergo morphometric
      examination and compartment-specific gene expression and epigenetic profiling. A small punch
      skin biopsy may be obtained at various times in some participants for assessment of
      intraepidermal nerve fiber density or for fibroblast culture. The skin biopsy for fibroblast
      culture will be done only once unless the culture fails, in which case the participant may be
      invited to undergo another biopsy. We may invite participants to undergo skin biopsy on
      several occasions for assessment of changes in nerve fiber density. We may also perform
      magnetic resonance imaging of the kidneys or the brain in some participants. Imaging of the
      kidneys will be done as near to the time of the kidney biopsy as possible. We many invite
      participants to undergo the brain imaging on 2 occasions about 3-5 years apart. Participants
      will be followed annually until death or development of end-stage renal disease.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible for participation in the study, subjects must meet the following criteria:

          -  Previous enrollment in protocol OH95-DK-N037 or a first-degree relative of an enrollee
             who is aged greater than or equal to 18 years and has type 2 diabetes.

          -  Willingness, after receiving a thorough explanation of the study, to participate.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded for the following reasons:

          -  Clinically significant disorders of the liver [cirrhosis, portal hypertension,
             hepatitis, increased bilirubin (greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl), cardiovascular
             disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt;40%, congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association Class I to IV),
             cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary diseases (asthma and
             restrictive or obstructive lung disease requiring therapy), renal-urinary disorders
             (calculi, urinary tract obstruction, glomerulonephritis, chronic infection),
             gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or anorexia sufficient to cause
             weight loss or wasting), or hematocrit levels less than or equal to 30 percent in
             women or less than or equal to 35 percent in men.

          -  Renovascular or malignant hypertension; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood
             pressure greater than or equal to 160 or diastolic greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg)
             despite treatment with three antihypertensive drugs; or hypertension that is being
             treated with antihypertensive medicines and the primary care physician or the patient
             refuses to adopt the blood pressure treatment regimen outlined in the study protocol.

          -  Hematuria of unknown etiology. Prior to entry into the study, any subject with
             hematuria should be evaluated, the etiology established and documented, and treatment
             rendered as appropriate.

          -  Chronic debilitating disorders with or without treatment (e.g., systemic lupus
             erythematosus (SLE), cancer, amyloidosis, and chronic infection) that would interfere
             with the assessment of kidney function. Participants who develop these disorders after
             their original enrollment into one of our kidney studies will continue to be followed
             in the protocol.

          -  Currently receiving a drug regimen that includes: steroids, immunosuppressants, or
             investigational new drugs. Participants who receive these drugs following original
             enrollment into one of our kidney studies will continue to be followed in the
             protocol, unless they have known chronic significant effects on kidney morphology or a
             high incidence of adverse effects on kidney function, in which case they will be
             withdrawn from the study.

          -  Pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior
             to entry and prior to each renal clearance study. Women who are pregnant will be
             offered the opportunity to participate following the conclusion of the pregnancy and
             those who become pregnant during the study will be able to resume the study following
             the conclusion of the pregnancy.

          -  Hypersensitivity to iodine.

          -  Bleeding disorders, since kidney biopsies could not be performed safely in these
             individuals.

          -  Massive obesity with body mass index greater than or equal to 45 kg/m(2). Kidney
             biopsies are more difficult and present greater hazards to persons with massive
             obesity.

          -  Conditions likely to interfere with informed consent or compliance with the protocol.
