  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the experience of discharge of adult medical surgical
      patients through improved discharge preparation communication between patients and care team
      members, with subsequent improvement in the post-discharge experience. Obtaining multiple
      perspectives on discharge readiness creates the opportunity for patient and care team to
      partner in identifying deficiencies in discharge readiness that warrant anticipatory,
      compensatory, or corrective interventions prior to discharge, with the goal of averting
      post-discharge problems and utilization. The results will also inform development and
      translation of tools for assessment of discharge readiness to clinical care environments.

      Specific Aims are to:

        1. Describe patterns of communication about discharge and collaboration among members of
           the health care team

        2. Conduct psychometric testing of 3 forms of the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale
           (RHDS - MD, RN, Patient)

        3. Describe relationships between care team communication, patient perceptions of quality
           of discharge preparation and perceived readiness for discharge, care team (RN and MD)
           assessments of discharge readiness, and post-discharge outcome ( post-discharge coping
           difficulty, Emergency Department (ED) use, and 30 day readmission.

        4. Determine the impact of an intervention with the inpatient care team to improve
           discharge preparation communication.

      H1: Patient perceptions of discharge readiness, post-discharge coping difficulty, ED use and
      readmission will improve following a care team educational intervention about discharge
      preparation, compared to pre-intervention baseline measures.

      H2: Care team members will report improved frequency and amount of discharge preparation
      communication following a care team educational intervention about discharge preparation,
      compared to pre-intervention baseline measures.

      H3: RN-MD collaboration will increase following a care team educational intervention about
      discharge preparation, compared to pre-intervention baseline measures
