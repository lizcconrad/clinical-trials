      The purpose of this study is determine the interaction of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL, BIA
      2-093) on the steadystate pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in patients and to evaluate the
      tolerability and safety of ESL administered concomitantly with phenytoin in patients.

      This study was planned as a single-dose, open label phase (Phase A) followed by a
      multiple-dose, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover phase (Phase
      B) study in patients taking phenytoin. Phase B consisted of two 14-day treatment periods
      separated by a washout period of 10 to 15 days. Subjects continued their usual phenytoin
      scheme and received a single dose of ESL 1200 mg (Phase A) and either ESL (600 mg from Day 1
      to 7 and 1200 mg from Day 8 to 14) or matching placebo once-daily for 14 days in each period.

      The study was prematurely terminated due to impossibility of recruiting the planned number of
      patients. Only 4 patients were admitted and this was considered a too small sample size to
      allow a reliable assessment of the potential interaction between ESL and phenytoin.
      Therefore, no pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed.
