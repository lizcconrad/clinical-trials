  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Articular cartilage can be the seat of many diseases including osteoarthritis and traumatic
      defaults. The cartilage has no intrinsic ability to repair resulting at long term in function
      loss in the joints. Currently available treatments are not satisfactory in the long term, the
      use of mesenchymal stem cells appears to be promising due to their ability to multipotency
      and immunomodulation properties. This project aims to determine the most appropriate source
      for regenerative medicine of cartilage stem cells from tissue taken during arthroplasty in
      patients with osteoarthritis. These cells will be tested for different chondrogenic markers.
      The success of this project will consider the implementation of a strategy for regenerative
      medicine in bone and joint diseases.

    <measure>Increased expression of chondrogenic markers</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Increased expression of chondrogenic markers will be Evaluated by different techniques:
in vitro: Histology fit for chondrogenic markers, RT-PCR on the following markers aggrecan, type II collagen, Sox9, Comp, type IX collagen
in vivo: In a second step, differentiated MSCs are implanted in vivo after combination with a hydrogel subcutaneously in nude mice. The formation of a neo cartilage tissue will be assessed by histology for type II collagen and aggrecan</description>

    <measure>Increasing secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules in vitro</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Increasing secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules in vitro will be tested by several techniques:
Microfluidic cards (TLDA assays) for the analysis of the expression of genes involved in inflammation and in the secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules Inhibition of proliferation of autologous T cells activated or not Assay for anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory molecules Analysis of the expression of surface markers by flow cytometry</description>
