  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcers are deep wounds that occur as a result of nerve damage in the feet
      (peripheral neuropathy). Amputation is a common consequence of diabetic foot ulcers;
      approximately 85% of all diabetes-related amputations are caused by foot ulcers. The ulcer
      treatment is extensive, resource demanding and highly specialized and necessitates
      involvement of patient, hospital and local in-home care personnel.

      The 3D photo optic camera project aims at a much more efficient and precise method for
      diagnosis and treatment of foot ulcers. The Department of Endocrinology and the section for
      LEAN and Innovation at Odense University Hospital has developed a prototype for a 3D camera
      that takes pictures and measurements of the ulcer that can provide the basis for correct
      diagnosis and treatment of the ulcer. The camera was developed in close cooperation with
      TECCLUSTER A/S, Svendborg Municipality, Team Online and ComMed.
