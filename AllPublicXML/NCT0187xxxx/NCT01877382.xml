    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label study of DS-3032b to assess its safety and tolerability,
      identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/tentative recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and assess
      its pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) properties in subjects with advanced solid
      tumors or lymphomas.

      Approximately 5 US sites are planned for Part 1 (Dose Escalation). Approximately 10 US sites
      are planned for Part 2 (Dose Expansion).

        creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN.

        and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) =&lt; 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Subject should be able to provide written informed consent, comply with protocol
             visits and procedures, be able to take oral medication, and not have any active
             infection or comorbidity that would interfere with therapy.

          -  Subject (male and female) of childbearing/reproductive potential must agree to use
             double-barrier contraceptive measures or avoid intercourse during the study and for 90

          -  Subject must be fully informed about their illness and the investigational nature of
             the study protocol (including foreseeable risks and possible side effects) and must
             sign and date an IRB [Institutional Review Board]-approved Informed consent Form [ICF]
             (including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization, if
             applicable) before performance of any study specific procedures or tests.

          -  Is willing to provide and there is confirmed availability of pre-existing diagnostic
             or resected tumor samples, such as paraffin-embedded sections. Providing fresh tumor
             biopsy is optional for subjects in Dose Escalation cohorts.

          -  Is willing to undergo tumor genotyping for TP53 mutation, insertion, or deletion at
             screening. Confirmation of TP53 nonmutant status is encouraged, but not required prior

             Subjects with treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require
             no treatment with steroids may be included in the study if they have recovered from
             the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy. A minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed between
             the end of whole brain radiotherapy and study enrollment (2 weeks for stereotactic

             treatment. Previous and concurrent use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of
             gonadotropin releasing hormone modulators for prostate cancer, and the use of
             somatostatin analogs for neuroendocrine tumors are permitted if such therapy has not
             been changed within 8 weeks before study drug treatment.

          -  Had therapeutic radiation therapy or major surgery within 4 weeks before study drug
             treatment or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks before study drug treatment.

          -  Participated in a therapeutic clinical study within 3 weeks before study drug
             treatment, or current participation in other therapeutic investigational procedures.

          -  Prolongation of corrected QT interval by Fridericia's method (QTcF) at rest, where the
             mean QTcF interval is &gt; 450 milliseconds (ms) for males and &gt; 470 ms for females based
             on triplicate ECG.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Substance abuse or medical, psychological, or social conditions that, in the opinion

          -  Prior treatment with an MDM2 inhibitor.
