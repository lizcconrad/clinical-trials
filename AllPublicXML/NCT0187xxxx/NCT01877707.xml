  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To identify whether home monitoring of multiple physiological parameters and biomarkers in
      sputum could provide advanced warning of an infective exacerbation or treatment failure
      before changes in patient-reported symptoms.

      1. To determine if longitudinal profiling of sputum from Cystic Fibrosis patients allow
           accurate prediction of exacerbations in a study of a larger group and can we confirm the
           7+ day early warning system works in this larger group.

        2. Is one biomarker sufficient to predict exacerbations - what is the accuracy? Are two or
           more biomarkers required to achieve an accuracy of greater than 95%?

        3. Can we now accurately determine how many hospital bed days a home testing/wellness
           monitoring device would save? What is the business case for healthcare providers to
           adopt our future test for home use? We estimate a 50% saving. Can this be confirmed?

        4. When used in the clinic, how many hospital days would our test save through faster
           determination of treatment efficacy? What is the business case for adopting our future
           test as a point of care test on the ward in Cystic Fibrosis centres? Could this be the
           new revolutionary tool that we anticipate?

        5. We forecast a 50% reduction in costs to treat Cystic Fibrosis patients in disease
           severity bands 2-A to 5. Can we provide evidence for this to support further investment?
