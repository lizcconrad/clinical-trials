  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-patients with coronary heart disease or hypertension will fill out a depression screening
      questionnaire while waiting in a cardiac clinic. Using a randomised-controlled study design
      half of the patients will receive a patient-targeted written screening feedback. This
      feedback contains information about depression in general, depression-severity adapted
      treatment guidelines and contact-information for treatment. Patients in the control group
      receive no direct screening-feedback but their cardiologist will be informed about the
      screening result. All patients with a positive screening-result will be contacted after one
      month and six months and asked for symptoms of depression, and their use of health care. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of this minimal intervention on the course of
      depressive symptom in patients with known coronary heart disease or hypertension.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a minimal intervention on the course
      of depressive symptoms in patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD) or hypertension.
      By means of a depression screening and individual patient-targeted feedback the level of
      depression should decrease, the percentage of treated depressed patients should increase and
      health economic costs should be lowered. The main hypothesis is that screening plus targeted
      feedback results in a greater reduction of depression than screening only.
