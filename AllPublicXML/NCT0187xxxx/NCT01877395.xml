      The aim of the study is to document the safety and immunogenicity of Purified Vero Rabies
      Vaccine (VRVg) when given in a simulated post-exposure regimen, i.e. with co-administration
      of human rabies immunoglobulins (Imovax® Rabies).

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is non-inferior to Imovax® Rabies in terms of proportion of
           subjects achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5 international
           units (IU)/mL at Day 14.

        -  To demonstrate that the observed proportion of subjects achieving an RVNA titer ≥ 0.5
           IU/mL at Day 14 is at least 99%, with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI)
           of at least 97%.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the clinical safety of each vaccine after each vaccine injection when
           administered in a simulated post-exposure schedule.

        -  To describe the geometric mean titer ratio (GMTR) between the 2 vaccine groups at Day
           14.

      All participants will receive five vaccine injections, i.e. one at Day 0, at Day 3, at Day 7,
      at Day 14 and at Day 28, respectively, (Essen regimen). In addition, human rabies
      immunoglobulins (HRIG) will be concomitantly administered to all subjects on Day 0.

      Safety will be assessed in all participants up to 28 days after vaccination, as applicable,
      in terms of occurrence of adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse
      events of special interest (AESIs) up to 6 months post-vaccination 5.
