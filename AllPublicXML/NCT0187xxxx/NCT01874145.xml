    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, parallel-arm study to assess the safety and
      tolerability of a daily dose of Glatiramer Acetate (GA) 40 mg/mL three times a week (TIW)
      administered subcutaneously (SC) as compared to GA 20 mg/mL every day (QD) administered SC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise of a Core study and an Extension phase. During the Core study,
      subjects will be evaluated at study sites for 5 scheduled visits at Months: -1 (Screening), 0
      (Baseline), 1, 2, and 4 (Termination/Early Termination). Subjects who complete all scheduled
      visits will have final procedures and assessments performed at the final visit (Month 4,
      Termination visit). Subjects who withdraw from the study before completing the 4 months
      evaluation period will have Early Termination (ET) procedures and assessments performed at
      their final visit.

      During the Extension phase, all subjects will be offered to continue treatment with GA 40
      mg/mL TIW. Subjects will be evaluated every 4 months until this dose strength is commercially
      available for the treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients or
      until the development of this GA dose regimen is stopped by the Sponsor, the last visit of
      this phase will be called Termination/ET-Extension visit.

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Estimates for Injection-Related Adverse Event Rate Per Year in the Core Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Injection-related (IR) adverse events refers to all local injection site reactions and/or symptoms or events related to immediate post injection reaction (flushing, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, dyspnea, throat constriction, and/or urticaria). Rate was calculated as # IR events/the total exposure to study drug in years.
For cases in which more than 1 IR adverse event started on the same date for the same patient, these were counted as 1 IR adverse event for that patient.
Parameter statistics were generated from a Poisson regression model with natural log of treatment duration (years) as an offset variable, and adjusted for baseline EDSS score, treatment group, age, sex, number of relapses in the 2 years prior to screening, in which a contrast comparing treatment groups were constructed. Adjusted mean estimates were adjusted estimates of event rates within treatment group.</description>

    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) is a psychometric measure of a patient's satisfaction with medication. It consists of 3 subscales: effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction. The scores were computed by adding items for each domain, i.e. 1 to 3 for effectiveness, 4 - 6 for convenience and 7 to 9 for global satisfaction. This outcome focuses on convenience items 4-6, with each question graded on a scale of 1 (extreme dissatisfaction) to 7 (extreme satisfaction). TSQM-9 participant perception of convenience score was calculated as: ([sum (Item 4 to Item 6) - 3] divided by 18) * 100. The full range was -100 to 100, with positive change from baseline indicating improvement.

          <title>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</title>
          <description>The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis. The EDSS quantifies disability in eight Functional Systems (FS):
pyramidal
cerebellar
brainstem
sensory
bowel and bladder
visual
cerebral
other
The scale is from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (Death due to MS). A grade of 2.5 refers to a mild disability in one functional system or minimal disability in two functional systems.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Estimates for Injection-Related Adverse Event Rate Per Year in the Core Period</title>
        <description>Injection-related (IR) adverse events refers to all local injection site reactions and/or symptoms or events related to immediate post injection reaction (flushing, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, dyspnea, throat constriction, and/or urticaria). Rate was calculated as # IR events/the total exposure to study drug in years.
For cases in which more than 1 IR adverse event started on the same date for the same patient, these were counted as 1 IR adverse event for that patient.
Parameter statistics were generated from a Poisson regression model with natural log of treatment duration (years) as an offset variable, and adjusted for baseline EDSS score, treatment group, age, sex, number of relapses in the 2 years prior to screening, in which a contrast comparing treatment groups were constructed. Adjusted mean estimates were adjusted estimates of event rates within treatment group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 in in the Adjusted Mean Participant-Reported Impact on Psychological Wellbeing Using Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29 PRO) in the Core Period</title>
        <description>The psychological wellbeing assessment portion of the MSIS-29 is comprised of 9 questions in which participants rate the impact of MS on their day-to-day life during the past two weeks from 1=no impact to 5=extreme impact for a total score of 9-45. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in psychological wellbeing over time.
The estimated change from baseline to month 4 adjusted for months 1 and 2 was generated using a mixed model repeated measures analysis adjusted for baseline MSIS-29 psychological score, treatment group, month, treatment by month interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 in in the Adjusted Mean Participant-Reported Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) Convenience Score in the Core Period</title>
        <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) is a psychometric measure of a patient's satisfaction with medication. It consists of 3 subscales: effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction. The scores were computed by adding items for each domain, i.e. 1 to 3 for effectiveness, 4 - 6 for convenience and 7 to 9 for global satisfaction. This outcome focuses on convenience items 4-6, with each question graded on a scale of 1 (extreme dissatisfaction) to 7 (extreme satisfaction). TSQM-9 participant perception of convenience score was calculated as: ([sum (Item 4 to Item 6) – 3] divided by 18) * 100. The full range was -100 to 100, with positive change from baseline indicating improvement.
The estimated change from baseline to month 4 adjusted for months 1 and 2 was generated using a mixed model repeated measures analysis adjusted for baseline TSQM convenience score, treatment group, month, treatment by month interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Start of Extension Period (Month 4) to Month 8 (and to Endpoint Visit) in the Participant-Reported Impact on Psychological Wellbeing Using Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29 PRO)</title>
        <description>The psychological wellbeing assessment portion of the MSIS-29 is comprised of 9 questions in which participants rate the impact of MS on their day-to-day life during the past two weeks from 1=no impact to 5=extreme impact for a total score of 9-45. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in psychological wellbeing.
The Extension Period endpoint visit was defined as the last observed post-baseline data of the Extension Period.</description>

        <title>Change From Start of Extension Period to Month 8 (and to Endpoint Visit) in in the Participant-Reported Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) Convenience Score</title>
        <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) is a psychometric measure of a patient's satisfaction with medication. It consists of 3 subscales: effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction. The scores were computed by adding items for each domain, i.e. 1 to 3 for effectiveness, 4 - 6 for convenience and 7 to 9 for global satisfaction. This outcome focuses on convenience items 4-6, with each question graded on a scale of 1 (extreme dissatisfaction) to 7 (extreme satisfaction). TSQM-9 participant perception of convenience score was calculated as: ([sum (Item 4 to Item 6) – 3] divided by 18) * 100. The full range was -100 to 100, with positive change from baseline indicating improvement.
