  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of blood pressure control into guideline recommended ranges</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) have cited the JNC-7 in their guidelines to define normal blood pressure as &lt; 120/80. We will use these guidelines and examine rates (percentage of subjects) of blood pressure control in intervention vs. usual care group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of subjects who have discontinued one or more of the blood pressure medications on their own (i.e. without medical direction) in the intervention vs. usual care group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of online tool</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ease of online health management tool use will be operationalized as the percent of subjects in the intervention group who measure their BP and enter it online at least 75% of the study period, 50% of the study period and those with 25% or less of the study period.</description>
