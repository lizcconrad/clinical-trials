  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To generate real world evidence to compare clinical outcomes and patient health-related
      quality of life, resulting from catheter ablation therapy with clinical outcome and patient
      health-related quality of life resulting from drug therapy in China. An economic model will
      be constructed, and using the clinical events evidence collected in this study, and China
      long-term disease progression and local disease cost data to perform a cost-effectiveness
      evaluation of Catheter Ablation versus Drug Therapy in AF (Paroxysmal plus Persistent AF)
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evidence generated by this study is expected to help inform medical decision makers with
      the clinical and economic data of therapy for AF patients, and also provide policy decision
      makers with information that can be considered /used to allocate funds for AF ablation and
      permit patients to have access to appropriate treatment options for AF management.
