  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an uncontrolled, open-label, parallel group clinical trial. Approximately 10
      subjects per dose group in 3 groups will be treated twice weekly for a total of 9 doses,
      followed by a 4-week observation period. Eligible subjects who have Hgb ≥10.5 g/dL and have
      stable Hgb levels will start the washout period of one to eight weeks. During the washout
      period, 30 subjects whose Hgb are &lt; 10.0 will complete the baseline assessment to confirm
      their eligibility. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 cohorts in a
      1:1:1 ratio. Subjects will be admitted on the day of the first dose and stay in the clinic
      overnight for pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling after the first (day 1) and the last dose (day
      29). FMX-8 will be administered as 30 min i.v. infusion. After the 29-day treatment period,
      the trial subjects will be observed for an additional 28 days to allow safety and
      immunogenicity assessments.
