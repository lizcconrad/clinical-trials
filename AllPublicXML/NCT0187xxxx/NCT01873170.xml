  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to understand if using birth control causes changes in the immune
      cells within the reproductive tract (including the cervix and the lining of the uterus) of
      healthy women. Immune cells are important because they help prevent infections from starting
      and help fight infections that have started. Immune cells are also the type of cells that HIV
      (human immunodeficiency virus) infects so understanding more about them will help to better
      understand how to prevent the spread of HIV.

      Immune cells will be studied from the reproductive tract of women who want to start using one
      of the following contraceptives: an oral contraceptive pill (COC), Depo-Provera (DMPA), the
      levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena®), the copper IUD (ParaGard®), or the etonogestrel subdermal
      implant (Nexplanon®).Immune cells will also be studied from the reproductive tract of women
      who are not using birth control and who are not at risk of pregnancy for comparison.
