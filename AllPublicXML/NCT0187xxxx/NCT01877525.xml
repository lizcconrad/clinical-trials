    <textblock>
      Resect and discard (RD) is a new paradigm for management of diminutive colorectal polyps
      wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps are then resected and
      discarded rather than sent for histopathological review. The aims of this study were to
      compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and the standard of care where polyps are
      sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting of academic and community
      gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an RD program for
      management of diminutive polyps.

      Introduction: Diminutive (≤5 mm) colorectal polyps are prevalent in the screening population
      but have low risk for harboring advanced villous or dysplastic components and for developing
      into colorectal cancer. &quot;Resect and discard&quot; (RD) is a new paradigm for management of these
      diminutive polyps wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps are
      then resected and discarded rather than sent for histopathological review.

      Aim: The aim of this study were to compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and
      the standard of care where polyps are sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting of
      academic and community gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an
      RD program for management of diminutive polyps.

      Methods: This is a prospective, observational study conducted in a single outpatient
      endoscopy center over 12 months. Screening and surveillance colonoscopies were performed by
      four academic and two community gastroenterologists. All diminutive polyps (defined as ≤5 mm)
      were endoscopically imaged and histology predictions (adenoma vs. non-adenomatous polyp) were
      made using high-definition white light (HDWL) with/without narrow band imaging (NBI) at the
      discretion of the endoscopist. Diagnostic performance and accordance of recommended
      surveillance intervals from endoscopic imaging were compared to histopathological review of
      the polyps.
