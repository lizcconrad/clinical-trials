    <textblock>
      Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk for thrombosis. Thrombosis is more frequent in
      myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) than the normal population. In this study, we
      investigated the thrombosis incidence, the effects of plasma homocysteine levels on
      thrombosis, and the correlations between folate, cobalamin, pyridoxine and homocysteine
      levels in MPNs, and to compare these results with the healthy controls.

      Thirty-one new or formerly diagnosed MPN patients who consecutively visitted our outpatient
