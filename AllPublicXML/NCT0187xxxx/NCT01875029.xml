  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back School (BS) is a behavioural intervention designed to treat and prevent chronic low back
      pain. Up to date clinical research studies have shown that transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) is able to decrease the intensity and duration of pain modulating the
      activity of brain areas involved in the circuits that regulate pain and facilitating the
      mechanisms inhibitors descendants of pain control.

      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of combining tDCS with a behavioural
      intervention (i.e. BS) in subjects with chronic low back pain.

      Chronic low back pain involves high individual and social costs. Back School (BS) is a
      behavioural intervention designed to treat and prevent the aforementioned condition. Up to
      date clinical research studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      can be considered a reliable tool for chronic pain. It has been shown how tDCS is able to
      decrease the intensity and duration of pain modulating the activity of brain areas involved
      in the circuits that regulate pain, such as the thalamus, and facilitating the mechanisms
      inhibitors descendants of pain control. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of
      combining tDCS with a behavioural intervention (i.e. BS) in subjects with chronic low back
      pain. Specifically, we will test their effects on low back pain intensity and participation
      of patients' in daily activities.

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group will receive sham-tDCS for 5 days before back school beginning. The anode will be placed on the primary motor cortex (M1) of the dominant hemisphere and the cathode on the contralateral supraorbital area. The direct current is transmitted through a pair of sponge electrodes, with a surface of 35 cm2 (7x5), soaked in saline solution and, it is generated by a constant current stimulator, with rechargeable batteries. This continuous stimulation lasted 30 seconds, with an intensity of 1 milliampere.
The back school session, a behavioural intervention,will be given 10 times for 4 weeks.</description>
