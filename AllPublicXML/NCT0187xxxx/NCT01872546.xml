      The expertise in the characterization of transcriptomics profile in lesional psoriatic skin
      and on the availability of innovative therapy for these patients.The investigators propose to
      follow the modification of the skin transcriptomics profile in psoriatic patients during
      successful Adalimumab biotherapy. Skin transcriptomics profiles of normal skin, psoriatic non
      lesional skin, and psoriatic lesional skin before and after biotherapy will be compared. The
      investigators will focus on the modification of the cytokine &quot;signature&quot; in these skin
      lesions and of some markers of keratinocyte inflammation. The modification of the
      transcriptomics profile induced by the biotherapy will be correlated to the clinical response
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index.
