  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with memory disorders are experiencing different trends which are difficult to
      predict. Moreover, the distinction between Lewy body disease and Alzheimer's disease is not
      easy as both diseases can present similar symptoms. Nowadays, routine examinations exist and
      can improve the diagnosis but there are not specific enough of one of those two pathologies.

      Lewy body disease is characterized by the presence of particular structures in patient's
      brain, called &quot;Lewy body&quot;, composed of a protein called &quot;alpha-synuclein&quot;. The aim of this
      study is to measure the rate of alpha-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid. This measurement
      could allow us to differentiate patient with Alzheimer's disease from those with Lewy body
      disease.
