      An open-label, dose-escalation trial of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      biological, and clinical activity of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered to patients with CD20
      (B-lymphocyte antigen CD20) positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that have failed standard
      rituximab-containing therapy. Following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab (if
      needed) each patient will receive DI-Leu16-IL2 administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection
      for three consecutive days every three weeks.

      An open-label, dose-escalation trial of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      biological, and clinical activity of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered to patients with CD20
      (B-lymphocyte antigen CD20) positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that have failed standard
      rituximab-containing therapy. Following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab (if
      needed) each patient will receive DI-Leu16-IL2 administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection
      for three consecutive days every three weeks (21 day cycle). Three to six (3-6) patients will
      be enrolled in each cohort. Patients may receive 6 cycles of DI-Leu16-IL2 approximately
      thrice weekly for 3 weeks for a total of 18 doses.

      Approximately 66 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 6 investigational
      centers in the U.S. Forty-two (42) patients will be enrolled during dose escalation (Phase 1)
      and 2 expansion cohorts of 12 patients each (Phase 2).

      Following completion of the Phase I portion of the trial and review of the safety, response
      and correlative immune data it has been elected to have 2 expansion cohorts of 12 patients
      each at 2 mg/m2.

        -  Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) that is relapsed or refractory to standard therapy

        -  All other CD20-expressing B-cell NHL that is relapsed or refractory to standard therapy.
           As mentioned above Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)
           with peripheral blood leukemia/lymphoma cells and high-grade lymphomas (i.e.
           Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Burkitt's Lymphoma) are excluded

      At the end of the study, patients may be enrolled into an open-label extension study (Study
      AO-101-EXT), at the discretion of the investigator.

      Study Primary Endpoints

        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered SC following
           peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell NHL.

        2. To investigate the optimal biologic dose (OBD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 following peripheral
           blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell NHL, which may differ from
           the MTD.

        3. To describe the toxicities associated with the proposed DI-Leu16-IL2 regimen.

      Study Secondary Endpoints

        1. To evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by the induction of DI-Leu16-IL2-specific
           antibodies.

        2. To evaluate the PK of DI-Leu16-IL2 (achieved in the primary portion of the study).

        3. To measure the response rate at the MTD (and/or OBD) associated with the proposed
           therapy and survival endpoints of the enrolled patients.
