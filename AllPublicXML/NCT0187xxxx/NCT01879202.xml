  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) that is characterized by physical
      and/or mental exhaustion. Fatigue is difficult to treat and treatment efficacy of available
      therapy is limited. The goal of this study is to determine whether MS-associated fatigue
      improves after 6 weeks of methylphenidate therapy. Treatment efficacy will be measured by a
      questionnaire called &quot;Fatigue Severity Scale&quot; (FSS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management oft fatigue comprises nonpharmacologic approaches like exercise, cooling
      procedures, nutrition, and energy conservation programmes. These strategies should be
      considered as first-line options since they add to overall wellbeing, have no side effects
      and increase the patient's autonomy. However, in most cases these strategies will not suffice
      to keep the patient symptom free on the long term. Also, patients with overwhelming and
      severe fatigue will be unlikely to engage in exercise. In these cases adding pharmacologic
      therapy will be the next step. Until now, Amantadine, Modafinil, and Pemoline have been used
      among others, with some success. Also antidepressants like buprione, fluoxetine, and
      venlafaxine have been used although they have never been systematically studied for the
      management of MS-related fatigue. However, if a mood disorder is present, it is appropriate
      to treat it before pursuing pharmacologic therapy of fatigue. Nevertheless, the response rate
      of all pharmacologic therapies of MS-related fatigue is not totally convincing making
      alternative pharmacologic therapies furthermore desirable. Methylphenidate is an antagonist
      of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters on the presynaptic neuronal cell membrane.
      Reduced reuptake results in an increase in extracellular levels of both neurotransmitters.
      Until now, methylphenidate has been successfully used to treat fatigue in HIV and parkinson´s
      disease, data on its efficacy in MS are not available. The aim of this study is to determine
      the efficacy of methylphenidate treatment in MS-associated fatigue. The treatment phase will
      be 6 weeks and treatment efficacy will be measured by validated questionnaires (Fatigue
      Severity Scale FSS, modified Fatigue Impact Scale MFIS) and by a neuropsychological test
      (Test for Attentional Performance).

    <measure>Change of Fatigue as measured by Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline versus follow-up at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue severity scale is one of the most commonly used self questionnaires to measure fatigue. The FSS questionnaire contains nine statements that rate the severity of fatigue symptoms. A low value (e.g., 1); indicates strong disagreement with the statement, whereas a high value (e.g., 7); indicates strong agreement. A total score of 36 or more suggests presence of fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Fatigue as measured by Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline versus follow up at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument provides an assessment of the effects of fatigue in terms of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. The full-length MFIS consists of 21 items. The MFIS is a structured, self-report questionnaire that the patient can generally complete with little or no intervention from an interviewer. The total score for the MFIS is the sum of the scores for the 21 items. Individual subscale scores for physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning can also be generated by calculating the sum of specific sets of items. All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a patient's activities</description>

    <measure>Change of Quality of life as assessed by Hamburger Lebensqualitätsfragebogen (HAQUAMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline versus follow up at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HAQUAMS is a reliable, valid and appropriate instrument for QoL assessment in multiple sclerosis. Participants' quality of life will be measured with the German version of the &quot;Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis (HAQUAMS).&quot; This validated questionnaire assesses disease specific quality of life with five subscales: communication, mood, upper limb mobility, lower limb,mobility, and fatigue. Subscale and total scores range from one to five, high scores indicating low quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue as measured by TAP (Test for Attentional Performance)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Test for Attentional Performance (TAP) is a computerised assessment of the dimensions of attention. Two subtests are administered:
Alertness In this test, reaction time is examined under two conditions. The first condition concerns simple reaction time measurements, in which a cross appears on the monitor at randomly varying intervals and to which the subject should respond as quickly as possible by pressing a key. In a second condition, reaction time is measured in response to a critical stimulus preceded by a cue stimulus presented as warning tone (&quot;phasic arousal&quot;, or temporal orientation of attentional focus).
Divided attention In this test, a visual and an auditory task must be processed in parallel. Two forms of this test may be administered. This requires the ability for divided attention to simultaneously ongoing processes.</description>

    <measure>Quality of sleep as measured by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale: The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. It provides a measure of a person's general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life. It has become the world standard method for making this assessment. The ESS asks people to rate, on a 4-point scale, their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in 8 different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily lives, although not necessarily every day. It does not ask people how often they doze off in each situation. The total ESS score is the sum of 8 item-scores and can range between 0 and 24.The higher the score, the higher the person's level of daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Quality of sleep as measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration,habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The client self rates 19 items, each of these seven areas of sleep . Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. The seven component score are then added to a global score ranging from 0-21 with 0 indicating no difficulty and 21 indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>
