  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deep heat therapies are increasingly frequent in daily physical therapist for the
      treatment of musculoskeletal diseases. The use of such procedures is justified by their
      analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiespasmolíticos and hiperemiantes. However, studies on the
      cardiovascular effects of these therapies are still incipient. Therefore, this study has as
      objectives: map the skin temperature changes in the lower limbs in different areas and
      positions after applying shortwave diathermy and microwave; assess hemodynamic and autonomic
      cardiovascular parameters, and investigate the occurrence of changes in conduction velocity
      superficial blood resulting from the application of these thermal features. The study will be
      conducted on 40 female volunteers between 18 and 30 years, university, healthy, that fit the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. The analysis by infrared thermography will be
      held in a room with temperature maintained at 23 ± 1°C and humidity average 50%. The
      volunteers will stay in prone position, with the legs bare, resting for 20 min to stabilize
      skin temperature with temperature of the room. After this period will be held applying
      diathermy of shortwave or microwave for 20 minutes at moderate heat on the lower limb regions
      of the hamstrings and triceps surae in extension and flexion to 180° to 90°. The records beat
      to beat blood pressure and heart rate to autonomic and cardiovascular hemodynamic evaluation
      will be performed by means of equipment Finometer (Finapress Medical Systems, Inc.) and
      electrocardiogram (ADInstruments, Inc.), respectively, before and after application of
      diathermy. On the other hand, the images will be processed using FLIR ThermoScan and blood
      flow data will be collected through the Doppler ultrasound. The results will be processed and
      analyzed using descriptive statistics, submitted to a linear regression model with mixed
      effects (random effects and fixed), with p≤0.05.

    <description>The skin temperature data will be acquired by a digital infrared thermographer at a distance of 1,5 m litter. 3 thermographic images will be collected over the application of diathermy at times 0, 10 and 20 min. For this, after the initial 10 min, the electrodes will be quickly removed from contact with the skin surface, so it can also be observed at room temperature under the electrode. Completed the 20 min of application will be also evaluated the temperature effect on residual time 10 and 20 min after application, where the individual remained at rest in the same position.</description>

    <description>Data from the femoral artery blood flow will be collected through the Doppler Portable Ultrasound wave continues. Data will be collected after 20 minutes of acclimatization, immediately after application of shortwave diathermy and immediately after the 20 minutes of time resudual application.</description>
