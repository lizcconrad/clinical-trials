  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced injury is known to be associated with immediate and
      long-term kidney dysfunction after renal transplantation. Protecting the kidney against I/R
      injury and maintaining renal function during renal transplant surgery is therefore very
      important in order to improve post-operative outcome. This purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether propofol anesthesia done in both kidney donors and recipients during
      deceased brain dead donor kidney transplantation is effective in reducing renal I/R injury
      via its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and improve post-transplant outcome
      compared to desflurane anesthesia.
