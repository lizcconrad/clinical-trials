  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to ascertain the effect of food on pharmacokinetics of WCK 2349 and
      determine the absolute bioavailability of WCK 2349 1000 mg (oral, QD dose) with respect to
      WCK 771 800 mg (intravenous, QD dose).

      This study would ascertain/confirm the therapeutically equivalent oral and IV doses of WCK
      2349 and WCK 771 respectively, and provide guidance in case of switch over therapy (WCK 771,
      IV to WCK 2349, oral) in future clinical trials in patients.

      All the subjects will be checked-in into the clinical study facility on Day -1, the day prior
      to dosing. The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive WCK 2349 1000 mg as an oral dose
      in fed or fasting state (1:1) in the food effect study as per the randomization schedule. The
      subjects completing the food effect study (i.e., Period 1 and Period 2) will be administered
      WCK 771 800 mg as an intravenous infusion in fasting state in Period 3 of the study. There
      will be a washout period of three days between each period. The subjects will continue to
      remain in the clinical facility for the entire duration of the study (completion of three
      periods in the study), including wash out period. Prior to check out procedure, detailed
      clinical examination will be done to confirm that subject has no safety issues.

    <description>To compare the pharmacokinetics of WCK 2349 following oral administration of 1000 mg of WCK 2349 (QD, one day) in healthy, adult, human subjects in fed and fasting state To determine the absolute bioavailability of WCK 2349 following oral administration of 1000 mg of WCK 2349 (QD, one day) with respect to intravenous administration of 800 mg of WCK 771 (QD, one day) in healthy adult human subjects in fasting state.Absolute bioavailability (F) of oral WCK 2349 as compared to intravenous WCK 771 following single dose administration in healthy subjects in fasting state will be calculated as follows: F =AUC i.v /AUC oral *Dose of oral/Dose of IV Summary statistics will be provided for the safety data.</description>
