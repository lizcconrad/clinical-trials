      The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and plasma concentration changes of
      quetiapine after multiple oral administration of FK949E (extended-release formulation of
      quetiapine) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

      This is a dose-titration study. In low-dose-group, patients receive prescribed dose on Day 5
      after 3-step dose increases. In high-dose-group patients receive prescribed dose on Day 7
      after 4-step dose increases. Patients receive prescribed dose of FK949E for 7 days in each
      group. The dosage period is 12 days in low dose group and 14 days in high dose group.
