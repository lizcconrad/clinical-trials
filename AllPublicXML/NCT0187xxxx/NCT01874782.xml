  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) can suffer from an excessive and
      prolonged fall in blood pressure when assuming an upright position, such as transitioning
      from lying to sitting or standing, a condition also known as orthostatic hypotension (OH).
      Due to a decrease in cerebral oxygenation, affected individuals can develop debilitating
      symptoms including lightheadedness, blurred vision, fatigue and even loss of consciousness.
      Recent evidence suggests that OH has a negative impact on cognition in individuals with SCI.
      Clinical observations suggest that OH can lead to neurological deterioration in individuals
      who may otherwise have a stable SCI. The presence of symptomatic OH prevented participation
      in 43% of physical therapy treatment sessions in a study of individuals with acute SCI
      despite the use of current treatment options. OH is known to adversely affect health, delay
      rehabilitation and prolong hospitalization in the acute phase of management of individuals
      who display it. Our team found OH was present in 41 of 55 (75%) patients with acute cervical
      SCI at our center in 2004.

      We plan to research the efficacy of a low-cost, non-invasive device known as transcranial
      electrical stimulation (TES) to manage OH in individuals with acute cervical SCI. Previous
      studies have shown that this device is safe to use in individuals with SCI, and has improved
      blood pressure control in non-SCI individuals.

      We hypothesize that in individuals with acute cervical SCI and OH, TES intervention will
      elicit an attenuation of the drop in systolic BP (SBP)in response to orthostatic stress.
      TES-induced differences will be most pronounced in those individuals with sparing of spinal
      autonomic pathways

    <description>In brief, the subject will receive six sessions of thirty minutes duration of transcranial electrical stimulation. Immediately after the last session, the subject will be monitored via finger BP cuff in the supine position for 10 minutes resting BP. Next the subject will be transferred to the sit-up position with continuous BP recording. The decline in BP at three minutes (orthostatic decrease) following assumption of the sit-up posture will be documented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  medically stable individuals with acute traumatic cervical SCI with OH;

          -  age 18-65 years;

          -  able to give informed consent.

        OH will be defined as per the American Academy of Neurology Consensus as a decrease in
        systolic BP ≥ 20 mmHg, or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mmHg when assuming an upright position on the
        sit-up test, whether or not symptoms occur.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  individuals with: any clinically important or unstable medical or psychiatric
             disorders;

          -  history of seizures;

          -  neuropsychiatric comorbidity;

          -  acute conditions that could exacerbate cardiovascular control, ie: untreated urinary
             tract or chest infections, open wounds, etc;

          -  alterations in head computed tomography or head MRI;

          -  any cognitive dysfunction or language barrier that would prevent subjects from
             following English instructions.

          -  Use of short acting medications for OH (ie: midodrine) will not be a contra-indication
             as they will be withheld prior to testing, however having continuous administration of
             vasopressors will be an exclusion criteria.
