  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of an intradialytic exercise program on
      functional capacity, aerobic capacity, strength, quality of life, depression,
      hospitalizations and intradialytic episodes of hypotension. The investigators would also like
      to look at the impact of exercise training over twelve weeks on hemoglobin levels as well as
      the clearance of potassium, phosphate and urea. Our hypothesis is that the above mentioned
      outcomes will positively improve over the twelve week intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional capacity is measured by the DASI score which gives an estimated V02 peak in ml/min/kg. The difference between the mean score at baseline and 12 weeks will be determined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aerobic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Aerobic capacity is measured as a function of the DASI score</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Strength is determined as bilateral hand grip strength (measured in kg) as well as by the 30 second sit to stand test(the number of repetitions achieved in 30 seconds). These measures are obtained at baseline and again at 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The KDQOL- SF36 will be used to measure the quality of life at baseline and again at 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number and rate of hospitalizations will be determined prior to exercise start and during the 12 week exercise program. Length of stay is also tracked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypotension</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intradialytic hypotension, defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 20 mmHg for patients with pre-dialysis blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg or a drop in SBP of 10 mmHg for patients with pre-dialysis blood pressure &lt; = 90 mmHg. IDH with patient symptoms and nursing interventions will be obtained as well.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemoglobin levels</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline hemoglobin and hemoglobin at 12 weeks will be tracked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Potassium levels</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline potassium and potassium at 12 weeks as well as the K gradient (pre -dialysis - dialysate K level)will be monitored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urea removal</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline and 12 week pre and post dialysis urea levels will be monitored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phosphate levels</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline and 12 week pre-dialysis phosphate levels will be tracked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bioimpedance derived volume and body mass determinations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In a small subset of patients (n=10) the bioimpedance derived fluid compartments (ECF, ICF, E:I ratio) and fat free body mass will be determined at both baseline and 12 weeks.</description>
