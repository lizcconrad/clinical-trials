      Hypothesis:

      In France, approximately 12,000 new rectal cancers are diagnosed each year. Frequency is one
      and a half times higher in men than in women. The average age of diagnosis is 65. Unlike
      colon cancer, technical management remains challenging with unresolved operating
      difficulties. Morbidity of surgical procedures remains high with a very large number of
      preventive or curative stoma derivations.

      Reference in surgical treatment is total excision of the rectum and its mesentery, followed
      by continuity restoration by immediate coloanal anastomosis (ACAI). In this procedure, rate
      of fistula that results is reported in the literature between 15 and 25%.

      An alternative to ACAI is delayed coloanal anastomosis without reservoir (ACAD). Based on
      retrospective experiences, we form the hypothesis that ACAD offers a much lower rate of
      fistula (&lt;5%) and allows diminution of preventive stoma derivation practice. Morbidity and
      mortality are reduced, and patient's quality of life greatly improved. Direct costs
      (consumables intraoperative, hospitalization, stoma complications) and indirect
      (pocket-fitting stoma) are greatly reduced.

      This study is a multicentre, two arms, phase 2 clinical trial.

    <measure>Main objective is to evaluate effectiveness of delayed coloanal anastomosis (ACAD) in the medium and lower rectal cancer treatment,</measure>
    <time_frame>Delayed coloanal anastomosis effectiveness will be evaluated in terms of symptomatic anastomotic fistula occurring during the 30 days post anastomosis and requiring stoma derivation</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was the effectiveness of the ACAD surgery evaluated in terms of absence of fistula requiring stoma diversion. We wish to highlight that the rate of patients with a fistula requiring stoma diversion is less than 15%, that is to say that the effectiveness of the ACAD rate is higher than 85%. Based on a one-sided binomial test with the null and alternative hypotheses respectively 85% 95% 53 ACAD eligible and evaluable patients will be required (one-sided type I error of 5% and 80% power). If 49 or more patients (out of 53) have no fistula requiring stoma diversion, then we conclude that the ACAD is effective. To anticipate any non evaluable patients, we plan to recruit 58 patients ACAD.</description>

The digestive functions, especially anal incontinence, will be evaluated according to the scale of 5 items Jorge and Wexner.
The quality of life will be assessed by self-administered questionnaire of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 colorectal module.
An economic study will be conducted. Economic impact (hospitalization, rehospitalization) will be evaluated from the data Program Medicalisation Information Systems (PMSI). We evaluate the use of consumables during the procedure, the equipment pockets of colorectal or temporary or permanent ileostomy (loss of sphincter fistula) to the eventual restoration of intestinal continuity.</description>

    <description>Delayed coloanal anastomosis ACAD Whatever the mode of continuity restoration used, resection is the same in the two groups. It consists of total excision of the rectum and its mesorectum, that intervention should be performed by laparotomy or laparoscopy.
After surgical resection, the colon is exteriorized through the anus and attached to the buttock.
By day 6, exteriorized colon is resected and coloanal anastomosis is performed without preventive stoma derivation</description>
