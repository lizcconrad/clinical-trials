    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of a single treatment of
      hMaxi-K compared to placebo (PBS-20% sucrose) administered by direct bladder wall injections.
      Two dose levels (16000 µg and 24000 µg -20 or 30 bladder wall injections, respectively) in
      females with moderate OAB/DO of ≥ six months duration will be evaluated. In each dose level,
      6 participants will receive hMaxi-K and 3 will receive placebo. .

      In addition secondary efficacy parameters will be evaluated (change from baseline compared to
      placebo), including number of micturitions per day, volume of micturitions, incontinence
      episodes, pad weight, uninhibited contractions during cystoscopy, and quality of life
      assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 double blind, placebo controlled study assessing safety and activity of 2
      escalating doses of hMaxi-K gene transfer by direct injection into the bladder wall in female
      subjects with OAB (Overactive Bladder Syndrome and Detrusor Overactivity).

      There will be a total of 9 visits and a 1 and 3 day post dosing telephone contact with the
      patient to evaluate for any new complaints. Following screening visits(V1 and V1A) and study
      drug administration at week 0, eligible participants will be evaluated for safety post dosing
      with study drug at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24.

      At Screening, Baseline (prior to dosing) and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks post dosing
      participants will have a complete physical exam including urogenital examination. ECG will be
      performed at Screening, at Baseline, at one week post dosing and at the final visit.

      At Screening, Baseline (prior to dosing) and 1, 2, 4, 12 and 24 weeks post dosing, laboratory
      evaluations including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be performed. Urine cultures
      will be done throughout the study (including prior to catheterization and at discharge) to
      insure the absence of infection.

      Participants will be assessed for study drug effects on incontinence at Baseline (prior to
      dosing) and at weeks 4 and 24 post dosing by cystometry. At Screening (V1) and at 2, 8 and 24
      weeks post dosing participants will have a bladder scan to evaluate for residual volume.

      Subjects will complete a daily diary at home for 7 days prior to the baseline (V2). Diaries
      will capture number of micturitions, volume of micturitions, number of urge incontinence
      episodes, and rating of episode, and the number of pads used every 24 hours. The participants
      will continue to complete this daily diary during the course of the trial and the diary will
      be evaluated at each follow-up visit.

      The participants will evaluate their perception of their bladder condition, QoL using Kings
      Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and SF-12. International Consultation on Incontinence
      Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) will be completed throughout the study.
