  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will treat participants with newly diagnosed, low, intermediate and high risk
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) using multi-modality risk-adapted therapy with standard or intensified
      dose chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection. Intermediate and high risk participants
      will receive an additional 12 weeks (4 cycles) of maintenance therapy with anti-angiogenic
      chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Estimate event-free survival for intermediate risk participants treated with
           vincristine, dactinomycin and cyclophosphamide with the addition of maintenance
           anti-angiogenic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the false negative rate and incidence of additional positive lymph nodes in
           participants undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by limited nodal dissection.

        -  Maintain a high local control rate in participants treated with surgery and/or limited
           volume proton and photon radiation without dose escalation.

        -  Define the incidence and type of failure in participants who receive risk-adapted local
           therapy relative to the primary tumor volume.

        -  Establish the feasibility of delivering 4 cycles of maintenance anti-angiogenic
           chemotherapy in intermediate and high risk patients following standard chemotherapy.

        -  Estimate the event free survival for high risk patients receiving interval dose
           compressed therapy and maintenance anti-angiogenic therapy.

        -  Define the incidence of CTC grade 3 and higher toxicities (and specific grade 1-2
           toxicities) related to proton beam therapy.

      Participants will be stratified based on both a pretreatment staging system and a
      post-surgery surgico/pathologic clinical grouping system. Treatment for low-risk (subset 1)
      participants will consist of chemotherapy and radiation. Low-risk (subset 2) and
      intermediate-risk participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation and/or undergo surgery
      to destroy/remove the tumor. Intermediate-risk participants will also receive 16 weeks of
      maintenance chemotherapy. High-risk participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy. High-risk participants will also receive additional maintenance therapy with
      anti-angiogenic chemotherapy.
