  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a within group, randomised, repeated dose, placebo- and octreotide controlled study
      in a target population of 45 healthy male subjects. Subjects were required to attend the
      clinical for screening procedures between 3 and 28 days before dosing commenced. The study
      was conducted in 4 groups of subjects; Groups 1 to 3 were a double-blinded, randomised
      design, each consisting of 12 subjects. Group 4 was an open-label design and consisted of 9
      subjects. There was a minimum interval of 96 h between dosing of Groups 1, 2 and 3 to allow
      for interim analyses of PK and safety/tolerability data for dose escalation purposes. Group 4
      (the active control group) was still to proceed if the decision was taken to prematurely stop
      dosing with ITF2984 (somatostatin analogue) following review of the PK and safety data
      presented at the interim decision meeting; dosing of this group was conducted independently
      from Groups 1 to 3. On Days 1 to 6, subjects in Groups 1 to 3 were to receive 2 doses of
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) approximately 12 h apart; subjects in Group 4 were to
      receive 3 doses of IMP approximately 8 h apart. For all groups, subjects were scheduled to
      receive their final dose of IMP on the morning of Day 7.

      In addition, subjects were to receive exogenous test administrations(stimulation test) on Day
      -1, Day 1 and Day 7 at the same time on each day (ie for Day -1, 23.5 h before the first dose
      of IMP, and for Days 1 and 7, 0.5 h after the first dose of IMP on the respective day). Blood
      samples for PD and PK analyses were taken at specified time points after each dosing.

      Subjects remained on site for 10 days (ie 36 h after the final dose of IMP on Day 7)
      providing that discharge conditions had been met, and returned to the clinic between 5 and 10
      days after the last IMP administration for a follow-up visit.
