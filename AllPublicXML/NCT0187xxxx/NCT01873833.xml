    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, lapatinib ditosylate,
      and trastuzumab work in treating patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine
      and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving capecitabine and cyclophosphamide
      daily may kill more tumor cells. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab,
      can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of the tumor to grow and
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.
      Giving capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, lapatinib ditosylate, and trastuzumab together may be
      an effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR).

      II. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR; complete response, partial response, and
      stable disease for &gt;= 24 weeks).

      III. To estimate the overall survival (OS).

      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) once daily (QD), cyclophosphamide PO QD, and
      lapatinib ditosylate PO QD on days 1-21 and trastuzumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
