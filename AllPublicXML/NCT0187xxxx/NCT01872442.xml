  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferon alpha was a therapy used in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic phase prior to the
      advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Synergistic effect of the combination of Peg-IFNα2a
      with Imatinib was demonstrated in the clinical SPIRIT trial. In this study, the investigators
      address the question of the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in combination with low dose of
      Peg-IFNα-2b as frontline therapy for patients with newly diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
      in Chronic phase.

    <description>Molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5) is defined by either a positive BCR-ABL/ABL ratio ≤ 0.0032 on the international scale or by undetectable BCR-ABL with the analysis of at least 32000 copies of ABL (according to the ELN recommendations by N. Cross et al., leukemia 2012).
