  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0994 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors. Patients will be enrolled in one of two stages: a dose-escalation stage (Stage I) or
      the subsequent expansion stage (Stage II). Stage I will evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of GDC-0994 administered daily. Stage II will gather
      additional data on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the recommended dose of
      GDC-0994 determined in Stage I.
