  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementing disorder of later life, is a major cause
      of disability and death in the elderly. Although a number of theoretical causes exist, the
      etiology of AD is still unknown. Consequently, the focus of treatments has been palliative,
      designed to ameliorate AD symptoms. Recent efforts, however, have revealed some surprising
      data suggesting that cholinesterase inhibitors (AchEIs), used over the last decade, and
      recently released memantine (an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist), may confer
      protection to neurons. Thus, they may offer a slowing of cognitive decline and/or improvement
      in behavioral symptoms associated with memory impairment.

      Over the last decade, it has been well documented that mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      increases the risk of conversion to AD and that coincident depression and MCI (Dep-MCI)
      further increases the risk 2 to 3 fold. The primary focus of this line of investigation is to
      treat the very high risk to dement patient population with Dep-MCI, before they develop AD,
      in the hopes of delaying AD onset.

      Memantine had not been studied in DEP-MCI patients. Since treatment of these patients with
      combined antidepressant and AChEIs has been associated with cognitive improvement in pilot
      studies, we explore whether treatment of DEP-MCI with memantine in addition to antidepressant
      treatment would benefit cognitive performance and lead to a low rate of conversion to
      dementia. We evaluate the cognitive and antidepressant benefit of combined open-label
      es-citalopram and memantine treatment over 48 weeks in a DEP-CI sample.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in a sample of 35 elderly (50-90 years old) outpatients who meet study
      inclusion criteria for depression (DEP) (DSM-IV criteria for major depression, dysthymic
      disorder, or depression NOS) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; e.g. operationally defined
      as between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;dementia&quot;), i.e., Dep-MCI. The research plan includes: i) Obtaining
      a baseline psychiatric and neuropsychological test profile, ii) If currently on an
      ineffective antidepressant, having a one week washout (3 weeks for fluoxetine), iii) A
      treatment trial beginning with a two-week es-citalopram lead-in period. At two weeks,
      memantine (Namenda) is added starting at 5 mg/day and increased until the maximum dose of 20
      mg/day is reached by six weeks. The study psychiatrist administers: the 24-item Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D); the Clinical Global Impression (CGI, 1-7 scale) initial
      severity and subsequent change ratings separately for depression, cognition, and overall
      clinical status; the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) for somatic side effects. A
      trained technician administers the neuropsychological battery at baseline, 12, 24 and 48
      weeks. If the patient is an antidepressant non-responder during the first 12-weeks, the
      es-citalopram is changed to an alternative antidepressant, as clinically indicated by the
      treating psychiatrist. The patient remains on the memantine for the entire 48-weeks,
      irrespective of antidepressant response.

      This will tell us about the efficacy and tolerability of es-citalopram+memantine on both
      cognitive and depressive symptoms in Dep-MCI patients and will potentially have broader
      public health implications because Dep-MCI is a wide-spread clinical problem where management
      needs to be improved.

    <measure>Change in Selective Reminding Test - Total Immediate Recall (SRT-IR)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Selective Reminding Test-Total Immediate Recall (SRT-IR) scores from baseline to Week 48: Measures word recall (maximum 12 words per trial, across 6 trials). Maximum total recall score across 6 trials is 72; minimum recall is 0 across 6 trials. The higher the raw score, the better the patient did at recalling the target words. The unit of measure is the raw score, or the sum of the number of words recalled across all 6 trials.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Wechsler Memory Scale-III scores from baseline to Week 48: The WMS-III Visual Reproduction sub-test was used to measure visual working memory and delayed memory. Patients were shown pictures of four drawings and were asked to reproduce them from memory immediately after seeing them, and 25 minutes after seeing them. The four scores are summed and the greater the total raw score, the better the patient did on the assessment. The maximum raw score for this test is a 41 on both the immediate and delayed portions (the overall range is 0-82 points). The change score is calculated using the total scores of both the immediate and delayed portions.</description>

    <measure>Change in Selective Reminding Test - Delayed Recall (SRT-DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Selective Reminding Test-Delayed Recall scores from baseline to Week 48: SRT Delay is administered 15 minutes after the immediate recall portion. Patients are asked to remember as many of the words as they can from the 6 trials. Maximum raw score is a 12 for free recall. If a patient is unable to recall a word, they are given a chance to recognize it among three incorrect word choices. Maximum raw score for recognition is 12. The greater the score on the delayed recall portion, the better the patient does on the assessment.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Any patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, psychoses, bipolar disorder, or alcohol/substance dependence (within the last 6 months) were excluded from participating in the study. Patients already on an effective anti-depressant, non-responders to citalopram/es-citalopram, and those on cholinesterase inhibitors/memantine were also excluded.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Es-citalopram and Memantine Treatment</title>
          <description>This group received concurrent es-citalopram plus memantine treatment for 48 weeks. Patients ranged in age from 50-90 years old. Es-citalopram treatment began at 10mg per day for two weeks and was increased to 20mg per day for the 48 week duration. If a patient had an inadequate response to the antidepressant on two consecutive visits, the study physician used an alternative. At two weeks into the study, the patients were started on memantine 5mg, and the maximum dose of 20mg was reached by the six week point.</description>

        <description>Change in Wechsler Memory Scale-III scores from baseline to Week 48: The WMS-III Visual Reproduction sub-test was used to measure visual working memory and delayed memory. Patients were shown pictures of four drawings and were asked to reproduce them from memory immediately after seeing them, and 25 minutes after seeing them. The four scores are summed and the greater the total raw score, the better the patient did on the assessment. The maximum raw score for this test is a 41 on both the immediate and delayed portions (the overall range is 0-82 points). The change score is calculated using the total scores of both the immediate and delayed portions.</description>

        <description>Change in Selective Reminding Test-Delayed Recall scores from baseline to Week 48: SRT Delay is administered 15 minutes after the immediate recall portion. Patients are asked to remember as many of the words as they can from the 6 trials. Maximum raw score is a 12 for free recall. If a patient is unable to recall a word, they are given a chance to recognize it among three incorrect word choices. Maximum raw score for recognition is 12. The greater the score on the delayed recall portion, the better the patient does on the assessment.</description>

        <title>Change in Clinical Global Impression - Depression Change</title>
        <description>The CGI Depression Change follows a seven-point likert scale. Compared to the patient's condition at baseline in the study [prior to medication initiation], the patient's condition is rated as: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment. Responses were calculated for the entire group. Mean at final visit has been reported below. Higher mean at baseline indicates a decrease in depression scores.</description>
