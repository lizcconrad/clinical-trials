    <textblock>
      Pathological complete response, (pCR) correlates with a favourable overall prognosis in
      locally advanced rectal cancer patients underwent preoperative chemoradiation, so obtaining a
      pCR might be beneficial. The aim of the study is to investigate safety and efficacy of
      preoperative IMRT combined with bevacizumab and capecitabine. primary endpoint is
      pathological complete remission rate.

    <description>radiotherapy: 50 Gy to the pelvis (25x 2 Gy on days 1-35, excluding weekends) .IMRT planing and technique with high energy photons will be used. All fields will be treated daily. Multileaf collimators will be used to shape individual radiation fields. Patients will be irradiated in a prone position with a full bladder and by using belly board to minimize exposure of the small bowel.
capecitabine 825 mg/m² p.o. twice daily on days 1-35 (including weekends),
