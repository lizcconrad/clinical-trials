  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that intense physical activity has a potential effect on thrombotic events
      due to catecholamine release. The hormones leptin and adiponectin have been used as markers
      of cardiovascular risk, but they are few and contradictory studies that relate physical
      training intensity and duration of high plasma concentrations of these hormones. The use of
      antioxidants, such as proanthocyanidins present in grapes, may help in reducing the
      undesirable effects of intense training.

      Fifty four Brazilian healthy military without hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus and endocrine
      disease were enrolled in this study. All subjects were high physically military trained. The
      Ethical Committee of the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro in Brazil (COEP008/2011)
      approved the study protocol. Informed consent was obtained from each subject after
      explanation of purpose and risks of all procedures used.
