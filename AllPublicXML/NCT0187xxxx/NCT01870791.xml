  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer is poor. Approximately
      16,000 patients in the United Kingdom die from the disease. In spite of new chemotherapy
      regimens, the average survival for these patients is around 9 months from diagnosis.

      Omegaven is an infusion comprising omega-3 fish oils. There is evidence that omega-3 fish oil
      supplementation can improve general well-being and quality of life in patients receiving
      palliative chemotherapy for a number of different cancer types. It has also been suggested
      that omega-3 fish oil supplementation may reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy.

      This clinical trial aims to see whether the addition of Omegaven to EOX chemotherapy, the
      most widely used regimen for patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer, will make this
      drug regimen more effective at killing oesophago-gastric cancer cells, such that disease
      progression is delayed. Forty-five patients who have been diagnosed with advanced
      oesophago-gastric cancer will be recruited over a two year period to receive standard
      chemotherapy and omega-3 fish oil supplementation. The results in these 45 patients will be
      compared to a matched historical control group of patients who have received identical
      chemotherapy. If results suggest that the combination of EOX and Omegaven is sufficiently
      effective, tolerable and feasible then it will be the intention of the trial team to take the
      combination forward to treat patients with advanced oesophago-gastric cancer in a randomised
      study.
