    <textblock>
      Neuromonitoring of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is challenging.
      Clinical scoring systems produce insufficient information with deeply sedated patients, and
      disturbances of normal hemostasis limit the use of invasive intra-cranial pressure
      measurements. EEG based monitoring algorithms have been introduced into the operation theater
      and general anaesthesia, but these algorithms cannot be used in the intensive care setting
      without modifications. EEG is also susceptible to electrical disturbances, such as those
      created by patient movement.

      The study is conducted in Finland, in the intensive care unit of the Surgical Hospital of
      Helsinki. The total number of patients in this study is 20, and it is a part of a larger
      neuromonitoring study with a total of 110 patients. The patients are divided into four
      subgroups, as follows: 1. patients admitted to ICU with acute liver failure, 2. patients
      admitted to the postoperative cardio-thoracic ICU after cardiac surgery with perioperative
      total heart arrest, 3. patients admitted to the ICU because of status epilepticus and finally
      4. patients in critical condition, admitted to the ICU after any surgery. This study
      concentrates on the first group of patients with acute liver failure.

      Clinical care of patients is not altered. When arriving into the ICU EEG-monitoring will
      added to routine monitoring. To evaluate the neurological status the following tests are
      performed: clinical test, blood tests and transcranial doppler ultrasound. The Entropy of EEG
      is measured along with the raw EEG signal.

      The recruiting of study patients was begun in December 2005 and the final study patients were
      recruited in December 2011. GE Healthcare Finland supplies the entropy monitoring devices and
      pays the salary of the research nurses who collect the study data. Clinical investigators
      will not receive funding from any commercial company. All patients (or their next of kin)
      included have given their written informed consent for inclusion in the study.

      The aim of this study is to find new factors and new non-invasive techniques, which correlate
      with the neurological state and outcome of patients suffering critical illness.

        All acute liver failure patients meeting the inclusion criteria, referred to the intensive
        care unit of the Surgical Hospital of Helsinki, Finland, for evaluation for the need of a
        liver transplant. The total study size was set to twenty patients, and recruitment was
        continued until the set number was met.
