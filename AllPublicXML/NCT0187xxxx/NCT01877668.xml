    <time_frame>At Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>PASI determines psoriasis severity based on lesion severity &amp; percentage body surface area (BSA) affected. Lesion severity is assessed for erythema, induration, &amp; scaling, evaluated separately for head &amp; neck, upper limbs, trunk, &amp; lower limbs &amp; rated for each body area according to a 5 point scale: 0=no involvement; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=very marked. BSA involvement is the extent (%) of body area affected by psoriasis &amp; is assigned a score: 0=no involvement; 1=0-9%; 2=10-29%; 3=30-49%; 4=50-69%; 5=70-89%; 6=90-100%. In each area, sum of severity rating scores is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of numbers obtained for the 4 body areas is the PASI score &amp; can vary in increments of 0.1 &amp; range from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores represent greater severity of psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scores: Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire, with each item scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Three endpoints are derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score (range 0 to 52) is calculated by summing the 13 items. FACIT-F experience domain score (range 0-20) is calculated by summing 5 items : I feel fatigued, I feel weak all over, I feel listless (&quot;washed out&quot;), I feel tired, and I have energy, while FACIT-F impact domain score (range 0-32) is calculated by summing the remaining 8 items. All responses are added with equal weight to obtain the total score. Higher scores represent better fatigue status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Scores Evaluating Spondylitis Using the Bath Anklyosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participants with ankylosing spondylitis. Utilizing a visual analog scale of 0-100mm (0=none and 100=very severe) participants answer 6 questions measuring discomfort, pain, and fatigue. The final BASDAI score averages the individual assessments for a final score ranging 0-10cm, with higher scores representing more severe ankylosing spondylitis disease activity.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI assesses the difficulty a participant has had in the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question, level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The score for each domain is the maximum (worst) score from the items/questions within the domain. Higher score indicates greater disability.</description>

        <description>Assessment of joint damage includes a joint erosion score (range 0-320) and a joint space narrowing (JSN) score (range 0-208).

        <description>The HAQ-DI assesses the difficulty a participant has had in the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question, level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The score for each domain is the maximum (worst) score from the items/questions within the domain. Higher score indicates greater disability.</description>

        <description>The PGA-PsO is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are rated separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale, scored as 0=none; 1, 2, 3, or 4=most severe. The severity rating scores are summed and the average taken; the total average is rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine a PGA-PsO score on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment of Psoriasis (PGA-PsO) Response</title>
          <description>The PGA-PsO is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are rated separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale, scored as 0=none; 1, 2, 3, or 4=most severe. The severity rating scores are summed and the average taken; the total average is rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine a PGA-PsO score on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).</description>
          <population>All participants who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug with baseline PGA-PsO&gt;0 and were evaluable. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) Response at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12</title>
        <description>PASI determines psoriasis severity based on lesion severity &amp; percentage body surface area (BSA) affected. Lesion severity is assessed for erythema, induration, &amp; scaling, evaluated separately for head &amp; neck, upper limbs, trunk, &amp; lower limbs &amp; rated for each body area according to a 5 point scale: 0=no involvement; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=very marked. BSA involvement is the extent (%) of body area affected by psoriasis &amp; is assigned a score: 0=no involvement; 1=0-9%; 2=10-29%; 3=30-49%; 4=50-69%; 5=70-89%; 6=90-100%. In each area, sum of severity rating scores is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of numbers obtained for the 4 body areas is the PASI score &amp; can vary in increments of 0.1 &amp; range from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores represent greater severity of psoriasis. PASI75 is defined as a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI.</description>

        <description>Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. The DSS is a function of finger circumference and tenderness, assessed and summed across all dactylitic digits. The severity of dactylitis is scored on a scale of 0–3, where 0=no tenderness and 3=extreme tenderness in each digit of the hands and feet. The range of total dactylitis scores for a patient is 0-60. Higher score indicates greater degree of tenderness.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Dactylitis Severity Score (DSS)</title>
          <description>Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. The DSS is a function of finger circumference and tenderness, assessed and summed across all dactylitic digits. The severity of dactylitis is scored on a scale of 0–3, where 0=no tenderness and 3=extreme tenderness in each digit of the hands and feet. The range of total dactylitis scores for a patient is 0-60. Higher score indicates greater degree of tenderness.</description>
          <population>All participants who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug with baseline DSS&gt;0 and were evaluable. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</population>

          <description>Enthesitis is inflammation in the tendon, ligament, and joint capsule fiber insertion into bone. The LEI assesses enthesitis in 6 sites. Tenderness is recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 6 sites, for an total score of 0–6. Higher score indicates a greater number of sites that are affected by enthesitis.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the physical component summary (PCS) score and the mental component summary (MCS) score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a standard deviation (SD) of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher PCS score represents better physical health status.</description>

          <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the PCS score and the MCS score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher MCS score represents better mental health status.</description>

An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the PCS score and the MCS score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher role-physical domain score represents better role-physical functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2), Acute Components: General Health Domain</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the PCS score and the MCS score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher general health domain score represents better general health perceptions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2), Acute Components: Social Functioning Domain</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the PCS score and the MCS score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher social functioning domain score represents better social functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short-Form-36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2), Acute Components: Mental Health Domain</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 acute is a 36-item measure that evaluates 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. An additional item measures health transition. The 8 health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the PCS score and the MCS score. Norm-based domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses; each of which has a population mean of 50 with a SD of 10 points, and ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. A higher mental health domain score represents better mental health functioning.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 3 responses. The responses record 3 levels of severity (no problems [1], some or moderate problems [2], or extreme problems [3]) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. Standard vertical 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual’s rating for their current health-related quality of life state, with a higher value representing better health status.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 3 responses. The responses record 3 levels of severity (no problems [1], some or moderate problems [2], or extreme problems [3]) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. Standard vertical 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual’s rating for their current health-related quality of life state, with a higher value representing better health status.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 3 responses. The responses record 3 levels of severity (no problems [1], some or moderate problems [2], or extreme problems [3]) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. Standard vertical 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual’s rating for their current health-related quality of life state, with a higher value representing better health status.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a descriptive system of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 3 responses. The responses record 3 levels of severity (no problems [1], some or moderate problems [2], or extreme problems [3]) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. Standard vertical 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 mm (best imaginable health state) visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual’s rating for their current health-related quality of life state; higher scores indicate a better health state, with a higher value representing better health status.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scores: Total Score</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire, with each item scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Three endpoints are derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score (range 0 to 52) is calculated by summing the 13 items. FACIT-F experience domain score (range 0-20) is calculated by summing 5 items : I feel fatigued, I feel weak all over, I feel listless (“washed out”), I feel tired, and I have energy, while FACIT-F impact domain score (range 0-32) is calculated by summing the remaining 8 items. All responses are added with equal weight to obtain the total score. Higher scores represent better fatigue status.</description>

        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire, with each item score ranging from 0 to 4. Three endpoints are derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score (range 0-52) is calculated by summing the 13 items. FACIT-F experience domain score (range 0-20) is calculated by summing 5 items : I feel fatigued, I feel weak all over, I feel listless (“washed out”), I feel tired, and I have energy, while FACIT-F impact domain score (range 0-32) is calculated by summing the remaining 8 items. All responses are added with equal weight to obtain the total score. Higher scores represent better (less) fatigue experience.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Scores Evaluating Spondylitis Using the Bath Anklyosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</title>
        <description>BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participants with ankylosing spondylitis. Utilizing a visual analog scale of 0-100mm (0=none and 100=very severe) participants answer 6 questions measuring discomfort, pain, and fatigue. The final BASDAI score averages the individual assessments for a final score ranging 0-10cm, with higher scores representing more severe ankylosing spondylitis disease activity.</description>
        <time_frame>From Baseline to Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug with presence of spondylitis at screening and baseline BASDAI score&gt;0 cm and were evaluable. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</population>
