      This study will assess the residual neuromuscular blockade (NMB) Train-Of-Four (TOF) ratios
      at tracheal extubation when anesthesiologists have determined that full recovery of
      neuromuscular function has occurred using standard clinical criteria for participants whose
      non-depolarizing-induced NMB is either not reversed or reversed with an acetylcholinesterase
      inhibitor administered as per standard routine care.

      This is a prospective, multi-site, anesthesiologist and PACU nurse TOF-Watch SX® blinded
      observational study of surgical patients undergoing elective laparoscopic or open abdominal
      procedures requiring general anesthesia and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade. There
      are two temporal aspects to the data collection: a prospective data collection in the OR and
      PACU; and a retrospective chart review one week after hospital discharge.

    <time_frame>Immediately prior to tracheal extubation in the OR</time_frame>
    <description>Neuromuscular functioning was monitored at time of tracheal extubation by applying three TOF electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollices muscle. T1 and T4 refer to the magnitudes (height) of the first and fourth twitches, respectively, after TOF nerve stimulation. The T4/T1 Ratio (expressed as a decimal of up to 1.0) indicates the extent of recovery from NMB, with a higher ratio indicating greater recovery from NMB. A T4/T1 Ratio of &lt;0.9 is indicative of residual NMB.</description>
