  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to the
      drug), safety and tolerability of single and multiple-dose of tapentadol in healthy
      participants.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      Phase 1 and, single and multiple-dose study of tapentadol tamper resistant prolonged-release
      formulation (TRF) 250 milligram (mg) tablet in healthy participants. The total study duration
      will be approximately of 29 days per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening
      (that is, 21 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (single-dose of tapentadol on
      Day 1, and multiple dose from Day 4-6 [followed by washout period of 24 hours]); and
      End-of-study (Day 8). All the eligible participants will receive single oral dose of
      tapentadol TRF 250 mg on Day 1 and twice daily from Day 4-6 (total 5 doses). Participants
      will keep upright position until 4 hours after study drug administration. Study drug will be
      administered 30 minutes after breakfast in the morning. Blood samples will be collected for
      evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
