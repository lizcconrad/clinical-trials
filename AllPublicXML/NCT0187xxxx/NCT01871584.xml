  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the hydrocolonic lavage method in
      order to prepare the colon prior to performing a colonoscopy, by comparison the hydrotherapy
      to standard preparation solution.

      Hypothesis: Colon cleansing by hydrotherapy is as good as colon cleansing by standard
      preparation solution.

    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the current standard method for evaluation of the colon. It has an
      indispensable place in the diagnosis and treatment of colon diseases. Diagnostic accuracy and
      therapeutic safety of colonoscopy depends on the quality of the colonic cleansing or
      preparation. Good preparation of the bowel is necessary prior to colonoscopy, to allow clear
      visualization of the bowel wall and any pathology within. The proposed study is a
      post-marketing study in which the study device, the Angel of Water system will be used for
      hydrotherapy of the colon in adult subjects scheduled for elective colonoscopy, instead of
      standard preparation solution. The effectiveness of the hydrotherapy in comparison to the
      standard preparation will be defined by evaluating colon cleanliness, subject's attitude and
      the duration of colonoscopy procedure.

    <description>The primary study outcome is the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score evaluating during colonoscopy. The BBPS is a valid scale for measuring bowel preparation as well as colonoscopy outcomes, as it reflects the colon's cleanliness during the inspection phase of the procedure.</description>

    <time_frame>Per patient: the end of procedure; For study: approx. 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will be asked to answer post cleansing questionnaire and a score will be calculated.</description>
