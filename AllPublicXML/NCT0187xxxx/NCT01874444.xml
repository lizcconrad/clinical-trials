      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rTMS are effective in the treatment of
      tinnitus

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) has an add-on effect for primary auditory cortex rTMS in improving tinnitus-related
      distress. We aimed to investigate whether rTMS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
      primary auditory cortex are capable of reducing tinnitus loudness. Linked to a
      neuronavigation system that is guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the frontal and
      temporal, rTMS can suppress areas of cortical plasticity. This cortical reorganization can be
      demonstrated by magnetoencephalography (MEG)
