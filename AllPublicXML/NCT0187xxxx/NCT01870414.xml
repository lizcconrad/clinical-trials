      The influence of cryotherapy on ankle motor control and balance of athletes is controversial.
      The aim of this study is to assess the neuromuscular response of the dominant leg and body
      balance basketball athletes after application of cryotherapy. The sample is distributed into
      two groups. Group one will consist of 20 basketball players without a history of ankle
      sprains in the past 12 months and no complaints of instability in this joint, and group two,
      20 non-athletes, active, no complaints in the lower limb in the last 12 months. Will perform
      the inversion movements and single-leg hop for the analysis of the electromyographic signal
      of anterior tibial, peroneal, gastrocnemius (lateral), rectus femoris, hamstrings and gluteus
      medius. Will also be performed kinematic analysis in search of body balance and range of
      motion of the joints of the lower limbs. And yet, the analysis of the plantar support and
      ground reaction force. After the initial collection of the data subjects will be submitted to
      the application of cryotherapy by immersion in a time of 20 minutes, with a temperature of 6
      ± 2 degrees Celsius. Data collection will be held in pre, 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes after
      application of cryotherapy. The data will be statistically analyzed to compare the results in
      collection times within and between groups. The significance level is set at 5%. The data
      support the intended use of cryotherapy in motor control of the inversion movement, jump and
      balance of athletes.

      Forty male subjects, aged 21.6 (±3.2) yr, 177.9 (±7.9) cm tall, 82.8 (±19.3) Kg body weight
      and 25.9 (±4.8) Kg.m-2 body mass index (BMI) were evaluated. Skin surface temperature before
      and after cold-water immersion was 27.7(±3)°C and 7.1 (±1)°C, respectively (p=0,0001).

    <measure>Cryoimmersion decreases neuromuscular response of lower limb after ankle inversion</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The peak values of the electromyographic signal amplitude (RMS) were obtained from thirty-five healthy, active university subjects after the use of a tilt platform to force the ankle into a 30º of inversion before (pre), and immediately after (post) 10, 20, and 30 minutes, followed by cold-water immersion at 4ºC, for 20 minutes. Shapiro-Wilk test, Repeated Measure Analysis and Bonferroni post-hoc test provided the results. Peak RMS values were significantly lower at all times after cold-water immersion when compared to prior application for all muscles, except in the post-immediate time for GM. There was a decrease in muscular response to the ankle inversion movement after cooling, with residual effect of up to 30 minutes. Therefore, special care should be taken by those involved in sports activities.</description>
