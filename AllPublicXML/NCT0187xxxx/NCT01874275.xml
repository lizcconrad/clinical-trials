      The primary objective of this investigation is to assess the effectiveness of transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation applied using VECTTOR to reduce the symptoms of Duchenne
      Muscular Dystrophy and reduce the impact of DMD upon the participants' quality of life.

      The primary outcome measures will include:

        1. increased muscle strength,

        2. increased range of joint motions and

        3. improved sleep parameters of ASI, N3 and REM.

      Muscle Strength and Joint Range of Motion Testing - All muscle and joint testing was
      performed at the MedCenter Therapy clinic in Houston, Texas. JTech computerized testing
      system was utilized including Goniometry, Grip testing, Inclinometry, Muscle Testing and
      Joint Range of Motion testing occurred on Day 0, 30, 60, 90, 180, and repeated at 12 months
      to determine muscular strength and joint Range of Motion. JTech computerized testing system
      was chosen on the basis of reliability and accuracy. At each of the testing intervals, the
      testing was administered by the same technician with the same equipment to all of the
      participants. Inter-and intra-tester reliability of the JTech computerized testing system has
      been the subject of multiple studies. Each of which found high ICCs (&gt;0.93) for both inter-
      and intra-tester reliability.

      All sleep studies were performed at Sleep Diagnostics of Texas in The Woodlands, Texas. Prior
      to the clinical trial, all of the participants spent two nights in the sleep unit and their
      sleep study examinations were performed. The second night was used as the Day 0 data. Sleep,
      breathing, arousals and limb movements were scored manually according to guidelines set forth
      by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The sleep studies were repeated at 6 months and 1
      year.

    <description>Range of Motion (ROM) testing (Wireless Tracker System) - All muscle and joint testing was performed using the JTech computerized testing system, including Goniometry, Grip Testing, Inclinometry, Muscle Testing and Joint Range of Motion. Testing occurred at Baseline (Day 0), 30, 60, 90 and 180 days to determine changes in joint Range of Motion. JTech computerized testing system determined the joint range of motion by radio signals from a goniometer measuring movement of the participants' joints. 44 separate tests were performed for Range of Motion for each participant at each time interval. The results from the range of motion tests were averaged the percent change from baseline to 180 days. Efficacy is defined as an increase in range of motion.</description>

Testing occurred at Baseline (Day 0), 30, 60, 90, and 180 days to determine changes in muscle strength. JTech computerized testing system determined the muscle strength by radio signals from a strain gauge measuring strength of the participant's muscles. 44 separate tests were performed for muscle strength for each participant at each time interval. Efficacy is defined as an increase in the strength measurement (pounds) from Baseline to 180 days.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep / Arousal Statistics Index (ASI) description: Sleep Studies were obtained twice before beginning the study. The second sleep study data was used as baseline. A follow up sleep study was obtained after 6 months (180 days) of Active or Placebo VECTTOR treatment. Sleep, breathing, arousal(s), and limb movements were scored manually according to guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The efficacy of the outcome measure of ASI is demonstrated by a percent improvement between Baseline and 180 days. The ASI is measured by the number of times sleep is interrupted per hour.</description>

Sleep, breathing, arousal(s), and limb movements were scored manually according to guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The efficacy of the outcome measure of ASI is demonstrated by a decrease in the value between Baseline and 180 days. The ASI is measured by the number of times sleep is interrupted per hour. Lower ASI values/numbers indicate improved sleep quality.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Range of Motion From Baseline to 180 Days</title>
        <description>Range of Motion (ROM) testing (Wireless Tracker System) - All muscle and joint testing was performed using the JTech computerized testing system, including Goniometry, Grip Testing, Inclinometry, Muscle Testing and Joint Range of Motion. Testing occurred at Baseline (Day 0), 30, 60, 90 and 180 days to determine changes in joint Range of Motion. JTech computerized testing system determined the joint range of motion by radio signals from a goniometer measuring movement of the participants' joints. 44 separate tests were performed for Range of Motion for each participant at each time interval. The results from the range of motion tests were averaged the percent change from baseline to 180 days. Efficacy is defined as an increase in range of motion.</description>

A follow up sleep study was obtained after 6 months (180 days) of Active or Placebo VECTTOR treatment. Sleep, breathing, arousal(s), and limb movements were scored manually according to guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The efficacy of the outcome measure of ASI is demonstrated by a percent improvement between Baseline and 180 days. The ASI is measured by the number of times sleep is interrupted per hour.</description>

VECTTOR: The VT-200, or VECTTOR system, delivers electrical stimulation via electrodes on the acupuncture points of a patient’s feet/legs and hands/arms to provide symptomatic relief of chronic intractable pain and/or management of post-surgical pain.
Once these electrodes are placed, the machine determines the appropriate choice of stimulation by automatically measuring body temperatures through the use of thermistors placed on the fingers during a testing sequence.</description>
