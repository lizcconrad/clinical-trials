      This protocol defines the requirements to demonstrate that the PRO instruments which were
      designed as paper-based are equivalent to the nSpire Health ePRO (electronic patient reported
      outcome), following the ISPOR's ePRO Good Research Practices Task Force recommendations. All
      validation studies of the questionnaires were conducted using the original paper versions.

    <measure>Demonstrate that the following PRO instruments which were designed as paper-based are equivalent to the nSpire Health ePRO (electronic patient reported outcome)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measures to demonstrate equivalency of electronic to paper PRO instruments are Usability and Cognitive Debriefing.
Usability data is gathered using systematic observation under controlled conditions to determine how well the device may be used by subjects.
Qualitative, Content Analysis of Cognitive Debriefing Data The cognitive debriefing data will be content analyzed for subject understanding of the instructions on the device used to deliver the PRO instrument.</description>
