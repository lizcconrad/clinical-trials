  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postoperative removal of intubation tube induces a noticeable sympathic response and
      increase of blood pressure. The risk of complications is especially elevated with the
      patients having cardiac surgery. Though sedation inhibits the sympathetic responses to
      extubation, according to the current protocol the propofol infusion has to be discontinued
      well before extubation because of its inhibitory effects on breathing centers.

      Dexmedetomidine is relatively new anesthesia drug. Dexmedetomidine is unique in its
      characteristic that it does not have the paralyzing effect on breathing. The aim of our study
      is to work out whether dexmedetomidine-extended propofol sedation over the extubation
      diminishes the aforementioned harmful effects of the extubation procedure.

      Study design is prospective double-blinded randomized study. The investigators compare two
      groups of 25 patients (total 50), who are of 60-90 years of age and are having either aortic
      valve surgery or the mentioned accompanied with cardiopulmonary bypass operation. The first
      group receives dexmedetomidine infusion and the other receives placebo infusion after the end
      of propofol infusion.

      The specific goal of the study is to figure what haemodynamic - mostly blood pressure related
      - changes can be observed when the postoperatively cut propofol infusion is continued with
      dexmedetomidine over the extubation procedure.

      Our hypothesis is that by using dexmedetomidine supplemented sedation the normally notifiable
      peak in blood pressure may be avoided.

      The study will be carried out completely in Cardiac ICU in Tampere University Hospital.

    <description>With the risk index we are better able to assess the total risk of the high levels of blood pressure to the patient. The risk index is dependant on the time integral of the blood pressure, for which the zero-value may be calculated from average pre-extubation SAP level.</description>

    <description>Dexmedetomidine will be diluted into a saline solution to a recommended concentration of 4 micrograms per millilitre. The saline will then be initially administered at the rate of 0.5 micrograms/kg/h and from that point the amount will be reduced to the point where the patient breathes well and is calm (compare dexmedetomidine recommendation at 0.2-1.4 ug/kg/h). The infusion rate will then be approximately 1-10 ml/h for a patient of 80 kgs weight. The exact dosage cannot be predetermined because it differs in each individual. In the control group the infusion speed is matching.</description>
