  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the concordance and discordance between results of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT scan and
      OctreoScan ® which is considered standard of care diagnostic test for neuroendocrine cancers
      and other imaging modalities like CT scan/MRI as gold standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of lesions that could be identified clearly as single foci will be determined for
      each patient. The same anatomic areas will be imaged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and
      111In-penteoctreotide Scintigraphy to ensure relevant comparison of lesion detection. Because
      of confluence and inability to clearly delineate single liver lesions in some cases, liver
      metastases will be classified as 1 organ metastasis, independent of the number of liver
      metastases present. Lymph nodes smaller than 1 cm on CT or MRI and showing marked avidity for
      68Ga- DOTATATE and 111In-penteoctreotide will be labeled as positive for disease. The
      presence of lesions will be confirmed by cross-sectional imaging of all patients with CT or
      MRI.

    <description>Will perform 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans on subjects. The same anatomic areas will be imaged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and 111In-penteoctreotide Scintigraphy to ensure relevant comparison of lesion detection.
The images from 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT will be reported by an experienced nuclear medicine physician who will be unaware of the results of the previous 111Inpenteoctreotide study. Areas of abnormal focal uptake will be documented. These areas of abnormal uptake will be compared with cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI)to confirm the presence of lesions. The images from 111In- penteoctreotide Scintigraphy will be reported independently by another experienced nuclear medicine physician.</description>

          -  Patients of either gender, aged at least 18 years.

          -  Karnofsky status equal or greater than 60.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Histologically and/or clinically confirmed and/or suspicious of NET.

          -  Somatostatin-analogue scintigraphies scan with result (positive or negative) within
             the last 4 weeks.

          -  Recent Blood test results up to 2-3 weeks as follows:(WBC:equal/higher 2*109/L;
             Haemoglobin: equal/higher 8.0g/Dl; Platelets: equal/higher 50x109/L; ALT, AST, AP:
             equal/lower 5 times ULN; Bilirubin: equal/lower 3 times ULN; Serum creatinine: within
             normal range or &lt;120μmol/L for patients aged 60 years or older.

          -  Negative pregnancy test in women capable of child-bearing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to DOTA, to 68Gallium, to Octreotate or to any of the
             excipients of 68Ga-DOTATATE.

          -  Therapeutic use of any somatostatin analogue, including Sandostatin® LAR (within 28
             days) and Sandostatin® (within 2 days) prior to study imaging. If a patient is on
             Sandostatin® LAR a wash-out phase of 28 days is required before the injection of the
             study drug.
