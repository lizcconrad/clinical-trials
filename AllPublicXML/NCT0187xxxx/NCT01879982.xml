    <textblock>
      For the moment, the detection of a mood episode in Bipolar Disorder (BD) relies on the
      appearance of the first clinical signs that the clinician detect or that the patient becomes
      aware of and reports to the clinician. Since physiological parameters such as cardiac
      rhythms, respiratory rate, voice characteristics and actigraphy seem to be related to the
      onset of a mood episode, information collected through the combined monitoring of multiple
      selected physiological parameters (such as cardiac rhythms, respiratory rate, movements,
      voice) during wake and sleep time, using wearable user friendly systems included into
      garments as well as with a smartphone, may offer a new perspective in the long-term treatment
      of BD.

        Individuals with cyclothymia or with rapid cycling BD will be recruited in the general
        population via ads in newspapers and universities (psychology, medical, and arts
        departments, for instance) and in clinical populations (patients from the investigators).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female individuals aged from 18 to 65 years old (both ages included).

          2. Participants meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for bipolar disorder I or II subtypes or
             Participants meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for rapid cycling BD, which is defined by a
             pattern of presentation accompanied by 4 or more mood episodes in a 12-month period,
             with a typical course of mania or hypomania followed by depression or vice versa. The
             episodes must be demarcated by a full or partial remission lasting at least 2 months
             or by a switch to a mood state of opposite polarity.

          3. Female participants must agree to use efficient contraceptive methods during the study
             duration.

          4. Participants must have signed informed consent documents indicating that they
             understand the purpose and procedures required for the study and are willing to
             participate in the study and comply with the study procedures and restrictions.

          5. Patients must be affiliated with or a beneficiary of a social security system.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any clinically relevant acute or chronic diseases which could interfere with the
             participants' safety during the trial, or expose them to undue risk or which could
             interfere with the study objective. This last perspective includes :- Attention
             deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)- Borderline personality disorder (BPD)

          2. Current MDD episode or manic episode, according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria

          3. Current major suicidal ideation (suicidal thoughts several times a day)

          4. History of recent (less than 1 year preceding inclusion) substance abuse or dependence
             (tobacco dependence excepted)

          5. Pregnant women as determined by the patient or breast-feeding women

          6. Any history of significant allergy.

          7. No legal capacity or limited legal capacity or unable to give an informed consent.

          8. Participants unlikely to co-operate in the study, and/or poor compliance anticipated
             by the investigator

          9. Participants being in the exclusion period according to the French National File for
             participants participating in a biomedical research.

         10. Total annual amount of compensation earned from participating in clinical studies
             exceeding 4500 Euros.

         11. Patients with pacemaker, defibrillator, or any implanted electronic device (to avoid
             any hazard - see section 7.3.2 of the Psyche device User Manual).
