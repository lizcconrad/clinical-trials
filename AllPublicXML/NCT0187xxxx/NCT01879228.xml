  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, diabetes has emerged as one of the most significant co-diseases that many
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients develop. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes results when either the
      body does not make enough insulin or the body does not respond correctly to this insulin.
      Insulin is a hormone which is made by cells in the pancreas and helps carry glucose (sugar)
      from the food we eat to the cells of the body for energy. While cystic fibrosis related
      diabetes (CFRD) has many features similar to both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, it is very
      different; therefore, treatment and care of CFRD is not the same.

      The purpose of this research study is to examine and understand the various mechanisms that
      contribute to CFRD and gain a better understanding of potential means to treat CFRD. The
      primary objective is to determine effectiveness of chronic incretin-based therapy vs. placebo
      on insulin secretion in CF patients with indeterminate glucose tolerance, impaired glucose
      tolerance, or CFRD.

      Insufficient incretin action has been associated with T2D. To study the possible link between
      insufficient incretin action and impaired insulin secretion in CFRD as in T2D, the present
      study will determine whether early intervention with incretin-based therapy using the DPP-4
      inhibitor sitagliptin (Januvia®) to raise endogenous levels of the incretin
      hormones--i.e.--glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotrophic
      polypeptide (GIP) for a 6-month period will improve insulin secretion in CF patients with
      indeterminate glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance or early CFRD.

    <measure>Change in second-phase insulin response derived from the glucose-potentiated arginine test as a measure of β-cell sensitivity to glucose at baseline and at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The key endpoint of interest will be the change in second phase insulin response derived from the Glucose-Potentiated Arginine (GPA) test. The GPA test will measure insulin (and other glucose controlling hormones) which will be a measure of pancreatic endocrine function in response to the injection of arginine. Arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid (substance) in the body. It will be given in the veins to make the pancreas secrete insulin. After the first injection of arginine, a glucose infusion will be started in order to raise the level of sugar in the blood to 230 mg/dl. Once the level is achieved, arginine will be injected again and blood samples are measured. After a 2 hour break, the glucose infusion will be started to achieve a blood sugar of 340 mg/dl and the arginine injection will be repeated. Comparison of responses at baseline and after 6 months of incretin-based therapy (Sitagliptin) or placebo will be performed using statistical methods.</description>
