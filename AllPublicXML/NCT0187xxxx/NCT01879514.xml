  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy(IgAN) is the highest incidence of kidney pathology in the primary
      nephropathy. In terms of differences in prognosis, severe IgA nephropathy,one of the most
      main primary renal disease,could cause the uremia. It will be significant that early
      indicators of prognosis and early intervention can be normalized and the scientific criteria
      for judging the efficacy of great clinical can be established. The subject based on the past
      study,literature research and various treatment will take the method of multi-center,
      double-blind, randomized, control to investigate the standard treatment of severe IgA
      nephropathy. Otherwise the uniformity and objectivity of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
      will be improved by the standardization of TCM research based on the epidemiological
      investigation and statistical analysis. The subject will determine the efficacy of more
      sensitive biomarkers and establish more scientific criteria for judging the effect with the
      application of urine proteomics and metabolomics technologies in order to operate in the
      formation of the standardization program of the treatment of severe IgA nephropathy with the
      Integrative medicine of TCM.
