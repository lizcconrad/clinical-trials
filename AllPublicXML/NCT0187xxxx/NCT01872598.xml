    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral masitinib 3 or 4.5 mg/kg/day in
      combination with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine to placebo in combination with
      cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's
      disease.

    <textblock>
      Actual standard treatment for mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia includes
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) and a NMDA receptor
      antagonist (memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease). These medications have
      shown to have an effect on some cognitive and non cognitive symptoms of the pathology.
      However, their efficacy remains limited and may decrease with time. There is an unmet medical
      need in this pathology. Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be
      considered as a good candidate at the dose of 3 and 4.5 mg/kg/day.
