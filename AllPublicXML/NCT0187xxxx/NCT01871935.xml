  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of general anaesthesia with a combination of opiates and hypnotics often induces
      vasodilation resulting in several haemodynamic effects such as a decrease in blood pressure
      (MAP), heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO). This haemodynamic suppression may jeopardize
      tissue oxygenation, particularly cerebral oxygenation. Previous research of the investigators
      group has revealed that atropine has an exceptionally beneficial effect on the determinants
      of tissue oxygen delivery as well as on tissue oxygenation. The investigators have
      demonstrated a significant and clinically relevant increase in CO and cerebral tissue
      oxygenation (SctO2) for a desired increase in MAP. This is in steep contrast with the more
      usual clinical practice of administrating classical vasoactive medication such as
      phenylephrine or norepinephrine, since the two latter have an even negative effect on CO and
      SctO2. In previous research the investigators used standardized target controlled
      propofol/remifentanil infusions for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. It is known
      that remifentanil has more intense haemodynamic side-effects compared to other opiates such
      as fentanyl, sufentanil or alfentanil. This raises the question whether the beneficial effect
      of atropine is restricted to propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia, or if this is equally valid
      during anaesthesia of propofol combined with other opiates such as sufentanil.

      Patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) require a long and deep
      general anaesthesia, which is usually performed with the combination of drugs as mentioned
      above. Because these patients often experience severe haemodynamic fluctuations they need to
      be closely monitored.
