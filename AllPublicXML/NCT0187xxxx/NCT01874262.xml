  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the mobile-phone based patient support has
      an impact on the adherence and persistence of ticagrelor treatment or on lifestyle changes
      that will have a positive impact on the cardiovascular risk factors.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary composite endpoint was defined as a non-adherence score based on the combination of adherence failure events and treatment gaps. Adherence failure events were defined as 2 missed doses during an observation cycle of up to 7 days. The first registered missed dose of ticagrelor in the e-diary initiated an observation cycle of 1 week. If a second missed dose was registered during the week, this was considered an adherence failure event. The third missed dose initiated a new observation cycle, and the process restarted. If the second missed dose was registered after more than 1 week, this was not defined as an adherence failure event, but initiated a new observation cycle. Treatment gaps were defined as patient reported gaps of 4 consecutive doses.</description>

        <title>Non-adherence Score</title>
        <description>The primary composite endpoint was defined as a non-adherence score based on the combination of adherence failure events and treatment gaps. Adherence failure events were defined as 2 missed doses during an observation cycle of up to 7 days. The first registered missed dose of ticagrelor in the e-diary initiated an observation cycle of 1 week. If a second missed dose was registered during the week, this was considered an adherence failure event. The third missed dose initiated a new observation cycle, and the process restarted. If the second missed dose was registered after more than 1 week, this was not defined as an adherence failure event, but initiated a new observation cycle. Treatment gaps were defined as patient reported gaps of 4 consecutive doses.</description>

          <title>Non-adherence Score</title>
          <description>The primary composite endpoint was defined as a non-adherence score based on the combination of adherence failure events and treatment gaps. Adherence failure events were defined as 2 missed doses during an observation cycle of up to 7 days. The first registered missed dose of ticagrelor in the e-diary initiated an observation cycle of 1 week. If a second missed dose was registered during the week, this was considered an adherence failure event. The third missed dose initiated a new observation cycle, and the process restarted. If the second missed dose was registered after more than 1 week, this was not defined as an adherence failure event, but initiated a new observation cycle. Treatment gaps were defined as patient reported gaps of 4 consecutive doses.</description>

          <description>The software application used on the patients' smart phones in this group, contained both the e-diary and the mobile-phone based patient support. Patients received feedback by the mobile-phone based patient support not only on the data they entered into the mobile-phone based patient support but also on their reported daily ticagrelor use.</description>

          <description>In this group the patients had access to the e-diary only, in which they reported their daily use of ticagrelor. Patients did not receive any feed-back except a reminder in case of a missing ticagrelor registration (which was applicable also for the other group receiving e-diary + the mobile-phone based patient support).</description>
