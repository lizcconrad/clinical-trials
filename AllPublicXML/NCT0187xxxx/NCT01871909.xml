  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is a laboratory model used to study hemorrhage in humans.
      The investigators hypothesize that the physiologic changes that occur with application of
      LBNP mimic those observed in bleeding and hemodynamically unstable trauma patients, and that
      LBNP is a truly valid model of human hemorrhage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims:

        1. Compare physiologic waveform data obtained from bleeding and hemodynamically unstable
           trauma patients to existing data collected from LBNP subjects.

        2. Determine the accuracy of LBNP in approximating the physiologic changes that occur in
           bleeding and hemodynamically unstable trauma patients.
