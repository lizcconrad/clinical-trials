  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the impact of initial treatment duration (4-week versus 8-week)of Esomeprazole
      (40mg) on the rate of symptom relapse and sustained healing of esophagitis in patients with
      symptomatic erosive esophagitis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients:

      Patients between the ages of 15 and 80 years with clinical symptoms of acid regurgitation,
      heart burn, or feeling of acidity in the stomach, who have Los Angeles Grade A and B erosive
      esophagitis proven by endoscopy are recruited. Criteria for exclusions include (1)
      coexistence of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal malignancies, (2) pregnancy, (3) coexistence
      of serious concomitant illness (for example, decompensated liver cirrhosis and uremia), (4)
      previous gastric surgery, (5) allergy to esomeprazole, (6) symptom score of a validated
      questionnaire (Chinese GERDQ) less than 12, and (7) equivocal endoscopic diagnosis of Los
      Angeles Grade A and B erosive esophagitis.

      Outcome parameters:

      The main outcome measures

        1. Rate of complete symptom relief (CSR) at the end of initial treatment phase

        2. rate of symptom relapse within 12 weeks after stopping initial therapy
