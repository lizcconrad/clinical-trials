  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol is one of the leading contributors to premature mortality and disability. Most people
      with alcohol problems will never seek treatment. There is a need to develop alternate ways to
      help problem drinkers outside of formal treatment settings.

      One promising strategy is Internet-based interventions for problem drinkers. The first
      randomized controlled trial found that the investigators could reduce alcohol consumption by
      about six drinks per week at a six-month follow-up using a minimal, personalized feedback
      Internet-based intervention. The investigators second randomized trial demonstrated that an
      extended Internet-based intervention that contained a range of cognitive-behavioural and
      relapse prevention tools could produce greater reductions in problem drinking compared to
      that provided by the same minimal intervention at a six-month follow-up. Building upon this
      research, the current project will assess whether this extended Internet-based intervention
      can have a sustained impact on problem drinking. Specifically, the major objective of this
      project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of an extended
      Internet-based self-help intervention for problem drinkers to a minimal Internet-based
      intervention in the general population of problem drinkers over a two year period.

      Problem drinking participants will be recruited through media advertisements across Canada
      and will be randomly assigned to the minimal or extended Internet-based interventions.
      Six-month, twelve-month and two-year drinking outcomes will be compared between experimental
      conditions. It is predicted that participants receiving the extended Internet intervention
      will display sustained improved drinking outcomes compared to participants in the minimal
      Internet intervention condition. This programmatic line of research will advance the science
      of Internet-mediated intervention.
