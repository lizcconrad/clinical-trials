  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine factors associated with frequency and
      type of internet and mobile technology use among illegal drug users, specifically use of
      internet and text-messaging to obtain health care information and engage in health care
      utilization, specifically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment
      services. We will target high drug activity neighborhoods in New York City and enroll
      participants recruited through targeted street outreach. All participants (n=336) will
      undergo an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) that will assess sociodemographics,
      health care access and utilization, sex/drug use behavior, health status, and characteristics
      of general and health-related internet/mobile technology use including factors that promote
      or hinder use. Participants identified as using the internet â‰¥1/month (n=151) will return for
      a 4-week ACASI to report on use of the pilot website (which will largely display information
      currently available in the community in print/ pamphlet/ video form).

      At the enrollment visit participants deemed eligible after screening will be consented, and
      given a 30 minute baseline ACASI survey. At the end of the baseline visit, those participants
      who reported internet use at least 1x/month (in the past month) will be offered participation
      in the Pilot Website Evaluation Component. For this component, participants will be
      instructed on how to use an educational website with health resources. Their use of the
      website will be tracked. They will be given an appointment to return in 4-weeks for a follow
      up survey at the pharmacy and a 2-week locator call.

    <description>While this pilot intervention is not a randomized trial, study participants who report internet use at least once a month will told of a Pilot Website Evaluation Component that they will be able to access for a 4-week study period. This website will contain a educational information tailored to the health needs of drug users. Web content will be similar to materials and public health messages released by the NYC Department of Health and therefore, harm is not likely to arise from viewing such content.</description>
