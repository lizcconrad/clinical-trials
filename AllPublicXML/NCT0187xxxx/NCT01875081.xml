  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If the participant voluntarily agrees to participate in the clinical trial before
      registration, the investigator conducts a screening test to evaluate the participant's
      suitability.

      A participant that satisfies all selection and exclusion criteria is assigned randomly to a
      test group (1-time or 2-time injection group) or control group (no-cell therapy group).
      Participants assigned to the 1-time injection group conduct cell therapy within 1 month after
      bone marrow aspiration. Before implementing cell therapy, implement hepatic artery
      catheterization which inserts a catheter into the hepatic artery through the right aorta
      femoralis and inject 5X107 autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
      Participants assigned to the 2-time injection group store 1-time injection amount of
      mesenchymal stem cells while being cultivated after sampled from the bone marrow, and will
      re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cells within 1 month after first injection.

      Participants will make a total of 8 hospital visits on a 4-week interval after registration,
      and effectiveness and safety will be evaluated based on a fixed procedure on every visit.
