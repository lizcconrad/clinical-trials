  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how feasible it is to use a certain type of Computed Tomography (CT)
      to scan prostate cancer, called a high quality volume CT scan. It is hoped that this
      technique will help doctors provide a higher-quality image of the prostate cancer, making it
      easier to plan the area that will be treated. Using this type of CT scan will also lessen the
      amount of time patients spend in the scanner.

      This study will not offer patients a different treatment for their prostate cancer. Patients
      will receive the most appropriate standard treatment whether or not they are in this study.
