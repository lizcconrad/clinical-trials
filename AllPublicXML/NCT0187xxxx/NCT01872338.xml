  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a psychotherapeutic intervention that integrates
      cognitive therapy and mindfulness meditation techniques to prevent suicide in military
      Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every month the VA becomes aware of approximately 1,100 Veterans in VA care who attempt
      suicide. While the VA has implemented a comprehensive, multifaceted suicide prevention
      approach, it has yet to implement nationally any evidence-based psychotherapies targeting
      suicide, a gap due largely to the dearth of evidence-based therapies for suicide. Primary
      aims of this proposal are to conduct a randomized controlled trial testing an adaptation of a
      cognitive-behavioral intervention, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), for Veterans
      on the VA's High Risk for Suicide List. The investigators' adapted version of MBCT for
      suicide (MBCT-S) integrates mindfulness meditation techniques with the VA Safety Plan to
      enhance patients' awareness of suicide triggers and appropriate coping strategies. This study
      has the potential to increase the range of cost effective treatment alternatives for the
      large number of suicidal Veterans for whom evidence-based therapies are severely limited.

    <description>The investigators define &quot;event&quot; broadly as a range of suicidal behaviors defined according to the VA's Self-Directed Violence Classification System (SDVCS). Based on the SDVCS, an event may include self-directed violence, with or without injury, in which evidence of suicidal intent is clear or undetermined; or suicidal preparatory behaviors. The study definition of a suicide event also includes suicidal ideation resulting in the need for emergency care or psychiatric hospitalization.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria were formulated to recruit a sample at high risk for suicide
        behavior.

          -  The subject has experienced a suicidal event during the past 30 days. A suicidal event
             involves

               -  1) psychiatric hospitalization due to suicidal risk,

               -  2) psychiatric hospitalization if subject was already on the High Risk for
                  Suicide List,

               -  3) suicidal ideation with suicidal intent,

               -  4) suicidal preparatory behaviors, or

               -  5) actual, interrupted, or aborted suicide attempt.

        AND

          -  The subject is on or will be placed on the VA High Risk for Suicide List

               -  OR The subject had an actual, interrupted, or aborted attempt in the last year

               -  OR In the study clinician's opinion (i.e., Masters or Doctoral level study
                  personnel with formal mental health training) in consultation with the PI, the
                  suicidal event is significant enough to warrant treatment to reduce suicidal
                  risk.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  cognitive deficits that decrease the likelihood of benefit from MBCT-S

          -  severe symptoms of hallucinations or delusions

          -  disorganized or disruptive behaviors

          -  medically unstable

          -  current mindfulness-based psychotherapy or receipt of 2 or more sessions of a
             mindfulness-based psychotherapy in the last 12 months
