  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a major cause of tooth loss in humans and is one of the most prevalent
      diseases associated with bone loss. Following bacterial colonization, the gingiva becomes
      inflamed leading, in some cases, to the destruction of the alveolar bone. Periodontitis has
      two distinct but interconnected etiologic components, periodontopathic bacteria and
      host-mediated connective tissue-destructive responses to the causative bacteria and their
      metabolic products.

      A few studies have revealed that probiotic Lactobacillus strains were useful in reducing
      gingival inflammation and the number of black-pigmented rods, including Porphyromonas
      gingivalis (Pg), in the saliva and sub-gingival plaque. Concerning periodontal conditions,
      its shown that application of beneficial bacteria, as an adjunct to scaling and root planing
      (SRP), can inhibit re-colonization of pathogens in periodontal pockets and reduce bleeding on
      probing.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the improvement of periodontal health with
      probiotic (Inersan) lozenges, used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing [SRP].
