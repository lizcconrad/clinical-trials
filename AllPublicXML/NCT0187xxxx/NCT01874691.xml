      This study is to build a Chinese national registry and surveillance system for acute
      myocardial infarction(AMI) to obtain real-world information about current status of
      characteristics, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of Chinese AMI patients; And
      to propose scientific precaution strategies aimed to prevent effectively from the incidence
      of AMI; And to optimize the management and outcomes of AMI patients through implementation of
      guideline recommendations in clinical practice, and analysis and development of effective
      treatment strategies; And to create cost-effective assessment system.

      The aim of the study is to establish the national platform for surveillance, clinical
      research and translational medicine in China, designed to facilitate efforts to improve the
      quality of AMI patient care and thus decrease morbidity and mortality associated with AMI.
