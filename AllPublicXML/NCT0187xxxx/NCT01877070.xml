  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information on how patients and their partners/close
      allies make treatment decisions when they have been diagnosed with early stage prostate
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient and his partner will fill out assessments at baseline. Thereafter we will obtain
      the patients' treatment decision (AT or AS) within approximately 3 months. Once a patient
      makes a decision, he and his partner will complete another set of questionnaires. The patient
      and his partner will then complete the remaining questionnaires approximately 6, 12, 18, and
      24 months following the treatment decision. We will examine the associations between baseline
      assessments , and the treatment decision as well as the changes in the assessments and the
      treatment decision. We will also assess associations between follow-up assessments and the
      decision to change a treatment decision from AS to AT. Data from patients and partners/close
      allies will generally be analyzed separately, thus patients who do not have a partner (or
      partner declines to participate) can still be enrolled and their psychosocial outcomes
      assessed.
