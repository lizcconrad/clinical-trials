    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer can compromise fertility.
      Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is an experimental strategy offered at The University of
      Pennsylvania to preserve future fertility (protocol 806062). The primary objective of this
      study is to determine the efficacy and safety of autologous transplantation of previously
      cryopreserved ovarian cortical tissue in patients who experience infertility or ovarian
      insufficiency after cancer treatments.
