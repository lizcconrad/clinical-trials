  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a probiotic can change the way
      bile is used by the body. The investigators will also look at the effect of the probiotic on
      your intestinal health.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study. After obtaining
      informed consent, healthy, middle-aged adults with a larger waist circumference
      (n=30/probiotic cross with n=90 total/study) will be randomized to one of four groups:
      Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, or
      placebo. Participants will consume 1 capsule per day of probiotic or placebo for 6 weeks.
      After a 4-week washout period, participants will be crossed to the other treatment (i.e.,
      probiotic to placebo or placebo to probiotic).

      Participants will complete daily questionnaires throughout the intervention period, and one
      week before and after each intervention period. Blood samples will be collected at the
      baseline and final time points (Â±3 days) of each intervention. Stool samples will be
      collected during the pre-baseline and final weeks of each intervention. Dietary intake will
      be assessed weekly during each intervention period. Gastrointestinal symptoms and physical
      activity questionnaires will be completed weekly during each intervention period and also the
      weeks before and after each intervention period.
