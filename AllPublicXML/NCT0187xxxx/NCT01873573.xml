  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to find out if adding triamcinolone (steroid) injection at
      the participant's initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure will improve the opening
      of their esophagus and decrease the need for repeat dilations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized two-arms cross-over trial. In this study there are two groups, the
      control group and the triamcinolone treatment group. The cross-over design will apply only in
      the control group when patients are not responding to EGD dilations alone (defined as no
      sustained improvement in baseline dysphagia) and they will be allowed to cross-over to the
      triamcinolone group and undergo 3 successive EGDs with triamcinolone injection.

      Typically, triamcinolone (steroid) injection is given as a standard of care after several
      esophageal dilations are performed and failed to improve the condition. Therefore,
      researchers want to find out if adding triamcinolone (steroid) injection at the participant's
      initial EGD procedure will improve the opening of their esophagus and decrease the need for
      repeat dilations.

    <measure>Number of Visits to Receive Esophageal Dilation During the 12 Month Follow-up Period</measure>

    <description>The main outcome measured will be number of visits to receive Esophageal Dilation during the 12-month follow-up period. Successful dilation of the stricture for the procedure will be defined as creation of a mucosal tear confirmed by endoscopic visualization after the last dilation is performed.</description>

    <description>Triamcinolone is a generic name of a long-acting synthetic corticosteroid and approved for sale in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After endoscopic dilation is performed, a total of 40-80 mg (physician preference) of triamcinolone (40 mg/ml) will be injected throughout the stricture under direct visualization.</description>

    <description>EGD is a test to examine the lining of the esophagus (the tube that connects your throat to your stomach), stomach, and first part of the small intestine. It is done with a small camera (flexible endoscope) that is inserted down the throat.</description>
