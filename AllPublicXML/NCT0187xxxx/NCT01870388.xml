    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to measure how much of the study drug called baricitinib
      gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. Healthy
      participants and those with liver disease may enroll. The study will last about 7 days for
      each participant, not including screening.
