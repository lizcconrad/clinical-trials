    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective clinical evaluation is to compare VEO® single or multilevel
      results to XLIF® single or multilevel results relative to the safety endpoints. This study
      will collect retrospective data on subjects who were treated with VEO® and XLIF® at least 3
      months prior to the initiation of this study. Given that fusion generally takes at least 6
      months to determine, the aim of this study is not to determine fusion but to consider the
      short-term (out to 6 months) reported adverse events between the two cohorts.

      Devices used in both systems are cleared for use and conform to US regulatory requirements.
      The study employs these procedures and devices for uses that are consistent with their
      510(k), legally cleared, labeling.

      <pre_assignment_details>The Sponsor originally collected data on 38 subjects, 21 subjects in the VEO treatment arm and 17 subjects in the XLIF® treatment arm, from a total of five sites.

          <title>VEO® Lateral Access and Interbody Fusion System</title>
          <description>VEO® is the brand name for the Baxano Surgical LLIF system, which employs traditional LLIF patient positioning, disc space preparation, implant placement, and is compatible with neuromonitoring. The VEO® system was developed with an initial, radiolucent retractor that is placed at the psoas fascia and held in place with an articulated arm. Dissection through the psoas is then performed with direct vision in conjunction with EMG. The psoas muscle is split anterior-posterior along muscle fiber lines and the retraction is performed with two independent blades. Insertion depth may be varied to avoid muscle creep, and the toed-out blade tips are positioned under the psoas to hold the system in place. An inner sleeve is inserted to lock the blades in place at the desired radial tension for a customizable disc space exposure. Standard discectomy, endplate preparation, cage implantation, and wound closure are performed.</description>

          <title>eXtreme Lumbar Interbody Fusion (XLIF®)</title>
          <description>The eXtreme lumbar interbody fusion (XLIF®) is the brand name of the LLIF system distributed by NuVasive®, Inc.When the XLIF® system is used for LLIF, the patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position and the retroperitoneal space is accessed through blunt dissection. Using proprietary neuromonitoring, a series of graduated muscle dilators are advanced through the psoas muscle down to the disc space at the lumbar level of interest. Real-time EMG evoked potential values indicate proximity of motor nerves to direct safe dilator placement. A guidewire is placed into the disc space through the initial cannulated dilator to fix retractor placement. A psoas muscle retractor system is inserted over the dilators and blades are carefully opened over the disc space in the caudal-cephalad and anterior directions under direct live EMG. Upon achieving sufficient disc space exposure, standard discectomy, endplate preparation, cage implantation, and wound closure are performed.</description>

            <title>VEO® Lateral Access and Interbody Fusion System</title>
            <description>VEO® is the brand name for the LLIF system introduced by Baxano Surgical® in 2011. The VEO Lateral system employs traditional LLIF patient positioning, disc space preparation, implant placement, and is compatible with neuromonitoring. However, the VEO® system posesses a radiolucent retractor that is placed at the psoas fascia and held in place with an articulated arm. This retractor was developed to address the reliance on EMG neuromonitoring alone with traditional LLIF approaches to avoid injury to lumbar plexus nerve roots, particularly as EMG is limited to monitoring motor nerves. Moreover, there was a desire to avoid reliance on fluoroscopy alone to determine retractor placement, without significant assessment of intervening anatomy.</description>

            <title>eXtreme Lumbar Interbody Fusion (XLIF®)</title>
            <description>The eXtreme lumbar interbody fusion (XLIF®) is the brand name of the LLIF system distributed by NuVasive®, Inc. in 2001. When the XLIF® system is used for LLIF, the patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position and the retroperitoneal space is accessed through blunt dissection. Using proprietary neuromonitoring, a series of graduated muscle dilators are advanced through the psoas muscle down to the disc space at the lumbar level of interest. Real-time EMG evoked potential values indicate proximity of motor nerves to direct safe dilator placement. A guidewire is placed into the disc space through the initial cannulated dilator to fix retractor placement. A psoas muscle retractor system is inserted over the dilators and the blades are carefully opened over the disc space in the caudal-cephalad and anterior directions under direct live EMG. Upon achieving sufficient disc space exposure, standard discectomy, endplate preparation, cage implantation, and wound closure are performed.</description>
