  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel, tissue-engineered
      vascular prosthesis, the Human Acellular Vascular Graft, HAVG.

      The HAVG is intended as an alternative to synthetic materials and to autologous grafts in the
      creation of an above-knee femoro-popliteal bypass graft in patients with peripheral arterial
      disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HAVG is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, acellular tubular graft composed of human collagens and
      other natural extra-cellular matrix proteins. Upon implantation, it is anticipated (based on
      pre-clinical studies) that the collagen-based matrix comprising the graft will be infiltrated
      with host cells and re-modeled by the host. This will result in a vascular structure more
      similar to the histological composition of the native vascular tissue that may improve graft
      longevity and be less likely to become infected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease who require above knee
             femoro-popliteal bypass surgery

          -  Preoperative angiography or angio-CT shows superficial femoral artery occlusion of &gt;10
             cm AND graft length required ≤ 30 cm. This imaging may have been conducted up to 3
             months prior to study entry provided that the patient's symptoms have remained stable
