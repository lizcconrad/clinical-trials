    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of contact lens lubricity on lid wiper
      epitheliopathy (LWE) in symptomatic contact lens wearers. LWE is defined as an alteration of
      that portion of the marginal conjunctival epithelium of the upper eyelid that wipes the
      ocular surface during blinking.

  <detailed_description>

      This study will be conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, participants will wear either
      spectacles or contact lenses for two weeks to determine the impact of interruption of contact
      lens wear on LWE. In Stage 2, a second cohort of participants will wear one of two contact
      lens brands for two weeks, and LWE and ocular discomfort will be compared.

    <description>LWE was measured by slit lamp evaluation of fluorescein and lissamine green staining of the upper eyelid. LWE was graded on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0=none and 3=severe. The percent of eyes experiencing at least a 1 grade reduction in LWE (from baseline) at the 2-week visit was compared between groups. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>
