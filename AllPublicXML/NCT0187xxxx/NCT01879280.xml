    <textblock>
      The scientific objectives of this study are to systematically study the problems that are
      created by incising the attachment of the temporalis muscle in a randomized group of
      patients, and to determine whether another approach that does not detach the temporalis
      muscle results in less post-operative morbidity. Cutting through the attachment of the
      temporalis muscle to the skull is a widely-accepted procedure used to gain access to the
      skull prior to the drilling used for a pterional craniotomy (one of the most frequent types
      of surgeries used in neurosurgical practice). Despite the frequent use of this maneuver and
      the known sequelae of temporalis mobilization (e.g. post-operative myofascial pain,
      temporalis weakness, and pain with mastication), very little is known about the true
      incidence of these post-operative symptoms. Furthermore, there is very little objective
      evidence at the present time to support the claim that the incidence and severity of these
      post-operative phenomena can be decreased with use of an osteoplastic craniotomy (a procedure
      where the temporalis is left attached to the bony calvarium). The investigators would like to
      evaluate whether this slightly more time-consuming and technically demanding approach is less
      morbid in this respect than the contemporary pterional approach. Special note is made that
      the osteoplastic approach has been used in standard neurosurgical practice for quite some
      time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In contemporary neurosurgery, when performing a pterional craniotomy, neurosurgeons have been
      taught to cut through and detach the temporalis before drilling the skull to &quot;turn a bone
      flap&quot;. While there are ways to turn a bone flap with the temporalis still attached (i.e., an
      &quot;osteoplastic craniotomy&quot;), this is thought to be slightly more time-consuming and is used
      less often in many centers. Additionally, there is a common misconception that osteoplastic
      craniotomy does not allow an equivalent view, although recent evidence suggests that the
      surgical exposure in the two approaches is no different. Aside from the extra time involved,
      we do not feel that leaving the temporalis attached to the bony calvarium disadvantages the
      patient in any fashion (and—in fact—may result in less post-operative morbidity). We are
      interested in this project because there is actually very little objective data regarding the
      morbidity people experience when the temporalis muscle is cut and mobilized prior to drilling
      the skull. If, in this study, we find that the group randomized to traditional pterional
      craniotomy experiences significantly more morbidity than the group randomized to osteoplastic
      craniotomy, this may justify conversion to an osteoplastic craniotomy in many or all
      instances.

      We wish to quantify the morbidity that is associated with the specific methods used to detach
      the temporalis muscle from the skull. Many variables regarding the way the temporalis is
      detached will be recorded and assessed in the group randomized to traditional pterional
      craniotomy. Additionally, many methods will be used to measure post-operative temporalis
      atrophy and/or dysfunction in the two randomized groups. After post-operative morbidity has
      been quantified, we plan to compare the traditional pterional group to the osteoplastic group
      and assess for significance.

             craniotomy for resection of a tumor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  o Because patient feedback and participation is necessary, cognitively impaired

               -  Also, generalized cachexia, prior history of craniotomy, or any other reason for
                  baseline temporalis asymmetry or poor wound healing is also reason for exclusion
                  from this study.
