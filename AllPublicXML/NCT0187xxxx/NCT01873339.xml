    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effect of single and repeat administration of darapladib, a
      novel, selective, orally active inhibitor of lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2
      (Lp-PLA2) currently under clinical development on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose
      of midazolam, a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) probe substrate. This study will investigate the
      inductive and inhibitory effect of darapladib on CYP3A4 metabolic pathway.
