        3.1.2 ECOG performance status 0-1 3.1.3 Histologically proven diagnosis of a prior thoracic
        malignancy treated with thoracic external beam radiotherapy with or without systemic
        chemotherapy

        3.1.4 Pathologic or clinical diagnosis of a new or loco-regional recurrent lung malignancy.
        A reasonable attempt should be made to make a pathologic diagnosis of malignancy (ie.

             adjacent draining lymph node regions.

          -  The new lesion or loco-regional recurrence must be within or adjacent to the
             previously irradiated treatment volume.

        3.1.5 Imaging as follows:

          -  CT scan of the chest with IV contrast within 8 weeks of registration

          -  Whole body PET scan within 8 weeks of registration

        3.1.6 Pulmonary function test (PFTs), including diffusion capacity within 8 weeks of
        registration

        3.1.7 Negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to registration for women of
        childbearing potential.

        3.1.6 Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must
        agree to use a medically effective means of birth control
