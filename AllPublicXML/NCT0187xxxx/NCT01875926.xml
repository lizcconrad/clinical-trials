      The overall aims of the study are:

        -  To provide additional information on the pharmacokinetics of ALX-0171 by measuring (i)
           local (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)) and systemic (plasma) concentrations of
           ALX-0171 after oral inhalation, and (ii) systemic (plasma) and urine concentrations
           after intravenous administration.

        -  To further determine the safety and local and systemic tolerability of ALX-0171.

        -  To further evaluate local (induced sputum) and/or systemic (serum) immunogenicity of
           ALX-0171, by analysing the potential occurrence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA).
