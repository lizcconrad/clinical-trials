  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represents the preferred reperfusion
      strategy for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), since it is
      more effective than thrombolytic regimens in reducing adverse events, including death.
      Drug-eluting stents (DES) are currently being widely used in patients with STEMI. The
      effectiveness of DES to reduce restenosis and the need for revascularization compared with
      bare-metal stents (BMS) has been documented in randomized controlled trials. The
      first-generation DESs implanted in STEMI have been associated with delayed healing and
      incomplete strut coverage. Therefore, in patients with implanted DES, longer duration of dual
      antiplatelet therapy is needed. The second-generation DESs (ZES and EES) have been improved
      the drug and polymer, which have been proved to improve neointima healing compared with the
      first generation DESs.

      However, the difference of strut coverage between EES and BMS implanted in STEMI patients is
      unknown. In this study, we assess the neointimal coverage at 3-month and 12-month follow-up
      in EES and BMS implanted in patients with STEMI by optical coherence tomography.
