  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will be investigating the use of stem cell transplantation, in related donors,
      to cure sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a recessive disorder caused by a point
      mutation that results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position
      in the B-chain of hemoglobin. This leads to sickling of the red blood cells under many
      conditions, such as hypoxia, dehydration, and hyperthermia. The sickling leads to
      vaso-occlusion, which causes irreversible damage in almost all systems in the body, including
      the central nervous system (CNS), lungs, heart, bones, eyes, liver, and kidneys.

      Primary objective:

      1) To determine disease free survival (DFS) at one year after matched sibling transplant
      using either bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), or umbilical cord blood
      (UCB) after a conditioning regimen consisting of Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, and Melphalan in
      patients 2-30 y/o

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Overall survival

        2. Rate of neutrophil and platelet engraftment for BM vs. UCB

        3. Incidence of graft failure

        4. Incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft vs host disease (GVHD)

        5. Incidence of chronic GVHD

        6. Incidence of other transplant complications, such as veno-occlusive disease, central
           nervous system (CNS) toxicity, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS)

        7. Incidence of reactivation of CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BK/JC virus

        8. Incidence of invasive fungal disease

        9. Time to immune reconstitution via monitoring of lymphocyte subpopulations and
           immunoglobulin levels
