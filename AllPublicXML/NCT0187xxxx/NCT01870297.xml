  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of LY3025876 given
      alone (Part A) and in combination with liraglutide (Part B) in participants with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

      This study will also evaluate how much of the study drug enters the blood stream and how long
      it takes for the body to remove the study drug. Information about any side effects that may
      occur will also be collected. Participants will continue their usual diet and exercise
      program and may remain on their physician-prescribed dose of metformin.

      Each part of the study is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks on average, not including
      screening. Participants may only enroll in one part.
