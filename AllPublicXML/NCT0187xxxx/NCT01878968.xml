  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to suggest that patients make different end-of-life decisions if they
      understand the risks, benefits and alternatives of CPR and mechanical ventilation. This study
      will examine whether evidence-based informed consent impacts patients choices and healthcare
      outcomes compared to routine care.
