  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to characterize the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      preliminary efficacy profile of IPI-145 given in combination with rituximab, or bendamustine
      plus rituximab, to subjects with select relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies.

    <textblock>
      This trial consists of two parallel arms. For each treatment arm, a 3+3 dose escalation
      design will be applied in 3-6 subject cohorts until the maximum tolerated dose of IPI-145
      when given with rituximab (Arm 1) or in combination with rituximab and bendamustine (Arm 2)
      is determined. Treatment arm selection will be chosen by the investigator and will depend on
      the agents previously administered to the subject. Once the MTD has been determined, the arms
      will move on to a dose expansion phase. During the dose expansion phase, each treatment arm
      will enroll to population specific cohorts to assess efficacy. All subjects must have had at
      least one prior anticancer treatment. The dose expansion cohorts are:

      Arm 1: Cohort A - CLL: Cohort B - CD20+ NHL

      Arm 2: Cohort A - CLL: Cohort B - CD20+ NHL
