  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to confirm the safety and immunogenicity of trivalent, surface
      antigen, inactivated influenza vaccine including MF59C.1 adjuvant, formulation 2013/2014
      Northern Hemisphere, in adults ≥65 years of age.

      For the immunogenicity endpoints the antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen,
      will be measured by means of Single Radial Hemolysis (SRH) or Hemagglutination Inhibition
      (HI) at approximately 21 days post immunization.

      The vaccine composition will be based on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended
      influenza strains for 2013/2014 Northern Hemisphere.

      The results of this study are intended to support the use of this vaccine in future influenza
      seasons if the recommended vaccine composition remains the same, in compliance with the
      requirements of the current European Union (EU) recommendations for clinical trials related
      to yearly licensing of influenza vaccines.

          <title>Percentages of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in HI Antibody Titers, Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After Receiving One Dose of aTIV</title>
          <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of adult subjects ≥65 years of age achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titers after receiving one dose of aTIV.
Seroconversion is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre-vaccination HI titer &lt;10 to a post-vaccination titer ≥40. Significant increase is defined as percentage of subjects with a pre-vaccination HI titer ≥10 to at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI antibody titers.
The related European (CHMP) criterion for the assessment of immunogenicity is met if &gt;30% of subjects achieve seroconversion or significant increase in post-vaccination HI titers.</description>
