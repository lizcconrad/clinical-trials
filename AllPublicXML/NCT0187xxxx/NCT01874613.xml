  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bioactive fibre-reinforced composite implant is used for reconstruction of skull bone defects
      and orbital floor defects.

      Functional and aesthetic outcome is assessed by patient and doctor.

      Development phase: Clinical trial Objectives: Assessment of functional and aesthetic outcome
      Methodology: Intervention study Sample size: 35+20+25 Main criteria for inclusion: Skull bone
      defect OR orbital floor fracture

      Investigational drug/treatment, dose and mode of administration: FRC implant Comparative
      drug(s)/placebo/treatment, dose and mode of administration: -

      Duration of treatment: 2 years of follow-up

      Assessments:

      Clinical outcome and radiologic assesment Functional and aesthetic outcome with Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS). Pain assessment with VAS.

      Statistical methods:

      Adequate statistical methods for publishing in international peer-reviewed journals.

    <description>After reconstruction, patient follow-up protocol follows to assess functional outcome, including safety.
Follow-up is done at timepoints of 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and after that every 6 month up to 2 years post-operatively. After this the follow-up is continued yearly, if necessary.
Visual and manual assessment is done by a doctor. Lateral and PA skull rtg is obtained to assess the fixation and position of the implant.
C-reactive protein level and leukocyte level is measured to assess the possible inflammation.</description>
