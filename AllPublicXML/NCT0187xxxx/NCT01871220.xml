      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of two different implant abutment designs
      on gum tissue volume changes over time after implant placement.

      This is a randomized, prospective, controlled clinical trial comparing the facial gingival
      profiles around Atlantis™ abutments that have either a linear &quot;divergent&quot; or &quot;concave&quot;
      transitional profile on the facial and proximal aspect of the abutments.

      Sixty study subjects requiring replacement of a single-rooted tooth with an implant-supported
      restoration will be recruited.

      The Osseospeed™ Plus implant will be placed for all 60 subjects, with the use of Uni healing
      abutments to minimize lateral tissue displacement during healing. After implant placement,
      but before final impressions are obtained (8 weeks post-placement), subjects will be
      randomized to either a &quot;divergent&quot; or a &quot;concave&quot; transmucosal abutment design. For
      fabrication of the experimental abutment, Atlantis™ engineers will initially design a control
      &quot;divergent&quot; prototype that will be modified with a concavity on the facial and proximal
      transition zones to obtain an abutment that will otherwise retain all the features of the
      control abutment. Engineers will measure the linear topographical changes (ΔL=Lc-Ld) of the
      transition zone, as well as the volumetric change (x) on the mid-facial aspect of the
      abutment induced by the formation of a submucosal concavity. The primary outcome of the study
      will be the apico-coronal change of the peri-implant mucosal zenith from prosthesis delivery
      to one year.
