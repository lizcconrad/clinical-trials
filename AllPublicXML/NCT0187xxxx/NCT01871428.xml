      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of aleglitazar monotherapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus who are drug-na誰ve to anti-hyperglycemic therapy. Patients will be randomized to
      receive either aleglitazar 150 mcg orally daily or placebo for 26 weeks.
