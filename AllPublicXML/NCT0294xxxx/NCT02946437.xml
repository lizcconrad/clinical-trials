      Feasibility and safety of short term application of sevoflurane in patients with SAH treated
      with aneurysm coiling or clipping in the setting of a neurointensive care unit.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After admission to the ICU, before the coiling / clipping intervention has been performed,
      the patients are screened for eligibility. When the patients are coming back to the ICU,
      after successful aneurysm coiling or clipping, data of artificial ventilation, systemic and
      other cerebral parameters will be collected continuously by online monitoring, starting at
      baseline and stopping at discharge of the ICU. Sevoflurane will be vaporized and
      administrated by the MIRUS™System directly to the inspiratory part of the ventilation circuit
      for the next 4 hours. In the following 14 days of the stay on the ICU, standard monitoring
      parameters, the appearance of vasospasm and brain oedema will be recorded. Besides the
      continuous online monitoring, laboratory assessment will be performed daily. At day 7±2 and
      day 14±2 after bleeding a MRI or CT examination will be performed, according to the clinical
      condition of the patient, to detect secondary brain injuries, as ischemia or brain oedema. At
      ICU discharge, the neurological outcome will be assesses applying GOS.

    <description>Sevoflurane postconditioning will start after the bleeding source is excluded by coiling or clipping as soon as the patient returns to the ICU and will be continued for 4 hours. 0.5-1.5vol% sevoflurane will be administrated into the ventilation circuit by a MIRUS™System.
The used dose (0.5-1.5vol%) is a lower dose as used for anaesthesia for a surgical intervention (0.5-3vol%), but high enough to provide sufficient sedation.</description>

    <description>MIRUS™ is a newly developed device, considered as vaporizer system, which can be used in the setting of operating rooms or in intensive care units. The MIRUS™System is successfully in use in daily clinical practice. This type of device is similar to the well-known AnaConDa® system (AnaConDa®, Sedana Medical, Uppsala, S) with several advantages. Since 2005 the anaesthetic-conserving device AnaConDa® facilitates, from a technical viewpoint, the routine use of volatile anaesthetics in intensive care patients as part of prolonged sedation, using ICU ventilators (Soukup J et al., 2009). The MIRUS™System forms a closed loop. It measures the end-tidal concentration of the anaesthetic gas and governs the application of the anaesthetic gas according to these values and the ventilation parameters.</description>
