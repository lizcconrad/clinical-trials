  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysms are common in the general population. The overall prevalence of
      unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is estimated of 2.3-3.2% in the population without
      specific risk factors for SAH. As noninvasive imaging modalities are more commonly used than
      before, UIAs are increasingly being detected. Most patients with small aneurysms (less than
      5mm) are incidentally found in clinical practice. Some studies indicate that the majority of
      patients with UIAs, particularly with small aneurysms (&lt;7mm), have a low risk of rupture, and
      others have found that small ruptured aneurysms have a high proportion in patients with SAH.
      Therefore, there is a lot of controversy regarding which small aneurysms can be left
      untreated, or which aneurysms are needed to be treated with clipping or coiling.

      The prevalence varies widely among different detection methods, race/ethnicity or patients
      with other inherited diseases. Although a wealth of data is available for the natural history
      of UIAs, the true natural history remains unknown because case selection bias occur in almost
      all studies. However, data on Chinese UIA is unknown. Using the MR angiography (MRA) to
      detect aneurysms, the prevalence is 7% of selected adult population in China. Therefore,
      small UIAs are very common and are increasingly being detected in clinical practice.
      Conservative treatment, surgical clipping and endovascular coiling are the three treatment
      options for UIAs. The optimal treatment remains controversial, particularly for small
      aneurysms (less than 7mm). To date, no clinical trials have compared the safety and efficacy
      between conservative treatment and surgical clipping or endovascular coiling for UIAs. It may
      be impossible to conduct the randomized controlled study considering aneurysm ruptured as a
      devastating event. However, surgical clipping or endovascular treatment itself carries a risk
      of immediate morbidity or mortality. Therefore, a substantial variability widely exists in
      treatment decision-making for UIAs, and this may lead to a great variability in clinical
      recommendations.

      Our study is a prospective observational study to identify the incidence of rupture of small
      aneurysms in the first year after the diagnosis of the aneurysm which is left untreated.
      Meanwhile, we determine the differences of outcomes, procedural complications, and rates of
      retreatment between surgical clipping and endovascular coiling for small UIAs in China.

      1. Background: There is a lot of controversy regarding which aneurysms can be left
           untreated, or which aneurysms are needed to be treated with clipping or coiling. To
           date, no clinical trials have compared the safety and efficacy between conservative
           treatment and surgical clipping or endovascular coiling for small UIAs.

        2. Study design: A multicenter prospective observation registry study. This study is
           undertaken to conform to the study protocol. Patients will be recruited between December
           2016 and December 2018. Patients are eligible for the study if they meet the inclusion
           criteria and they are not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are met.

        3. Procedures: All patients were interviewed by a multidisciplinary team that consisted of
           vascular neurosurgeons, interventional neuroradiologists and anesthetists. If patients
           meet all of the inclusion criteria: an unruptured aneurysms ≤5mm are enrolled and then
           followed up at 6 and12 months. Clinical observation, surgical clipping and endovascular
           coiling are the three treatment options for UIAs. In general, when an UIA is detected,
           it should be needed to quit smoking, to aggressively manage hypertension, and to control
           alcohol use. When an aggressive treatment is considered, treatment risks should be
           balanced against the risk of rupture.

    <description>All patients are treated under general anesthesia and systemic heparinization. A bolus of 50-75 IU/kg of heparin is given after femoral sheath placement, and intermittent boluses of 1250 IU per hour are given during the procedure. Activated clotting time is maintained at 2-3 times baseline level. Balloon-assisted coiling or stent-assisted coiling are considered in aneurysms with an unfavorable morphology (aneurysm neck≥ 4.0 mm or dome/neck ≤2.0). All anterior circulation aneurysms are clipped through a standard pterional or frontal temporal approach. The posterior circulation aneurysms are treated using far lateral approach depending on the aneurysm location.</description>
