        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male, aged 18-55 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 34.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive) at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any disorder which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety,
             evaluation of results, or compliance with the protocol

          -  Subjects, aged at least 40 years, with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic
             cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (as described in the American College of Cardiology and
             the American Heart Association Prevention Guideline) risk above or equal to 5%

          -  Male subjects who are not sexually abstinent or surgically sterilised (vasectomy) and
             are sexually active with female partner(s) who are not using a highly effective method
             of contraception (such as condom with spermicide) combined with a highly effective
             method of contraception for their non-pregnant female partner(s) (Pearl Index below
             1%, such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm or cervical cap+spermicide), and/or intend to donate sperm in the period
             from screening until 3 months following administration of the investigational medical
             product
