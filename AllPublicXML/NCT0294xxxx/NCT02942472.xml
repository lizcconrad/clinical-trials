      The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between the position of the tip of the
      inner catheter, the position of the air bubbles (at time , 5 min ,10 min )after embryo
      transfer and pregnancy rate outcome in ICSI cycles. Most IVF teams consider not touching the
      endometrium and the uterine fundus with replacement of the embryos in the lumen of the
      endometrial cavity the most important factors for successful embryo transfer, it is highly
      recommended to use agents that can facilitate a smooth embryo transfer and reduce unintended
      stimulation of the fundus, for example the application of soft-tipped catheters, which can
      improve pregnancy rate.

      The advantage of using the air and liquid content for catheter loading is to prevent the
      embryo from adhering to the wall of the catheter at the time of injection.The presence of two
      air bubbles on both sides of the medium that contains the embryo prevents the transfer of the
      embryo within the catheter and beside, in the transfer under ultrasonographic guidance, the
      air bubbles are often considered a marker for the embryo's position in the uterus.
