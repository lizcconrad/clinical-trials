      Assessment of lymphatic structure and function pre- and post- treatment and during recovery
      in head and neck cancer related lymphedema patients using NIR fluorescence lymphatic imaging:
      Response to ICD therapy in HNC Patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A non-randomized, non-blinded, single site pilot study designed to assess whether
      near-infrared fluorescence imaging can report on the efficacy of a pneumatic compression
      device to move lymph in head and neck cancer survivors with resulting head and neck
      lymphedema.
