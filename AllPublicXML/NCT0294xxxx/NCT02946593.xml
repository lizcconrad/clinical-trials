    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the feasibility of the program and data collection
      protocol to plan a multisite clinical trial. The program, &quot;Stroll Safe&quot;, an outdoor fall
      prevention program, will take place in the lab space of the New York University occupational
      therapy department and in the surrounding neighborhood.

      Twenty-four people who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled after informed consent.
      Recruitment will include follow up with people who expressed interest in the fall prevention
      program during a survey study conducted by the PI, and interested members of community-based
      programs for seniors who have agreed to be community partners for this study. Twelve
      participants will be assigned to the 7-week program and 12 will receive written information
      on outdoor fall prevention (control group).

      The topics addressed in the once a week, 7-week outdoor falls prevention program, for which a
      treatment manual has been developed, are based on the results of a survey conducted of
      community dwelling older adults that identified gaps in knowledge and use of prevention
      strategies, and the related literature. The program includes pre-set modules, however,
      participants will be able to voice individual concerns and problem-solve solutions during
      group discussions. Using an ecological perspective, the Health Belief Model, and problem
      solving theory as a guide, the intervention will include a didactic component, group problem
      solving, practical application of strategies, and self-advocacy regarding reporting problems
      to the city.

      Analysis will primarily focus on process measures.Post-intervention, semi-structures
      interviews will be conducted and analyzed to assess strengths/limitations of the program and
      participant's attribution of any behavioral changes to the intervention. Although statistical
      significant is not anticipated in this small feasibility study, repeated measures ANOVA will
      be used to examine changes in Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), Outdoor Falls
      Questionnaire (OFQ) and Falls Behavioral Scale for the Older Person (FaB) scores from pre to
      post-test for the treatment and control groups. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) will also be
      calculated. Change in number of stumbles, trips, slips, and falls before and after the
      program will also be analyzed.

      Data will be collected on falls self-efficacy and strategy use at study enrollment
      (Baseline), after completion of the 7 week program (1st Post-test), and at 2 months
      post-program completion (2nd Post-test). Participants will be asked to keep daily diaries of
      stumbles, trips, slips, and falls from the time they enroll in the study until two months
      following the completion of the program.

    <description>The structure of the program will model the evidenced-based Lifestyle Re-Design program (Clark et al., 2012). Session 1, 2, 4 &amp; 5 will include a brief didactic presentation about outdoor fall risks and strategy use from the group leader. This will be followed by group discussion/problem solving related to addressing risks. Identified strategies will be recorded on a wipe board and transcribed for group members in order to create handouts. Each 90 minute session will end with action planning, where participants will write down behavioral changes they will implement in the coming week. Session 3 and 6, also 90 minutes, will include outdoor mobility training and practice using strategies discussed in previous sessions. Training sessions will be led by the PI and an assistant. The final session will be a review of risks, strategy use, and reinforcement of behavioral changes in participant's action plans.</description>
