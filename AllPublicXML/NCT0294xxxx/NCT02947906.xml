      Fifty patients who were referred to receive physiotherapy and 20 healthy volunteers will be
      participants of the study.Participants with multiple sclerosis will evaluate with the
      following assessment tools: Modified Ashworth scale will use to evaluation of severity of
      plantar flexor spasticity. Plantar pressure distribution parameters will assess with dynamic
      pedobarography.

      Fifty patients who were referred to receive physiotherapy at the neurology department of
      Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation of the Faculty of Health Sciences of Hacettepe University,
      Ankara with multiple sclerosis and twenty voluntary healthy age matched participants will be
      the subjects of this study.

      Assessment tools described as following: Modified Ashworth scale will use to evaluate of
      severity of plantar flexor spasticity. Static and dynamic loading parameters will be evaluate
      with pedobarography.Maximum loading pressure -N/cm2, maximum loading time- ms for; 1st. and
      5th metatarsal head, medial and lateral heel and midfoot will be recorded both while the
      patients standing and walking.
