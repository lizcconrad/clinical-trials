      program &quot;gestational diabetes&quot; (multidisciplinary and multi-professional program) to see if
      they deem effective to limit the impact of gestational diabetes on pregnancy . Patients are
      questioned on the skills acquired in everyday life, the effective support in personal
      development, development of self-determination capabilities and communication with health
      professionals.

      This study must include all patients participating in the therapeutic education program for a
      year and meeting the inclusion criteria.
