  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to comprehensively establish the bio-similarity/bioequivalence in EPIAO®
      and EPREX® in terms of 52-week comparisons in efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. The
      targeted population is anaemia patients with end-stage chronic renal disease who previously
      received epoetin treatment and on haemodialysis.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group two arm study to establish
      the therapeutic equivalence, safety and tolerability of EPIAO® as compared to EPREX® in the
      treatment of CKD related anaemia in subjects who are on haemodialysis. A total of 264
      subjects will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment arm A will receive
      EPIAO® 1-3 times a week, intravenously for period of 52 weeks and treatment arm B will
      receive EPREX, 1-3 times a week, intravenously for period of 52 weeks.

    <description>Recombinant human erythropoietin falls under the pharmacological class of haematopoietic / anti anaemic agents. It has been developed for the treatment of anaemia in subjects with chronic kidney disease.
Erythropoietin, also known as EPO, is a glycoprotein hormone that controls erythropoiesis, or RBC production. It is a cytokine (protein signalling molecule) for erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow. Human EPO has a molecular weight of 34,000.</description>
