      To compare two intrauterine systems in order to avoid complications originating from short
      pregnancy interval and undesired pregnancies in the early postpartum period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients admitting to Zeynep Kamil Research and Training Hospital for caesarean delivery
      will be included in the study. There will be two computer based randomized groups. The
      investigators expect that both groups will have 100 cases. First group will be treated with
      conventional intrauterine devices (Cu T380 A) while the second group will be treated with
      frameless intrauterine devices (GyneFix). The participants will be informed about postpartum
      unplanned pregnancies and the complications of short pregnancy interval. Participants will
      also be informed about possible complications of having an intrauterine device and that there
      may be a possibility of failure.The participants who choose to participate in the study will
      be divided into two groups by computer based randomization and one of the systems will be
      applied. After the participants read and sign the informed consent form, the intrauterine
      device will be applied postplacental up to 10 minutes.
