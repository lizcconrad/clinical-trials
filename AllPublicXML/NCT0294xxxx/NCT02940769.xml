    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to observe/measure the circadian pattern of sleep, Cortisol
      and Melatonin in MDD subjects and Control subjects. We will also assess if controlled
      exposure to light in MDD subjects (post-partum females, non- post-partum females and males)
      will change these parameters using light glasses. In addition to the biological outcome
      measures (sleep, cortisol and melatonin) we will also monitor sleep and depressive symptoms
      in the research subjects for the duration of the protocol.

      In this study we will collect baseline hormone data and clinical data along with assessing
      light exposure using a Daysimeter in MDD participants and control subjects. We will collect
      baseline Daysimeter data for 5 days and then collect cortisol and melatonin levels in both
      MDD subjects and Control Subjects. Control subjects will complete the study following the
      sample collection. MDD participants will then have a light intervention (sham or active).

      Following the Daysimeter and hormone data collection, MDD subjects in each group will be
      randomly assigned into a non-treatment group or treatment group. While continuing to wear the
      Daysimeter, all MDD subjects will wear assigned glasses for 2 hours prior to bedtime. The
      subject will choose the bedtime hour and try and consistently wear the glasses at the same
      time throughout the study. Subjects will then wear the assigned glasses in the am upon waking
      for 1 hour. Following 7 days wearing the assigned glasses MDD subjects will repeat the sample
      collection for Cortisol and Melatonin
