  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out why patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have
      poor exercise capacity and to explore what causes an increase in blood pressure during
      exercise (i.e. increased adrenaline levels, or decreased ability of blood vessels to dilate).
      This study will also test whether or not regular exercise on a bicycle and/or treatment with
      6R-BH4 (Kuvan) pills improves these measures during exercise. 6R-BH4 is currently
      FDA-approved for use in patients with certain forms of a disease called phenylketonuria, but
      it is not currently FDA approved for blood pressure or exercise capacity in people with CKD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major problem addressed in this study is to understand mechanisms underlying poor
      exercise capacity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Prior research has found
      that CKD patients have an exaggerated increase in blood pressure during certain forms of
      exercise that could contribute to exercise dysfunction as well as cardiovascular disease.
      This study will test the mechanisms underlying this exaggerated blood pressure response, as
      well as the potential benefits of simple measures such as exercise training on a stationary
      bicycle, and treatment with 6R-BH4, a drug that is currently FDA-approved for the treatment
      of phenylketonuria, but has been shown to have beneficial effects on vascular health in
      patients with kidney disease.

      Prior to the intervention portion of this study, the researchers will measure how much the
      vein constricts in response to adrenaline in CKD patients versus controls. The study will
      also measure muscle pH, and muscle oxygenation during exercise in CKD patients and controls.

      The intervention portion of the study will test whether aerobic exercise training with and
      without 6R-BH4 might help muscle pH and adrenaline levels, vascular reactivity, muscle
      oxygenation, and the exaggerated blood pressure response during exercise in CKD patients.
      Participants will be randomized using a 2x2 factorial design to exercise training (ET) with
      6R-BH4, ET with placebo, stretching (control condition to exercise) with 6R-BH4, and
      stretching with placebo. Participants will undergo exercise training on a stationary bicycle,
      or stretching exercises, 3 times per week for 6-14 weeks (depending on availability of the
      participant).

    <description>Participants will exercise 3 times a week on a stationary ergometer. Exercise intensity will begin at low levels (50% of maximal heart rate reserve) calculated utilizing the Karvonen method. Briefly, target exercise heart rate (HR) is calculated by subtracting the persons age from 220. Resting heart rate is then subtracted from this number. The answer is then multiplied by the target percent (50% for example) and the product is added back to resting heart rate to provide the target exercise session heart rate. Intensity will be increased by 5% every week (as tolerated by the participant) to a maximum of 80% of maximal heart rate. Exercise time will progress from an initial 20 minutes per session to a maximum of 45 minutes by increasing 5 minutes each week.</description>

The Control group will come in for stretching sessions 3 times per week for 20-45 minutes.</description>
