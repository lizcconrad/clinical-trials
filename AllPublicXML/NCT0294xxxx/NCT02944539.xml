  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compelling epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations of mitochondrial DNA,
      including mutations and abnormal content of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are associated with
      the initiation and development of gastric cancer.The aim of this study was to explore
      association between mtDNA content in peripheral blood cells could be used as a risk predictor
      for gastric cancer.

    <description>The ratio of mitochondrial DNA contents to hemoglobin contents was calculated for each sample from standard curves. After that, the ratio for each sample was normalized to a calibrator DNA in order to standardize between different runs, and then defined as the measurement of relative mtDNA contents.Relative expression of mtDNA were measured in patients suffered from gastric cancer when compared with control group.</description>

      Mitochondria are responsible for multiple cellular functions including regulation of energy
      production, modulation of oxidation-reduction status, generation of reactive oxygen species
      and apoptosis. Each mitochondrion possesses multiple copies of a mitochondrial genome
      comprised of independently replicating double stranded DNA (mtDNA).

        A total of 300 eligible gastric cancer patients were anticipated to include in this study.
        Moreover, 300 healthy controls without previous cancer history were also recruited from
        individuals who visited investigator's hospital for physical examination during the same
        time period.
