  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collectively, evidence shows that a combination of medication and behavioral therapy is most
      effective for migraine care. The ED is a critical point of contact with the health care
      system for many migraine patients; in current practice, it is a missed opportunity to
      initiate and establish a comprehensive migraine management paradigm. Behavioral headache
      treatments (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT)) are effective migraine treatment options that are essentially free of side
      effects. PMR has also been successful as a technique that patients can do independently.
      Studies have shown that combination pharmacological-behavioral therapy is most effective for
      migraine treatment.

      Several aspects of this study are innovative, including: 1. Initiation of preventive
      medication in a timely manner for migraineurs who present to the ED. 2. Introduction of
      PM+PMR in the ED at a time that can serve as a teachable moment. 3. Introduction of a
      smartphone application-based product (a minimal contact based behavioral therapy) in the ED
      setting to reduce headache disability, frequency, and intensity.

      Investigators will conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of a comprehensive
      migraine treatment program on the quality of life for migraineurs with frequent and disabling
      headaches who present to the ED. The intervention (PM+PMR) will combine acute treatment,
      migraine preventive medication-topiramate, and the APP with PMR. Data from patients in the
      intervention group will be compared with data from an enhanced usual care (EUC) group to
      examine the efficacy of the combined treatment effects.

    <measure>Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) at 3 Months and Baseline</measure>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>

    <description>PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all scale items. A short 4 item scale can be made from questions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale.</description>

    <description>All subjects will be discharged on acute migraine therapy (naproxen, triptan) unless there is a contraindication and will also be started on topiramate (25mg/night) with a plan to increase the dose every week by 25 mg up to 100 mg/night. Subjects will receive medicine along with progressive muscle relaxation therapy</description>

    <description>Subjects will be given a general education session consisting of basic migraine information such as evidence-based ways to treat migraines: treat early, limit acute medications &lt; 2-3 days/week, and call the primary care physician (PCP) if abortive medications are used more frequently. Any migraine treatment decisions on discharge will be left up to the ED attending. The RC will load the APP onto the subjects' smart phones but the PMR component will be blocked on the version of the APP that they receive. All subjects will be asked to track headache frequency, intensity, and acute medication use on the APP.</description>
