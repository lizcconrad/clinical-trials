      Abstract

      Introduction

      Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can more than double the patient's chance of
      survival in Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). In Singapore, bystander CPR rate was low.
      Recent studies have proposed and validated the use of popular songs as aids in performing
      CPR. These songs may not be widely known when applied to a different population, and further,
      may lose popularity over time. &quot;Count on me Singapore&quot; (COMS) is believed to be known to over
      90% of the Singapore population. Pilot data indicated that CPR performed using COMS as a
      mental metronome (COMSCPR) can achieve guideline-compliant rate of chest compression with
      lower fatigue level than CPR guided by the conventional &quot;one-and-two-three-and&quot; (Standard
      CPR). The investigators hypothesize that COMSCPR is non-inferior to Standard CPR in achieving
      guideline-compliant rate of chest compression.

      Methodology

      The investigators planned a prospective, randomized, crossover non-inferiority trial
      comparing COMS CPR and Standard CPR. 80 eligible volunteers will be recruited from a
      convenience sample of camp personnel from a military training camp. After a 15 minutes
      familiarization session, they will be randomized into two groups (A and B). Group A will
      proceed to perform one cycle (two minutes) of Standard CPR, while group B will proceed to
      perform one cycle of COMS CPR. participants will cross over to perform one cycle of the other
      method of CPR. After completing this second cycle, a survey form will be administered. The
      Laerdal SkillReporter will be used to measure the CPR performed. After a 7-14 days interval,
      participants will be recalled to attend a test scenario. Statistical analysis will be used to
      compare the two arms.
