      Aims: This exploratory trial will:

        1. Explore the feasibility of a definitive/phase III RCT on clinical and cost-effectiveness
           of peer-befriending for people with aphasia post-stroke.

        2. Investigate psychological and social wellbeing outcomes of participants, significant
           others, and peer befrienders.

        3. Explore the feasibility of a full economic evaluation of usual care + peer befriending
           versus usual care control.

      Design: Single blind, mixed methods, parallel group phase II RCT comparing usual care +
      peer-befriending vs. usual care, starting at discharge from hospital. The study will deliver
      on four work packages: development phase; RCT; qualitative study; economic evaluation.
      Participants (n=60) will be assessed three times up to 10 months post-randomisation.

      Outcome measures: Feasibility: feasibility of recruitment to definitive trial (proportion
      screened who meet criteria; proportion who consent; rate of consent); participant,
      significant other, peer befriender views on acceptability of procedures (qualitative study);
      number of missing/incomplete data on outcome measures; attrition rate at follow-up; potential
      value of conducting main trial using value of information analysis (economic evaluation);
      description of usual care; treatment fidelity of peer-befriending. Patient-reported outcomes
      will include mood, wellbeing, communication and social participation.

      Benefits: Peer befriending may help avert some of the serious psychological consequences of
      stroke, and prevent the need for more complex and costly psychological therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Stroke and aphasia can have a profound impact on people's lives. Depression is a
      common sequel of stroke, with rates remaining high even one year after stroke at 33%. It is
      associated with worse rehabilitation outcomes, increased carer strain, increased healthcare
      utilisation, and higher mortality. A recent audit of clinical psychology services for people
      with mood problems post-stroke across 10 UK stroke services found that the most common
      outcome of mood assessment was monitoring and advice, with less than half of patients with
      low mood receiving psychological intervention. There is a pressing need to evaluate
      systematically interventions that aim to improve psychosocial wellbeing for people with
      stroke and aphasia.

      Aims: SUPERB trial aims to evaluate the feasibility of a phase III trial on the clinical and
      cost-effectiveness of a stepped care model level 1 intervention, peer befriending, for people
      with aphasia. Specifically it will:

        1. Explore the feasibility of a definitive phase III randomised control trial (RCT) based
           on a) feasibility of recruitment and retention to the trial, b) acceptability of
           research procedures and outcome measures, c) acceptability of usual care + peer
           befriending vs. usual care control to participants, their significant others and peer
           support workers, d) documentation of usual care, e) treatment fidelity of peer
           befriending.

        2. Explore psychological and social well-being outcomes as outcomes in a definitive trial
           for a) people with aphasia receiving usual care + peer befriending versus usual care
           control, b) their significant others, and c) peer befrienders.

        3. Explore the feasibility of a full economic evaluation of usual care + peer befriending
           versus usual care control in a phase III RCT.

      Intervention to be tested: The intervention group will receive peer befriending from stroke
      survivors with long-term aphasia who will be trained as peer befrienders. They will visit
      participants who have had a stroke more recently 6 times over a period of 3 months. An
      further 2 visits within the next 6 months will also be offered for a gradual transition to
      the end of the peer befriending. The schedule and nature of visits will be agreed between the
      pair at their first meeting. This meeting will also identify possible goals for the
      intervention e.g. to offer conversation, help with problem solving and social activities.

      Methods: The overall study will last 3½ years and comprise a development phase (year 1) and a
      phase II RCT (years 2-3). The development phase will inform the intervention manual, the
      choice of outcome measures, fidelity practices and topic guides for participant interviews.
      This phase will be informed through a series of six workshops attended by six people with
      aphasia with experience of peer befriending. This will be followed by a pilot of the
      intervention, fidelity checking and all associated processes with 8 participants comparing
      usual care (n=4) with usual care + peer befriending (n=4).

      The phase II RCT will be a single blind, mixed methods, parallel group design comparing usual
      care (n=30) with usual care + peer befriending (n=30) for people with aphasia post-stroke and
      low levels of psychological problems. Assessments and outcome measures for participants and
      significant others will be administered before randomisation with outcome measures
      re-administered at 4 and 10 months post-randomisation. Peer befrienders will complete outcome
      measures before training and after they have completed the visits for two participants. In
      addition, this RCT will include a qualitative study and a feasibility economic evaluation.
      The qualitative study will use semi-structured interviews of purposively sampled participants
      (n=20) and significant others (n=10) from both arms of the trial, and peer befrienders. The
      feasibility economic evaluation will utilise the EQ-5D and a stroke-adapted version of the
      CSRI.

      Outcomes: RCT: feasibility of recruitment of participants to definitive trial (including
      proportion screened who meet criteria; proportion who consent; rate of consent); number of
      missing/incomplete data on outcome measures; attrition rate at follow-up; potential value of
      conducting main trial using value of information analysis (economic evaluation); description
      of usual care; treatment fidelity of peer befriending. Patient-reported outcomes will include
      mood, wellbeing, communication and social participation. Qualitative study: participant,
      significant other, peer befriender views on acceptability of procedures and experiences of
      care received. Economic evaluation: cost outcomes, average costs, costs per participant and
      mean difference between trial arms, description of resources used and overall cost
      effectiveness.

      Benefits: This study will inform on whether peer befriending is a suitable intervention to
      explore further, in terms of averting some of the serious psychological consequences of
      stroke, and preventing the need for more complex and costly psychological therapies.

    <description>The experimental group will receive usual care + peer befriending. Peer befriending aims to utilise the skills and 'lived experience' of people with longer-term aphasia to offer support to others with aphasia, starting at a time of transition (discharge from hospital and withdrawal of intensive therapeutic input) and increased need. It aims to help people develop their own strategies for adjusting to life post-stroke. Peer-befrienders will visit participants 6 times over a period of 3 months (+2 times within the next 6 months). The schedule, nature of visits, and goals (e.g. discuss concerns; pursue activities) will be agreed between the pair. Visits may include: conversation, problem solving, trips out, joint activities.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants with aphasia:

          -  Over 18;

          -  Fluent premorbid users of English (confirmed by relative or self report);

          -  Presence of aphasia due to stroke; and

          -  Low levels of emotional distress (score of ≤2 on Depression Intensity Scale Circles).
             The latter will ensure that they do not require immediate level 2 or 3 psychological
             input. People who score 2 (which is also the median on DISCS) and who the MDT deems do
             not need stepping up or stepping up is not available, will still be eligible to take
             part.

        Significant Others: each participant with aphasia will nominate one significant other, who
        is their closest confidant and who is over 18 years of age. If participants live alone
        their significant other should be someone that they see at least once a week.

        Peer befrienders: will be people with mild-moderate aphasia (score score a minimum 5/10 for
        auditory comprehension and 5/10 for verbal expression in the Frenchay Aphasia Screening
        Test) who are over 18 years of age, are at least one year post-stroke

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be excluded if they have:

          -  Other diagnoses affecting cognition or mental health (based on medical records for
             participants with aphasia and self-report for significant others and peer befrienders,
             as well as the GHQ-12 as a depression screen for peer befrienders: will be excluded if
             they score 3 or more);

          -  Severe uncorrected visual or hearing problems (based on medical records for
             participants with aphasia and self-report for significant others and peer
             befrienders);

          -  Severe or potentially terminal co-morbidities, on grounds of frailty (based on medical
             records for participants with aphasia and self-report for significant others and peer
             befrienders).

        Participants with aphasia will also be excluded if they are:

        • Discharged to a geographical location outside the borough of the recruiting hospital.
