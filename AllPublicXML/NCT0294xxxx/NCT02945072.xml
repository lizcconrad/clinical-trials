      The aim of this study is to investigate long-lasting or later behavioral changes in children
      in the context of different anesthesia techniques (Inhalation anesthesia vs. TIVA)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The process of surgery and anaesthesia can be an extremely frightening and stressful event
      for a child, and is frequently followed by negative postoperative behavioural changes. This
      Event could be associated with poor postoperative outcome and long term behavior problems
      like anxiety, eating or sleeping disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate
      long-lasting or later behavioral changes in children in the context of different anesthesia
      techniques (Inhalation anesthesia vs. TIVA). After anesthesia initiation, anesthesia
      maintenance should be done with sevoflurane or Tiva. The effect of behavioral changes in
      children in the context of anesthesia techniques should be evaluate by post hospitalisation
      behavior and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at first, second and fourth week. Early
      postoperative problems like postoperative nausea and vomiting, pain level, pain therapy and
      postoperative awareness should be evaluate too.
