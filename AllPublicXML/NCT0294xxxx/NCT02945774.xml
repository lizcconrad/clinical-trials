  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroinflammation is increasingly implicated as a potential critical pathogenic mechanism in
      a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. This study will use hybrid PET/MRI imaging
      to evaluate neuroinflammation and its relationship to cerebral perfusion in frontotemporal
      dementia (FTD). Patients with FTD will be recruited from the Cognitive Neurology and Aging
      Brain clinics at Parkwood Institute and will undergo neurocognitive assessment and MRI/PET
      using the PET ligand FEPPA which binds to activated microglia, a marker of neuroinflammation.
      Correlations will be conducted to determine whether abnormal neuroinflammation is present in
      Frontotemporal dementia and whether differential patterns of neuroinflammation are present in
      different FTD clinical and molecular subtypes, and to determine the relationship between
      neuroinflammation, cerebral perfusion using arterial spin labeling MRI imaging techniques,
      and indices of brain structure including volumetric and white matter analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with a probable Frontotemporal Dementia or neurologically healthy
             control participants with no history of neurological problems

          2. Study partner is available who has frequent contact with the subject and can accompany
             the subject to all clinic visits for the duration of the protocol.

          3. Visual and auditory acuity adequate for neuropsychological testing

          4. Good general health with no diseases expected to interfere with the study.

          5. Subject is not pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential (i.e. women must be
             two years post-menopausal, surgically sterile or practicing an effictive form of
             family planning

          6. Willing to participate in a longitudinal imaging study at 12 months.

          7. Willing to undergo MRI (3Tesla)/ PET scan (with FEPPA ligand) and no medical
             contraindications to MRI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant neurologic disease other than suspected Frontotemporal Dementia that
             would better account for symptoms (i.e. frontal lobe stroke).

          2. Screening/baseline MRI scans with evidence of infection, infarction, or other focal
             lesions. Subjects with multiple lacunes are excluded.

          3. Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, metal
             fragments or foreign objects in the eyes, skin or body that may preclude MRI
             participation as per MRI screening form.

          4. Major depression, bipolar disorder as described in DSM-IV within the past 1 year.
             Psychotic features, agitation or behavioral problems within the last 3 months which
             could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol.

          5. History of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria).

          6. Any significant systemic illness or unstable medical condition which could lead to
             difficulty complying with the protocol.

          7. Clinically significant abnormalities in B12, or thyroid function tests that might
             interfere with the study.

          8. Investigational agents are prohibited one month prior to entry and for the duration of
             the trial.

          9. Exclusion for FEPPA: Current or recent participation in any procedures involving
             radioactive agents such that the total radiation dose exposure to the subject in any
             given year would exceed the limits of annual and total dose commitment set forth. The
             current regulation for radiation dose to patient volunteers and health control
             volunteers are contained within Health Canada's recently amended (June 19, 2012)
             Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Positron-emitting
             Radiopharmaceuticals). Limitations for effective total body dose is 50 mSv (C.03.305
             (c)) which has been increased from the previous values of 20 mSv (Table 1 in
             INFO-0491).

         10. Exclusion Criteria for controls undergoing arterial line placement: Absent pulse,
             Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease), Burns over the cannulation site,
             Inadequate circulation to the extremity, Raynaud syndrome, Anticoagulation therapy,
             Atherosclerosis of upper extremity vessels, Coagulopathy, inadequate collateral flow,
             Infection at the cannulation site, Previous surgery in the area, Synthetic vascular
             graft.
