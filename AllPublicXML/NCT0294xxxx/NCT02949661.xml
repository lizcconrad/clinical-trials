  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal resection and reconstruction (TRR) is the treatment of choice for most patients with
      tracheal stenosis or tracheal tumors .The postintubation tracheal stenosis is the common
      indication for (TRR).The immediate postoperative period can be anxiety provoking for some
      reasons such as requirement to maintain a flexed neck, oxygen mask, and surgical pain which
      inadequately treated.

      Bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) is a popular regional anesthesia
      technique for its feasibility and efficacy. The use of regional anesthesia in combination
      with general anesthesia may lighten the level of general anesthesia required , provide
      prolonged postoperative analgesia and reduce the requirements for opioid analgesics

      Local anesthetic infiltration into the surgical incision can relieve pain at the wound site
      after surgery, as part of multimodal analgesic approach.

      Levobupivacaine, is &quot;S&quot;-enantiomer of bupivacaine, has strongly emerged as a safer
      alternative for regional anesthesia than bupivacaine . Levobupivacaine has been found to be
      equally efficacious as bupivacaine, but with a superior pharmacokinetic profile. Clinically,
      levobupivacaine has been observed to be well tolerated in regional anesthesia techniques both
      after bolus administration and continuous post-operative infusion.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the intra- and postoperative efficacy of local wound
      infiltration versus bilateral superficial cervical plexus block with levobupivacaine for
      upper tracheal resection and reconstruction surgery.
