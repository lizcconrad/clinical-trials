  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot evaluation of 'Stick To It', a behavioral intervention based on the
      concept of gamification. The objective of the program is to encourage young men who have sex
      with men (MSM) to be regularly screened for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
      and to adopt safer sexual behaviors, with the ultimate goal to decrease HIV and STI
      incidence. Gamification is the application of game elements, like points, badges, and
      rewards, to non-game settings.

      The investigators will conduct a quasi-experimental pilot study of 'Stick To It', a
      prevention intervention that uses gamification principles and mechanics. The intervention
      includes an online timer that reminds men to get tested, online quizzes, and peer
      recruitment; these activities are awarded with points redeemable for chances at prizes at
      participating clinics. The intervention was designed based on findings from interviews with
      health staff and focus groups with young MSM, and with input from a gamification consultant.
      The primary hypothesis is that the intervention will increase repeat HIV/STI testing among
      young MSM. The intervention will be implemented at two STI clinics in Oakland and Los
      Angeles, California in 2-week intervals for six months. The investigators will review medical
      records of exposed and unexposed young MSM attending the same STI clinics to compare uptake
      of quarterly HIV testing and self-reported behavior after six months.

    <description>The intervention is a prize system linked to points earned through online and real-world activities designed to incentivize young MSM to test for HIV and STIs every three months. Participants receive points for pre-determined activities, such as: answering online quizzes, inviting friends to participate, and getting tested for HIV/STIs. Points are redeemable in person at two AIDS Healthcare Foundation Men's Wellness Centers, where participants will be able to exchange their points for gumballs from a gumball machine; different color combinations of gumballs correspond to prizes of different values. Participants are reminded to get tested regularly via SMS messages; in addition, they can check when their next test is due by checking their testing timer on the stick2it.org website.</description>
