      This study is a phase IV, open-label, single arm, multicentre study whose aim is to assess
      whether interferon-free and ribavirin-free Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) Hepatitis C Virus
      (HCV) therapy with grazoprevir/elbasvir, will be feasible for the treatment of People who
      inject drugs (PWID) with recent injecting drug use and chronic HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection.

      A prospective, observational cohort design will be used to enrol patients attending tertiary,
      drug and alcohol and primary health care services in Sydney, Australia.

      The study consists of a treatment phase (12 weeks) and a follow-up phase (up to 3 years)
      where participants will be followed every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months in
      years 2-3 to evaluate treatment response and reinfection.

      The effectiveness of the treatment will be assessed by looking at the proportion of patients
      with undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks post end of treatment (SVR12) following therapy with
      grazoprevir/elbasvir and evaluate demographic and clinical predictors of non-response.
