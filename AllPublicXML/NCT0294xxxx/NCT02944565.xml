    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well daratumumab works in treating
      patients with multiple myeloma when the infusion is accelerated. Monoclonal antibodies, such
      as daratumumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of decreasing the infusion time of daratumumab in
      patients that have already received 2+ doses of daratumumab and are continuing on
      daratumumab.

      II. Estimate the time savings versus (vs) predicted infusion time.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 1.5 hours. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have received &gt;= 2 daratumumab infusions and be scheduled to receive
             another dose

          -  All races and ethnic groups are eligible for this study

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by
             the principal investigator to likely interfere with a patient's ability to sign
             informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the results

          -  Concurrent use of complementary or alternative medicines that in the opinion of the
             principal investigator would confound the interpretation of toxicities and/or
