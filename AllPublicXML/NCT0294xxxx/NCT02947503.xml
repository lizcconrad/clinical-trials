  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One approach to prevent the rising burden of diabetes is to address the issue of gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM has a growing prevalence up to 5-10% (and even higher in
      specific subgroups), with a pregnant population becoming older and more obese worldwide. GDM
      increases the risks of complications during pregnancy, at delivery and on the longer term,
      like type 2 diabetes (T2D) and persistent obesity, in mother and child. Moreover, insulin
      added to diet as the standard care for GDM has disadvantages for mother (maintenance of
      hyperinsulinaemia, increasing weight and blood pressure) and child (macrosomia,
      hypoglycaemia) with related adverse pregnancy outcomes. Metformin, as an insulin sensitizer
      targeting the cause of GDM, may have essential benefits, as suggested by observational
      studies. However, RCTs with metformin (early positioned in the treatment of GDM) are still
      lacking. The POEM study is the first Randomized controlled trial (RCT) in GDM to test the
      hypothesis that metformin, early given from the start of the diagnosis GDM, on top of diet
      and lifestyle improves clinically relevant pregnancy outcomes in mother and child during
      pregnancy, at delivery and on the longer term - up to 20 years after birth.

      The POEM study was designed to investigate the effects of metformin on top of diet and
      lifestyle (with insulin rescue if needed) in GDM on eight clinically relevant pregnancy
      outcomes at delivery, summarized by means of an integrated, newly developed score, the GDM
      Outcome Score (GOS), and on other relevant outcomes on the longer term in mother and child.
      The investigators hypothesize that metformin given to women with GDM from the start of the
      diagnosis reduces risks resulting in relevant health benefits for mother and child during
      pregnancy, at delivery, and many years thereafter.

      The POEM study is a randomized controlled intervention study, consisting of three phases:

        -  Phase A - from inclusion until two weeks after delivery; intervention study with and
           without exposure of metformin in mother and (unborn) child: two arms after randomization
           with 1:1 allocation to Diet + Lifestyle + Metformin (DLM) or Diet + Lifestyle (DL);

        -  Phase B - from two weeks until 1 year after delivery; intervention study with exposure
           of DLM vs DL in mother;

        -  Phase C - from 1 until 20 years after delivery; observational extension study of mother
           and child without study medication.
