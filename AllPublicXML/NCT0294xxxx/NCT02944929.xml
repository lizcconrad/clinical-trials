  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of a self-rehabilitation program to repeated Botulinum Toxin Injections (BTI)
      and usual physiotherapy should increase the proportion of patients who attain their Primary
      Treatment Goal (impairments and function) more than usual care (involving repeated Botulinum
      Toxin Injections and conventional physiotherapy), in post stroke out-patients with
      spasticity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects 150 000 persons in France each year. Most patients have activity limitations
      because of the resulting motor deficit and spasticity. Autonomy in activities of daily living
      is reduced.

      The principal treatment for focal spasticity is currently intramuscular botulinum toxin
      injection (BTI).

      BTI is classically combined with only 2 to 3 sessions of out-patient physiotherapy per week.
      This is mainly because of a lack of out-patient therapists. However, this amount of therapy
      is insufficient and does not follow current literature which shows that the intensity of
      physiotherapy affects the recovery of impairment and activity. This gap in our health system
      could be filled by a self-rehabilitation program in addition to physiotherapy.

      Recent studies have shown that self-rehabilitation following BTI could significantly improve
      activity limitation (Roche et al, 2014 ; Sun et al 2010).

      The addition of a self-rehabilitation program to BTI and usual out-patient physiotherapy
      could thus increase the effects of BTI on impairment and activity limitation in patients with
      spastic hemiparesis following stroke.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females aged between 18 to 75 years.

          2. Adult patient under guardianship with consent obtained and the legal guardian's
             authorisation obtained.

          3. Single stroke having occurred more than 6 months before (previous TIA is accepted).

          4. Capable of understanding instructions and participating in the definition of a
             therapeutic goal (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) &lt; 3).

          5. Having previously undergone BTI. The last injection must have been performed at least
             4 months prior to inclusion.

          6. Affiliation to the French social security regime or a similar regime.

          7. Patient (or the legal guardian if under guardian adult patient) has signed the
             informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are unwilling to participate in the study. For the one under
             guardianship, the refusal of the patient will be the final decision even if the
             guardian is willing to participate.

          2. Subjects who are unlikely to adhere to the study an/or poor adherence anticipated by
             the investigator.

          3. Un-controlled progressive pathology.

          4. Osteoarticular lesion which contraindicates part of the rehabilitation involved in the
             study.

          5. Patients with other interventions planned prior to the end of the study period
             (orthosis, surgery etc.).

          6. Surgery to the treated limb less than 6 months previously.

          7. Pregnant woman.
