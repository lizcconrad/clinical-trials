      Evaluation of safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside compared to iron sucrose in subjects
      suffering from IDA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IDA is highly prevalent in subjects with cancer and gastrointestinal diseases such as
      inflammatory bowel diseases, menstruating or pregnant women, and subjects who have undergone
      bariatric procedure. IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on
      the subjects, and treatment of these subjects includes controlling the bleeding and
      replenishing lost iron.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside compared to
      iron sucrose in subjects suffering from IDA. In a subfraction of 35 subjects treated with
      iron isomaltoside ECG and iron will be measured frequently
