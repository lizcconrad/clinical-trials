    <description>Prospective open label, non-comparative, multicentre exploratory study. Divided in 2 parts Part1: Inecalcitol treatment will be added to imatinib for 12 months. Part 2: Follow-up after discontinuation of inecalcitol. Imatinib will be maintained for 2 years and then will be stopped for those still in MR4.5. These patients will then be followed for 2 additional years after discontinuation of imatinib.</description>
