  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most treatment-seeking smokers will fail in their attempts to quit smoking in the early days
      and weeks of quitting. Poor sleep (e.g., short duration) is an overlooked, but important
      nicotine withdrawal symptom that can affect up to 80% of treatment seeking smokers and
      predicts relapse. Addressing sleep deficits could promote cessation, particularly in smokers
      who may be vulnerable to poor sleep in one or more sleep metrics even before quitting. This
      study will address this conceptual and empirical gap by conducting a 15-week proof-of-concept
      study to determine whether standard smoking cessation treatment can be optimized with a
      multi-metric sleep advancement counseling intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the impact and efficacy
      of a sleep advancement counseling (SAC) protocol in response to standard nicotine dependence
      treatment (behavioral counseling + varenicline) in a sample of 90 treatment seeking smokers
      from the greater Newark city/Newcastle county area. Following eligibility assessment, which
      include an overnight polysomnography (sleep study), 90 eligible and consenting
      treatment-seeking smokers will be randomized to either the experimental smoking cessation +
      SAC (N=60), or the control, smoking cessation + general health education (GHE) alone (N=30)
      condition. Participants will complete six in-person counseling sessions over a 15-week
      treatment period (wks 1, 3, 4,7,11,15) As part of the smoking cessation treatment protocol,
      eligible participants will receive 12 weeks of FDA-approved smoking cessation medication,
      Varenicline, during week 3-15. An end of treatment (week 15) and a 12-week follow-up (week
      27) assessment will be conducted in-person to allow for the objective assessment of smoking
      status and cardiovascular markers.

    <description>Participants will receive a 15-week intervention targeting smoking cessation and sleep counseling intervention.
Smoking Cessation intervention components include:
6 individual smoking cessation sessions over 15 weeks (week 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 15)
12 weeks of the quit-smoking drug chantix. The standard dosing will be used - 0.5 mg once per day for days 1-3, 0.5my twice per day for days 4-7; and 1mg twice per day from week 3 until the end of treatment.
Sleep counseling components in the form of CBT for insomnia will be given as part of the smoking cessation counseling.</description>
