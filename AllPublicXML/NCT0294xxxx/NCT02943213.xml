  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cycle Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Cycle) is developing an oral tablet formulation of Chlorpromazine
      Hydrochloride and intends to conduct bioequivalence trials to demonstrate its similarity to
      the RLD.

      The aim of this pilot study is to investigate intrasubject variability in the bioavailability
      of Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride 25 mg sugar coated tablets.

      Cycle aims to demonstrate that Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride has a shallow dose response curve
      and a wide safety margin. This will then allow for the modification of bioequivalence
      acceptance criteria in future pivotal studies which will reduce the number of participants
      required whilst still maintaining assurance of safety and efficacy.

      Pilot Subjects (n): 20 Periods: 2 (2xR) Dosing: Single-dose Strength: 25 mg Test Product: N/A
      Reference: USL PHARMA Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride Analytes (in plasma): Chlorpromazine;
      7-Hydroxychlorpromazine Bioequivalence based on 90% CI (Cmax, AUC): Standard; 80.00 - 125.00%

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-dose, open-label, two-period replicate pilot study with orally
      administered chlorpromazine hydrochloride 25 mg (sugar coated tablets) conducted under
      fasting conditions in at least 16 healthy male and female subjects at a single study center.

      Up to 20 eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study with 16 evaluable subjects to
      complete the study.

      Analytes to be measured will be Chlorpromazine and 7-hydroxy-Chlorpromazine (free) as
      stipulated by FDA Guidance for assessment of bioequivalence for Chlorpromazine.

                  hysterectomy, amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months and considered post-menopausal, Note: In
                  postmenopausal women, the value of the serum pregnancy test may be slightly
                  increased. This test will be repeated to confirm the results. If there is no

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of psychiatric disorder, antagonistic personality, poor motivation, emotional
             or intellectual problems likely to limit the validity of consent to participate in the
             study or limit the ability to comply with protocol requirements.

          2. Current alcohol use &gt; 21 units of alcohol per week for males and &gt; 14 units of alcohol
             per week for females.

             In this study the concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives is NOT allowed.

          6. Participation in another study with an experimental drug, where the last
             administration of the previous IMP was within 8 weeks (or within 10 elimination
             half-lives for chemical entities or 2 elimination half-lives for antibodies or
             insulin), whichever is the longer) before administration of IMP in this study, at the
             discretion of the investigator.

          7. Treatment within the previous 3 months before the first administration of IMP with any
             drug with a well-defined potential for adversely affecting a major organ or system.

          8. A major illness during the 3 months before commencement of the screening period.

         19. Donation or loss of blood equal to or exceeding 500 mL during the 8 weeks before the
             first administration of IMP.

         20. Diagnosis of hypotension made during the screening period.

         21. Diagnosis of hypertension made during the screening period or current diagnosis of
             hypertension.
