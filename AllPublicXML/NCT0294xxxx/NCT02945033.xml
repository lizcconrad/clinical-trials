  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four retrospective studies were recently published on efficacy of aspirin in patients with
      surgically resected colon cancer. Two of these studies strongly suggested that aspirin used
      in low doses (100 mg/d) after surgical resection of colorectal cancer with PI3K mutation
      could act as a targeted therapy with a major protective effect on the risk of recurrence. The
      other two studies did not confirm the benefit of aspirin in this situation. These four
      retrospective studies provide an insufficient level of evidence to demonstrate the benefit of
      low-dose aspirin as adjuvant to surgery for colorectal cancer. Therefore, it is necessary as
      recommended in the conclusion of these studies and meta-analyses to perform a randomised
      prospective study to validate these data.
