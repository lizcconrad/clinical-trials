      The study adopted the superiority design of multi center, randomized, double-blind, positive
      control drug, dose finding, using two simulation skills. The qualified subjects, according to
      the ratio of 1:1:1, were randomized into low dose group, high dose group and positive drug
      control group, and received a treatment course of 4-8 weeks, all individuals were followed up
      for 4 weeks after drug withdrawal.

      Explore the safety and efficacy of different doses of bicyclol in treatment of acute
      drug-induced liver injury using polyene phosphatidylcholine capsule as the positive control
      drug.
