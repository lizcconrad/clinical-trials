      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of nimotuzumab when giving
      together with nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nimotuzumab and nivolumab, may
      block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nimotuzumab followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and nimotuzumab IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
