  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that alternating DBS parameters on
      a weekly basis will prevent tolerance to stimulation and thus waning of benefit, compared
      with non-alternating stimulation. The primary endpoint will be preserved tremor control with
      the alternating group compared with standard treatment using the Tremor Research Group
      Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS). Key secondary endpoints will be preserved
      activities of daily living measures as well as preserved tremor control as quantified by
      motion sensor data.

      This study has one primary aim: To determine if alternating DBS stimulation parameters on a
      weekly basis will be superior at preserving tremor control compared with usual stimulation
      (non-alternating stimulation) in ET patients with VIM DBS.

    <description>Two different, but equally efficacious, settings will be determined for each subject. The settings will differ by a minimum of two of the following parameters: electrode configuration, voltage, frequency and pulse width. The different settings will be named Setting A and Setting B. The treatment cohort will receive both Setting A and Setting B that will differ by the parameters listed above.</description>
