  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lucerastat and
      to determine its pharmacokinetic profile after multiple dosing. Also, the potential effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of lucerastat was explored following a single dose of 500 mg.

      The subjects were to be enrolled sequentially to three dose groups, starting with the lowest
      dose level. Subjects could participate in only one Group. Progression to an increased dose of
      lucerastat was permitted only after review of all data from the previous cohort suggested
      that it was safe to do so.
