      Subjects will be scanned on the QT Ultrasound Breast Scanner. For subjects that may have
      breast calcifications and/or mass(es) and/or other finding(s) on the QT scan image(s),
      standard imaging modalities (e.g., mammogram and HHUS) will be performed per ACR
      recommendations.

      If available, subjects may provide copies of their breast imaging exams and related reports.

      Demographics and medical history will be collected.
