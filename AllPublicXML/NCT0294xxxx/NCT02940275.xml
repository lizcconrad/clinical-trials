      This is an observational clinical study, patients with systemic diseases will be enrolled
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will received the examination of
      sublingual microcirculation by using incident dark field video microscope (Cytocam，Braedius
      Battery Powered Transilluminator). The microcirculation data includes total small vessel
      density, perfused small vessel density, microvascular flow index, and heterogeneity index.
      The patients will be divided into right groups according to their systemic diseases as
      follows: group 1 hypertension (60 patients), group 2 diabetes mellitus (60), group 3
      hypertension and diabetes mellitus (60), group 4 end stage renal disease with hemodialysis
      (60), group 5 kidney transplant recipients (60), group 6 coronary artery disease (60), and
      group 7 peripheral arterial occlusive disease (60).
