  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) is one of the most common complications
      resulting from administration of parenteral nutrition in neonates. Excess intravenous intake
      of vegetable oil-based lipid emulsions containing phytosterols is felt to be a major
      contributing factor. To date, no information is available on plasma phytosterols half-lives
      in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants with PNAC. In a prospective cohort study,
      plasma phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol and sitosterol) of VLBW preterm infants with
      PNAC will be measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) during PN
      administration and also after the stop of intravenous lipid infusion. Plasma phytosterols
      half-lives will be calculated from the monoexponential decay curves. Blood samples will be
      weekly collected from 1st to 12th week of life during routine metabolic tolerance analysis or
      gas-analysis in order to avoid burden of additional phlebotomy. Samples will be collected in
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-tubes and immediately centrifugated. Plasma will be stored in
      pyrogallol added-tubes at -20°C until analysis. Saponification reaction will be done using
      5-alpha-cholestane as internal standard.

    <time_frame>7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77 and 84 days</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma campesterol, stigmasterol and sitosterol concentrations will be measured at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77 and 84 days from PN started. Plasma phytosterol concentrations will be measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Calibration curves will be used to calculate the phytosterol plasma concentrations (mg/L).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver dysfunction in preterm infants will be defined by conjugated bilirubin values from blood samples over 1 mg/dl</measure>
    <time_frame>Routinely checked at 7 and 42 days of life. Additional measure of conjugated bilirubin will be performed after 15 days if the value continues to be higher than 1 mg/dl.</time_frame>
    <description>Eligibility of preterm infants will be related to liver function. Conjugated bilirubin value from blood sample is a good sign of hepatic function. The threshold value was defined to 1 mg/dl. Just preterm infants who will have conjugated bilirubin values more of 1 mg/dl will be included in the study. Conjugated bilirubin will be measured at 7 and 42 days of life on routine care. When the conjugated bilirubin value will be higher than 1 mg/dl, the analysis will be repeated every 15 days until it returns under the threshold value (1 mg/dl). Parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis will be only diagnosed in patients with pathological values of conjugated bilirubin (over 1 mg/dl) during vegetable oil-lipid infusion.</description>

    <measure>Plasma phytosterols half-lives</measure>
    <time_frame>We will able to measure the plasma phytosterol half-lives (days) after the analysis of 3 or more blood samples collected from the stop of lipid infusion to 84 days of life</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma phytosterol half-lives (days) will be measured using 3 or more plasma phytosterol concentrations calculated after only lipid stopping. Half-life of plasma phytosterols will be calculated from monoexponential decay curves.</description>
