  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chemo-radiotherapy for the local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients will induce
      the mucosal ulcer and damage salivary glands. Consequently, it can disturb the nutrition
      conditions and clinical outcomes of patients. This research tries to evaluate the nutrition
      status at the baseline, before and after radiotherapy, during the follow-up by the body mass
      index, hematological indexes, immunological indexes, and nutrition questionnaires including
      PG-SGA and NRS 2002. Through the evaluation of two different nutritional interventions, the
      investigators aim to find an optimized assessment model and the best nutrition support
      patterns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All nasopharyngeal patients received radical treatment including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
      and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. At the beginning, the investigators assign patient to
      experimental and control groups randomly. Patients in experimental group received standard
      nutritional support by adding NUTRISON. Control patients will give conventional nutritional
      guidance. The investigators collected all the nutritional indexed at first visit, before and
      after radiotherapy, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after radiotherapy. All these data will be set into
      statistical software to produce an optimized model for clinical practice.
