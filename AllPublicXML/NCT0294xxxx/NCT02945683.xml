  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial,
      whether a new food supplement containing Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and vitamin D3
      (ReuterinÂ® D3) may improve the SCORAD in pediatric patients with mild to moderate atopic
      dermatitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that childhood allergy development can be linked to an imbalance of
      the intestinal microbiota. The probiotic bacteria, which contribute to the balance of the
      intestinal microflora, may play a key role in the modulation of the immune response, looking
      as a potential resource in the prevention or treatment of allergic disorders.

      In this study the investigators will recruit pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis of
      mild-to-moderate degree, for which the standard treatment consists in using an emollient
      cream and topical steroids in case of exacerbation.

      The investigators assume that participants can receive significant benefits from the addition
      to their standard treatment of a food supplement containing L. reuteri DSM 17938 and vitamin
      D3, which, thanks to their beneficial effects on intestinal microbiota and on modulation of
      the immune response, may compensate for the inadequate capacity of these patients to produce
      antimicrobial peptides in response to cutaneous aggressions, improving, therefore, the
      severity of the disease.

      88 children of both sexes, between 1 and 4 years old, with a SCORAD of 25-50 will be selected
      as a part of routine outpatient visits at the Pediatric Allergy Department of the University
      Hospital of Verona.

      The study product (active or placebo) will be administered for 3 months, with a follow-up
      period of further 3 months. From all participants, at time 0 and after 3 months, blood and
      stool samples will be collected for the analysis of vitamin D and cathelicidin levels and for
      the analysis of microflora respectively.
