  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well targeted therapy works in treating patients with
      incurable non-small cell lung cancer with a genetic mutation. Giving drugs that target other
      genetic mutations or other specific proteins may work better when a patient has cancer caused
      by a driver mutation and the treatment that targets that mutation stops working.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate among patients with high PD-L1 expressing cancers
      after failure of targeted therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the overall survival for patients receiving treatment targeting primary
      mutations, secondary mutations, or immunotherapy at the time of progression on tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor therapy.

      II. To assess the incidence of secondary mutations in this population according to smoking
      status.

      III. To evaluate the response rates of patients treated using these different approaches.

      IV. To correlate outcomes with specific secondary genetic changes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I (PD-L1 &gt;= 50%): Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2
      weeks or pembrolizumab IV every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II (PD-L1 &lt; 50% without secondary oncogenic driver): Patients receive tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor therapy orally (PO) targeting the initial oncogenic driver or other treatment for
      about 3 weeks.

      ARM III (PD-L1 &lt; 50% with secondary oncogenic driver): Patients receive tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor therapy PO targeting initial oncogenic driver, a drug targeting the secondary
      mutation, or other treatment for about 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 30 days.
