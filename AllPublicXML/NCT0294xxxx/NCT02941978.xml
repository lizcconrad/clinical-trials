      The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of motivational interviewing in the
      adherence of patients with AF to oral anticoagulation (OAC) regimens. Half of the patients
      will be interviewed and guide on the importance of adherence to OAC medication. Patients
      assigned to the intervention group will be contacted at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year
      after discharge. Patients in the control group will be contacted at 1 year after discharge.

      Study Purpose: To investigate the impact of motivational interviewing in the adherence of
      patients with AF to oral anticoagulation (OAC) regimens

      Trial Type: Randomised clinical study

      Clinical Design: Prospective, single center, randomized control study

      Primary Objective: The primary outcome is overall adherence to OAC regimen in the year after
      hospitalization for any reason, reported as both a continuous and a binary outcome

      Secondary Objective: The secondary clinical outcome is a combined endpoint of death, acute
      myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic/ischemic stroke or major bleeding at 1 year

      Sample Size: 1000 subjects

      Population: Subjects with Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) on OAC therapy or
      prescribed OAC therapy that are hospitalized for any reason.

      Intervention

        1. Motivational Interview - Baseline: At hospital discharge, patients assigned to the
           intervention group will be contacted in person by a study physician (MD) and will be
           given a leaflet that will educate them about the risk for stroke and the importance of
           adherence to OAC medication.

        2. Motivational Interview - Follow-up: Patients assigned to the intervention group will be
           contacted via telephone for a pre-specified interview at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and
           1 year after discharge. The three elements of medication adherence (initiation,
           implementation, and discontinuation) will be evaluated. Based on the patient's dosing
           history, the delegated study personnel will assess whether an intervention is required
           and provide specific support tailored to the needs of the patient

      Control Patients assigned to the control group will be contacted via telephone for a
      pre-specified interview at 1 year after discharge

      Clinical Duration:The total study duration is expected to be 3 years

    <description>Motivational Interview - Baseline: At hospital discharge, patients assigned to the intervention group will be contacted in person by a study physician (MD) and will be given a leaflet that will educate them about the risk for stroke and the importance of adherence to OAC medication. The leaflet will also provide some basic information on how to take OAC medication (doses, food interactions, skipping doses, etc.) and will describe the main clinical manifestations of side effects.
Motivational Interview - Follow-up: Patients assigned to the intervention group will be contacted via telephone for a pre-specified interview at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year after discharge. The three elements of medication adherence (initiation, implementation, and discontinuation) will be evaluated.
