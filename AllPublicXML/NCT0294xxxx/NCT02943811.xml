  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators sought to retrospectively assess whether the use of a intrauterine device
      to manipulate the uterus does affect the long-term oncologic outcomes of patients operated by
      laparoscopy for endometrial cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively collected data regarding patients who received operation by
      laparoscopy for presumed clinical stage I endometrial cancer. The subjects were then
      stratified according to the use or not of the uterine manipulator. The investigators also
      considered the actual type of manipulator used. Then disease-free, disease-specific and
      overall survival were evaluated, as well as all the possible factors associated with
      prognosis.

      Data were retrieved from specifically designed research quality internal surgical databases,
      prospectively updated by trained residents on a regular basis, in order to capture all the
      possible surgical and follow-up data.
