  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the educational potential of games, with the goal of
      developing a game to improve learning and promote healthy hearing behaviors.

      The project is looking for adolescents and young adults that play games to share their
      experience and learning from playing games.

      The investigators ask participants to fill out an enrollment form/informed consent, complete
      surveys on healthy hearing habits, and play a game provided by the project.

      This projects aims the development and evaluation of a game to educate teenagers and young
      adults about noise-induced hearing loss, enhance knowledge about hearing, and promote healthy
      hearing behaviors with the potential to improve hearing health care.

    <description>This instrument has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of past hearing loss prevention programs funded by the National Institute of Health. It contains questions on knowledge, attitudes, and intended behavior related to hearing health care. Although there are questions in different domains, the instrument consolidates the overall perception of participant on hearing health care.</description>
