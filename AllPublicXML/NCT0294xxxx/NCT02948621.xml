      The endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty allows stomach size reduction through an endoluminal
      suture approach without any incision. It could reduce the complications associated with
      current surgical techniques while obtaining the target gastric restriction, weight loss,
      comorbidities and quality of life improvement.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess weight loss after endoscopic sleeve
      gastroplasty in patients with morbid obesity.

    <textblock>
      Gastric restriction is one of the fundamental principles of gastric bypass and gastric
      banding. Nowadays, practitioners have the possibility to reduce stomach size by merging
      tissues through an endoscopic endoluminal suture approach without any incision. This could
      reduce the complications associated with current surgical techniques while obtaining the
      target gastric restriction, weight loss, comorbidities and quality of life improvement.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess weight loss after endoscopic sleeve
      gastroplasty in patients with morbid obesity according to the technique described in the
      literature: reduction of the gastric pouch into a sleeve structure by modification of the
      stomach greater curvature thanks to a plication.
