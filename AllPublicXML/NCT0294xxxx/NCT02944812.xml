      This trial intends: 1.To evaluate the concentration of Chidamide in the serum and
      cerebral-spinal fluid of PTCL patients at certain time points after taking the medicine, to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Chidamide in these patients and its CNS (central nervous
      system) distribution.

      2. To evaluate the efficiency and safety of Chidamide in PTCL patients.
