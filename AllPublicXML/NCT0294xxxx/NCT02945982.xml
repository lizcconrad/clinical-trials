  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portal hypertension is a common pathology in chronic liver disease, particularly in liver
      cirrhosis. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is one of most etiologies of liver cirrhosis in China. The
      basic reason for portal hypertension in HBV is the largely deposition of hepatic
      extracellular matrixes which causes high pressure in liver vessels. One of the most common
      symptoms of cirrhotic portal hypertension is gastroesophageal varices.The effective
      inhibition of HBV can partially stop or reverse liver fibrosis in patients with chronic
      Hepatitis and liver cirrhosis due to HBV and the anti-fibrotic strategy focusing on the
      regulation of hepatic extracellular matrix may have a great benefit. Therefore, antivirals
      therapy is also a basic treatment for low-grade cirrhotic portal hypertension. Fuzheng Huayu
      has been found to enhance the degradation of collagens in fibrotic liver and have a good
      action against liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, there are no
      high quality clinical evidences which can demonstrate if the combination of anti-viral and
      anti-fibrotic therapy can relieve the pressure of liver vessels and decline incidence rate
      and bleeding rate of gastroesophageal varices.

      The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of the
      combination of Entecavir and Fuzheng Huayu for reverse rate of gastroesophageal varices in
      patients with Moderate and Severe cirrhotic portal hypertension due to hepatitis B virus.
