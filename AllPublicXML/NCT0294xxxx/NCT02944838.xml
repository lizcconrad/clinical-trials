  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Senior Change Makers is an intergenerational intervention that compares two, 8-week programs:
      (1) an advocacy program wherein senior participants perform audits of their physical activity
      environments, identify an advocacy project, and advocate for improvements; and (2) a walking
      program designed to increase participant physical activity through education and guided
      walks. The investigators expect that the advocacy program will produce greater improvements
      in seniors' advocacy skills, confidence, and attitudes at 8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be conducted at six senior centers in San Diego, California and will
      involve 132 senior participants, 16 student participants, and 12 decision maker participants
      (N = 160). Three senior centers will be randomized to an advocacy program and three will be
      randomized to a walking program.

      The participants at the advocacy intervention sites will undergo an 8-week advocacy program
      during which they will (1) learn about the connection between the built environment and
      physical activity, (2) conduct a field audit of their physical activity environment using the
      Microscale Audit of Pedestrian Streetscapes (MAPS) Mini tool, (3) select an advocacy issue
      related to a physical activity barrier, and (4) engage in advocacy actions, such as
      communicating with decision makers or public officials. The group sessions will include
      topics such as how the environment affects walking, potential pedestrian hazards and
      solutions, how to conduct an audit of the walking environment, what advocates do, local
      examples of successful advocacy projects, creating an advocacy action plan, creating a fact
      sheet about the advocacy issue, writing letters to representatives, making an advocacy
      presentation. The student participants will work with the senior participants throughout the
      program to help accomplish the advocacy goals. The program will culminate with the
      presentation of the advocacy issue to a &quot;decision maker&quot; (e.g., a city planner, engineer,
      city council member, etc.).

      In the other study condition, the walking groups, participants will undergo an 8-week program
      that provides participants with information about safe physical activity, strategies to
      increase physical activity, and guided walks. The group sessions will address topics such as
      the benefits of walking, fall prevention tips, goal setting, positive thinking, social
      support, sedentary behavior and health, barriers to walking, handling setbacks, and
      overcoming challenges to physical activity. Comparing two beneficial programs helps with
      participant recruitment and retention, and ensures that between-group differences in outcomes
      are not due solely to participation in a group program.

    <description>The investigators will use validated survey items to measure seniors' changes in self-efficacy for advocacy, perceived socio-political control, and assertiveness (Millstein, 2013). Sample item: &quot;I am confident that I can work to make my community a better place for being physically active.&quot; These are key outcomes of the advocacy training</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure completion of advocacy &quot;actions&quot; and &quot;outcomes&quot; with a checklist survey taken by the researchers. Examples of actions include testimony, letters, and meetings. To determine if decision makers took any action after the advocacy, the investigators will ask the decision makers or their staff to complete a short, 10-minute survey, after the advocacy action. The survey will solicit feedback for the advocates, assess whether any action occurred, and assess the decision makers' perceptions of the advocacy and study. Researchers will follow-up again at 3 months to assess completion of advocacy actions, if the decision makers took any actions, and whether any changes occurred</description>

    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured at baseline and after completion of the 8-week intervention. The investigators will use Actigraph accelerometers (model GT3X, Pensacola, FL), set to collect data in 60 second epochs to match cut points. Senior participants will wear the accelerometer for seven days during all waking hours (except when bathing or swimming) and estimates of physical activity levels and sedentary time will be calculated using validated algorithms and cut points for seniors.</description>

    <description>The Senior Change Makers Advocacy Program consists of weekly meetings, 1 hour each, for 8-weeks. The program will be led by graduate level students and will address topics such as how the environment affects walking, potential pedestrian hazards and solutions, how to conduct an audit of the walking environment, what advocates do, local examples of successful advocacy projects, creating an advocacy action plan, creating a fact sheet about the advocacy issue, writing letters to representatives, and making an advocacy presentation.

    <description>The Senior Change Makers Physical Activity Program consists of weekly meetings, 1 hour each, for 8 weeks. The program provides participants with information about safe physical activity, strategies to increase physical activity, and guided walks. Topics will focus on walking, but we will also include information and activities relating to strength training, flexibility, and balance. Behavioral skills such as goal setting, addressing barriers, and social support will also be addressed.</description>
