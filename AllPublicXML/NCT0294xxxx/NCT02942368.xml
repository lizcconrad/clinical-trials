  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to investigate the potential role of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD).
      tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique which has been utilized for the treatment
      of major depression in several studies, both as a primary and adjunctive treatment. The
      treatment will be administered under the supervision of a physician with experience in
      administering the treatment and monitoring for complications. This will be a prospective
      &quot;adaptive tDCS stimulation&quot; open label research study. Participants will receive 20 minute
      sessions of up to 4 milliamps (mA) transcutaneous electrical stimulation sessions over 4 to 6
      weeks. Building on the theory that greater current &quot;dose&quot; may be a significant factor in
      determining efficacy, this study aims to determine whether higher tDCS current doses lead to
      greater improvements in depressive symptoms in this population of patients with
      treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.
