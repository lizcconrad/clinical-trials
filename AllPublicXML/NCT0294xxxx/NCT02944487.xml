  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lucerastat, and
      to determine its pharmacokinetic profile as single oral doses at different strengths.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects were enrolled sequentially to five dose groups, starting with the lowest dose
      level. Subjects could participate in only one Group.
