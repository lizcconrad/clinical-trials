  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Paclitaxel drug eluting
      balloons (RESTORE DEB, 3μg/mm2 balloon surface area ) for success of intervention treatment
      and maintaining the vessels unobstructed in the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis
      compared with a product of the same category (SeQuent® Please).
