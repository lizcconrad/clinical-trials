        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in Cohort 1 and
             metastatic NSCLC in Cohort 2, predominantly squamous histology. Squamous NSCLC
             diagnosis must be confirmed by histology or cytology local pathology report.

          -  Participants in Cohort 1 are required to have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
             protein expressing tumor (defined by local immunohistochemistry test). This is not
             required for participants in Cohort 2.

          -  Measurable disease at the time of study entry as defined by Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)

          -  The participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)
             score of 0-1

          -  Have discontinued all previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute
             effects of therapy: Biologic agents (for example, antibodies) and Immunotherapy ≥4
             weeks; Chest radiotherapy ≥4 weeks; Major surgery, excluding biopsy ≥4 weeks)

          -  The participant has archived tumor tissue available for biomarker analyses.

          -  Participants in Cohort 2 are required to have received 1 prior single-agent immune
             checkpoint inhibitor for squamous NSCLC.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has nonsquamous NSCLC

          -  The participant has received prior anticancer therapy targeting the EGFR, vascular
             endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or VEGF receptor.

          -  The participant has received previous chemotherapy (including concurrent
             chemoradiation) for advanced NSCLC (participants who have received neo-adjuvant and/or
             adjuvant chemotherapy are eligible if the last administration occurred at least 1 year
             prior to start of therapy).

          -  The participant has brain metastases that are symptomatic or require ongoing treatment
             with steroids or anticonvulsants.

          -  The participant has a bleeding tumor.

          -  The participant has a history of arterial or venous thromboembolism within 3 months
             prior to study enrollment.

          -  The participant has a history or evidence of current clinically-relevant coronary
             artery disease of current ≥ Class III as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Angina Grading Scale (Campeau 1976) or congestive heart failure of current ≥ Class III
             as defined by the New York Heart Association.

          -  The participant has experienced myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study
             enrollment.
