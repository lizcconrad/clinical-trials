  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Nilotinib will be safe in individuals with mild to
      moderate AD. Specifically, investigators hypothesize that low daily oral doses of Nilotinib
      will lead to CSF penetration, CNS Abl inhibition, and stabilization of CSF total Tau and
      p-Tau231/181 and Abeta42/40 levels. The investigators hypothesize that Nilotinib will
      decrease brain load of amyloid using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). The
      investigators also predict that Nilotinib will reduce CSF markers of cell death, including
      neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S100B.

      The investigators propose a novel treatment strategy that involves Abl inhibition to alter
      Abeta40/42, total Tau and p-Tau231/181 in subjects with mild to moderate dementia due to AD.
      The investigators pre-clinical studies show that Nilotinib inhibits brain Abl, decreases
      Abeta and p-Tau, modulates brain and peripheral immune profiles and reverses cognitive
      decline in AD models. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that Nilotinib is a
      viable therapeutic candidate - via Abl inhibition - in subjects with AD. Based on strong
      pre-clinical evidence about the effects of Nilotinib on neurodegenerative pathologies,
      including autophagic clearance of neurotoxic proteins, immunity and behavior, the
      investigators conducted an open label pilot clinical trial in advanced (stage 3-5) PD with
      dementia (PDD) and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) patients. Participants (N=12) were randomized 1:1
      to once daily oral dose of 150mg and 300mg Nilotinib for 6 months. The investigators showed
      that Nilotinib penetrates the blood brain barrier (BBB), in agreement with pre-clinical data.
      Several studies show that Abeta42 is decreased and CSF total Tau and p-Tau are increased in
      PD and LBD. Investigators data show that Nilotinib reverses loss of CSF Abeta40/42 and
      significantly reduces (N=5, P&lt;0.05) CSF total Tau and p-Tau between baseline and 6 months
      treatment. These biomarker changes are consistent with cognitive improvement (3.5-3.85
      points) using Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's
      Disease-Cognition (SCOPA-Cog) between baseline and 6 months. These data are very compelling
      to evaluate the effects of Nilotinib in a phase II, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild to moderate AD.
