  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      combining anastrozole and palbociclib in the following two cohorts: Cohort A) as first-line
      therapy and Cohort B) as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy in postmenopausal
      patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pre- and perimenopausal
      women must receive therapy with an LHRH agonist. The LHRH agonist will be by choice for an
      approved LHRH agonist administered according to its respective prescribing information.
      Following informed consent and eligibility check, subjects will be enrolled to either Cohort
      A or Cohort B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 subjects will be enrolled over an enrollment period of 18-24 months. The study
      is planned to enroll up to 25 patients in Cohort A (upfront) and 15 patients in Cohort B
      (maintenance). Subjects will be recruited through Levine Cancer Institute locations and
      through referrals. Women of any race or ethnic origin who meet the study criteria may
      participate in this clinical trial. Males will not be eligible for this study. Breast cancer
      in men is rare and the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors in males is limited. Children are not
      included in this clinical trial because the effects of palbociclib are not known in the
      pediatric population, but may be eligible for other pediatric trials.

               -  Age greater than or equal to 60 years;

               -  Age less than 60 years and cessation of regular menses for at least 12
                  consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause and
                  serum estradiol, FSH and LH level within the laboratory reference range for
                  postmenopausal females;

               -  Documented bilateral oophorectomy;

               -  Medically confirmed ovarian failure OR premenopausal or perimenopausal, i.e., not
                  meeting the criteria for being postmenopausal.

          -  Premenopausal or perimenopausal women can be enrolled if amenable to be treated with
             an LHRH agonist. Patients must have commenced treatment with an LHRH agonist at least
             4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.

          -  Histologically or cytological confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer with evidence of
             metastatic disease. Locally advanced disease not amenable to resection is eligible.

          -  Documentation of ER-positive and, or PR-positive tumor based on most recent tumor
             biopsy (unless bone-only disease). ER and PR assays are considered positive if there
             is at least 1 percent positive in the tumor sample.

          -  Documentation of HER2-negative tumor based on most recent tumor biopsy. Tumor must not
             demonstrate overexpression of HER2 by either IHC (immunohistochemistry) or in-situ
             hybridization (ISH).

          -  No previous treatment for metastatic disease for Cohort A.

               -  For Cohort A: previous treatment with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant or
                  neoadjuvant setting is allowed

               -  For Cohort B: only first-line chemotherapy (can be single-agent or a combination
                  regimen) for metastatic disease with response (defined as a complete response or
                  partial response by RECIST version 1.1, or stable disease for six months or more
                  from this regimen) and chemotherapy discontinued for 21 days is allowed; patients
                  may have received prior systemic therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting.

          -  For Cohort A, measurable disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1, or bone-only
             disease prior to start of study treatment. Patients with bone-only metastatic cancer
             must have a lytic or mixed lytic-blastic lesion that can be accurately assessed by CT
             or MRI. Patients with bone-only disease who have blastic-only metastasis are not
             eligible. Tumor lesions previously irradiated or subjected to other loco regional
             therapy will only be deemed measurable if progression at the treated site after
             completion of therapy is clearly documented. For Cohort B, measurable disease as
             defined by RECIST version 1.1, or evaluable disease.

          -  Patient has archival tumor tissue available that is formalin-fixed and
             paraffin-embedded. Biopsy sample taken at the time of presentation with recurrent or
             metastatic disease is recommended.For patients who do not have archival tissue, tissue
             from a fresh biopsy should be obtained prior to study treatment initiation, if it can
             be safely attained using local anesthesia only. One exception is those patients with
             bone-only disease for whom provision of previous archival tissue would be acceptable.
             Serial fresh tumor tissue samples will be collected in patients with lesions amenable
             for a biopsy who consent to such a procedure.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL;

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL; Hemoglobin greater than or equal
                  to 9 g/dL.

               -  Renal: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5X ULN or Measured or calculated
                  creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than or equal to 60 mL/min for subject with
                  creatinine levels &gt; 1.5X ULN [CrCl should be calculated per institutional
                  standard; GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl]

               -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5X ULN; AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less
                  than or equal to 3X ULN (less than or equal to 5X ULN if liver metastases
                  present); Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5X ULN (less than or equal
                  to 5X ULN if liver or bone metastases present)

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication per the Investigator.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases,
             carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease as indicated by clinical symptoms,
             cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth. Patients with treated brain metastases are
             eligible if there is no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after
             CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI
             or CT) during the screening period.

          -  Use of food or drugs known to be potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and drugs known to be potent
             CYP3A4 inducers (for examples, see the Prohibited Medications Section)

             congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic
             attack, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism.

          -  Impairment of gastro-intestinal function or GI disease that may significantly alter
             the absorption of palbociclib, such as history of GI surgery which may result in
             intestinal blind loops and patients with clinically significant gastroparesis, short
             bowel syndrome, unresolved nausea, vomiting, active inflammatory bowel disease or
             diarrhea of CTCAE Grade &gt; 1.

          -  Prior hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to anastrozole.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 4 weeks before
             treatment initiation in this study.
