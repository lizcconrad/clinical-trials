    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the variations of respiratory changes in pulse
      oximeter plethysmographic amplitude (delta POP) according to different contact forces between
      finger and sensor of pulse oximeter. During general anesthesia without surgical stimuli,
      pulse oximeter sensor is applied with serial contact force, from 0 to maximal 1.5N (increased
      by 0.2N) and POP waveform is obtained for 60 seconds. Delta POP will be calculated and
      compared.
