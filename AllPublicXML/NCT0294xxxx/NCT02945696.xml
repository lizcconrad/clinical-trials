      The investigators will perform a prospective randomized study to compare the effectiveness of
      laparoscopic-guided abdominal wall nerve blocks with local wound site infiltration and with
      ultrasounded guided abdominal wall blocks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain control after abdominal surgery in children is often a complex, multifaceted problem
      that requires a multimodal approach to treatment. Infiltration of wounds with long-acting
      local anesthetic, either into the surgical field or through locoregional nerve blockade, has
      been known to decrease narcotic requirements. Nerve blocks of the abdominal wall can occur
      through several modalities, among them the transverse abdominis plane block and the rectus
      sheath block. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block places local anesthetic in a plane
      between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, directly blocking innervation
      of spinal nerves T9-L3, the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric and lateral cutaneous branches of
      L1-3, reducing pain sensation to the anterior abdominal wall. The rectus sheath block places
      local anesthetic between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis at the level of the
      terminal branches of intercostal nerves 9-11.

      The investigators will perform a prospective randomized study to compare the effectiveness of
      laparoscopic-guided abdominal wall nerve blocks with local wound site infiltration and with
      ultrasounded guided abdominal wall blocks.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether patients who receive a nerve block have
      significantly less pain compared to patients who receive local infiltration of anesthetic.
      Secondly, the investigators believe that laparoscopic-guided abdominal wall nerve blocks
      should be as effective as abdominal wall blocks performed under ultrasound-guidance, and may
      in fact allow for more consistent infiltration of local anesthetic to desired nerve bundles.
      Thirdly, the investigators believe that laparoscopic-guided abdominal wall nerve blocks are
      significantly less time intensive than ultrasound-guided abdominal wall nerve blocks,
      allowing a cost savings and decreased time under general anesthesia.
