    <textblock>
      To investigate the clinical application value of laparoscopic radical right hemicolectomy
      using the caudal-to-cranial approach versus the medial-to-lateral approach by prospective
      randomized controlled clinical study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the caudal-to-cranial approach with the medial-to-lateral approach in laparoscopic
      right hemicolectomy for the advance right colon cancer.

      A prospective randomized controlled trial will be performed in the GI department,the
      Guangdong provincial hospital of Chinese Medicine from October 2016 to October 2024.The
      sample size，150 cases with advanced right colon cancer, will be needed after calculated by
      the statistics .The 150 cases will be randomly divided into two groups: laparoscopic radical
      right hemicolectomy using the caudal-to-cranial(CtC) approach(GroupCtC) and laparoscopic
      radical right hemicolectomy using the medial-to-lateral(MtL) approach (GroupMtL). Primary
      outcomes are the operative time，The secondary outcomes are the total blood loss,the number of
      lymph nodes dissected,the average time of ground activities,the time to first flatus,the
      hospital stay,the intra-operative complication and the post-operative complication，and
      others' outcomes are the Disease-free survival rate(DFS) at 3 years and 5 years,the Overall
      survival rate（OS）at 3 years and 5 years.The data in two groups will be compared.

    <description>Cutting the peritoneum along the line between the right mesocolon and retroperitoneum, enter the Toldt's space to dissect the posterior of Superior mesenteric vein（SMV）and Superior mesenteric artery（SMA）and their branches, and then finished the D3 dissection from caudal to cranial on both sides of the mesentery along the Superior mesenteric vein（SMV）. In the end, cut the lateral ligament to mobilize the posterior space of ascending colon. This approach is called caudal-to-cranial approach.</description>

    <description>First, the pedicle of ileocolic vessels is identified and the mesocolon is dissected between the pedicle and the periphery of the Superior mesenteric vein（SMV）to expose the second portion of the duodenum. The ileocolic vessels are then cut at their roots. The ascending mesocolon is separated from the retroperitoneal tissues, duodenum, and pancreatic head up to the hepatocolic ligament cranially. The important detail in this procedure is the wide separation between the pancreatic head and the transverse mesocolon.This approach is the medial-to-lateral(MtL) approach</description>
