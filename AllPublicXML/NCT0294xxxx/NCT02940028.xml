  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ICU is a stressful and challenging place for patients and their families. Many family
      members experience anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder during and after
      their ICU experience. The investigators are studying post-traumatic growth in this study.
      Post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a set of positive changes that occurs after a challenging or
      difficult life experience. This study investigates the effects of expressive writing on
      positive changes that occur after a difficult experience .PTG will be compared between the
      intervention group receiving the expressive writing intervention and the control group
      (non-expressive or fact based writing).
