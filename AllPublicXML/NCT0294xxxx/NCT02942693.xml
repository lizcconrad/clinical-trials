      It is a randomized phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of particle therapy
      with or without apatinib as induction therapy for the treatment of head and neck adenoid
      cystic carcinoma. Participants will be randomized to arm 1: receiving apatinib for 6 weekly
      followed by particle radiotherapy; arm 2: particle radiotherapy alone.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of particle therapy with or
      without apatinib as induction therapy for the treatment of head and neck adenoid cystic
      carcinoma. It is a randomized phase II clinical trial with single phase and 2 experimental
      arms. Participants will be randomized to arm 1, receiving apatinib (0.5g, daily) for 6 weekly
      followed by particle radiotherapy (proton: 56 GyE/28 Fx, plus carbon: 15 GyE/5 Fx for boost);
      arm 2: particle radiotherapy alone (proton: 56 GyE/28 Fx, plus carbon: 15 GyE/5 Fx for
      boost). The short term response will be evaluated using RECIST criteria. And the acute and
      late toxicities will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE v4.03.
