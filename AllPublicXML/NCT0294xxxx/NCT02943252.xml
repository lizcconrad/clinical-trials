    <textblock>
      This is a Single-center, Open-label, Single-arm, Phase Ⅱ exploratory clinical trial
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of Apatinib plus S1 for patients with advanced
      (unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous head and neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard therapy for patients with advanced (unresectable, locally advanced,
      recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous head and neck cancer. Apatinib is a novel vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved for
      the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or more lines of
      prior chemotherapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor is highly expressed in non-squamous
      head and neck cancer and its expression correlates with stage, tumour size, vascular
      invasion, recurrence and metastasis. S1 is a new kind of oral fluorouracil antineoplastic
      chemotherapy drugs. In vitro, apatinib has synergy effect with fluorouracil. In this study,
      the investigators try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib and S1 in advanced
      non-squamous head and neck cancer and to validate the correlative biomarkers.
