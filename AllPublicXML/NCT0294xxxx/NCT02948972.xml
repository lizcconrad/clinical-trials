    <textblock>
      The ENDOFERT Study is an open, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial.
      This study includes patients presenting colorectal DIE and infertility. Patients will be
      randomized in two parallel-groups; one group underwent complete surgery of colorectal DIE
      prior to ART and the other group underwent ART alone (ratio 1:1)
