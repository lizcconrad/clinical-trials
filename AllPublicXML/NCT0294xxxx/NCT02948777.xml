  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial lipemia is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes subjects even with normal fasting
      triglyceride values. Humans are mostly in a postprandial rather than in a fasting state and
      therefore non-fasting triglyceride values reflect more accurately the continuous exposure of
      arterial wall to the substantial cholesterol load. Evolocumab lowers blood LDL-cholesterol.
      This study evaluates the effect of evolocumab on postprandial lipid metabolism in type 2
      diabetes. All participants in this study receive evolocumab treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female (non-fertile or using a medically approved birth control method)
             overweight/obese subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus treated with lifestyle
             counselling and a stable metformin dose for at least three months

          -  age 18-77 yrs.

          -  body mass index 25-40 kg/m2

          -  triglycerides between 1.5-4.5 mmol/L and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol &gt;1.8 but
             ≤4.0 mmol/L (on Atorvastatin 20 mg/day)

          -  glycohemoglobin: ≤9%.

          -  Each patient will attend a pre-screening visit (at week -5) where eligibility criteria
             will be evaluated. If the patient uses another statin than atorvastatin (20 mg) at
             screening visit the used statin is stopped and atorvastatin 20 mg will be initiated.
             If the patient is not using any statin, atorvastatin 20 mg will be initiated and the
             lipid values will be checked after 4 weeks when all inclusion/exclusion criteria will
             be assessed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 1 diabetes
