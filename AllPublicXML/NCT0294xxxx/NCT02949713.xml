    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to find out whether it is feasible to conduct a larger study
      looking at the effect of mobile phone text messaging added to motivational interviewing on
      number of women living with HIV infection reporting exclusive or any breastfeeding six months
      post-delivery.

      Secondary aim: In HIV-infected women initiating breastfeeding after giving birth, does
      interactive weekly mobile phone text messaging plus motivational interviewing versus usual
      care, improve self-reported adherence to exclusive or any breastfeeding 6 months
      post-delivery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding reduces the risks of dying from infections and is currently recommended as the
      most beneficial feeding option for infants born to HIV-infected women in low-resourced
      settings. This recommendation contradicts previous recommendations to avoid breastfeeding to
      prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. South Africa, a high HIV prevalent country,
      recently phased out access to free formula milk in the public sector in support of
      breastfeeding for HIV-infected women. The investigators previously found that few
      HIV-infected South African women choose breastfeeding and among those who did, many stop
      breastfeeding early. This study involves text messaging breastfeeding advice encouraging
      women to exclusively breastfeed, and inquire if they have any breastfeeding related problems,
      and motivational interviews exploring and supporting woman's commitment to continue
      breastfeeding.Participants meeting inclusion criteria who consent participation will be
      enrolled by a research nurse and immediately randomly assigned to text messaging plus
      motivational interviewing group or usual standard of care group.

      The investigators propose a randomized, parallel group, standard of care-controlled pilot
      trial which will be conducted among HIV-infected women of low socio-economic background,
      giving birth at a primary healthcare clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. The pilot trial will
      assess the feasibility of conducting a larger trial on communication and support approaches
      that may improve HIV-infected woman's adherence to exclusive and continued breastfeeding.

    <description>Participants will register their phone numbers into an automated SMS software (provided by WelTel.org). Every Monday morning, a text message (SMS) will be sent to participants in the intervention group encouraging participants to continue breastfeeding, and inquire if participants have any problems breastfeeding their infants. Participants will be asked to respond within 48 hours, indicating that they either do not have a problem or they have a problem and require help. In addition to text messaging, participants will have motivational interviews post-delivery at weeks 2, 6, 10, 14, and 24. Motivational interviews will explore and support the participant's commitment to continue breastfeeding.</description>
