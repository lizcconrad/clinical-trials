  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent Veterans of the OIF/OEF/OND conflicts are presenting in VA care with high rates of:
      PTSD, depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse, reporting significant difficulties with
      community reintegration, and dropping out of mental health care at high rates. Surveys of
      recent Veterans show that Veterans want the VA to provide mental health care tailored to
      their concerns and reintegration priorities. The VA is committed to providing personalized,
      proactive, patient centered care (PCC); but little research or intervention development has
      been done on PCC in mental health care settings and preliminary research indicates Veterans
      may lack the skills and knowledge to be active partners in PCC. This study aims to examine
      PCC behaviors in VA mental health care and, informed by this data, develop a brief patient
      centered mental health intervention that will help recent Veterans take the lead in their
      care personalization and support their functional recovery. Results from this study will
      demonstrate the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of this intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project Background: The term &quot;recent Veterans&quot; refers to Veterans who served in the military
      operations Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn.
      Almost 60% of recent Veterans who received VA care have been diagnosed with a mental health
      disorder, most commonly posttraumatic stress disorder (32%), depressive disorders (26%),
      anxiety disorders (25%), and substance abuse (13%). The research literature consistently
      confirms that recent Veterans with stress-related mental health disorders experience
      impairment in functional domains of health (overcoming and managing disease), purpose
      (meaningful daily activities and participation in society), and community (positive
      relationships and social networks).

      Project Objectives: The proposed research will characterize patient centered care in VA
      mental health care and produce a brief patient centered intervention that will empower
      Veterans to lead and personalize their mental health care in support of their functional
      recovery. In Aim 1 of this research the investigators will characterize rates of providers'
      and recent Veterans' (n=30) participation in the four components of PCC, as well as barriers
      and facilitators of each PCC component, to inform development of a brief patient centered
      mental health intervention in Aim 2. In Aim 2 the investigators will develop a brief patient
      centered mental health intervention for recent Veterans experiencing stress-related mental
      health disorders and conduct a pre-pilot demonstration (n=10) to assess acceptability. This
      intervention will be informed by data collected in Aim 1 and developed using an iterative
      process of discussion with and input from recent Veterans, VA mental health providers, peer
      specialists, and researchers. Finally in Aim 3 the investigators will test the feasibility
      and preliminary efficacy of the brief intervention by conducting a randomized controlled
      trial with 48 recent Veterans with stress-related mental health disorders.

      Project Methods: In Aim 1 data will be collected at one time point using surveys and a
      recording of a Veteran provider encounter which will be coded to quantify Veteran and
      provider patient centered care behaviors. Intervention development in Aim 2 will be led by a
      multi-stakeholder Advisory Panel and further developed using Veteran focus groups.
      Acceptability will be demonstrated via qualitative interviews following a pre-pilot
      demonstration project with 10 Veteran participants. In Aim 3 data will be collected at
      baseline, post-RCT participation, and 3 month and 6 month follow-up. Feasibility will be
      assessed with study administration data on engagement and participation in the intervention
      and preliminary efficacy will be evaluated via coded Veteran provider encounters and
      quantitative analysis of functioning from self-report surveys.

    <description>The Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey measures health-related quality of life in 8 domains, 4 of which will be utilized in this study: (1) role limitations due to emotional problems, (2) vitality, (3) social functioning, and (4) mental health. Item response scales differ but are scored with 3- to 6-point scale and are summed to create total and domain scores.</description>

    <description>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 is a 36-item assessment of health and disability across physical and mental health disorders in both clinical and non-clinical settings/populations. It closely corresponds with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). I will use subscales measuring (1) life activities such as domestic responsibilities and work, and (2) participation in community activities. Items are scored on a 5-point scale (from none to extreme) that are summed to create total and domain scores.</description>

    <description>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 is the most current version of the PTSD Check List (PCL), the gold standard of PTSD symptom assessments. Its 20-items use a 5-point Likert scale (0-not at all to 4-extremely) that maps on to the diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-5. The PCL-5 is appropriate for both clinical and research purposes and is recommended for monitoring symptom change. The PCL-5 is summed to create a total score. Preliminary validation has established that a 10 point change is clinically significant.</description>

    <description>Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test is a 10-item self-report instrument with 3 subscales: hazardous alcohol use, harmful alcohol use, and dependence symptoms. The items obtain information on the frequency and amount of drinking and alcohol-related problems. Scores on the AUDIT correspond with 4 risk level zones and movement between risk level zones is a clinically significant change.</description>
