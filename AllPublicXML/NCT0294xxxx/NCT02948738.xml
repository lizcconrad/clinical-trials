  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with asthma are admitted for asthma attacks very frequently in the U.S. The families
      and children are given basic education about asthma but studies are needed to improve this
      education so that it makes a meaningful difference in health outcomes and asthma care. This
      study compares two inpatient education models for children hospitalized with asthma.

      The current standard is to review an asthma action plan with families and to review inhaler
      medication administration. In this study, investigators will be assigning families to either
      a control (current standard education) or and intervention group. In the intervention group,
      participants will receive interactive education based on learning theories that are thought
      to enhance long term memory. Participants in the interactive group will build their own
      action plan using colored templates and pictures. Participants will also learn to use their
      inhaler using teach-back methodologies. Investigators will then compare the two groups in
      terms of ER visits, hospitalizations, family confidence in managing asthma, asthma knowledge,
      and quality of life.
