  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to obtain and to describe the position of the laryngeal mask during
      elective magnetic resonance imaging in paediatric patient. The radiologic findings will be
      compared to the clinical performance of the laryngeal mask.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Properly inserted laryngeal mask (LMA) with good clinical performance can be misplaced (on
      radiological imaging) but with not know effect on clinical practice. The percentage of the
      misplaced LMAs are relatively high, but the exact number in paediatric population is
      currently not clear. The aim of this prospective observational cohort study is to describe
      the percentage of misplaced LMAs during elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in
      paediatric patient. After approval of the local ethical committee all elective paediatric
      patients in study interval (10/2016-3/2017) indicated for elective MRI of the brain or
      elective MRI of the brain and cervical spine will be included to the trial. Demographic
      characteristics - age, weight, comorbidities, anesthesia management - education of
      anesthesiologist, type of LMA, number of insertion attempts, clinical performance of the LMA,
      presence/absence of leak, the peak inspiratory pressure (mechanical ventilation), volume of
      air in cuff, complications during anesthesia and LMA soil after extraction - blood, saliva,
      mucus, gastric content. The clinical performance will be compared to the LMA position on MRI
      - position of the proximal and the distal site of the LMA cuff according to the cervical
      vertebrae, displacement of the epiglottis, distance between proximal LMA cuff and vocal
      cords, distance between distal LMA cuff and vocal cords.
