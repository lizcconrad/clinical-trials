  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how often breast cancer recurs (returns
      after treatment) in the breast in patients who have been treated with chemotherapy and have
      had follow-up radiation therapy (but not surgery) and are in complete remission (no evidence
      of disease).

      This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA-approved and
      commercially available methods. The study doctor can explain how radiation therapy is
      designed to work.

      About 50 participants will be enrolled on this multicenter study. Up to 50 may take part at
      MD Anderson.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive radiation therapy for as long as your doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. Your participation on this study will be over after the follow-up period (5 years
      after you complete radiation therapy).

      Study Visits:

      At any point after you have completed chemotherapy and before you begin radiation therapy,
      you will have an image-guided biopsy of the breast to test for evidence of disease. To
      perform an image-guided biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected area using imaging
      such as CT, ultrasound, MRI or mammography to collect cells or tissue from an organ, lymph
      node, or suspected tumor mass. The doctor will use the imaging to guide the needle into the
      area. The sample collected will be a core biopsy that collects a small piece of tissue. If
      the biopsy shows evidence of the disease, you will be scheduled for standard of care surgery
      and will still receive radiation therapy and remain on this study. You would sign a separate
      consent form for the surgery.

      Within 12 weeks after you have completed chemotherapy, you will have radiation therapy to
      your breast. The doctor will discuss the dose amount and length of the radiation therapy
      period with you. During radiation therapy, you will have weekly visits with your doctor.

      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) before
      your first radiation therapy visit, and at 6 months and 1 year after you complete radiation
      therapy. CTC testing checks how many tumor cells are in your blood.

      You will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires about your quality of life and symptoms when
      you first agree to take part in this study, and again at 6 months, 1, 3, and 5 years after
      your post-chemotherapy biopsy. The questionnaires can be completed by mail, email, or during
      a phone call. The questionnaires should take about 15 minutes to complete each time.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 6 months for 5 years after you finish radiation therapy, you will have a physical exam
      and mammogram. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an MRI instead of a mammogram
      at every other 6-month visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically confirmed unicentric invasive breast cancer defined as radiologic
             clinical stage T1 or T2 (&lt;/= 5 cm), N0 or N1 (&lt;/= 4 abnormal axillary nodes on initial
             ultrasound), clinical stage M0.

          2. HER2 positive (IHC 3+ and or FISH amplified) or triple receptor negative (TN, ER/PR &lt;
             10% HER2 negative (IHC 1+ or 2+ FISH non-amplified) receiving any standard routine
             clinical NST regimen.

          3. Patient desires breast conserving therapy.

          4. Age 40 years or older. This age cutoff is justified because breast cancers in women
             under the age of 40 are known to have a significantly higher risk of IBTR presumably
             due to underlying biologic differences.

          5. Female sex.

          6. If the patient has a history of a prior non-breast cancer, all treatment for this
             cancer must have been completed prior to study registration and the patient must have
             no evidence of disease for this prior non-breast cancer.

          7. Patient must have an initial nodal ultrasound that does not demonstrate more than four
             suspicious lymph nodes, any suspicious lymph nodes should be biopsied to determine if
             nodal metastatic disease present.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical evidence for a stage T3 or T4 breast cancer.

          2. Clinical or pathologic evidence for distant metastases.

          3. Prior diagnosis of invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer in the
             ipsilateral breast.

          4. Clinical evidence of progression of disease &gt; 20% in the breast or new evidence of
             nodal metastases.

          5. Patient is known to be pregnant.

          6. Patient is participating in a NST protocol in which surgical excision of the breast
             and or lymph nodes are required.
