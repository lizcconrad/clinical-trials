      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, transmural inflammatory disorder affecting the whole
      alimentary tract from mouth to anus. Over the past decades, the incidence of CD is either
      high and stable or low but rising in the worldwide. Although the precise etiopathogenesis of
      CD remains unknown, a number of lines of evidence showed that inappropriate diet was one of
      the reasons responsible for the onset of CD, and diet therapy has been gaining increasing
      attention in the therapeutic work-up of CD.

      Due to reduced intake and high intestinal losses, over three quarters of CD patients would
      suffer weight loss. Involvement of small bowel in CD patients made their nutrition status
      much poorer than ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Therefore, nutrition support is of great
      value in the management of CD. It is widely accepted that enteral nutrition could help
      pediatric CD patients to reach clinical and endoscopic remission, with similar efficacy but
      less side effects than corticosteroids. However, the value of enteral nutrition in adult
      active CD is still controversial, with an unstable remission rates ranging from 8% to 100%.
      Varied characteristics and compliance of enrolled patients might explain this wide range.
      Considering this, idetification of factors favoring the use of enteral nutrition would be
      helpful to select preferred patients suitable for enteral nutrition.

      In this study, we will observe the role of enteral nutrition in active adult CD. The age,
      gender, serum CRP, albumin, fecal calprotectin, nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS2002),
      involved intestinal segments and other items will be correlated with the changes of Crohn's
      disease activity index (Best CDAI) and CRP in order to idetify the factors favoring the use
      of enteral nutrition.
