  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unwarranted use of antibiotics for pediatric acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and
      use of second-line, broad spectrum antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs has contributed to the
      rapid development of resistance in many strains of bacteria. Provider-parent communication
      during pediatric visits for ARTIs strongly influence antibiotic prescribing rates. The
      overall goal of this study is to develop and test a distance learning quality improvement
      (QI) program called Dialogue Around Respiratory Illness Treatment - DART. The DART program
      aims to improve provider communication practices and treatment decisions during pediatric
      ARTI visits, with the ultimate goal being to decrease rates of antibiotic prescribing for
      these illnesses in children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic prescribing for childhood ARTIs, including acute otitis media (AOM), sinusitis,
      bronchitis, upper respiratory infection (URI), and pharyngitis is common in the United
      States. An estimated 31.7 million visits for respiratory conditions result in antibiotic
      prescriptions annually, accounting for &gt;70% of outpatient visits during which antibiotics are
      prescribed to children. Current national levels of antibiotic prescribing for ARTIs appear
      excessive given the estimated prevalence of these infections caused by bacterial pathogens in
      children. While a number of studies in the early 2000's indicated that inappropriate
      antibiotic prescribing may have peaked in the 1990's these declining prescribing rates were
      primarily driven by decreased rates of office visits for ARTIs and decreased prescribing for
      cases where antibiotics are rarely needed (i.e., acute nasopharyngitis, laryngitis, URI,
      bronchitis, bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, and influenza).

      For patients presenting with presumed bacterial ARTIs (i.e., AOM, sinusitis, Group A
      Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis, and non-viral pneumonia), overall prescribing rates remained
      stable during the decade spanning 1995 to 2006 while second-line antibiotic prescribing
      increased. This has occurred despite the recent development of treatment guidelines outlining
      first- and second-line alternative treatments for bacterial ARTIs. Between 1995 and 2006,
      prescription rates of azithromycin (a second-line agent) for ARTIs increased almost 9-fold
      for children &lt; 5 years-old. Similarly, for children ≥5 years-old, azithromycin and
      fluoroquinolone prescription rates increased approximately 6- and 5-fold, respectively.
      During this same time period, use of amoxicillin, the first-line agent for most ARTIs,
      decreased by 37% for children &lt;5 years-old and by 49% for those ≥5 years-old with ARTIs.
      Furthermore, it is widely accepted that episodes of bronchitis and URI in children are caused
      by viral pathogens and that antibiotic treatment does not alter the course of those diseases
      or prevent future bacterial infections. Overuse of antibiotics for such conditions
      contributes to increased resistance among many strains of bacteria that commonly cause ARTIs,
      posing risks at both the individual and community levels. The large number of annual visits
      for pediatric ARTIs and the frequency of antibiotic prescribing during those visits make
      ARTIs an important target for efforts to reduce antibiotic overuse.

    <description>For each group of practices, during the first month of intervention participation, study staff at Seattle Children's Research Institute will send each participating provider within a group/wedge, via email, a password to access the online tutorial. Participants will be asked to view the 40-minute tutorial at a time that is convenient for them but prior to the first webinar. Investigators will be able to track whether and how often participants access the online tutorial as a measure of engagement in the intervention. PROS will follow up, via email or phone, with providers who have not completed the tutorial within a three week timeframe.</description>

    <description>The first webinar, focused on making appropriate antibiotic choices for bacterial ARTIs, will be held at the beginning of month 2 of intervention participation, and the second webinar, focused on recommended communication practices during visits for ARTIs, will be held at the beginning of month 3 of intervention participation. Due to webinar faculty time constraints, we will establish dates/times for the webinar prior to recruitment. Providers will be given information on webinar dates in both the randomization email, as well as include the dates in the study box letter.
The webinars will be recorded to facilitate attendance for those who are unable to make the scheduled date/time. Included in the recording will be the presentation and any questions and answers from participants.</description>

    <description>An online link to the first booster video vignette will be sent to practice participants via email at the beginning of month 5 of intervention participation for each group/wedge. The link will lead to a website in which the provider will need to create a user name and password to access the booster videos. Two additional booster vignettes will be made available for viewing at the beginning of months 7 and 9 of intervention participation.
For each of the three booster sessions, up to three reminders to complete viewing the video vignette will be sent over a 2-week period. The study team will be able to monitor whether participants access and complete the questions at the end of each vignette.</description>

    <description>During the intervention phase, providers will also receive 6 audit and feedback reports given by parents.
The first report will have two parts:
The first part will focus on the provider's overall antibiotic prescribing rates for all ARTIs (viral and bacterial) and rates of using second-line antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs.
The second part will report the rates at which the provider uses the targeted communication practices as well as their average satisfaction scores.</description>
