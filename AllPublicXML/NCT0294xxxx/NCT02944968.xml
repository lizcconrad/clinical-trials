  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the workflow and acute performance , during standard
      electrophysiology mapping and RF ablation procedures, of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF-5D
      catheter with temperature sensing capabilities and micro electrodes used in combination with
      the CARTO® 3 Navigation System with THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF-5D-module.
