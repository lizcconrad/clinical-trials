  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how the pressure in the pulmonary artery changes
      under different conditions of posture, respiration and exertion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study with enrollment up to 30 subjects at
      2 U.S. sites. All study data can be collected on a single day as a one-time visit (lasting
      approximately 90-120 minutes).

      This study is a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study as
      LINQ™ HF investigational RAMware is required to activate additional sensors in the Reveal
      LINQ ICM.

      The patient will come to the clinic for a single in-office visit. PA pressure will be
      measured while the patient is in a variety of positions and during different respiratory
      exercises and after brief exertion. Data will be collected on eCRFs.

      The effects of the different postures, respiration and exertion will be quantified using
      descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation).
