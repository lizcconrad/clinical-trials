      Single arm, open-label experimental trial of 12 weeks of Viekira Pak treatment ± ribavirin
      for adults with chronic kidney disease and hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir,
      dasabuvir (referred to as Viekira Pak) ± ribavirin for adults with advanced CKD with an
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45ml/min that are infected with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and to determine the effect of treatment on traditional
      and novel markers of kidney function and cardiovascular disease risk in patients with
      advanced CKD. During the course of this prospective, single arm treatment trial, we will
      measure currently accepted markers of kidney function and novel biomarkers of CKD progression
      to determine if they improve with eradication of HCV.
