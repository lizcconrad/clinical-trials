    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe and preliminary explore the efficacy and safety of
      combination of Apatinib and SHR-1210 regimen in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or
      gastric cancer.

      Apatinib is a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factors receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor, similar to vatalanib (PTK787), but with a binding affinity 10 times that of
      vatalanib or sorafenib.

      SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will received apatinib orally every day and SHR-1210 200mg (3mg/kg for underweight
      patients) iv every 2 weeks. The efficacy and safety will be observed.

      The dose escalation phase has completed for apatinib from 125mg, 250mg to 500mg. The dose of
      250mg showed best tolerance and efficacy especially in hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, for
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients, apatinib 250mg orally every day was chosed for the dose
      extension phase. In gastric cancer, the dose of 250mg also showed good tolerance but mild
      efficacy. Thus, for gastric cancer patients, the dose of 375mg daily for apatinib would be
      explored and then the investigators will decide the best dosage for these patients.
