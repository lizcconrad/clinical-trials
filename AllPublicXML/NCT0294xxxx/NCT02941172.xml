    <textblock>
      This study investigates cannabinoid CB1 receptors in human brown adipose tissue (BAT) and
      other tissues using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Subjects will be scanned in
      room temperature conditions and during controlled cold exposure, and the density of CB1
      receptors in BAT and other tissues will be quantified. The investigators hypothesize, that
      cannabinoid signaling is increased in cold conditions, when BAT is metabolically active.

      Understanding the mechanisms of BAT activation and the role of endocannabinoids in humans is
      important and beneficial in fighting against the epidemic of obesity and diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endocannabinoids have an important role in regulating energy balance and metabolism.
      Cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1) are found in several tissues such as brown adipose tissue
      (BAT). Endocannabinoids and CB1 receptors participate in the control of lipid and glucose
      metabolism, and blockage of CB1 receptors has been found to improve metabolic factors linked
      to obesity and cardiovascular disease, making CB1 antagonists potential drugs against obesity
      and diabetes.

      In this study the investigators use a PET radiotracer [18F]FMPEP-d2, which binds to CB1
      receptors in vivo, to quantify the CB1 receptor density in BAT, white adipose tissue, muscle
      and the brain. This study is done once in warm conditions and once during controlled cold
      exposure. To verify whether the subject has metabolically active BAT, an additional PET scan
      with the radiotracer [18F]FDG is performed.
