  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the effect of single-injection sciatic PNB to
      continuous sciatic PNB on 1) postoperative pain control as measured by self-reported pain
      scores, pain medication use, and unplanned hospital admission due to poor pain control, 2)
      active knee flexion, and 3) patient satisfaction with pain control following ACL
      reconstruction with a hamstring autograft. The results of this research have the potential to
      positively impact pain control for the adolescent population undergoing this surgical
      procedure and foster responsible utilization of limited resources.

      SPECIFIC AIM 1. The first aim of the study is to explore the impact of sciatic PNB technique
      on hamstring donor site pain control postoperatively.

      H1.a. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB decreases pain
      scores during the initial 72 hours following hamstring autograft harvest when compared to
      single-injection sciatic PNB.

      H1.b. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB decreases oral
      pain medication use during the initial 72 hours following hamstring autograft harvest when
      compared to single-injection sciatic PNB.

      H1.c. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB decreases the
      incidence of unplanned admission due to poor pain control during the initial 72 hours
      following hamstring autograft harvest when compared to single-injection sciatic PNB.

      SPECIFIC AIM 2. The second aim of the study is to explore the impact of sciatic PNB technique
      on active knee flexion postoperatively.

      H2. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB does not delay
      active knee flexion during the initial 72 hours following hamstring autograft harvest when
      compared to single-injection sciatic PNB.

      SPECIFIC AIM 3. The third aim of the study is to explore the impact of sciatic PNB technique
      on patient satisfaction with postoperative pain control.

      H3.1. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB improves patient
      satisfaction during the initial 72 hours following hamstring autograft harvest when compared
      to single-injection sciatic PNB.

    <description>If a CPI catheter is placed, the CPI catheter will be placed under ultra-sound guidance, with the tip of the catheter being placed immediately adjacent to the sciatic nerve, after the local anesthesia has been deposited. CPI catheters will only remain in-situ for 48 hours.</description>

    <description>Under ultrasound-guidance, the sciatic nerve can readily be identified in the posterior thigh. The nerve appears hyperechoic and can be traced distally to the popliteal fossa, where it divides into the tibial and common peroneal nerves. Local anesthesia is injected under real-time visualization following a negative aspiration. If a single-injection block is done, local anesthesia is deposited adjacent to the sciatic nerve within the fascial plane, but not within the epineurium. As such, single-injection sciatic PNB, which can last up to 24 hours, should provide adequate analgesia precluding the need for oral narcotic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications following ACL reconstruction with a hamstring autograft.</description>

    <description>Single-injection sciatic PNB is a regional anesthetic technique employed to anesthetize the sciatic nerve with a single dose of local anesthetic. This technique offers pain control for a limited amount of time based on the volume and concentration of local anesthetic used.</description>

    <intervention_name>Continuous sciatic PNB</intervention_name>
    <description>Continuous sciatic PNB entails placing a continuous perineural infusion (CPI) catheter so that local anesthetic may be released slowly but continuously adjacent to the sciatic nerve (perineural) for several days postoperatively. The continuous PNB has the ability to reliably provide analgesia on subsequent postoperative days.
Participants my be randomized to receive an additional experimental continuous pain ball during surgery which can provide up to 48 hours of pain relief.</description>
