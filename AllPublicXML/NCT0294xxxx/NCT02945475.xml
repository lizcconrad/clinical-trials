      This study is aimed at understanding neuroendocrine responses to different types of sugars
      and how this influences feeding behavior among lean, obese and obesity prone individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Animal studies have shown that fructose may act centrally to promote food intake. Compared to
      glucose, fructose may also be a weak suppressor of appetite due to attenuated stimulation of
      the purported satiety hormones, insulin and glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1). Moreover,
      fructose is sweeter than glucose and may stimulate central taste and reward pathways to
      promote feeding behavior. The investigators have combined functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) with hormonal and behavioral assessments to better understand the impacts of
      glucose and fructose on appetite and its central regulation in humans and have made important
      observations in lean individuals linking fructose consumption to overeating and obesity. The
      ingestion of fructose: (a) reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), a marker of neuronal activity,
      in the hypothalamus less than ingestion of glucose; (b) stimulated levels of two potential
      satiety hormones, insulin and GLP-1, less than glucose; and (c) failed to induce the satiety
      that was observed after glucose ingestion (Page et al, Journal of American Medical
      Association 2013). The investigators now propose to expand this work by examining some
      potential biological underpinnings of the different impacts of glucose and fructose
      ingestion; examining responses to combinations of glucose and fructose ingested together, as
      occurs in real life; and by examining effects of a common non-nutritive sweetener, sucralose,
      on brain and appetitive response. The investigators propose a random-order crossover design
      to determine the effects of caloric and non-nutritive sweeteners among lean, obese, and
      obesity-prone groups of participants. The investigators will measure body fat, circulating
      levels of hormones involved in satiety signaling, quantify food intake, and measure brain
      activity using blood-oxygen level dependent and arterial spin labeling methods and functional
      connectivity analyses.
