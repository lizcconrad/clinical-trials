  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is a renal injury and progressive and irreversible loss of kidney
      function and in its most advanced stage is called chronic renal failure. Although
      hemodialysis replace some kidney function, patients suffer some alterations characterized by
      &quot;uremic syndrome&quot; typically expressed by: motor neuropathy and/or autonomic neuropathy,
      cardiac or musculoskeletal myopathies, peripheral vascular changes, among others. Thus, the
      functional capacity and ability to exercise presents diminished these patients. The aim of
      this study is to verify the acute effect of low level laser therapy on the functional
      capacity of these individuals.

      The research will be developed in the hemodialysis unit of the Santa Clara hospital of Santa
      Casa de Misericordia de Porto Alegre and the patients will be evaluated before and
      immediately after the application of laser therapy protocol. Before the protocol will be
      evaluated pain in the lower limbs, Borg scale, level of physical activity through the
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and blood collection will be held for
      later analysis parameters of biochemical oxidative stress and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      damage.

      The laser therapy protocol will be applied in 6 points in quadriceps and 4 points in the
      gastrocnemius, bilaterally. After application, will be held the 6-minute walk test, effort
      subjective perception by Borg scale, assessment of pain in the lower limbs with visual analog
      scale and a new blood sample for further analysis. Patients will be randomized in two groups.
      The intervention group (IG), which will be held laser therapy and placebo group (PG), where
      the laser therapy will be placebo mode applied. The application will take place with the
      Chattanooga device, with the laser diode cluster probe from the same manufacturer consisting
      of five diodes 850 nanometers (nm) and power output of 200 milliwatts (mW). It is irradiated
      6 points in quadriceps and 4 points in gastrocnemius, bilaterally.
