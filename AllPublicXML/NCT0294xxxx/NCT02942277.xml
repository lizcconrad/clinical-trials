  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Researchers are looking for new ways to control and eradicate malaria. They want to test
      vaccines to block malaria transmission in adults in Mali. These vaccines work by inducing
      antibodies in a person. The antibody is then taken up with blood by a mosquito that bites the
      person. This blocks parasite development in the mosquito. This stops malaria transmission to
      another person.

      Objective:

      To test the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and transmission-blocking activity of the
      vaccines Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA with AS01 in Malian adults.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy Malians ages 18-50 living in certain areas in Mali who:

      Are not pregnant or breastfeeding

      Are not infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C

      Do not have evidence of immunodeficiency

      Do not have history of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Malaria Comprehension Exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Electrocardiogram (for participants in certain study groups)

      Participants will be randomly assigned to a study group.

      Participants will be monitored for 12-16 months. For the first 7 months, they will have
      between 1 and nine visits a month. The number depends on the month and on what group they are
      in. For the rest of the months, they will have 1 monthly visit.

      Each visit includes a physical exam. Most include blood tests.

      Participants will get 3 doses of a study or comparator vaccine. They get the vaccine through
      an injection in the upper arm. This occurs at their first visit, then 1 month later, and then
      5 months later.

      Participants will be followed for at least 6 months after the last vaccine.

      If participants develop an injection site rash or reaction, photographs may be taken of the
      site.

    <textblock>
      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT) would be a valuable tool for local
      elimination or eradication of this disease, and may contain components that block
      transmission to mosquitoes (such as Pfs25 or Pfs230) or that prevent human infection (such as
      the vaccine RTS,S). Pfs25 and Pfs230, surface antigens of zygotes and ookinetes (and
      gametocytes for Pfs230) in the mosquito stage of P. falciparum, are the lead candidates for a
      malaria transmission blocking vaccine (TBV). Recombinant Pfs25M and recombinant Pfs230D1M
      have each been conjugated to P. aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA) and adjuvanted with AS01. Our
      ongoing experience with Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA in Malian adult trial participants, and
      the extensive experience with the AS01 adjuvants in African children and adults, justify
      conducting the first-in-human trial of Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA with AS01 in Malian
      adults. This dose-escalating phase 1 study will determine safety, immunogenicity, and
      functional activity of these vaccines in Malian adults. Pfs25M-EPA + Pfs230D1M-EPA in AS01
      will be assessed by mosquito feeding assays in Malian adults for evidence that they may
      reduce the number of malaria transmission events in study subjects.

      A total of 305 subjects will be enrolled at multiple sites in Mali, West Africa to receive
      escalating doses of a malaria transmission blocking vaccine (s): Pfs25M-EPA/AS01,
      Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01, or simultaneous administration of Pfs25M-EPA/AS01 and Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01;
      or a comparator vaccine (ENERGIX-B). Enrollment within each group will be staggered for
      additional safety and subjects will only be enrolled into the co-administration group once
      each individual dose has been administered. Subjects will be followed for at least 6 months
      after the last vaccination. Safety outcomes will be local and systemic adverse events and
      serious adverse events. Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by
      ELISA against recombinant Pfs25, Pfs230, EPA, CSP, and B cell and T cell responses.
      Functional activity of the induced antibodies will be assessed in TBV arms by standard
      membrane feeding assays conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
      Diseases, and activity that interrupts malaria transmission will be measured in all arms by
      direct skin feeding assays in Mali.

      Subjects in the open label safety cohorts (Arms 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b) will be
      offered reenrollment for follow-up laboratory assessment to explore the duration of
      immunogenicity and functional activity at 9, 12 months post vaccination. Following scheduled,
      intentional unblinding, subjects enrolled in Arms 2c, 2d, and 4c will be provided the
      opportunity to re-enroll for a fourth vaccination (Arms 2c, 2d TBD microgram dose of
      Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01; Arm 4c Menatctra) approximately 1 year post vaccination #3. Subjects in
      these arms will also be eligible to re-enroll for follow up of duration of immunogenicity and
      functional activity at 9, 12 months post vaccination if they choose not to enroll to recive
      the booster vaccination. Subjects will be followed similarly to the previous year for safety,
      immunogenicity, and functional activity.

There are two formulations in the AS01 family: AS01B Adjuvant System and AS01E Adjuvant System. While AS01B contains 50 microgram of MPL and 50 microgram of QS-21 per one human dose, AS01E contains half the quantity of each immunoenhancer, i.e. 25 microgram of MPL and 25 microgram of QS- 21. For this study, the AS01B adjuvant will be used at a diluted concentration similar to the concentration of AS01E.</description>

             or immunosuppressive drugs within 30 days of Study Day 0.

         17. Prior to Study Day 0 and every subsequent vaccination day, receipt of a live vaccine
             within the past 4 weeks or a killed vaccine within the past 2 weeks.

         18. Receipt of immunoglobulins and/or blood products within the past 6 months.

         19. Previous receipt of an investigational malaria vaccine in the last 5 years.

         20. History of severe reaction to mosquito bites (Arms 3c, 3d, 4c only)

         21. History of allergy to the comparator vaccine (such as latex, yeast, or previous
             Hepatitis B vaccine)

         22. Known allergies or contraindications (such as significant cardiac disease; prolonged
             QTc &gt;450 ms; currently taking medications that may prolong your QTc; serious side
             effects from Coartem in the past) to study treatment (Coartem
             [artemether/lumefantrine]) (Arms 3c, 3d, 4c only)

         23. Other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or
             rights of a participant participating in the trial, interfere with the evaluation of
             the study objectives, or would render the subject unable to comply with the protocol.
