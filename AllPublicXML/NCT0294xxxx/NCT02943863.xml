  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) that uses heated and humidified oxygen was recently introduced
      for bedside care. It has been shown to be associated with reduced risks of tracheal
      intubation rates and mortality in adult hypoxic patients.

      The mechanisms of the effects of HFNC are thought to be related to the favorable effects of
      the heated and humidified gas, the high-flow rate used to minimize the entrainment of room
      air, and an increase in the ventilation efficiency, including the elimination of
      nasopharyngeal dead space, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) effects, and improvements
      in paradoxical abdominal movement. Regarding the effects on lung volume, global ventilation
      in the lungs increases during HFNC, which is thought to attribute to PEEP effects. However,
      how regional ventilation is affected during HFNC in comparison with conventional NC remains
      unknown.

      Because PEEP in mechanically ventilated patients improves the regional homogeneity of
      ventilation, investigators postulated that HFNC via PEEP effects would result in more
      homogeneous regional distributions in the ventilation changes. Investigators therefore
      assessed global and regional ventilation in patients with hypoxia receiving care via HFNC
      using electric impedance tomography and compared these results with conventional nasal
      cannula.
