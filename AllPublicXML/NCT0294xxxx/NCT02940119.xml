  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in the neck and shoulders is a musculoskeletal disorder that affects a significant
      number of individuals.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of PBMT (with a device
      that combines low level laser therapy and light emitting diode therapy) in chronic pain
      relief of musculoskeletal origin in the neck and shoulders area.

    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was carried out. Seventy-two
      patients with chronic pain in neck and shoulder were recruited and randomized into two groups
      (n = 36 each group), one group received active PBMT and another group received placebo PBMT
      (with a device with same appearance of the actual laser, including any visible light).
      Patients were treated at 9 different sites of 3 zones in the neck and shoulders area, twice a
      week during 3 consecutive weeks with a PBMT device manufactured by Multi Radiance Medical™
      (Solon - OH, USA). Primary outcome was intensity of pain using the Visual Analog Pain Scale
      (VAS), secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM) of the neck and shoulders and patient
      satisfaction with therapy employed.

          -  neck and/or shoulder pain is of benign musculoskeletal origin wherein the etiology is
             sprain strain and/or muscle spasms;

          -  neck/shoulder pain is episodic chronic, defined as having occurred and recurred over
             regular or irregular periods or intervals of time, persisting over at least the last 3
             months;

          -  self-reported Degree of Pain rating on the 0-100 VAS pain scale for the neck-shoulder
             region is 50 or greater;

          -  subject is willing and able to maintain his or her current pre-study neck/shoulder
             pain management regimen of pain relief medication and/or treatment/therapy use
             throughout the course of study duration, whilst refraining from consuming other types
             of medication and/or prescription medication(s) and/or herbal supplements intended for
