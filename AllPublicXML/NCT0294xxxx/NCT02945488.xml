  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to: 1) Assess the independent and synergistic efficacy of exercise and
      nutrition interventions to manage major symptomatic concerns of inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD), 2) Assess the independent and synergistic efficacy of exercise and nutrition to
      mitigate inflammation in IBD, and 3) Assess the feasibility of such an intervention in
      preconception women with IBD. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of
      anti-inflammatory exercise and nutritional interventions will have a synergistic effect on
      managing major symptomatic concerns associated with IBD, reducing inflammation, and improving
      fertility status in preconception women with IBD, as compared to either intervention
      independently.

      Potential participants will be recruited from the Preconception and Pregnancy Clinic recently
      established within the Saskatchewan Multidisciplinary Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic
      [MDIBDC]. Eligible participants will be randomized [stratified] to one of four groups: 1)
      Exercise and dietary plan, 2) Exercise and no dietary plan, 3) Stretching [placebo exercise]
      and dietary plan, 4) Stretching and no dietary plan. Participants will be assessed at
      baseline, midway [3 months], and post-intervention [6 months] for indications of disease
      activity, quality of life, fertility status, and bone health.

    <description>Exercise intervention will entail 30 minutes of moderate intensity cardiovascular training 3 days/week and full body resistance training 2 days/week (supervised). Cardiovascular training will entail any weight-bearing activity that would achieve target heart rate, such as walking, jogging, stair climbing, dancing, etc. Resistance training will entail 2-3 sets of 8-12 repetitions of exercises targeting all major muscle groups with an external load applied, such as a dumbbell, barbell, medicine ball, etc.</description>
