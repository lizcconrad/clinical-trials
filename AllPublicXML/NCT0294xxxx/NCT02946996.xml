  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects that the study drugs (metformin and OPC)
      have on AGE levels in patients with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGEs are a type of metabolite, or substance, found in the food. The AGE content in food is
      determined by the types of food you eat and also how you prepare your food. The researchers
      helping conduct this study have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to see if certain drugs (metformin and OPC) have an effect on the
      AGE levels in your blood and to see if those AGE levels have an effect on your cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Subjects may have

          -  Subjects must be receiving ADT with a LHRH agonist or antagonist, with or without an
             anti-androgen. Subjects whose ADT is interrupted may enroll or continue on study as
             long as the testosterone is documented to remain &lt;50ng/dL. The ADT treatment must be
             the first or second line of systemic therapy, and may be given as adjuvant therapy, or
             as treatment for recurrent cancer.

          -  Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function at baseline, as
             follows:

               -  Hematology parameters: ANC &gt;1500/mcL, platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL, Hgb &gt;8.0gm/dL

               -  Renal Function: Creatinine &lt;1.8mg/mL

                  &lt;2.5xULN

          -  Prior radiation therapy allowed

          -  Subjects may have diabetes mellitus but must not be taking metformin.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 - 2

          -  Ability to sign written informed consent

          -  Documented testosterone level must be maintained during treatment &lt;50ng/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to grapes or grape seed

          -  Known hypersensitivity or intolerance to metformin.

          -  Any condition associated with increased risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis
             (e.g. congestive heart failure defined as NYHA Class III or IV functional status,
             history of acidosis of any type; habitual intake of 3 or more alcoholic beverages per
             day).

          -  More than two courses or combinations of ADT agents, or prior chemotherapy for
             metastatic prostate cancer.

          -  Current use of metformin, or strong antioxidants.
