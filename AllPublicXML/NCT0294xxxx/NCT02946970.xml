  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study the brain mechanisms underlying the effect of subliminal (not
      consciously perceived) intragastric administration of bitter tastants on hunger and food
      intake, which was previously found. The investigators will assess brain activation patterns
      after an acute intragastric administration of Quinine-hydrochloride versus saline on two
      different test days, and will simultaneously assess a putative role of altered gut peptide
      release in these effects. The hypothesis is that intragastric infusion of a bitter agonist
      will decrease the activity in homeostatic and hedonic brain regions and that this effect is
      mediated by gut peptide release.
