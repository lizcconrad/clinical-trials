    <textblock>
      Broad Goal: To demonstrate that focused vascular ultrasound (FOVUS) can accurately risk
      stratify patients with chest pain in the emergency department (ED).

      Background and Rationale: Traditional risk assessment focuses on characteristics of the pain,
      known Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), risk factors, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests
      to identify active ischemia. Identifying clinically significant CAD remains one of the most
      challenging tasks in the ED. Current clinical decision rules err on the side of over
      investigation and admission. To address this limitation, the Investigators have developed a
      point-of-care carotid ultrasound test predictive of CAD. The Investigators have shown that
      carotid plaque is strongly associated with significant angiographic CAD in a population
      referred for angiogram.

      Research Aims:

      Primary - To determine the association between carotid plaque measured by a dedicated
      sonographer and 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including MI, reperfusion, or
      death in patients presenting to the ED with suspected cardiac ischemia.

      Secondary - To determine the agreement sonographer and emergency physician FOVUS results.

      Methodology: The Investigators propose a prospective cohort study to assess the prognostic
      value of a novel point-of-care carotid ultrasound plaque quantification protocol in the ED of
      Kingston General Hospital. We will enroll 500 consecutive patients presenting with a chief
      complaint of chest pain prompting at least one 12-lead ECG and troponin measurement. Patients
      will undergo carotid scan by a dedicated sonographer and emergency physician. Patients will
      be followed for MACE for 30 days. Those performing scans will be blinded to clinician's
      impression and care plans while clinicians will be blinded to FOVUS findings. The primary
      analysis will involve determination of the sensitivity, sensitivity, positive predictive
      value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratios associated with FOVUS for 30-day MACE.

      Expected Outcomes: The study will provide evidence to determine whether FOVUS may be a useful
      prognostic tool for emergency physicians assessing patients with suspected ischemic chest
      pain. The secondary analysis will provide evidence to determine whether emergency physicians
      can be trained to measure carotid plaque height accurately when compared to the gold standard
      ultrasonographer measurement.

      Significance: If FOVUS can reliably identify very low risk patients, implementation of this
      novel tool could reduce ED length of stay, monitoring, and overcrowding.
