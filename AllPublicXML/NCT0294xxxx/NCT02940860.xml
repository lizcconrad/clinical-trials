      Evaluation of safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside compared to iron sucrose in subjects
      with IDA and NDD-CKD.

    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common problem associated with many chronic diseases such
      as chronic kidney disease (CKD). IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL)
      burden on the subjects, and treatment of these subjects includes treatment of its underlying
      cause and restoration of haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and iron stores.

      This study is planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iron isomaltoside compared to
      iron sucrose in subjects with IDA and NDD-CKD.

          2. Hb ≤ 11 g/dL

          3. Chronic renal impairment, as defined by either (i) eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 at
             screening (as calculated by modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD)), or (ii)
             eGFR &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73m2 at screening and kidney damage as indicated by abnormalities
             in urine composition per medical history and/or intermediate/high risk of
             cardio-vascular disease based on the Framingham model

          4. Screening s-ferritin ≤ 100 ng/mL, or ≤ 300 ng/mL if TSAT ≤ 30 %

        Exclusion Criteria includes:

          1. Anaemia predominantly caused by factors other than IDA

          2. Hemochromatosis or other iron storage disorders

          3. Previous serious hypersensitivity reactions to any IV iron compounds

          4. Prior to screening or during the trial period; has or will be treated with a red blood
             cell transfusion, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy

          5. Undergoing dialysis for treatment of CKD

          6. Planned surgical procedure within the trial period
