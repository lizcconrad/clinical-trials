  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will develop and pilot a fourteen-day assessment tailored for the
      high-demand schedule of residents through a smart phone intervention, EmoTrak.EmoTrak uses
      ecological measurement assessment (EMA), which solicits real-time user feedback at various
      time points across a series of days or weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial that compares residents, using
      EmoTrak with a wait list control group. After two weeks, the active control group becomes the
      treatment group. All participants will be evaluated four times from at baseline to two
      months. The measures to explore for any pre and post change are stress reduction on the
      emotional exhaustion scale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and improved resilience on
      the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).

    <description>The EMA intervention uses twice-a-day interactive questions for emotion tracking including type of emotion, intensity of emotion, trigger to emotion and response to emotion through an Iphone app designed for the study. The study users receive individualized feedback about their daily reporting of emotions, sleep and stress.The study tracking is for 14 days.</description>
