  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Results of a recently completed National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded trial of an
      intervention, Forever Free: Stop Smoking for Good, revealed high efficacy throughout the 24-
      month follow-up period, further supporting the utility of extended self-help for promoting
      and maintaining tobacco abstinence. Investigators have recognized that wide-scale
      implementation, and therefore public health impact, would be enhanced by the availability of
      a Spanish-language version to reach the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority
      population of smokers.

      The goal of this study is to address this gap by testing a Spanish-language version of the
      validated self-help smoking cessation intervention. If demonstrated effective, the proposed
      intervention would represent an easily disseminable and low-cost intervention with
      significant public health impact for Hispanic/Latino smokers throughout the United States.
      The aims of this project are to test the efficacy of a Spanish-language version of a
      validated, extended self-help intervention for smoking cessation among Spanish-speaking
      smokers against usual care control. Participants (N = 1400) recruited nationally will be
      randomized to the two arms.
