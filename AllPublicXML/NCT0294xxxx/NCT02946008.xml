    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm prospective non-randomized, non-blinded trial to assess the safety of
      neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) before surgery in high risk prostate
      cancer patients.

      Radiation therapy will be delivered over 5 treatment sessions for approximately 1.5 weeks
      total.
