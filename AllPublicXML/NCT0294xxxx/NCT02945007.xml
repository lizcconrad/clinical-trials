    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of 1 to 3 concept
      formulations of JNJ-53718678 compared to the currently existing oral solution, and to assess
      the effect of food on the bioavailability of 1 to 3 oral concept formulations of JNJ-53718678
      when administered as a single oral dose of 500 milligram (mg) in healthy adult participants.
