  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of a redesigned tethered
      capsule catheter that contains an integrated micro-motor. Investigators will be testing
      imaging of this new technology in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10 healthy volunteers will be enrolled and asked to swallow the Distal Scanning Capsule. The
      subjects will be awake and un-sedated.

      The capsule is attached to a string like tether which allows the operator to control as well
      as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using natural propulsive force
      called peristalsis.

      As the capsule progresses through the esophagus, multiple images of the esophagus are
      acquired in real time to be analyzed later.
