    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled trial comparing exoskeleton gait training with standard gait
      training or no gait training in community-dwelling participants with chronic incomplete
      spinal cord injury
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community dwelling iSCI participants may improve clinical gait function by engaging in a gait
      training regimen, where robotic exoskeletons can readily deliver a precise dose and
      simultaneously reduce the physical stress imposed on therapists using conventional manually
      assisted stepping practice. Exoskeleton training is predicted to improve function in
      participants receiving usual care, but not superior to intensity-matched manual training. The
      rationale to implement exoskeleton robotics as preference in gait training is based on
      precision dosing, over-ground training, and reduced therapist burden for high repetition
      training.

      The investigators aim to demonstrate that Ekso exoskeleton training can significantly improve
      gait speed in stable chronic, community-dwelling incomplete SCI (iSCI) participants. The
      objectives of this study are the following:

      A. Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate that a 12 week robotic gait training regimen can lead to a clinically
      meaningful improvement in independent gait speed on the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT) in
      community dwelling participants with chronic iSCI.

      B. Secondary Objectives:

        1. To examine the economic factors such as number of physical therapists/staff required
           during training.

        2. To analyze the physical burden on therapists assisting and supervising during training.

        3. To study the influence of factors that may modify the gait recovery in the chronic
           incomplete SCI population (demographic, clinical, functional, psychological, balance,
           etc.).
