  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presented study investigates standardized visual cueing in reading and visual spatial
      task as a treatment method for spatial neglect. In a randomized controlled design patients
      receive either cued reading and visual spatial tasks (intervention) or treatment which is
      unspecific to neglect (control).

      In the intervention condition, patients with left-sided neglect receive intense training,
      including reading and visual spatial task with standardized and adapted visual cueing by the
      therapist. Improvements in reading and visual spatial tasks lead to a reduction of cues by
      the therapist. Accordingly, the patient has to apply self-cueing over time in order to solve
      the task.

      For the control condition, all patients receive unspecific treatment without any standardized
      adapted cueing implemented by the therapist.

      To enhance the effectivity of cueing in reading and visual spatial tasks, the investigators
      additionally conduct parietal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in those
      patients without tDCS exclusion criteria (see exclusion criteria below).

      It is hypothesised that systematic and adaptive therapeutic cueing leads to a significant
      reduction of omissions of word and word parts in reading.

      UPDATE: No Add-on tDCS was performed since it was not applicable for our severly impaired
      patients due to the strict exclusion criteria of tDCS.
