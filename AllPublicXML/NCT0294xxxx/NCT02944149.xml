  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to demonstrate
      that tubal ligations by minilaparotomy (ML) conducted by trained clinical officers (COs) are
      no less safe as compared to those conducted by assistant medical officers (AMOs) in Tanzania.
      Participants will be randomized in a one to one ratio to ML by a CO and ML by an AMO. In
      addition to the screening and enrollment/ML visit, there will be three scheduled follow-up
      visits at 3, 7 and 42 days post-surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to establish whether the safety of ML provided by trained COs is not
      inferior to the safety of ML provided by trained AMOs, as measured by rates of major adverse
      events (AEs) among women undergoing ML. The primary outcome is safety, defined by the overall
      rate of major AEs following ML. The investigators will address the primary objective by
      comparing the rate of major AEs observed following MLs conducted by COs vs. AMOs during the
      ML procedure and through 42 days follow-up. This study will be conducted among 1,970 women 18
      years of age and older presenting at study sites for ML surgery. The duration of a woman's
      participation in the study is expected to be 6 weeks, unless additional follow-up beyond 42
      days is clinically indicated due to complications or for other reasons. The study will be
      conducted in Arusha Region in northern Tanzania. The following health facilities will serve
      as study sites: Daraja Health Centre, Karatu Hospital, Kaloleni Health Centre, Levolosi Urban
      Health Centre, Longido Health Centre, Monduli Hospital, and Mto wa Mbu Health Centre.

    <description>Experimental: clinical officer (CO) In Tanzania, COs are mid-level providers who offer diagnosis, treatment, and minor surgeries. They are more common in rural areas than medical officers (MOs) and assistant medical officers (AMOs) and are generally considered capable of performing minor surgery. Almost all facilities in Tanzania are understaffed, but COs vastly outnumber MOs and AMOs. COs are more prevalent in poorer and/or rural areas than other higher level cadres; thus, task-shifting to COs would increase access to tubal ligation by minilaparotomy for many women who are most in need.</description>
