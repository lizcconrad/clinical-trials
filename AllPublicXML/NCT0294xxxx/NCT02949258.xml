    <textblock>
      Scirrhous gastric cancer, also known as linitis plastic or Borrmann type 4, is an aggressive
      tumor with an extremely poor prognosis. Aggressive surgical procedures and adjuvant
      chemotherapies have not improved the survival rate. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether neoadjuvant Chemotherapy with SEEOX regimen via intra-arterial and intravenous
      administration are effective in the treatment of Borrmann type 4 gastric cancer.

      Gastric cancer patients who diagnosed as Borrmann type 4 would be included in this study.They
      would receive 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with SEEOX regimen via combined
      intra-arterial and intravenous administration. The treatment schedule consisted of 3 courses
      (each, 2-week administration and 1-week withdrawal) of intra-arterial administration of
      oxaliplatin (150mg), etoposide (100mg) and epirubicin(30mg) by Seldinger method on day 1 and
      oral S-1(120mg) on days 1-14, followed by radical surgery.The efficacy and toxicity of SEEOX
      regimen would be examined.

    <description>A three-cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be performed in all cases. In every cycle, oxaliplatin 150 mg, etoposide 100 mg and epirubicin 50 mg will be administered from the celiac artery on day 1. Oral S-1 120 mg per day will be given for days 1-14. The second cycle will be scheduled following a 1-week rest after the first cycle.After two courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients will be reevaluated and receive curative or palliative resection or exploratory laparotomy within 14 days after completing the second course of chemotherapy.</description>
