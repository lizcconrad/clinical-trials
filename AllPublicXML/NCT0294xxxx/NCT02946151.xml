  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-phase study, which aims to investigate the performance of a novel
      electrode type in detecting epileptic seizures. The electrode is designed for subcutaneous
      implantation with long-term monitoring in mind.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The problem of unrecognized seizures is common for certain types of epilepsy.
      Electroencephalography (EEG) is an excellent method for seizure identification and
      recognition, but until now, it has not been feasible to perform EEG recordings for more than
      a few days outside a hospital or laboratory. A novel device has been developed, which might
      remedy that. The device is a EEG-electrode for subcutaneous implantation connected to an
      external data storage device.

      The investigators in this study hypothesize that this device might be a useful tool for
      ultra-long-term epilepsy monitoring. The study aims to investigate that. While the device
      might be used to diagnose epilepsy, it is more likely to be a good observation tool and that
      is what the study aims to determine.

      Subjects include patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and high seizure frequency.
      These will have the device implanted. Study phase 1 is a proof of concept to determine
      whether the device is actually able to detect epileptic seizures. This will take place during
      admission and be performed as simultaneous recordings with ordinary scalp EEG and the
      investigational device. Study phase 2 is a home monitoring to prove that devices actually
      provides clinically useful information regarding seizures in an outpatient setting.

      The study requires 9 visits from each subject over the course of 4-6 months. The
      investigational device will be explanted after approximately 75 days of wear.

      Because of the huge amounts of EEGraphical data generated from the very long-term monitoring,
      an automated seizure detection algorithm will be developed specifically for this device. The
      algorithm will be trained on known data and adjusted along the way if deemed necessary. All
      findings from the automated algorithm will be double-checked by a
      neurophysiologist/neurologist.

      Data regarding sleep quality will be collected in part by actigraphy and in part by daily
      questionnaires delivered by smartphone. Cognitive performance testing, seizure
      log/description and medication log will also be handled via a specially designed smartphone
      app.
