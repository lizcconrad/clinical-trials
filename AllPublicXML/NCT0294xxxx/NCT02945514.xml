      -  Answer personal questions including such things as health information, eating habits and
           preferences, activity level and intensity.

        -  Submit a first stool sample via a self-addressed, postage-paid kit that is mailed to
           you.

        -  Attend one of the 2 hour connection meetings based on available dates.

        -  The study team will collect vitals: measurements of height, weight, blood pressure,
           pulse, waist and hip circumference.

        -  You will have a Blood collection for study (approximately 35 ml of blood/5 tubes)

        -  You will be provided a FitBit wrist band that you will wear

        -  You will be provided a manual blood glucose monitor you will use for pricking finger and
           measuring blood sugar level at least 4 times per day.

        -  You will have a continuous blood glucose sensor and monitor inserted by study staff.

        -  You will use DayTwo's mobile application where you will input food eaten, activity,
           measurements, medications, and sleep.

        -  You will be given a second stool kit and instructions for collection.

        -  You will be asked to eat 4 breakfasts consisting of either bagels and cream cheese or
           cereal. These foods will be provided for you. Other than these four breakfasts, we would
           like you to follow your normal eating habits during the collection week.
