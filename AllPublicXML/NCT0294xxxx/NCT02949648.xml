  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      evidence on the impact of e-cigarette use on smoking and quitting among smoking youth in Hong
      Kong.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are from a cohort of Youth Quitline callers and smoking youth (N=200) in Hong Kong.
      The longitudinal study will investigate the effects of baseline e-cigarette use on quitting
      (including relapse), nicotine addiction and intention to smoke at 12-month telephone
      follow-up. A qualitative study will be conducted on 10 ex- and 10 current smokers to
      supplement and facilitate interpretation of the quantitative findings.

    <measure>7-day point prevalence abstinence assessed in the telephone follow-up survey</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after baseline survey</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) is a validated, commonly used measure of smoking cessation. Subjects who reports no smoking in the preceding 7 days at the time of 12-month survey in the follow-up are regarded as quitters.
This measure has serval advantages compared to continuous abstinence. First, it can include smokers who take delayed action and quit. It also allows relapses to occur in the follow up period, without classifying smokers as permanent failure. Third, it does not rely on recall of past events happened long ago.</description>
