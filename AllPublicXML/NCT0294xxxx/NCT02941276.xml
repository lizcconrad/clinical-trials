      This trial is looking at using an intra-oral electrostimulating device for the management of
      radiotherapy-induced dry mouth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth is a common complaint of radiotherapy for cancer of the head and neck region. It is
      a distressing often persistent condition which can lead to longlasting oral discomfort,
      dental infections, diminished quality of life, social isolation and loneliness.
      Unfortunately, current therapies of dry mouth are often unsatisfactory, expensive and may
      result in adverse effects. A novel intraoral electronic device has recently been developed to
      treat dry mouth. The device, acting as a &quot;salivary pacemaker&quot;, harmlessly stimulates nerves
      of the salivary glands and does not cause adverse side effects. The aim of this proposal is
      to assess the longterm effects of such a device in this population, which have yet to be
      investigated, to demonstrate whether its daily application is an effective method of
      lessening dry mouth and improving life quality. 84 individuals will be enrolled in the study
      to use the device for 12 months, after receiving appropriate instructions. 42 participants
      (out of 84) will act as controls as they will receive a sham device that will not deliver
      electric stimuli but only tactile stimulation (like using a chewing gum). All participants
      will be allowed to continue using their routine local therapy for dry mouth (e.g. artificial
      saliva) during the study. Each participant will keep a diary relevant to the frequency of use
      and potential changes in dry mouth sensation. Participants will also be asked to attend
      hospital appointments to measure changes in saliva production and complete questionnaires on
      their dry mouth and quality of life. The device has the potential to radically change current
      clinical practice. If the trial is successful, the use of the device will provide patients
      having radiation-induced dry mouth with a safe and drug-free therapeutic modality.
