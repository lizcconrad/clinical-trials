  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term effects of endovenous steam ablation
      (EVSA). Postoperative data at 3-4 year follow-up will be collected from patients treated with
      EVSA.

    <textblock>
      Endovenous steam ablation (EVSA) of saphenous veins (saphenous vein reflux) is one of the
      endothermal methods in the modern treatment of venous insufficiency. Good results and
      long-term follow-up have been published for endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA), while long-term effects of EVSA are less documented.
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of EVSA in 200 consecutive
      patients treated with EVSA and conduct prospective evaluations at 3-4 year follow-up.
      Standardized and validated measures will be compared to preoperative measures to evaluate
      change in patient-reported and clinical outcomes over time.
