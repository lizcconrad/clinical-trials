  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta is considered a severe pregnancy complication that may be associated with
      massive and potentially life-threatening intrapartum and postpartum hemorrhage.
      Life-threatening bleeding is the most common complication to be associated with this
      condition; the average blood loss at time of delivery is reported to be 3000-5500 mL, which
      leads to significant postoperative morbidity and death.
