    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study will determine the natural history of fetal exposure to Zika
      virus (ZIKV) and its effects on the fetus and newborn with emphasis on neurodevelopment
      outcome. Exposure of the fetus will be determined by maternal symptomatology, RT-PCR ZIKV
      (blood and urine) and serologic test specific for ZIKV. Neonates will be classified according
      to trimester of infection and as exposed and unexposed to ZIKV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with Zika Virus (ZIKV) is an emerging disease in South America and a serious public
      health problem due to a high prevalence of one of the vectors that transmit the virus, Aedes
      Aegypti, and the severe and sometimes fatal complications that can be generated in the fetus
      of women infected by the virus during their pregnancy. Retrospective studies have shown an
      association with microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum,
      and other anomalies of the central nervous system (CNS). The high risk of neurodevelopmental
      impairment in the exposed newborn is a major concern.

      The epidemiologic and neurobiological evidence supporting the link between infection of
      pregnant women, trimester of infection, and the development of such anomalies in the fetus is
      growing to the extent that the Center for Disease Control has officially made a statement
      supporting this association. Although the dimension of the public health impact is still
      unknown, limited prospective data makes counseling of pregnant women difficult, especially
      when they are considering termination of pregnancy.

      Given that evidence supporting the neurotropic quality of ZIKV and the potential variations
      of the effect the virus may have on the developing fetal brain according to the gestational
      age of infection, we have designed a prospective cohort study to determine whether exposure
      of the fetus to ZIKV in symptomatic mothers results in fetal CNS anomalies and/or impaired
      neurodevelopmental outcome of the newborn. As a secondary aim we will determine the effect
      gestational age has on severity of CNS anomalies and neurodevelopmental outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women who on their first prenatal visit (independent of gestational age)
             confirm through a pre-designed questionnaire that they have had any symptom(s)
             compatible with ZIKV infection (rash [exanthema or sprout], conjunctivitis, arthralgia
             or myalgia, fever). Pregnant women with an affirmative response will be categorized in
             two groups:

               -  Acute Infection: symptoms of ZIKV infection that occurred within the previous 14
                  days of the day the pregnant women attended her prenatal visit.

               -  Late Infection: symptoms of ZIKV infection that occurred more then 14 days from
                  her prenatal visit. Gestational age of onset of symptomatology will be documented
                  at this time.

          2. Pregnant women without symptoms of ZIKV infection who have a negative RT-PCR for ZIKV
             and a negative specific serologic test for ZIKV at initial prenatal visit with normal
             prenatal evaluation. These pregnant women will be selected from non high-risk delivery
             services.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Eligible pregnant women that refuse to sign consent for participation in the ZEN
             Initiative.

          2. Enrolled pregnant women that withdraw their consent to participate at any time in the
             study.
