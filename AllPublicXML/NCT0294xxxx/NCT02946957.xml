  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) pain affects 50 percent of older adults, more than half of whom also
      experience significant sleep disturbance. This randomized trial will determine whether a
      telephone-based cognitive behavioral treatment targeting insomnia in older adults with
      chronic severe OA-related insomnia and pain results in substantially greater reductions in
      insomnia severity and in related improvements in pain, fatigue, mood, quality of life and
      healthcare costs compared to telephone-delivered education (attention control) about
      insomnia. The trial will test an intervention that if demonstrated to have long term efficacy
      is scalable and has the potential for wide-scale deployment in healthcare systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five percent of older adults experience significant osteoarthritis (OA)-related
      comorbid sleep disturbance. Insomnia is associated with substantial negative effects on
      function, mood, and medical resource utilization. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia
      (CBT-I) is evidence based and has been shown to be efficacious in populations with a variety
      of comorbid conditions including OA-related chronic pain. However, in-person CBT
      interventions are unlikely to be widely deployable in healthcare systems. Telephone delivery
      has the advantage of giving patients access to personalized, efficacious CBT-I interventions
      from home, increasing generalizability, and outreach to minority, rural, and other
      underserved populations. Older (60+ yrs) primary care patients across Washington State will
      be screened for severe persistent OA-related insomnia and pain. Two hundred and seventy
      patients will be randomized to either CBT-I or an education only attention control (EOC).
      Each treatment will consist of six 20-30 minute telephone-based sessions over an eight week
      period. Pre-treatment, post-treatment (2 months and 12 month) assessments will include
      measures of sleep, pain, fatigue, mood, and quality of life. A cost effectiveness evaluation
      of the intervention will also be conducted. The proposed research will determine if telephone
      CBT-I improves OA insomnia and associated outcomes in a state-wide primary care population of
      older adults, and inform policy decisions about widespread dissemination of telephone CBT-I
      in this and related patient populations.
