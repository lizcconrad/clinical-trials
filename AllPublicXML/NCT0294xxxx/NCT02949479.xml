  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Adverse childhood experience have been described in sexual offenders but the link
      with the offence need to be further investigated. Investigators postulate that one of the
      clinical moderating factors could be dissociative experience, a consequence of these early
      adverse experiences reactivated during the offence. The purpose of the study is to estimate
      the prevalence of clinical dissociation during the offence in a male adult population
      referred to our center for a sexual offence and to explore its correlations with
      epidemiological and clinical data (personal, legal history, psychiatric comorbidities),
      clinical trauma and dissociation, prognosis estimates.

      The study will be proposed to the subjects after their usual clinical evaluation in the
      center for sexual offence and to extend this evaluation by a specific focus on childhood
      abuse and neglect trauma and dissociative history. After receiving complete information, the
      participants will sign the consent form and be referred to a unique on-site visit of
      approximately 2 hours long. During this visit, the participants will benefit from a
      psychiatric examination in search for clinical features of dissociation during the offence,
      lifetime dissociative experience, lifetime post-traumatic stress disorder; they will have to
      complete bioevaluation forms for dissociation (Dissociative Experience Scale) and childhood
      abuse and neglect (Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse). After this completion, they will
      benefit from a second part psychiatric examination, so as to complete the assessment and
      answer their questions if any.
