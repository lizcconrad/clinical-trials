      1. To describe the average labor curve and establish new labor progression standards. The
           investigator will investigate the current characteristics of obstetric population and
           the labor progression with obstetric intervention in China. The investigator compare the
           different effects of traditional labor progression management model, new labor
           progression management model and active labor progression management model on labor
           outcomes. Based on the best outcomes of maternity and infants, the investigator will
           establish and modify new labor progression which is suitable for Chinese.

        2. Cesarean section rates: Based on big data, the investigator will introduce the
           international advanced Robson class method and identify the appropriate level of
           cesarean section rate for each type population.the investigator compare cesarean section
           rates of different level hospitals and evaluate the effects of reducing cesarean section
           rates. The investigator also analyze the risk factors of cesarean section rates of the
           ten Robson classification, which will provide basis for reducing cesarean section rates
           under the new strategy.

        3. Establishment of &quot;Chinese maternal-fetal medical collaboration network&quot; and mobile
           application software (APP) to promote natural childbirth: The investigator establish
           perinatal data center using the hospital information system (HIS) system of hospital.
           The investigator predict the cesarean section rates and relative factors using the
           Robson classification method, and propose the new strategy of reducing cesarean section
           rates. Meanwhile, the investigator develop the quality management system toolkit which
           can help clinicians standardize behavior and improve obstetric safety.

    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels. It is usually expressed in terms of the systolic (maximum) pressure over diastolic (minimum) pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Normal resting systolic (diastolic) blood pressure in an adult is approximately 120 mmHg (80 mmHg), abbreviated &quot;120/80 mmHg&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Apgar scale is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10.</description>
