  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is a poorly understood, serious, and emerging complication for adult
      patients with sickle cell disease. Because there is extensive microvascular damage from
      oxidative damage in sickle cell disease, the investigators hypothesize that this is also
      present in the cerebral microvasculature to cause cognitive impairment. The investigators
      plan to test this by correlating markers of inflammation and oxidative damage with cognitive
      performance and 7 Tesla brain MRI microvascular findings in these patients, with the long
      term goal of understanding the mechanisms and risk factors of cognitive impairment in sickle
      cell disease.

      The Neurovascular Determinants of Cognitive Function in Adults with Sickle Cell Disease is a
      study for adults 18 and older who have been diagnosed with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Many
      adult patients with SCD suffer from cognitive impairment (CI), a serious complication
      responsible for severe functional limitations, and whose pathogenesis, risk factors, and
      natural history are unknown. This research project will look at cognitive performance and 7
      Tesla brain MRI findings along with markers of inflammation and oxidation to better
      understand the mechanism and risk factors. The investigators will complete a baseline
      assessment. SCD participants will be seen for follow-up at 3 and 5 years. Non-SCD
      participants will be seen for follow-up at 3 years. All assessments are completed at no cost
      and there is compensation for participation.
