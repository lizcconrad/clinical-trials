  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is on one hand to verify the measurement conformity of the IRAP
      dosage and on the other hand to obtain normal values of the blood IRAP concentration on
      healthy volunteers.

      This study consists of two visits, from two to five days apart.

      The first visit :

        -  Healthy volunteers will be on an empty stomach.

        -  they will have a clinical examination, blood tests and blood samples will be taken to
           constitute a blood collection. the IRAP concentration will be measured with those
           samples.

      The second visit : This visit will take place in an interval from 2 to 5 days after the first
      visit.

        -  Subjects will be on an empty stomach

        -  An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 3 hours will be performed. Blood samples will
           be taken three time 15 minutes apart at Baseline (before taking the glucose). And then
           after the glucose intake, blood sample will be taken every 15 minutes to measure
           insulinemia, blood glucose, and IRAP concentration.
