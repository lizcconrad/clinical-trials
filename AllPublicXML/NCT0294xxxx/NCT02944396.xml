  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of veliparib in combination
      with nivolumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel or
      carboplatin/pemetrexed) (Phase 1 portion) and to assess whether the addition of nivolumab to
      veliparib in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy results will improve progression
      free survival (PFS) compared to veliparib with platinum doublet chemotherapy alone in
      participants with metastatic or advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Phase 2
      portion).

             (anti-PD-1), or PD Ligand-1 (PD-L1) or PD Ligand-2 (PD-L2) agent or an antibody
             targeting other immunoregulatory receptors or mechanisms.

             or antineoplastic biologic therapy within 21 days, or major surgery within 21 days, or
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy within 7 days, or palliative radiation within 7 days
