    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted to evaluate the safety of a study drug given by injection under the
      skin to healthy participants and participants with type 2 diabetes. It will also investigate
      how the body processes the study drug and the effect of the study drug on blood sugar levels.
      Information about any side effects and tolerability will be documented. This study is
      approximately 30 days for each participant, not including screening. Screening is required
      within 28 days prior to the start of the study.

          -  Male participants with female partners who can become pregnant must agree to use an
             effective method of birth control during the study and for 4 months after study drug
             dosing

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 18.5 kilogram per square meter (kg/m²)
