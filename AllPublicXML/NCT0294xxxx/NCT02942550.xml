    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impact of the peripheral opioid antagonist methylnaltrexone on
      the onset of effect of ticagrelor in morphine treated patients with ST elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI). Half of the participants will receive methylnaltrexone, while the other
      half will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rate of drug absorption in the gastro-intestinal tract is often determined by the rate of
      gastric emptying. Morphine treatment, which is frequently given in order to relieve pain in
      patients with STEMI, is known to delay gastric emptying, and has indeed emerged as a
      predictor of delayed/poor antiplatelet response in patients receiving oral prasugrel or
      ticagrelor.

      In recent years, morphine has been found to delay the onset of oral P2Y12-inhibitors. To
      counteract this, the investigators hypothesized that an opioid antagonist may be used. The
      opioid antagonist naloxone has previously been shown to reduce the morphine induced delay in
      gastric emptying However, naloxone crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reduces the pain
      relieving effects of morphine. In contrast, the morphine antagonist methylnaltrexone has a
      reduced passage over the BBB and acts primarily as a peripheral morphine antagonist without
      affecting the morphine-mediated central analgesic effects.

      The aim of the planned study is to evaluate whether methylnaltrexone bromide may reduce the
      morphine induced delay in onset of platelet inhibition after a loading dose of 180 mg
      ticagrelor in morphine treated patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI), where a rapid and adequate platelet inhibition after the administration
      of ticagrelor is crucial. As morphine is an inclusion criterion, all patients included in the
      study will be on morphine treatment. Thus, morphine treatment is not an intervention to be
      administered as part of the protocol. Stratification according to inferior and
      anterior/lateral STEMI will be perform to avoid imbalance in the location of myocardial
      infarction between the groups.
