      Six month, five visit study of plaque, gingivitis, and tooth whitening with three randomized
      intervention groups using FDA marketed and approved products and devices. One hundred fifty
      (150) subjects from the patient base of 10 PEARL Network associated dental offices on the
      East Coast of the United States will be entered into the clinical research study. This is a
      post-marketing comparative effectiveness research study. Having a total of 5 visits over a
      six month period. Adverse events and side effects for the products used are being assessed.
