  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The accumulation and maturation of oral biofilm in the gingival margin is widely recognised
      to be the primary aetiological factor in the development of chronic gingivitis. Based on this
      association, the current treatment of gingivitis is focused on biofilm disruption, which will
      normally include mechanical processes, both professionally and at home. However, for
      patients, it is not easy to achieve a proper level of plaque control. The efficient plaque
      control techniques are very time consuming and require a special motivation and skills for
      their optimum use. It was at this point where mouthwashes become important, due to the fact
      that they include diverse types of antimicrobial agents to complement the results of
      mechanical oral hygiene measures.

      The essential oils have been presented as a realiable alternative to the &quot;gold Standard&quot;
      (Chlorhexidine). However, it use has been limited clinically due to their alcohol contain.
      Some years ago, a new alternative without alcohol has been launched to the market. This
      formulation has not been already deeply tested specific antiplaque studies in which the
      structure of the biofilm remained intact.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the in situ antiplaque effect of 2 antimicrobial agents
      (based on an essential oils formulation with and without alcohol) in the short term with a
      posterior analysis on &quot;non-destructured&quot; biofilm with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope
      combined with fluorescence staining.
