    <textblock>
      This study aimed at correlating global behavior of Down's Syndrome patients to periodontal
      disease status.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a higher prevalence and severity of periodontal disease in Down's Syndrome patients.
      Plaque levels in these patients are high due to poor hygiene habits. Behavior also may
      contribute to the overall periodontal condition.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) measured by a periodontal probe and classified according to severity</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Severe periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 6mm and ≥1 interproximal site with pocket probing depth (PPD) ≥5mm. Moderate periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with CAL ≥ 4mm or ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with PPD ≥5mm. Mild periodontitis was defined as ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 3 mm CAL and ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 4 mm PPD or at least 1 site with PPD ≥ 5 mm (20,21). Gingivitis was determined as follows: Subjects were considered healthy if presented PPD ≤3mm/BOP extent scores &lt; 10% and with gingivitis if presented PPD ≤3mm/ bleeding on probing (BOP) extent scores &gt;10%. Prevalence of periodontal disease was the sum of gingivitis, mild, moderate and severe periodontitis.</description>

Scores: 0 - absence, 1 - strictly presented, 2 - evidently presented.</description>
