      An exploratory study assessing the ability of biomarkers measured at 8 weeks to predict
      clinical response over 24 and 48 weeks in subjects taking voclosporin 23.7 mg BID in
      combination with standard of care in patients with active lupus nephritis

      Voclosporin is a next generation CNI intended for use in the prevention of organ graft
      rejection and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The aim of the current development
      program is to investigate whether voclosporin added to the standard of care treatment in
      active LN is able to reduce disease activity, as measured by a reduction in proteinuria.The
      background therapy will be MMF 2 g daily, initial treatment with IV methylprednisolone
      followed by a reducing course of oral corticosteroids. Patients with active, flaring LN will
      be eligible to enter the study. They are required to have a diagnosis of LN according to
      established diagnostic criteria (American College of Rheumatology) and clinical and biopsy
      features suggestive of active nephritis. Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug
      combination to reduce the level of proteinuria while demonstrating an acceptable safety
      profile.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to the American College of
             Rheumatology criteria (1997; see Appendix 6).

          -  Kidney biopsy within 24 months prior to screening with a histologic diagnosis of lupus
             nephritis International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society Classes III,
             IV-S or IV-G, (A) or (A/C); or Class V, alone or in combination with Class III or IV.

          -  Laboratory evidence of active nephritis at screening, defined as: Class III, IV-S or
             Class IV-G (proteinuria ≥1000 mg/24 hours when assessed by 24 hour urine collection,
             defined by a UPCR of ≥1.0 mg/mg assessed in a first morning void urine specimen).
             Class V, alone or in combination with Class III or IV, (proteinuria ≥1,500 mg/24 hours
             when assessed by 24 hour urine collection, defined by a UPCR of ≥1.5 mg/mg assessed in
             a first morning void urine specimen).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as calculated by the Chronic Kidney
             Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation of ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening
