  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintenance of a healthy pregnancy depends on an appropriate adaptation and responsiveness of
      blood vessels, to ensure appropriate blood flow to the fetus during everyday stressors.
      Previous work by the investigators has demonstrated that during pregnancy, the part of the
      nervous system responsible for cardiovascular function (the sympathetic nervous system) is
      hyperactive. The investigators also know that in women who develop high blood pressure during
      pregnancy that sympathetic nervous system activity is even higher. Yet, very little is known
      about why this occurs and how this might be affected.

      Pregnant women are encouraged to be active, yet, less than 15% of women perform sufficient
      exercise to meet current guidelines. This is important because hyperactivity of the
      sympathetic nervous system is observed in other inactive populations and has been linked to
      adverse cardiovascular health outcomes including hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart attack,
      and stroke. Indeed, in 2011, the American Heart Association stated that inactivity was a risk
      factor as potent as cigarette smoking for the development of future cardiovascular disease in
      women.

      The investigators' work and others have demonstrated that exercise during pregnancy is
      beneficial for both the mom and baby; however, the effect of prenatal exercise on
      neurovascular function is not known. If exercise is effective in controlling the increase in
      sympathetic activity that occurs during pregnancy, or its effects on the cardiovascular
      system, this may help prevent the development of high blood pressure or other cardiovascular
      problems during pregnancy.

      The objectives of this study are to: 1) examine the impact of exercise on sympathetic and
      vascular function during pregnancy; 2) examine the role of endothelial function on the
      vascular effects of exercise during pregnancy.

      Study design:

      100 women (&gt;18yrs) will be recruited in the first or second trimester (&lt;20 wks). Women with
      multiple pregnancies will be excluded. Eligible women will be randomized between an aerobic
      exercise intervention (EXER) or no intervention (CTRL).

      Initial testing will take place between 16-20 weeks of pregnancy. Following initial baseline
      testing, women will be randomly assigned to an exercise intervention or no intervention.
      Women will receive an opaque sequentially numbered envelop with their allocation. Allocation
      will be determined using a randomly generated allocation sequence by an individual not
      associated with the research study. The intervention will consist of aerobic exercise
      equivalent to 50-70% of heart rate reserve, 3-4 times per week until the end of the study
      (34-36 weeks). For initial baseline testing (16-20 weeks) and at the end of the intervention
      (34-36 weeks), participants will visit the laboratory twice

      On Day 1, participants will complete a peak exercise test on the treadmill or bike to
      volitional fatigue to measures fitness and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular responses to
      exercise.

      On Day 2 Participants will arrive fasted (12 hrs) and blood samples will be collected.
      Anthropometrics, personal/familial history of hypertension and pregnancy complications will
      be recorded. Following a standardized breakfast, participants will undergo an assessment of
      reflex neurovascular control including a cold pressor test, flow mediated dilation and end
      expiratory voluntary breath hold. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity, ultrasound (blood flow
      and diameter of brachial, femoral and carotid arteries), blood pressure, heart rate and
      respiratory variables will be measured.

      OUTCOME/IMPACT

      Pregnancy is a stress-test for life; with women who develop complications during pregnancy
      having a higher risk for cardiovascular disease later in life. Exercise is well known to
      prevent cardiovascular disease through improvements in endothelial function and the
      sympathetic nervous system. Whether this improvements is also seen in pregnancy remains to be
      seen.

    <description>The aerobic exercise intervention will consist of a walking program at 50-70% of individual heart rate reserve. This will begin at 16-20 weeks gestation and continue 3-4 times per week until the end of the study (34-36 weeks). The duration of exercise will increase each week up to a maximum of 40 minutes (5 min warm up, 25 minutes exercise, 5 min cool down). Women will have at least one supervised exercise session per week. The investigators will also monitor other activity using questionnaires and accelerometry. This will occur at baseline (16-20 weeks), mid-intervention (24-26 weeks) and at the end (34-36 weeks).</description>
