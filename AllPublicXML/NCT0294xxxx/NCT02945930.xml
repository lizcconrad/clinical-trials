      &quot;Compont Medical Glue&quot; is a kind of histoacryl producted by Compont Company. It has been used
      to treat esophagogastric varices for several years. This study is a prospective
      multicenter,open study on the safety and efficacy of Compont Medical Glue in the treatment of
      esophagogastric varices. Weather the patient receiving injection of Compont Medical Glue is
      according to the degree of esophageal-gastric varices and is decided by the experienced
      endoscopic physicians. No additional intervention will be given to the patients, no matter
      whether patients are participated in the study.
