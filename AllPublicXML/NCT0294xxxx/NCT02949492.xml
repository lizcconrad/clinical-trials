      Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress cytopathic immune responses and inhibit transplant
      rejection. Our goal is to exploit the Treg suppressive properties to induce transplantation
      tolerance. In contrast to effector T cells, Tregs constitutively express the high affinity
      IL-2 receptor, which makes them exquisitely sensitive to very low-doses of IL-2. We propose
      here to conduct a phase IV clinical trial in which we will test the capacity of low-dose IL-2
      to promote the selective expansion of endogenous Tregs in liver transplant recipients at the
      time immunosuppressive drugs are being discontinued. We expect this will promote Treg
      accumulation within the transplanted liver, shift the balance between effector T cells and
      Tregs, and facilitate the development of operational tolerance in patients unlikely to reach
      this state spontaneously. We expect the trial to start shortly after the initiation of the
      project and to provide robust evidence on the efficacy of IL-2 within 47 months.

    <textblock>
      Transplantation remains the most successful treatment for end-stage organ failure, but the
      need to administer life-long immunosuppression (IS) to prevent rejection limits patient
      survival. Liver transplantation is the only transplantation setting in which a sizeable
      proportion of patients spontaneously develop &quot;operational tolerance&quot;, a phenomenon defined by
      the maintenance of stable graft function in the absence of destructive immune responses
      without the need of IS. Unfortunately this phenomenon preferentially develops in elderly
      recipients and several years after transplantation. To maximize the benefit derived from IS
      discontinuation there is a need to find strategies to intentionally induce tolerance in young
      recipients in whom accumulated IS toxicity has not yet occurred. Our studies have revealed
      that successful IS discontinuation is associated with a transient intra-graft immune
      regulatory response with preferential accumulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). This
      suggests that short-term enhancement of Treg numbers and/or function at the time of IS
      withdrawal may facilitate the acquisition of tolerance in patients who are not predisposed to
      spontaneously develop it. IL-2 is a cytokine that is essential for the optimal development,
      survival and function of Tregs. Several clinical studies have shown that low-dose IL-2
      preferentially expands Tregs and is safe and efficacious in patients with autoimmunity or
      GVHD. In these studies, Treg frequency increased up to 2 to 8-fold without significant
      changes in the number of effector T cells. Our objective is to investigate if administration
      of a short-course of low dose IL-2 to liver transplant recipients facilitates the
      discontinuation of IS. We propose to conduct a phase II, safety and efficacy, prospective,
      single-arm clinical trial in which liver recipients &lt;50 years old and 2-6 years after
      transplantation will receive IL-2 and gradually discontinue their IS medication.

    <description>Low-dose IL-2 will be initiated while study participants remain on a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant. Following 4 weeks of treatment, participants showing at least a 2-fold increase in peripheral blood absolute Treg numbers, stable liver function and no adverse effects will undergo a liver biopsy to exclude sub-clinical graft damage, and subsequently will initiate immunosuppression withdrawal. Low-dose IL-2 will be maintained for a total of 6 months.</description>
