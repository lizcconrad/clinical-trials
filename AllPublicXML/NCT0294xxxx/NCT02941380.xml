      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to examine cerebral oxidative and inflammatory stress and
      cerebral hemodynamics during and after coronary artery bypass grafting and correlate with
      postoperative cognitive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive decline is a well-known and well-described complication following
      coronary artery bypass grafting. Severity ranges from postoperative delirium to stroke, but
      the majority of patients with postoperative cognitive decline following coronary artery
      bypass grafting have decline in recent and remote memory in particular.

      The reason for the cognitive decline is still not fully understood though many reasons have
      been proposed.

      Inflammation and oxidative stress may contribute to the postoperative cognitive dysfunction
      which may also be in combination with a reduced cerebral autoregulation.
