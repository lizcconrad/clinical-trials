  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Telemedicine is increasingly used to overcome distance between patients and
      physicians. Preliminary studies suggest that mobile app follow-up care for ACL reconstruction
      patients is feasible, can avert in-person follow-up care, and is cost-effective.

      Objective: To avert in-person follow-up through the use of a mobile app in the first six
      weeks after surgery.

      Methods: This will be a single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial

      Results: Data to be analyzed from 72 patients.

    <description>The mobile app follow-up group will have no planned in-person follow-up, however these visits will be replaced with surgical site examination via submitted photos, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Quality of Recovery - 9 questionnaire (QoR-9) and limb specific recovery monitoring. All information is submitted with the mobile app (QoC Health Inc, Toronto).</description>

    <description>Patients in the conventional follow-up group will have a planned clinic follow-up at 2 and 6 weeks post-operatively, which is the schedule currently used by our surgeons. At these scheduled follow-up visits, patients will be asked to complete the VAS to assess pain and the QoR-9 in addition to recovery questions about their operated extremity.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction at Women's College Hospital (WCH), between the
             ages of 18-70.

          -  Patients must be able to use a mobile device and communicate in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are smokers, as they carry increased rates of complications.

          -  Patients must not:

               -  Suffer from chronic pain

               -  Be taking narcotic (morphine-like) medication for pain on a regular basis, and

               -  Have an allergy to local anesthetics or morphine-like medications

                    -  Pain scores captured in the VAS and QoR-9 are important for judging
                       post-operative recovery. Pre-existing pain or inability to take narcotics
                       post-operatively would compromise the reliability of these measures.
