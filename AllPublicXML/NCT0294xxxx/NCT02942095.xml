  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the
      combination of ixazomib and erlotinib that can be given to patients with advanced solid
      tumors. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat non-small cell lung cancer, but its use in advanced solid cancer is considered
      investigational. Ixazomib is FDA approved. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs
      are designed to work.

      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of ixazomib and erlotinib based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of
      ixazomib will be tested. Up to 18 participants may be enrolled at each dose level. The first
      group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of ixazomib is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose of erlotinib.

      Once the highest tolerable dose is found, up to 18 participants will be enrolled at that dose
      level as an expansion group.

      The dose of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you have
      intolerable side effects.

      Study Drug Administration Each study cycle is 28 days.

      You will take ixazomib capsules by mouth on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.

      You will take erlotinib tablets by mouth on Days 1-28 of each cycle.

      You should swallow ixazomib capsules whole with 8 ounces (1 cup) of water. Each capsule
      should be swallowed separately with a sip of water. You should also swallow erlotinib tablets
      whole with water. You should take the ixazomib and erlotinib doses at the same time.

      Do not break, chew, or open the capsules or tablets. Each dose should be taken on an empty
      stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. If you miss a dose, take it as soon
      as you remember, as long as the next scheduled dose is at least 72 hours (ixazomib) or 12
      hours (erlotinib) away. You should not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. If
      you vomit after taking a dose, wait until the next scheduled dose. Do not take an additional
      dose.

      Your dose of study drug may be changed and/or you may be given drugs to help control the side
      effects.

      Study Visits:

      Cycle 1:

      Week 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and
           kidney function.

        -  If you can become pregnant, leftover blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

        -  During Days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, blood (about 1-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for
           pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body
           at different time points.

      Week 2:

      Â°Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and kidney
      function.

      Week 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and
           kidney function.

      Cycle 2 and Beyond:

      Week 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. The blood
           sample will also be used for liver and kidney function tests.

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the routine blood or urine test will be used for a
           pregnancy test. To continue on this study, you must not be pregnant.

      Week 4:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and
           kidney function.

        -  On Day 28 of each cycle, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG.

        -  At the end of every other cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), you will have imaging scans
           (either CT scans or MRI) performed to check the status of the disease.

      If you have side effects or abnormal test results while on study, you may be asked to return
      to the clinic for more tests until the side effects or abnormal test results improve.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, if you develop new health problems, or if you are no longer
      able to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      End of Study Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of the study drugs, the following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and
           kidney function.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

             enroll non-small cell lung cancer patients with documented EGFR mutation who failed
             treatment with anti-EGFR therapy (e.g. erlotinib or afatinib) and tested negative for
             EGFR T790M mutation. We will allow patients with positive EGFR T790M mutation if they
             have progressed on third generation anti-EGFR therapy (e.g. CO-1686 or AZD9291) or
             medically not suitable/candidate for the third generation anti-EGFR therapy. Failure

             cohort.

         14. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: 1) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patient with
             KRAS point mutation at codon G12 or G13. Since KRAS mutation is present in more than
             90% of pancreatic cancer with 98% of the mutation found at codon 12, we expect
             majority of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma will be eligible for the
             study. We plan to enroll up to 9 patients in this cohort. In addition to the above
             inclusion criteria, first 5 patients from both non-small cell lung cancer and
             pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients will need to agree to mandatory pre- and
             post-treatment tumor biopsies.

             exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with
             subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures, in
             the opinion of the Investigator.

          2. Radiotherapy completed within 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation. Radiotherapy
             completed &gt;2 weeks prior to treatment initiation is allowed if all procedure-related
             toxicities resolved per inclusion #2.

          3. Patient who were receiving prior therapy will require wash out period of either more
             than 2 weeks or more than 5 half-lives whichever shorter.

             chemically related to study drug, or excipients or to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

          5. Current use of a prohibited medication.

          6. Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord
             compression. If these were treated and clinically stable for 4 weeks, patient can be
             considered for the trial.

          7. Patient who is on strong inducer/inhibitor of CYP3A needs to be off the medication
             prior to treatment initiation unless it is medically necessary for the patient.

          8. Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test suggestive
             of pregnancy and not as a tumor marker during the screening period. If pregnancy is
             tested positive, treating physician will further investigate if the patient is
             pregnant or not. Treating physician may consider repeating the serum beta-hCG at next
             follow up visit or refer patient to OB/GYN for further evaluation.

          9. Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.

         10. Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14
             days before study enrollment.

         12. Ongoing or active systemic infection, active hepatitis B or C virus infection, or
             known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.

         13. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before study enrollment or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are
             not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.

         14. Patient has greater than or equal than Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, or Grade 1 with
             pain on clinical examination during the screening period.

         15. Patients that have previously been treated with ixazomib, or participated in a study
             with ixazomib whether treated with ixazomib or not.
