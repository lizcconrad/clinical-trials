  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to analyze the pathological tumor response on locally advanced rectal
      cancer after preoperative treatment with neo-adjuvant therapy regimen or with chemotherapy
      combined with short-course radiotherapy in a prospective cohort and to correlate this
      response with patient's outcome

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II , open label, randomized study in patients with confirmed diagnosis of
      locally advanced rectal cancer. The study is designed to analyze the pathological tumor
      response on locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative treatment with neo-adjuvant
      therapy regimen or with chemotherapy combined with short-course radiotherapy.
