      When developing new medications for lung diseases like Cystic Fibrosis (CF), scientists
      perform lab experiments using cells from the airways, physiology studies of how the lungs
      change when a drug is given, and clinical studies to determine how drugs affect overall
      health. The investigators of this study are seeking to develop computer models that will
      predict how patients will respond to drugs by just doing lab studies on cell samples from
      their noses. Such models would allow for medications to be developed more rapidly for all
      patients and allow treatments to be personalized as well. In order to develop these computer
      models a series of tests will be performed on patients who have CF. Tests will include
      sampling cells from the nose and measuring lung physiology using a combination of different
      imaging, breathing, and other studies performed both before and after participants take a
      therapy. Similar tests will be performed on people who do not have CF, and on the parents of
      the CF participants who carry a single CF gene because this will provide information on how
      specific genes might affect CF lung disease.

      The goal of this research is to develop a series of interconnected models of therapeutic
      response in the diseased lung, focused primarily on Cystic Fibrosis (CF), that will
      ultimately provide a means for predicting in vivo response based on patient-specific in vitro
      testing, allowing for the optimization and personalization of therapies. Investigators use
      both human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and more recently human nasal epithelial (HNE) cell
      cultures to study CF pathophysiology. The investigators performing this study have also
      developed functional imaging biomarkers in the lung that provide organ level quantification
      of CF lung physiology (mucociliary clearance and airway liquid absorption), and, more
      recently, in silico systems models of lung physiology at both the cell and organ level. The
      in silico models provide a framework of differential equations that describe how basic
      physiological processes interact and contribute to experimental outcomes. Their use allows
      these mechanisms to be more specifically differentiated. Here the investigators propose to
      link in vitro and in vivo response by sampling and culturing HNE cell cultures from both
      non-CF and CF subjects who will also perform a series of physiological assessments, including
      functional imaging scans. The in silico models will facilitate linking therapeutic studies in
      cells to therapeutic outcomes in patients.
