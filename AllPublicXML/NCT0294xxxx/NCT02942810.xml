  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, single-dose, pharmacokinetic study to be conducted in male and
      female subjects with normal and impaired renal function. The study will be composed of five
      groups of patients with mild (6 patients), moderate (6 patients), severe (6 patients) renal
      impairment, end stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis (6 patients) and their
      respective matched controls in 1:1 ratio (24 healthy subjects with normal renal function).
      The severity of renal impairment will be assessed based on estimated creatinine clearance
      (CLCR) by the Cockcroft-Gault equation

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Body mass index (BMI) 18.0 and 40.0 (kg/m2) and body weight of at least 50 kg.

             Patients with renal impairment:

          2. Have a diagnosis of renal impairment that has been stable, without any change in
             overall disease status in the last 1 month

             Healthy Subjects:

          3. Have normal renal function with creatinine clearance more than 90 mL/min and no
             evidence of any disease or condition that may affect pharmacokinetics of FEP ZID.

          4. A resting blood pressure 90-145 (systolic) / 60-95 (diastolic) mmHg for healthy
             volunteers and 90-155 (systolic) / 50-100 (diastolic) mmHg for patients with renal
             impairment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, rheumatologic, hepatic, urologic, immunologic,
             infectious, skin and subcutaneous tissue, psychiatric or mood disorders (including any
             past suicide attempt), or uncontrolled metabolic or endocrine disorders (including
             diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or dyslipidemia) that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would confound subject's participation and follow-up in the clinical
             trial.

          2. Evidence of hepatorenal syndrome or acute glomerulonephritis
