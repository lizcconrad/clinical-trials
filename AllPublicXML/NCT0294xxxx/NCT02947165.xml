    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures.

          2. Patient (male or female) ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Escalation: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with measurable or
             non-measurable disease as determined by RECIST version 1.1 who have progressed despite
             standard therapy or are intolerant of standard therapy, or for whom no standard
             therapy exists.

          4. Expansion: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with at least one
             measurable lesion as determined by RECIST version 1.1, who have progressed despite
             standard therapy following their last prior therapy or are intolerant to standard
             therapy and fit into one of the following groups: Group 1: NSCLC; Group 2: TNBC; Group
             3: HCC; Group 4: MSS-CRC; Group 5: pancreatic, prostate and ccRCC.

          5. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2.

          6. Patients must have a site of disease amenable to biopsy, and be a candidate for tumor
             biopsy. Patient must be willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy at screening, and during
             therapy on this study. Exceptions may be made on a case by case basis after documented
             discussion with Novartis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to study treatment ingredients or other
             monoclonal antibodies and components of study drug.

          2. Patients with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Note: Patients with
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

          3. HIV infection.

          4. Active HBV or HCV infection.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
