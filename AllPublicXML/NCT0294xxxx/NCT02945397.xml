      The study is an RCT comparing the effect of a group-based intervention with an individual
      work-out intervention on work participation. The target group is persons who are at risk of
      leaving the work force due to health issues, and people currently outside the work force. The
      interventions have a time-span of 3 months. Survey data will be collected at baseline, after
      three months (after intervention has ended), and after 15 months. Survey data include
      information on lifestyle, self-reported health, subjective health complaints and readiness
      for work. Register data on employment and welfare benefits will be collected from two years
      in advance of inclusion, and five years after inclusion. According to power calculations, the
      study will need 322 participants.

      In addition to the effect evaluation, a process evaluation will also be performed. The
      process evaluation will examine content quality and adherence to guidelines, as well as
      feasibility of the group intervention. The process evaluation will consist of some survey
      data as well as interviews with service providers and participants.
