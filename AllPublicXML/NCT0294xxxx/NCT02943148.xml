      Several methods have been used to predict adhesions after abdominal operations.
      High-resolution ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and scar healing properties were
      the methods that were evaluated in the English literature for this study. Estimating the
      likelihood of adhesions and related complications after prior surgery and assessing the
      severity of adhesion formation after surgery is not easy. Anticipating adhesions is very
      important to preventing complications by ensuring that the necessary preoperative
      preparations are in place and/or that appropriate cases are referred to a tertiary center.
