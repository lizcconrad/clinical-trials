  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is pilot testing the feasibility and impact of a low-cost intervention that
      uses existing gymnasiums, and therefore has the potential to be replicated across the United
      States. The intervention, PlayFit, is designed for adults aged 21-50. PlayFit has five key
      components, intended to overcome the major barriers to physical activity. First, it will
      assist people in finding others to play with, using the Pick-Up model of designating times to
      play and making those times known in the community. Second, it will overcome a lack of
      confidence in physical activity by including games of lower intensity for relatively unfit
      adults, then building up to moderate and vigorous games. Third, it will require team members
      of varying ages and genders to encourage intergenerational play. Fourth, it will use modified
      equipment (e.g., softer, lighter balls) and smaller game space to require less running, so
      that even relatively unfit people can feel confident participating. Fifth, it will be
      designed to be led by community volunteers, which will increase its disseminability.

      AIM - Understand the optimum design for PlayFit. To meet this aim, the investigators will
      come up with a list of games to play and pilot the games at a gymnasium. The investigators
      will observe the participants playing the games and have them complete a brief survey.

    <description>Subjects will participate in three 60 minute game sessions each week for 12 weeks. During each game session, subjects will be divided randomly into two teams to play a modified game. Research staff will review the instructions of the game and if needed, modify the game rules during play to enhance the experience (ie. keep it fun, keep it to moderate intensity level). The length of play session between breaks increases each week.</description>
