  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critical care patients are at a high risk of developing delirium and impaired cognitive
      function 3 and 12 months after their ICU stay. In this study the aim is to try to elucidate
      the pathophysiology behind delirium in the ICU and subsequent development of cognitive
      dysfunction in ICU survivors.

      Biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be analysed in patients with and without
      delirium in the ICU. Samples will also be taken 3 and 12 months after the ICU-stay. CSF will
      also be obtained in healthy age- and sexmatched controls undergoing surgery.

      Critical care patients are at a high risk of developing delirium, a form of acute brain
      dysfunction, and may develop impaired cognitive function 3 and 12 months following their ICU
      stay.

      In this study the aim is to try to elucidate the pathophysiology behind delirium in the ICU
      comparing patients with and without delirium and possible development of cognitive
      dysfunction in ICU survivors. Neuroinflammatory markers and markers of structural damage in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be analysed in patients with and without delirium assessed
      with the CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method) test in the ICU. CSF samples will also be
      taken in ICU-survivors, 3 and 12 months after the ICU-stay. For comparison CSF will be
      obtained in healthy age- and sexmatched controls undergoing surgery in spinal anesthesia.
