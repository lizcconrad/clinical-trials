  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the degree of anxiety experienced by women
      undergoing visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and Lugol's iodine (VILI) can be reduced
      by watching the procedure in real-time on a digital screen.

      The study took place in the District of Dschang, Cameroon. Women aged between 30 and 49
      years, addressed to undergo a pelvic examination with VIA and VILI, were invited to
      participate. Throughout the examination, one part of the women underwent the routine
      VIA/VILI, with no visual support (control group), whereas the other part of patients were
      shown the pictures of the cervix in real-time on a digital screen (study group). At the end
      of the procedure, all women had the possibility to see the pictures retrospectively.
      Randomization determined the women's distribution between the two groups. Their anxiety level
      was measured by asking them to complete the Spielberg's State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) both
      prior to and immediately after the procedure.
