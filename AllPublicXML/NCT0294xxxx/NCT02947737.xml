    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of applying amniotic membrane
      dressings compared to gentamicin and xeroform dressings to donor sites for skin grafts. This
      study will enroll ten participants who undergoing a split thickness skin graft procedure with
      two or more donor sites. The amniotic membrane will be applied to one donor site and a
      dressing of xeroform and gentamicin will be applied to another other donor site. Each
      participant will receive both types of dressing and will serve as their own control.
      Postoperative follow up will follow standard of care, regardless of the dressing type.
      Dressings will be removed on postoperative day 4 and participants will return to be
      re-examined one week after being discharged from the hospital.

    <textblock>
      The use of amniotic membrane in the treatment of wounds has been employed for almost 100
      years, with reports of it being used in skin grafting for burns and ulcers in 1913. This
      study will investigate the use of amniotic membrane as a donor site dressing (the area where
      skin is removed to be transplanted to the recipient site). Donor sites are often a
      significant cause of postoperative pain for patients who have undergone skin grafts.
      Furthermore, donor sites that fail to re-epithelialize or scar may require additional
      excision and skin grafting on the donor site itself. There is a paucity of literature in the
      United States regarding the use of amniotic membrane as a donor site dressing, however,
      studies from other countries have demonstrated an increase in patient comfort and a faster
      time to re-epithelialization. Inherent to amniotic membrane that makes it an ideal dressing
      include the presence of extracellular matrix components create integrity, epithelial cells
      participate in the healing process, and defensins confer antibacterial properties. MiMedx
      produces AmnioFixÂ® which is a dehydrated preserved amniotic membrane that will be used in the
      dressing of our donor sites in contrast to gentamicin and xeroform based dressings. This
      study will see if patients have improved cosmetic outcomes, less postoperative pain and a
      faster time to re-epithelialization at the donor site treated with amniotic membrane compared
      to the standard of care.
