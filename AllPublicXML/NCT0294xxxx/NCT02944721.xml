  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish the genetic, neurophysiological and psychological
      phenotype of the patients presenting a persistent neuropathic pain after surgery of the
      breast cancer, by comparing the neuropathic painful patients with the not painful and with
      the not neuropathic painful . This will be realized on a transverse cohort
      (&quot;Seintinelle&quot;cohort) and confirmed on a forward-looking longitudinal cohort.

    <description>The genetic profile will be determined from a biological sample of blood taken at the willing patients. This analysis will include: an analysis of candidate genes, an analysis piece-genomics genome-wide association (GWAS) and newer techniques of sequencing of whole exome sequencing allowing to study variants with low and high impact.
The psychological profile will be determined by tests estimating the affect, the suffering, the capacities of management of the pain, the emotional regulation and the neuropsychological tests .
The neurophysiological profile will be determined by an evaluation quantified by the sensibility, the tests of painful conditioning stimulation, and the analysis of the excitability of nerve fibers.</description>
