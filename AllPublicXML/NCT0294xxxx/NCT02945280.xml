    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of a drug called apixaban for the
      treatment of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) and clinically important bleeding.
      Subjects will receive apixaban 10 mg by mouth twice a day for 7 days, followed by 5 mg by
      mouth twice a day for a duration of 11 weeks. There will be a followup visit at 12 weeks for
      all participants. A total of 375 are to be enrolled.

      The study drug has been approved to treat blood clots. The study drug has not been studied
      uniquely for the treatment of blood clots in the upper extremity however. Because it is
      unknown whether it is effective to treat blood clots in the upper extremity, the principal
      investigator cannot guarantee that there will be benefit to study subjects; however, it is
      hoped that the information obtained from this research study will help treat patients in the
      future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) constitutes approximately 10% of all
      DVT. A recent increase in incidence is largely secondary to the increasing use of
      peripherally inserted central venous catheters. Treatment for UEDVT is derived from evidence
      for treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (LEDVT). No evidence exists for the use
      of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for the treatment of UEDVT.

      Population: Sequential patients identified within the Intermountain Healthcare system and
      University of Utah Healthcare system with UEDVT defined as the formation of thrombus within
      the internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins of the arm demonstrated by
      imaging. Intervention: Apixaban 10 mg PO twice daily for 7 days followed by apixaban 5 mg
      twice daily for 11 weeks.

      Comparison: In the primary analysis, the principal investigator will report the rate of
      clinically overt objective VTE and VTE-related death in comparison to the rate reported upon
      literature review (&quot;reference value in the literature&quot;). If the confidence interval for this
      rate excludes the commonly accepted threshold event rate of 4%, the principal investigator
      will conclude that treatment with apixaban is noninferior, and therefore a clinically valid
      approach to treat UEDVT. As a secondary analysis the principal investigator will compare the
      rate of the primary efficacy outcome and primary safety outcome with a historical control of
      case matched patients with UEDVT (&quot;historical control&quot;) treated with therapy conventional
      (low molecular weight heparin plus warfarin) prior to the approval of DOACs.

      Sample Size: A sample size of 357 patients who meet eligibility criteria was chosen so that
      an exact 95% confidence interval would exclude an event rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE)
      in the observation cohort of 4%. The principal investigator will add 5% for anticipated
      withdrawal to assure adequate patient enrollment in the case of patient withdrawal and enroll
      375 patients.

      Outcome: 90 day rate of new or recurrent objectively confirmed symptomatic venous thrombosis
      and VTE-related death. The primary safety outcome is major bleeding and clinically relevant
      nonmajor bleeding.
