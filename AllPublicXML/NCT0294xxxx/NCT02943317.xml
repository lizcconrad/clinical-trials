  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and dose expansion trial to
      evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of defactinib (VS-6063) in combination with avelumab
      in epithelial ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is comprised of 2 sequential parts: Part A (Dose Escalation of VS-6063) and Part B
      (Expansion).

      In Part A (Dose Escalation), approximately 18 subjects will receive avelumab IV treatment in
      28-day cycles (10 mg/kg over approximately 1 hour on Days 1 and 15) and oral defactinib
      twice-daily (BID) continuously starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Subject enrollment will proceed
      according to a standard 3+3 design. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), each
      subject will receive the study drug regimen for a minimum of 28 days (Cycle 1) and may
      continue to receive additional cycles of study treatment until disease progression has been
      documented or unacceptable toxicity or other treatment discontinuation criteria have been
      met. All subjects in a cohort must have completed at least 1 cycle of dosing before dose
      escalation involving new subjects entered into the next dose cohort can occur. Based on the
      safety and PK data obtained in the dose escalation portion of the study, the RP2D of the
      combination will be determined.

      In Part B (Expansion), approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled and will receive avelumab
      IV treatment in 28-day cycles (10 mg/kg over approximately 1 hour on Days 1 and 15) and oral
      defactinib at the RP2D dose continuously starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1.

             renal, hepatic, neurologic, dermatologic, pulmonary, endocrine systems) or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, place
             the subject at undue risk or confound interpretation of safety or other data.

         18. Gastrointestinal (GI) condition that could interfere with the swallowing or absorption
             of defactinib.
