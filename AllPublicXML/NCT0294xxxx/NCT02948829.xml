  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the cellular immune responses following 2 doses of
      tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (TDV) in 4 to 16 years' healthy participants.

      The vaccine being tested in this study is TDV. This study will look at cellular immune
      responses following TDV vaccination in dengue endemic regions.

      The study will enroll approximately 200 participants. Participants will receive:

      • TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection

      All participants will receive 2-dose schedule of TDV by SC injection into the upper arm at
      Day 1 (Month 0) and at Day 90 (Month 3).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Panama and the Philippines. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 3 years 4 months. Participants will make multiple
      visits to the clinic and will be contacted at least every week for the entire study duration
      post first injection.
