      This is a phase II, prospective, single arm, non comparative study with crizotinib combined
      with bevacizumab in treatment-naive lung adenocarcinoma cancer patients with ALK
      translocation or ROS1 translocation or MET amplification. Patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC(Stage ⅢB/ⅢC/Ⅳ) with at least one measurable tumor lesion will be considered
      eligible for the trial. All potentially eligible patients will be evaluated for ALK、MET and
      ROS1 by FISH or IHC or NGS to detect MET amplification or ALK translocation or ROS1
      translocation After evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and after signature of
      informed consent form, all MET amplified or ALK translocation or ROS1 translocated eligible
      patients will receive crizotinib 250 mg BID p.o and bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg every three weeks
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.
