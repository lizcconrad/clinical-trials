      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, phase II clinical study. 87 patients
      will be recruited.

      Group A (low dose group)

      Intrapleural injection of bevacizumab 2.5mg/kg/times, d1, d8; 21 days for a course of
      treatment. Subjects will received two courses of treatment if there is no termination of
      treatment listed in the standard.

      Group B (medium dose group)

      Intrapleural injection of bevacizumab 5mg/kg/times, d1, d8; 21 days for a course of
      treatment. Subjects will received two courses of treatment if there is no termination of
      treatment listed in the standard.

      Group C (high dose group)

      Intrapleural injection of bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg/times, d1, d8; 21 days for a course of
      treatment. Subjects will received two courses of treatment if there is no termination of
      treatment listed in the standard.

      Main evaluation criteria: pleural effusion objective response rate(ORR) (WHO standard)

      Secondary evaluation criteria: pleural fluid time to progression (TTP), overall survival
      (OS), ORR, QOL scores (Quality of Life Questionnaire-lung cancer) and KPS, and safety (NCI
      CTCAE V4.03)
