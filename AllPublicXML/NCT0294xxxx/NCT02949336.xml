  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective collection of health related personal data (observational
      study). A total of approximately 10 subjects with traditional medial SIGMA® High Performance
      Partial Knee System and 10 ACL deficient subjects with medial SIGMA® High Performance Partial
      Knee System are analyzed during sitting onto a chair and getting up, deep knee bend, stance
      and swing phase of level walking, downhill walking (ramp descent) and stair descent at least
      12 months post-operatively, in terms of 3D fluoroscopic assessed tibio-femoral motion as well
      as simultaneous skin marker assessed whole leg motion and ground reaction forces. All the
      video-fluoroscopic testing is performed at the Institute for Biomechanics at the ETH Zurich.
      The UKA subjects are recruited based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The primary objective is to quantify and describe the three-dimensional kinematics for
      patients with a traditional medial SIGMA® High Performance Partial Knee System (functional
      ACL and tibial posterior slope matching the native bone) during these daily activities.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate patients with the same medial UKA implant (SIGMA® High
      Performance Partial Knee System) in an ACL deficient knee, where the UKA was implanted at a
      50% reduced tibial posterior slope relative to the native knee.

      The knee arthroplasty for each patient was implanted more than one year ago as per inclusion
      criteria of this study with the sole purpose of standard clinical practice of the recruiting
      surgeons.

        The clinical investigators of the participating clinics (PD Dr. med. Fabian von Knoch,
        Gelenkzentrum Zürich; and Dr. med. Stefan Preiss, Schulthess Klinik) will identify
        potential subjects based on clinical records. PD Dr. med. Fabian von Knoch will recruit
        patients he operated on at the Gelenkzentrum Zürich while Dr. med. Stefan Preiss will
        recruit subjects from his patient population at the Schulthess Klinik.
