    <textblock>
      Objective: Acute urinary retention (AUR) is a common problem in hospitalized patients. Either
      indwelling urethral catheterization or clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) can be the
      choice of treatment. In chronic urinary retention, most physicians prefer CIC to chronic
      indwelling urethral catheter on the basis of the claim that the rate of catheter-associated
      urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is lower.

      Method: The patients were randomized into indwelling urethral catheter and CIC groups. The
      primary outcomes of the study were catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria and CAUTI.
      The secondary outcomes were pain, hematuria, cloudy urine, and quality of life.

      We queried the hospitalized patients in Ramathibodi Hospital who developed first-time AUR
      from June 2014 to May 2015. Patients under 18 years of age with a history of urinary
      retention, urinary tract infection, and poor compliance were excluded from this study. All
      the patients gave their written informed consents. The patients were randomly divided into
      two groups depending on the type of assigned intervention: CIC and indwelling urethral
      catheter groups.

      All the patients were followed up after 2 weeks; urinalysis and urine culture were obtained
      at the time of AUR and whenever the patients developed UTI-associated symptoms. The patients
      with positive urine culture at the time of AUR were excluded from the study.
