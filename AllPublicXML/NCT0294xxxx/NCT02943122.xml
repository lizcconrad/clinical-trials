    <textblock>
      Preeclamptic pregnancy is associated with alterations in the left ventricular structure and
      function and elevation of cardiovascular biomarkers. The alterations are still persistent
      several months after delivery and are more clearly observed in early-onset and severe
      Pre-eclampsia
