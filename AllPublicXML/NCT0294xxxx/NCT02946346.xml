  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most genital infections by human papillomaviruses (HPV) are asymptomatic or benign and clear
      within a few months or years. There infections are much less studies than chronic infections,
      even though they represent the main reservoir for the virus. The goal of this project is to
      decipher the kinetics of the virus and of the host immune response in acute HPV genital
      infections in your women. This will be performed by following women longitudinally and
      regularly in order to measure variations in virus load, immune cell count, cytokine
      concentration and antibody titers. The investigators will also investigate the interaction
      between these kinetics and host genetics and host vaginal microbiota

    <description>This time series will be used to calibrate a general model capturing HPV kinetics in genital acute infections in young women. At every time point, other measures such as temperature, vaginal pH, coinfections will be performed and women will fill-in detailed questionnaires about their every day life (vaccination status, antibiotic treatments, sexual activity) to control for co-factors. Virus genetics, host genetics (SNPs), immunophenotyping and microbiota will also be surveyed as cofactors.</description>
