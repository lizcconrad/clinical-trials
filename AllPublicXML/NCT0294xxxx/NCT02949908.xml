      This is a prospective, multicenter, open label, uncontrolled, non-interventional, single arm
      study to measure treatment satisfaction of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) subjects on Rebif
      after discontinuing initial first-line treatment.This study is a regional study with 3
      participating countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland

    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Score Determined With Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Version II (TSQM v II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM v II is designed as a general measure of treatment satisfaction with medication, suitable for use across a wide variety of medication types and illness conditions. It consists 11 question items used for computing 4 subscales: effectiveness, convenience, side effects and global satisfaction. Effectiveness score: ([(Item 1 + Item 2) − 2] divided by (12)*100; side effects score: ([Sum of Item 4 to Item 6) − 3] divided by 12)*100; convenience score: ([Sum of Item 7 to Item 9) − 3] divided by 18)*100; global satisfaction: ([Sum of Item 10 to Item 11) − 2] divided by 12)*100. Individual subscale scores and Total scores range from 0 to 100, where higher score indicates more satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>ARR will be defined as the number of relapses per year. Annualized Relapse Rate: (Number of Relapses / Time on study)*365.25. Time on study (days): (date of study completion or date of study discontinuation - date of first Rebif administration plus 1). A relapse is defined as the appearance of a new clinical sign or symptom attributable to MS, or clinical worsening of a previous sign or symptom that had been stable for greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 days and that persisted for &gt;=24 hours without fever.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline in Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire (MusiQoL) at Month 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MusiQoL is a disease-specific validated 31-item multi-dimensional, self-administered questionnaire. It has nine dimensions: Activities of daily living (8 items); Psychological well-being (4 items); Symptoms (3 items); Relationships with friends (4 items); Relationships with family (3 items); Relationship with the healthcare system (3 items); Sentimental and sexual life (2 items); Coping (2 items); and Rejection (2 items). Each item is scored from 1 (never/not at all) to 5 (always/very much) or 6 if not applicable. Higher scores indicated a higher level of quality of life. All nine dimensions are linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates the worst possible level of quality of life and 100 indicates the best level. The total score will be computed as the mean of these subscales scores. and will range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates the worst possible level of quality of life and 100 indicates the best level.</description>
