  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common tumour in the UK, Netherlands and Denmark with
      41000, 14000 and 4000 new cases per year respectively. Standard primary radical Total
      Mesorectal Excision (TME) surgery is an oncologically effective treatment for early stage
      rectal cancer. However, resection of a low rectal tumour requires a permanent stoma in
      approximately 5-10% of cases while many more patients have a temporary stoma, some of which
      are not reversed. Radical surgery, which evolved to treat locally advanced, symptomatic
      tumours, may not be the optimal method of treatment for early screen-detected tumours and an
      organ preserving strategy may generate significantly less morbidity without substantially
      compromising oncological outcomes.

      TREC was a randomised phase II trial to test the feasibility of randomisation between TME and
      an organ preserving policy of short course pre-operative radiotherapy (SCPRT) delay followed
      by transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). STAR-TREC is a phase II feasibility study that
      will evaluate whether it is possible to accelerate the patient recruitment attained in the
      TREC study, to 4 per month in the first year of recruitment and 6 per month in the second.
      This would demonstrate deliverability of a phase III study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STAR-TREC is a randomised, three arm (1:1:1) study using the following arms:

        1. Standard TME surgery (control)

        2. Organ saving using:

             1. long course concurrent chemoradiation

             2. short course radiotherapy For organ-preserving strategies clinical response to
                radiotherapy determines the next treatment step. Radiotherapy response is evaluated
                using endoscopy and the tumour regression grade, as assessed by MRI. The first
                assessment at 11-13 weeks (from radiotherapy start) using MRI and endoscopy will
                identify a minority of non-responders who should convert to TME surgery. Patients
                demonstrating a satisfactory radiotherapy response at 11-13 weeks will be
                reassessed by endoscopy at 16-20 weeks. Re-evaluation determines if the STAR-TREC
                criteria for complete clinical response (cCR) are met. Patients who achieve cCR may
                progress directly to active surveillance. Those who do not fulfil the criteria for
                cCR will progress to excision biopsy with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM).

      Patients in the organ saving arm will be assigned to either;

      A. Long course concurrent chemoradiation:

      Capecitabine: 825 mg/m² orally, b.i.d., on radiotherapy days Radiotherapy: A dose of 50 Gy,
      applied to the primary tumour and surrounding mesorectum, in 25 fractions of 2 Gy, 5 days a
      week.

      or B. Short course preoperative radiotherapy A dose of 25Gy, applied, to the primary tumour
      and surrounding mesorectum in 5 fractions of 5 Gy, 5 days a week.

      As a feasibility study, this trial will have recruitment rate as it's primary outcome.
