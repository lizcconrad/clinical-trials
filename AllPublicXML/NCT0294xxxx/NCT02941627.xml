  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and the safety profile of the Neuro Cochlear
      Implant System (CIS) in adults with severe to profound sensorineural hearing disabilities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new cochlear implant system is indicated in individuals with serious hearing disabilities
      who do not obtain benefit from appropriately fitted hearing aid(s). Cochlear implant surgery
      is safe, but as with any surgery, possible issues or device related issues may occur. The
      risk benefit balance is well known in cochlear implantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be 18 years or older,

          -  Bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss, PTA ≥ 70 dB HL (average in dB
             of the thresholds for pure tones at 500, 1000 and 2000Hz, on both ear),

          -  Post-lingual deafness,

          -  Limited benefit from appropriately fitted hearing aid(s), with score ≤ 50% correct in
             open-set sentences recognition (HINT sentences), binaurally in the best listening
             condition

          -  Primary implantation,

          -  No anatomical contraindications: Radiological evaluation showing no obstacles to full
             electrode insertion and verifying the absence of central auditory lesions

          -  Fluent in local language, including reading and writing,

          -  Psychologically suitable,

          -  Updated pneumococcal vaccine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical conditions that contraindicate undergoing surgery (middle ear diseases i.e.
             AOM/CSOM, lesions of auditory nerve, pathologies of central auditory pathway,
             otosclerosis any cochlear malformation (i.e. Mondini malformation, cochlear
             ossification, Large Vestibular Aqueduct)

          -  Unrealistic expectations from the candidate regarding the possible benefits, risks,
             and limitations that are inherent to the surgical procedure(s) and the device

          -  Unwillingness or inability of the candidate to comply with all investigational
             requirements
