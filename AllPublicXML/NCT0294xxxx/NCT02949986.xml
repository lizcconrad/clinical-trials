  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many exercise approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing falls and
      fall risk in community-dwelling older adults. The Otago Exercise Program is one such program.
      The Otago Exercise Program has been tested in four randomized controlled trials and one
      controlled multi-center trial and was found to reduce falls in older men and women. The focus
      of the Otago Exercise Program is on improving strength and balance with a home-based balance
      exercise program. The goal of the current study is to evaluate whether a self-administered,
      tablet-based version of the Otago fall prevention program is both feasible and effective for
      reducing fall risk and improving balance in community-dwelling older adults.

      Twenty community-dwelling older adults who satisfy the study criteria will be recruited to
      participate in this study. This group of participants will be selected to represent the
      general community-dwelling older adults as much as possible. They will demonstrate a range of
      ability in terms of their balance and mobility in which some are non-fallers and some
      fallers. All adults who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and have access to the internet
      via wireless connection will be included.

      Participants will be consented for the research study and will be assessed initially, after 1
      month of exercise and at the end of 2 months of exercise. Assessment will include
      questionnaires about health history, including falls, physical activity, balance confidence
      and system usability. Participants will also complete strength, balance and mobility physical
      performance tests. Age, sex, presence of comorbidities, medication list, functional
      abilities, balance confidence, fear of fall behavior and fall history will be assessed by
      questionnaire. Usability of the tablet-based questionnaire will be assessed by questionnaire.
      Participants will be tested with standard clinical tests of balance and gait.

      Participants will be closely supervised by a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) student during
      training in how to use the exercise program. Participants will complete a full set of
      exercises with the tablet in the presence of the DPT student. The DPT student will determine
      whether participants are safe with the program before allowing them to perform the program on
      their own at home. If the research team determines that a participant is unable to exercise
      safely on his/her own he/she will be withdrawn from the study.

      The tablet-based, video game exercise program is called Health in Motion and was developed by
      Blue Marble Game Company. Health in Motion was tested in a pilot study and found to reduce
      fall risk in 8 of 15 older participants without any adverse events. Participants will
      complete 2 months of the home-based balance exercise program using the Health in Motion app.
      Participants will be asked to perform the exercises for 30 minutes 3x/week. Participants will
      be asked to perform the exercise program for 2 months.

      Performance scores from the clinical gait and balance measures obtained during the initial
      visit will be compared to the performance scores obtained after 1 month and 2 months of
      performing the exercise program. We hypothesize that balance and gait will improve following
      2 months of performing the tablet-based fall prevention exercise program at home. The
      assessments performed by the DPT students and by the participant using the app will be
      compared. We hypothesize that the scores from self-assessment will closely correlate to the
      students' assessment. The system usability score will be examined to understand issues
      associated with using technology. We hypothesize that older adults will enjoy performing the
      exercises using the tablet format.

    <measure>Activity-specific balance confidence (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>ABC is a 16-item questionnaire regarding confidence to perform different activities (e.g., walking around the house, up and down stairs, and on icy surfaces) without losing balance. The scale ranges from 0% (no confidence at all) to 100% (completely confident). An overall average balance confidence score will be calculated for each subject.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The timed up and go test (TUG) is commonly used to assess functional mobility in older adults and is sensitive to fall risk (Shumway-Cook et al., 2000). The test involves standing up, walking as quickly and safely as possible for 3 m, turning around, walking back and then sitting down. Time to complete the TUG will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment (FGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 10 items of the FGA include walking while changing speed and turning the head, walking over obstacles, walking tandem, backward and with eyes closed and stair climbing. A maximum total score of 30 is possible with scores &lt; 22 indicating high risk for falling (Wrisley et al., 2010).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preferred gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed will be determined by instructing participants to walk at their normal pace over a 9-m pathway. The time to walk the middle 6 m will be measured using a stopwatch and gait speed calculated. Gait speed has excellent test-retest reliability (r = 0.90; Bohannon, 1997) and slower gait speed is associated with fall risk (Montero-Odasso et al., 2005).</description>

    <measure>Single Leg Stance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Single Leg Stance Test is a test of balance and requires participants to stand on one leg for up to 30 seconds. Up to three trials, using each leg will be performed. SLS is correlated with injurious falls (Vellas et al., 1997).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified clinical test of sensory interaction on balance (mCTSIB)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mCTSIB is organized into a series of 4 conditions of increasing difficulty and timed for a maximum of 30 seconds for each condition. The first two conditions involve a stable support surface with eyes open and eyes closed. The last two conditions involve a foam surface with eyes open and eyes closed. The mCTSIB score is the sum of the average time for each condition.</description>
