  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of JNJ-64179375 in Part 1
      (Intravenous dose) and Part 3 (Subcutaneous dose) and potential for reversibility of
      JNJ-64179375 induced Pharmacodynamic effects on coagulation parameters and platelet function
      (Part 2) in healthy male participants.
