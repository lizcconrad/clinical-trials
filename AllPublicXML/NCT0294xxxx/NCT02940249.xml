  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial hyperglycaemia can lead to adverse modifications to functional proteins within
      the body and eventually lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. Previous research by this
      group has shown that an apple polyphenol extract reduced hyperglycaemia following a
      high-carbohydrate meal. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of lower doses of
      the apple extract on postprandial glycaemia, insulinaemia and plasma gastric inhibitory
      polypeptide concentrations following a mixed carbohydrate test meal.

      Introduction:

      Sharp peaks in blood glucose levels can lead to adverse modifications to functional proteins,
      oxidative stress and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. It is therefore desirable to consume a
      diet that will allow more gradual rises in blood glucose levels after meals. Fruit
      polyphenols may help to limit the glucose excursion following a high carbohydrate meal.
      Previous research by this research group has demonstrated that 1200 mg of apple polyphenols
      (Appl'Inâ„¢) inhibited the average incremental area under the curve (T+0 to T+30 min) of plasma
      glucose by 54% relative to placebo. Possible mechanisms include inhibition of intestinal
      enzymes and inhibition of intestinal glucose absorption by decreasing SGLT1/GLUT2 transport
      activity. The literature also suggests that foods rich in polyphenols exert beneficial
      effects on risk factors of cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, lipid metabolism and
      vascular function.

      Study design:

      A randomised, controlled, double-blind, cross-over study will be conducted. Four matched test
      drinks will be consumed in random order on separate study visits immediately before a
      mixed-carbohydrate test meal, containing either: 1) 1.2 g, 2) 0.9 g 3). 0.6 g of apple
      polyphenols, or 4). placebo. Postprandial changes in plasma glucose, insulin, NEFA, GIP,
      GLP-1 concentrations as well as changes in vascular function will be measured. Twenty-four
      hour urine samples will be collected for analysis of urinary polyphenol metabolites and
      glucose. In a sub sample of participants, a paracetamol absorption test will be incorporated
      via addition of 1.5 g paracetamol into the test drink.
