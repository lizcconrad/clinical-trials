  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with prednisolone can be used as a proof of concept to investigate the possibility
      of immune modulation as a treatment for schizophrenia. It is expected that daily treatment
      with prednisolone in addition to antipsychotic treatment reduces psychotic symptoms and
      improves cognition, as compared to placebo. The investigators propose to investigate the
      effects of administering the corticosteroid prednisolone versus placebo in addition to
      standard antipsychotic medication in patients with early stage schizophrenia or related
      disorders, hypothesizing that a decrease in the overall low-grade cerebral inflammation due
      to prednisolon treatment will be expressed as a decrease in overall symptom severity.,
      Secondly, addition of prednisolone is hypothesised to slow down cognitive deterioration in
      recent-onset psychosis patients. Finally, the investigators aim to determine whether indirect
      immunological parameters of the hypothesised low grade inflammation status in schizophrenia
      are shifted due to the addition of prednisolone.

      In the current study, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of additional treatment
      with prednisolone on symptomatic improvement, global functioning, cognition and on
      immunological parameters in patients with early-stage psychotic disorder, applying a
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled add-on design. A placebo-controlled design was
      chosen in order to differentiate between clinical effects of prednisolone and effects
      associated with experimental treatment, such as induced expectations of participants.
      Prednisolone or placebo is provided next to existent antipsychotic medication as the
      investigators do not intend to replace existing treatment, this study being a Proof of
      Concept trial. It would carry considerable risks for patients to taper down existent
      antipsychotic medication and randomize patients to either placebo or a type of therapy for
      which the efficacy still has to be proven, even for a short period of time.

      90 patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder, or psychotic
      disorder NOS (not otherwise specified) will be included, with an age of 18-70 years and a
      time interval between the onset of psychosis and study entry not exceeding seven years. All
      90 in- and outpatients will be randomized 1:1 to either prednisolone or placebo daily for 6
      weeks. Prednisolone will be initiated at 40mg/day for 3 days and the 4 remaining days of the
      first week 30mg/dag will be used. During the treatment period, patients will be seen at
      weekly intervals to assess symptom severity, depressive mood and suicidal ideation, global
      functioning and side effects.
