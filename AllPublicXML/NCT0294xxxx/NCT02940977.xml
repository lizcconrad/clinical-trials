  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To elucidate the role of CTC detection in the evaluation of risk level in PCa patients,
           and establish a mathematic model for predicting the pathological status.

        2. To explore the possible subtle change in CTC condition after radical prostatectomy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Detect and evaluate the CTC status (a total of 5 times: 1 day before sugery, 3/6/9/12
           after surgery) for all of the PCa patients enrolled. Analyze the CTC result with PSA
           level, needle biopsy and radiological imaging information.

        2. Analyze the difference in CTC amount/Epithelial-Mesenchymal ratio between patients in
           different D'Amico risk level(low/intermediate/high).

        3. Establish a mathematic model based on the CTC results and pathological condition
           observed in operation (OC, organ confined; EPE, extraprostatic extension; SVI, seminal
           vesicle invasion; LNI, lymph node invasion), and compare this model with the latest
           version of Partin table.

        4. Detect and compare the CTC and PSA level in every 3 months (3/6/9/12) after surgery.
           Evaluate the radiological condition in 12 months after blood draw.
