  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Classically lung elastance and transpulmonary pressure are measured from the difference in
      tidal variations of airway pressure subtracted by tidal variations i esophagus pressure
      divided by the tidal volume. This requires the presence of a esophageal balloon catheter
      which is cumbersome and costly. In this study values obtained as described above are compared
      to values obtained with a new method in which a stepwise increase in positive endexpiratory
      pressure (PEEP) is performed with a size of the lung volume increase which corresponds to the
      tidal volume which the patient is ventilated with. The measurements are performed in sedated
      and mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit.

      Classically lung elastance and transpulmonary pressure are measured from the difference in
      tidal variations of airway pressure subtracted by tidal variations in esophageal pressure
      divided by the tidal volume (Method 1). This requires the presence of a esophageal balloon
      catheter which is cumbersome and costly.

      In this study values obtained as described in Method 1 above are compared to values obtained
      with a new method (Method 2) in which a PEEP-step is performed with a size of the lung volume
      increase which corresponds to the tidal volume which the patient is ventilated with.
      Measurements using Method 1 and 2 are performed in sedated and mechanically ventilated
      patients in the intensive care unit.
