  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer and its treatment can have profound effects on skeletal muscle, the most
      well-recognized being atrophy, weakness and diminished oxidative capacity. These adaptations
      negatively impact quality of life, treatment decisions and survival. Despite these
      consequences, the factors promoting these adaptations remain poorly defined and understudied
      in human patients. To address this gap in knowledge, our goal in this study is to examine the
      role of muscle disuse as a regulator of muscle size and function in human cancer patients
