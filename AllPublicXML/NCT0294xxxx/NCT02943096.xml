      The goal of this proposal is to conduct the first pilot study of whether consuming flavanol
      supplements will augment the cognitive and mood benefits of antidepressant medication in
      older adults with Late LifeDepression (LLD). Flavanols represent a specific group of plant
      derived nutrients that are found in cocoa beans, grapes, tea, berries and various other
      fruits and vegetables. The specific flavanols investigated in this study come from cocoa.
      Currently available treatments for LLD (i.e., antidepressant medication) are limited in
      efficacy, especially in individuals who also suffer from cognitive impairment. Recent studies
      performed at Columbia and elsewhere suggest that flavanols may induce beneficial brain
      changes that support cognitive functioning and elevate mood, but their precise clinical
      effects in older adults with combined depression and cognitive impairment remain to be
      evaluated. For this study, the investigators plan to recruit 50 adults aged ≥60 years who
      have Major Depressive Disorder, meet a minimum depressive symptom threshold despite currently
      receiving an adequate trial of an antidepressant, and have a significant cognitive complaints
      without a diagnosis of dementia. Subjects will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of
      augmentation treatment with flavanol capsules (in addition to continuing their
      antidepressant) vs. capsules not containing flavanols. Pre- and post-treatment MRI scanning
      of the brain will be conducted, and comprehensive pre- and post-treatment neuropsychological
      assessment will be performed. Results from this project will allow the investigators to
      evaluate a novel therapeutic approach to LLD, which could have large public health
      ramifications given the prevalence, frequent treatment resistance, and chronicity
      characteristic of LLD.

      The goal of this proposal is to conduct the first pilot study of whether consuming a diet
      high in flavanols will augment the cognitive and mood benefits of antidepressant medication
      in older adults with Late Life Depression (LLD). LLD affects 3% of community-dwelling adults
      over 60 years old, and 15% of older adults living in the community have clinically
      significant depressive symptoms. Diagnosis with LLD increases an older adult's risk of
      disability by 67-73% over 6 year follow up, causes twice the functional impairment compared
      to those without LLD, and is associated with high rates of completed suicide in individuals
      over 65. Currently available treatments for LLD (i.e., antidepressant medication) are limited
      in efficacy, leading to high rates of recurrence and frequent development of chronicity.
      Cognitive impairment, which is commonly associated with LLD, predicts poor acute response to
      antidepressants, leads to higher relapse rates during the continuation phase of treatment,
      and is associated with the development of adverse age-related health outcomes, including
      increased risk of dementia, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL), and driving
      cessation.

      Novel treatments addressing LLD's underlying neurobiology are critically needed, particularly
      therapies that may also have beneficial effects on the cognitive components of LLD. The most
      extensively studied brain region to be implicated in both the depressive and cognitive
      aspects of LLD has been the hippocampus. Decreased hippocampal volumes are found in depressed
      patients compared to controls, and this finding appears to be particularly pronounced in
      individuals with recurrent depressive illness. Among the subregions comprising the
      hippocampus, evidence suggests that it is decreased neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus
      (DG) specifically that may contribute to the development of depression, and it appears that
      part of the mechanism of action of antidepressants is to enhance neurogenesis in the DG. As
      the DG is also a critical contributor to the cognitive functions of the hippocampus, it
      stands out as a highly significant brain region that may be involved with both the mood and
      cognitive components of LLD.
