      The aim of this smartphone-based intervention study is to determine whether a newly developed
      app is effective in promoting an active lifestyle in low educated working young adults.

    <textblock>
      A stepwise approach was used to develop a new native Android smartphone app (Active Coach).
      This app aims to promote an active lifestyle (through physical activity and active transport)
      in low educated working young adults. The development of this app is based on theory,
      evidence and user's experiences. The app focuses on four determinants (knowledge, attitude
      (perceived benefits and perceived barriers), social support and self-efficacy) and includes
      several behavioral change techniques (self-monitoring, goal-setting, feedback on behavior,
      review behavior goals, instruction on how to perform the behavior, information about health
      consequences, enhancing network linkages and prompts/cues). Furthermore, the app works in
      combinations with a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit Charge) to track users activity
      behavior.

      For the smartphone-based intervention, 120 low educated working young adults are being
      recruited via purposeful convenience sampling though companies and employers. Participants
      can not have any medical conditions that prevent them from being physically active and they
      need to own an Android smartphone. Fitbit Charge activity trackers will be provided. The
      participants will be randomly divided in the intervention group or the standard information
      control group. The intervention period will be nine weeks. At the beginning and the end of
      the intervention period, physical activity levels will be objectively measured with
      accelerometers. Follow-up measurements will be conducted 12 weeks after the end of the
      intervention period.
