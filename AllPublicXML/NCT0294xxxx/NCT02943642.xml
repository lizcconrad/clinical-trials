      This study evaluates the effectiveness — as judged by complete response — of a single
      four-day treatment with the fusion protein A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) compared to oral Zolinza
      (Vorinostat), in a randomized 2-arm trial after a maximum of 12 months of treatment. Patient
      eligibility is stage IB/IIB mycosis fungoides with mSWAT &lt; 50 who have never had lymphoid
      disease or a prior bone marrow / HSCT transplant.

      Primary Objective: This study objective is to document the incidence of complete responses
      compared to oral vorinostat, in a randomized 2-arm trial after a maximum of 12 months of
      treatment for subjects with stage IB/IIB mycosis fungoides with mSWAT &lt; 50 who have never had
      lymphoid disease or a prior bone marrow / HSCT transplant.

      Secondary Objective: To further explore the toxicity profile of A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) fusion
      protein for subjects with mycosis fungoides who have been selected to be free from
      preexisting cardiac disease and never treated with Campath.

      Number of Subjects: Lead-in Dosing: 12 / Randomized: 162

      Patients will receive full supportive care during the course of the study. Participation in
      the study will require IV infusions of the research agent 2 times a day for four days
      (protocol FDA outpatient approved), as well as frequent outpatient blood draws for the first
      30 days. Patients with partial or complete remissions at their 1 month follow up visit will
      have another follow-up visit on day 60, then every three months for 1 year, followed by
      annual visits to assess duration of the response.

    <time_frame>Skin lesions will be judged for mSWAT scores for judging the duration of response at 12 months in the experimental arm and 6 months in the comparator arm.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR) in mycosis fungoides: (a) Cutaneous lesions consisting of erythematous patches and plaques and erythroderma must be absent giving an mSWAT of 0 that persists for at least 30 days, and (b) the spleen and liver should be normal sized by physical exam. Subjects in the experimental arm who have a CR at 12 months will be encouraged to enter the Part B followup that consists of a a yearly physical exam from year 2 to year to year 6 and skin assessment as long as the CR is maintained.
Partial Response (PR) in mycosis fungoides: (a) There must be a reduction of 50% in cutaneous lesions as judged by mSWAT and (b) no new evidence of disease or disease progression of skin lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 25% increase in the mSWAT score from its nadir value.
Treatment Failure: Failure to achieve a PR or CR: Relapse/Progression: Relapse is defined at reevaluation as no longer a CR or PR.</description>
