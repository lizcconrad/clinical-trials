          -  Patients with active infections or require treatments with immunosuppressive drugs at
             screening visit. However, patients require ongoing treatments with corticosteroids may
             be recruited.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) preceding the first dose of BLEX 404 Oral Liquid.
