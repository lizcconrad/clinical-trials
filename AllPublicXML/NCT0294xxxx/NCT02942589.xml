    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether food intake in response to large portion sizes
      differs between women who have received portion-control training and women who have not
      received such training. In a crossover design, women come to the laboratory on four occasions
      to eat a lunch of seven foods varying in energy density. Across meals, all foods are varied
      in portion size (100%, 125%, 150%, or 175% of baseline amounts). Food and energy intake is
      determined for each meal. Participants are from two groups: women who completed a one-year
      weight-loss trial in which they were trained in portion-control strategies, and women who had
      not received such training (community controls).
