      Specific Aim 1: Finalize development of the closed-loop strategy in the Moodify application.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the Moodify application with
      the target population to prepare for a large-scale efficacy trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Investigators have recently constructed a beta version of the Moodify
      application, comprised of the multi-modal assessment modules, several treatment modules and
      an initial version of the closed-loop algorithm to control treatment delivery. Utilizing the
      extensive experience in developing mobile assessment and treatment tools at Posit Science
      Corporation, the investigators will employ an iterative development process incorporating
      feedback from users (focus groups of patients with mood disorders), clinicians and scientists
      (project consultants) to achieve the following development goals: (1) Finalize Moodify's
      closed-loop algorithm to incorporate all assessment modules and expand the existing triage
      approach; (2) Expand cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) functions within the app; and (3)
      Expand in-app bi-directional communication feature between the clinician and user. At the
      completion of Specific Aim 1, the investigators will have a mobile app suitable for
      evaluation in a feasibility trial (Specific Aim 2).

      Specific Aim 2: The investigators will conduct a single arm, open label feasibility field
      trial with 25 participants that meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
      Participants will be asked to engage with the experimental cognitive treatment and spend up
      to six weeks engaged in 15 hours of cognitive training as an adjunct to their standard
      clinical treatment. The experimental cognitive treatment will be deployed as dictated by the
      closed loop predictive algorithm, with all patient data continuously accessible for remote
      monitoring by the attending clinicians and Posit Science Corporation (PSC) clinician and
      Principal Investigator, Dr. Thomas Van Vleet. Participants will be re-evaluated every two
      weeks during treatment use, and again at the expected time of completion of training, at 6
      weeks, to evaluate changes in cognitive function. Participants will then stop using their
      assigned program for 6 weeks, and return for a follow-up assessment to evaluate the endurance
      of changes in cognitive function in the absence of further program use.
