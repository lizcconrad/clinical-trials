  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the potential benefits of participant
      use of a smartphone application (&quot;App&quot;) called COPD Co-Pilot™. When used by the participant,
      COPD Co-Pilot™ may provide early detection of worsening COPD symptoms. Early symptom
      detection may allow the pulmonary providers and nurses to respond with timely medical advice
      and treatment. The goal for use of COPD Co-Pilot™ is to reduce the frequency and duration of
      hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and hospital readmissions. The study will also
      examine the financial impact of the COPD Co-Pilot™ program to determine whether costs of
      hospital stays, emergency department visits, and hospital readmissions differ when patients
      are enrolled in COPD Co-Pilot™ than when they are not enrolled. Another purpose of this study
      is to measure patient satisfaction with use of COPD Co-Pilot™.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the 6-month observational period, subjects will report respiratory symptoms using COPD
      Co-Pilot on a daily basis and will receive feedback and clinical recommendations from their
      health care provider when their symptoms change from their baseline symptoms. Final clinical
      recommendations, medical advice, diagnoses, and treatment are in the full and sole discretion
      of the provider.

      All subjects will receive current standard of care under the supervision of their health care
      provider. No experimental drugs, dosages, or treatment protocols will be administered at any
      stage during this trial.

      Subjects will receive monthly calls to determine whether any changes to the subject's medical
      history, hospitalization history, medications, etc. have occurred so they may be added to the
      subject's profile.

      At approximately 6 months post enrollment, all subjects will have an in person end of study
      visit.
