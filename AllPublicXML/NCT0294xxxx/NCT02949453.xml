  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous suicide attempt is known to be a strong risk factor for repetition and
      repetition is common within the first year after an episode of deliberate self-harm (DSH).
      There has been growing interest in brief interventions for this population that are focused
      on maintaining long-term contact and/or offering re-engagement with services when needed.
      Despite telephone-delivered interventions have shown promising results in suicide reattempt
      prevention, subjective impact of such brief contact interventions and effectiveness
      mechanisms have never been evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 20 patients previously receiving a
      telephone-delivered intervention from our team. Six weeks and 3 months after a DSH, people
      included in telephone-delivered process will be interviewed by a social science researcher.
      Qualitative analysis using thematic analysis will be independently performed by two
      researchers.
