  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to establish the clinical evidence for effect of video-game based
      rehabilitation therapy system using IMU sensors as a game interface, newly-developed in
      Korea, on upper limb function of children with cerebral palsy. First, the investigators would
      compare the effect of video-game based rehabilitation therapy to conventional occupational
      therapy.

      -  Purpose: to elucidate the effect of video-game based rehabilitation therapy system on
           upper limb function of children with cerebral palsy compared to conventional
           occupational therapy

        -  Subjects: total 30 children with cerebral palsy whose upper limb functions are impaired
           (all 30 children will receive the conventional occupational therapy, but 15 of these
           children will receive the additional video-game based rehabilitation therapy)

        -  Intervention: 4 weeks of therapy (6 days per week)

        -  Studies: functional MRI, computerized motion analysis, upper limb functional assessment
           (MUUL, ULPRS), ADL evaluation, cognitive evaluation

        -  Evaluation plan: 1) pre-intervention, 2) post-4 weeks of intervention, 3) 8 weeks after
           end of intervention

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total score of Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MUUL is the test of unilateral upper limb function is a validated and reliable tool for evaluating quality of upper limb movement in children with neurological conditions. It comprises 14 test items of reaching to, grasping, releasing and manipulating simple objects. Scoring is completed for the 30 item scores using a three, four or five point scale and the individually defined scoring criteria. The test will be done by occupational therapist. The total score of MUUL will be used for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total score of upper limb physician's rating scale (ULPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>ULPRS assess changes in the movement pattern, focusing on all 3 levels of the arm (palm, forearm, and elbow) to determine whether there is an isolated functional impairment, such as thumb in palm, restricted forearm supination, or a total flexion pattern with thumb in palm, wrist in flexion, forearm supinated, and elbow flexed. The score sheet includes 9 items, and 3-, 4-, and 5-point scales are used to score each component of movement tested. The total score of ULPRS will be used for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scaled scores of Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI-selfcare)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>PEDI is a descriptive measure of a child's current functional performance. It measures both capability and performance of functional activities in three content domains: Self-care, Mobility, Social function. PEDI-selfcare section will be administered by occupational therapist. The Scaled scores of PEDI-selfcare will be used for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinematic data of computerized 3D motion analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>3D motion analysis will be performed using a computerized motion analysis system (VICON MX-T10 System with 6 infrared cameras, Oxford Metrics Inc., Oxford, UK) to measure the kinematic data (angle of each joint) during the task of drinking from a cup. Kinematic data of forearm pronation or supination, wrist flexion or extension, ulnar deviation or radial deviation will be used for analysis.</description>

    <description>The Rapael kids, a video-game based rehabilitation therapy system using IMU sensors as a game interface, newly-developed in Korea will be used on upper limb function of children with cerebral palsy. All 40 children will receive the conventional occupational therapy, but 20 of these children will receive the additional video-game based rehabilitation therapy. The additional video-game based training will be performed 30 minutes daily 6 times per week, for 4 weeks. The conventional occupation therapy will be performed 30 minutes daily 5 times per week, for 4 weeks.</description>
