  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell
      lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Different chemotherapy and radiation regimens have been advocated but
      in general, cisplatin-doublets are deemed standard of care. Decreasing the overall treatment
      time of irradiation by hypofractionation is thought to increase the efficacy. Extensive
      experience is available on the combination of daily-dose cisplatin in combination with
      hypofractionated radiotherapy. However, no data is available on the safety of cisplatin
      doublets and hypofractionated radiotherapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with locally advanced NSCLC will be consented to participate in this
      phase 2 trial that evaluates the concurrent treatment of cisplatin (Day 1: 75mg/m2) and
      pemetrexed (Day 1: 500mg/m2 for non-squamous cell lung cancer) or etoposide (Day1-3 100mg/m2
      for squamous cell lung cancer), 3-weekly regimens, together with radiotherapy (24 daily
      fractions of 2.42 Gy to the mediastinal lymph nodes with an integrated boost of 2.75 Gy to
      the primary tumour). An interim analysis is planned following the first cohort of 25 patients
      to assess safety.
