  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DFDBA is an allograft that possesses osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. It has
      the potential for osteoinduction due to increased expression of bone morphogenetic protein
      (BMP).Cerabone™ has shown maximum resemblance to human bone with the potential to reconstruct
      bone defects. Decortication is performed as a part of guided bone regeneration (GBR)
      procedure as it enhances the healing process.Therefore a combination of decortication and
      bone graft when applied in periodontal intrabony defect would enhance the regeneration of
      periodontium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been great strides in the management of periodontal intrabony defects, especially
      with the use of bone graft materials. It is necessary to choose the most appropriate material
      and procedure in order to obtain the desired regeneration. Among the bone grafts,
      Demineralised freezed dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and xenografts have shown good results in
      the management of intrabony defects. Recently, a novel bovine xenograft i.e., Cerabone™ has
      shown maximum resemblance to human bone with the potential to reconstruct bone defects.
      Decortication or intramarrow penetration of the bone has shown favourable results in guided
      bone regeneration procedures. So the goal of the present study was to check the efficacy of
      decortication with decalcified freeze dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and Cerabone™ bone grafts
      and to compare the response between the bonegrafts placed following decortication using RVG
      and CBCT, in intrabony defect.

      The combination of decortication with bone grafts i.e., DFDBA and (Cerabone)TM can be an
      added advantage in the treatment of intrabony defects. To the best of the investigators
      knowledge no clinical trial reports this combination therapy in scientific literature. There
      is need for further research in this area.
