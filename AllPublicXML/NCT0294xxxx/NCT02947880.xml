  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a previous therapeutic trial, investigators showed that the bumetanide improved
      significantly autism. This trial showed that a therapeutic response was obtained in 75% of
      cases.

      These first results were reinforced by a study led with adult patients for whom the eye
      tracking measurements as well as the functional MRI showed a diminution of the response time
      and a modification (amplification) of the cerebral response during an emotions recognition
      test.

      Finally, investigators confirmed the physiological mechanism behind the action of the
      bumetanide in a study in two mouse models of autism.

For the patient of 25kg and more the bumetanide is used at the posology of 1mg in the morning and 1mg in the evening, for patient under 25kg the posology is 0.5mg in the morning and 0.5mg in the evening.
After the 3 months in the double blind trial (bumetanide versus placebo), all the patient will receive (in the open phase of the trial) the bumetanide during 3 months with the posology fitting with their weights.</description>
