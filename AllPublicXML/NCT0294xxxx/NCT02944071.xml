    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study to demonstrate the
      acceptable safety and performance of angioplasty with the Ranger DCB in native
      femoropopliteal artery lesions. It is intended that all patients with qualifying lesions
      would be considered for enrollment and treated with the Ranger DCB catheter. Approximately
      123 patients with femoropopliteal artery lesions will be enrolled. All lesions will be
      treated with the Ranger DCB. Up to 15 clinical sites located in China are expected to
      participate.
