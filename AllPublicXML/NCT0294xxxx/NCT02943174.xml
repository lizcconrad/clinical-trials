  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation aims to apply and test the feasibility of an acceptance, mindfulness and
      compassionate-based intervention structured for cancer patients. MIND programme for cancer
      thus comprises 8 weekly group sessions, lasting 1 and a half hour each, run in small groups
      at an Oncology Service at the Coimbra's University Hospital. For each week participants have
      assigned homework (e.g., mindfulness exercises). This programme mainly aims to increase
      participants' physical and psychosocial quality of life, and attenuate depressed mood and
      anxiety. Additionally, this study also intends to explore whether the reduction of depression
      and anxiety symptoms will promote better results in the medical treatments of the
      participants, and influence the course and prognosis of the illness.

      The sample will include diagnosed cancer patients recruited at an Oncology Service at the
      Coimbra's University Hospital. Patients will be approached by their doctor to assess their
      level of interest in the investigation. Patients who demonstrate interest will go through a
      Screening interview conducted by a licensed psychologist that aims explain the structure and
      arms of the investigation, to collect demographic data, and whether the patient meets the
      inclusion criteria for the study. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and demonstrate
      interest in participating in the study, will sign an informed consent. All ethical
      requirements for research with humans are guaranteed.

      Afterwards, participants will be randomized in two groups (experimental and control group).
      Both groups will maintain the medical treatment as usual (TAU). Additionally, the
      experimental group will enroll in the MIND programme for cancer patients, also provided by a
      licensed psychologist and a co-therapist.

      Both groups will concurrently complete a protocol of self-report measures and their medical
      data will be collected by the medical staff of the Hospital (to measure main three areas: a)
      psychological processes; b) quality of life and psychopathology; c) current medical status).
      These assessments will occur in four different times: before the start of the MIND programme
      M0), after the final session of the programme (M1), and 3 (M2) and 6 months (M4) after that.
