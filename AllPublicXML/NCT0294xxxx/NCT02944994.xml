      The purpose of this study is to examine effectiveness and implementation for the Unified
      Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in trauma exposed veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and mood diagnoses are chronic and devastating with respect to costs to the
      individual and the healthcare system, and are more prevalent than any other class of
      disorders. When these disorders present concurrently, the significant public health
      implications and societal costs are intensified. Despite high rates of comorbidity and
      underlying mechanistic similarities between treatment protocols, single disorder evidence-
      based psychotherapy protocols for these disorders have traditionally been recommended to
      treat emotional disorders sequentially. Moreover, when clinicians are presented with complex
      case presentations, they are often unprepared to treat them and move away from evidence-based
      approaches, potentially increasing the burden on the mental health system. The Unified
      Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is an innovative
      transdiagnostic protocol with promising evidence for successful treatment of emotional
      disorders, both for standalone and comorbid presentations, including the classification of
      not otherwise specified (NOS) disorders. To date, there have only been efficacy trials of the
      UP, which limit generalizability and do not address the larger public health impact and
      effectiveness in routine clinical care settings with both psychiatric and medical
      comorbidity. To address this critical limitation, the applicant proposes a pilot feasibility,
      acceptability, and tolerability study of the UP in patients with diverse psychiatric and
      medical comorbidity to manualized supportive therapy within a hospital. The deployment
      focused model (DFM) will inform design and statistical analyses. An additional aim includes
      determining the feasibility, acceptability, perceived fit and satisfaction of the UP in
      clinic settings through surveying and interviewing stakeholders in the system that are
      implementing the UP through the study. Consultation with stakeholders can minimize the time
      required to collect and assess fit within the larger system and, therefore, minimizes the
      time lag between science and practice in routine care settings. This study addresses an
      important public health concern by examining the effectiveness of the UP in a new population
      as a strategy for treatment of common and debilitating mental disorders in routine care
      settings. Furthermore, the proposed research aims will complement a comprehensive training
      plan to prepare the applicant to become an independent investigator with expertise in
      implementation science and effectiveness research. Results from the study will provide
      important information about whether or not this efficacious treatment can be effective,
      efficient, and ready for implementation in routine care settings in which psychiatric and
      medical comorbidity are common. This study will also serve as a model of deploying
      efficacious treatments into generalist clinics.

    <description>These interviews will occur at one time point and will be analyzed with Qualitative Comparative Analyses guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Qualitative analyses are often descriptive in nature and a summary of common themes are reported to speak to factors impacting implementation of the intervention in this population. NVivo software will be used to aggregate the qualitative interviews from all participants and highlight the common themes across CFIR interviews</description>

    <description>Change will be examined from baseline through the end of treatment. For each participant it will be reported if there was a change in each participants clinician administered diagnostic assessment and the resulting clinician severity rating for each mental health diagnosis. This assessment will be used in conjunction with the CAPS-5 (outcome 3) to inform the presence or absence of clinical diagnoses at baseline and follow-up. Each has it's own metric, but can be used to show the presence or absence of a clinical level of the diagnosis</description>

    <description>Change will be examined from baseline through the end of treatment. For each participant it will be reported if there was a change in each participants clinician administered diagnostic assessment and the resulting severity rating for a PTSD diagnosis. This assessment will be used in conjunction with the ADIS-5 (outcome 2) to inform the presence or absence of clinical diagnoses at baseline and follow-up. Each has it's own metric, but can be used to show the presence or absence of a clinical level of the diagnosis. They cannot be combine into one variable unless a dichotomous score is calculated to indicate a clinical diagnosis more broadly is present versus absent.</description>
