  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed asymptomatic
      coronary artery disease (CAD) in Kalamazoo and its neighboring areas using Coronary Computed
      Tomography (CCTA) and Coronary Artery Calcium Score (CACS) to assess if asymptomatic CAD is
      widespread enough to warrant implementation of CCTA as a routine screening tool.
      Additionally, this study will use the CCTA results to evaluate several methods of assessing
      CAD risk in the asymptomatic population including Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and Reynold's
      Risk Score, Biomarkers (High sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, Fibrinogen, Vertical Auto
      Profile, oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), Apolipoprotein B1
      (ApoB1), Vitamin D, Homocysteine) as well as a large panel of genetic markers of
      atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia.
