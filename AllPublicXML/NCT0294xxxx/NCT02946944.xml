    <description>After arrival to the emergency department, a series of surveys to determine the risk of death from pulmonary embolism are carried out. Then angiography, tensiometry of SBCC, catheter thrombus fragmentation are scheduled. Then puncture of the right jugular vein is performed. PigTail catheter is inserted via guidewire into the pulmonary artery . Angiography of the pulmonary arteries is performed. Miller index is calculated. Catheter thrombus fragmentation is performed by a PigTail catheter. RV, RA pressures are measured. In the ICU heparin is prescribed (of 1000 units per hour) under the control of PTT (50-75s). The next day patients are randomizaed to assign them into 2 groups. Dual drug therapy is going to be administered to this group (experimental): sildenafil 30mg 3p \ g + 10 mg apixaban 2p \ d for 14 days. On the 7th day MSCT angiography of the pulmonary aretry with contrast and echocardiogram are performed. On the 14th day the controlechocardiogram is performed .</description>
