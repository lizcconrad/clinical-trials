  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a known complication of the postoperative period after spinal surgery, where
      prescription pain medicines called opioids are traditionally used in high doses for the
      treatment of surgery-related pain. The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness
      of Movantik (naloxegol)—a FDA-approved drug used to treat constipation that is caused by
      opioids—in preventing constipation in patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery at MGH.

    <description>Subjects in the treatment group will be administered MOVANTIK™ (naloxegol) 25 mg tablet or placebo once daily beginning 2 hours after the completion of their surgery until their discharge from the hospital (variable timing). Subjects with renal impairments (creatine clearance rate of less than 60 mL/min) will receive a 12.5 mg dose tablet of naloxegol in place of the 25 mg dose as advised by FDA guidelines. For patients who are unable to swallow the tablet whole, the tablet can be crushed and given orally or administered via nasogastric tube.</description>

    <description>Matching placebo consists of an inert mixture supplied by AstraZeneca in identical-appearing tablets.
