  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant African American women between 18 and 45 years of age will be enrolled at 20 weeks
      of gestation or less. Biological specimens (vaginal swabs, rectal swab) will be collected at
      enrollment, 23-24 weeks, at 28-29 weeks, and at the onset of labor. A urine sample will be
      obtained at entry and at the time of delivery for metabolomic analysis. Participants will
      also collect a dietary survey at entry, 23-24 weeks, and 28-29 weeks. The biological
      specimens will then be analyzed for their microbiomial profile. This will then be correlated
      with the timing of their delivery as well as other comorbidities such as obesity,
      hypertension, and diabetes.
