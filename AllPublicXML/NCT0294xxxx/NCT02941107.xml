  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Australian Indigenous children, particularly those living in remote communities, suffer a
      disproportionately high burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis disease. Despite the introduction
      of rotavirus vaccine into the Northern Territory (NT) Immunisation Schedule in 2006, the rate
      of hospitalization for rotavirus in NT Aboriginal children &lt; 5 years continues to be high,
      and the rate ratio of rotavirus hospitalisations for Indigenous versus non-Indigenous
      children has actually increased. The reasons for sub-optimal vaccine response are not
      completely understood, but both reduced vaccine immune responses and low vaccine coverage are
      likely to be important factors.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if Aboriginal children who receive an additional
      dose of RV1 between the ages of 6 and 12 months, will have an increase anti-rotavirus serum
      IgA seroconversion and decreased medical presentations with gastroenteritis in the first
      three years of life, compared to those who receive placebo.
