      Purpose of this clinical trial is to improve prediction of outcomes from surgical
      intervention in patients with Primary aldosteronism, and evaluate the merits of non-invasive
      metomidate PET CT versus adrenal vein sampling in the diagnosis of surgically correctable
      aldosteronism.

      This is an observational cohort study which takes place within existing secondary and
      tertiary care practice of the NHS. It is a multi-centre study in which all participants to
      have the same two investigations performed in random order. These are as follows:

      11C- metomidate PET CT This is a one-hour non-invasive study, prior to which participants are
      treated with dexamethasone for 3 days.

      Adrenal Vein Sampling This is an invasive investigation in which both adrenal veins are
      cannulated and blood collected for measurement of adrenal steroid hormones.
      Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is administered prior to AVS in order to ensure steroid
      hormone secretion during the procedure.

      The investigators will standardise the start-time of treatment with spironolactone, which is
      first-choice treatment for participants with primary aldosteronism, in order that the
      pre-spironolactone blood pressure and biochemistry can be compared with subsequent
      measurements post-surgery, and the changes during the first month of spironolactone treatment
      can be used to assess their value in predicting response to surgery.

      Sub-study of Repeat Metomidate PET CT before and after Spironolactone therapy

      In order to determine whether it will be necessary for the start of spironolactone treatment
      to be delayed in all participants until after both investigations are completed, the
      investigators will perform a sub-study, early in MATCH, in which 6 patients have their PET CT
      repeated after at least 6 weeks treatment with spironolactone. (This is the conventional
      period of time for which spironolactone is withdrawn prior to AVS.)

      Follow-up management and investigations The investigators anticipate ~50% of participants
      will be found on one or both investigations to have unilateral PA, and be recommended for
      adrenalectomy.

      The primary outcome measurements will be at 6 months after surgery.

      Primary outcomes:

        1. Change in ARR from baseline to 6 months after treatment

        2. Change in SBP (mean of at least 18 measurements from 3 days' home monitoring), from
           baseline to 6 months after treatment

      Secondary outcomes

        1. Cure of hypertension, defined as the proportion of patients in whom average home blood
           Pressure measurements 6 months post adrenalectomy are &lt;140/90 mmHg on no treatment.

        2. Prediction of cure of hypertension, by one or more of:

             1. The ratio of SUVmax between tumour and normal adrenal;

             2. Blood pressure fall on spironolactone (50 mg daily for 2 weeks, 100 mg daily for 2
                weeks), measured as the difference in home systolic blood pressure

             3. Post-operative analyses of the APA, to include genotyping for somatic mutations in
                KCNJ5, CACNA1D, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CTNNB1 and phenotyping by histological grading
                (zona fasciculata versus zona glomerulosa), gene expression and
                immunohistochemistry.

        3. Change in home blood pressure from baseline at follow-up visits other than 6 months
           post-adrenalectomy.

        4. Reduction in number of antihypertensive drugs

        5. Change from baseline in blood levels of Troponin, Brain Natriuretic Peptide. The
           judgement as to which patients have met primary and secondary outcomes will be made by a
           critical endpoints committee meeting every 3-6 months throughout the study.

      The sample size calculation has been performed to permit detection of a significant influence
      on outcome where the smallest number of patients will be available. This is the group of
      patients in whom the two diagnostic techniques give discordant results, estimated to be ~20%
      of the total. Recruitment of 140 patients across 3 centres over 3 years (&lt;1/centre/month),
      with an estimated 70 proceeding to adrenalectomy, permits 90% power at alpha=0.01 of
      detecting superiority of PET CT over AVS.

          -  Diagnosis of PHA based on published Endocrine Society consensus guidelines.

          -  Patients will be enrolled/consented when they have had each of the following:

               1. At least one paired measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone, measured off
                  spironolactone, showing an elevated ARR.

                  pmol/L)' (as per Endocrine Society guidance)

               3. a CT or MRI scan of the adrenals with probable or definite adenoma(s)

        Patients with elevated ARR can be put forward for consideration by the MDT as exceptional

        performed, IF:

          1. Plasma Aldosterone &gt; 450 pmol/L AND plasma renin &lt;0.5 pmol/ml/hr (&lt;9 mU/L) if measured
             on treatment with ACEI (Lisinopril &gt;=20 mg or equivalent) or ARB (Losartan 100 mg or
             equivalent); OR

          2. Age &lt;40 AND definite adrenal adenoma on CT or MRI Patients whose CT/MRI does not show
             probable or definite adenoma must also be reviewed by MDT before enrolment/consent

        All patients will have a positive Aldosterone renin ratio (ARR) serum measurement with
        another local diagnostic confirmatory test as specified from local specialised APA
        Guidelines. This is often standard cross-sectional imaging by CT or MR scanning. Any

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those patients who indicate that they are unlikely to proceed with surgery will not be
             recruited, because there will be no outcome change in blood pressure, restoration of
