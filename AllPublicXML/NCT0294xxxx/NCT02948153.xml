  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study raises two main hypotheses: 1) Asthmatics patients who present with bronchial
      hypersecretion differ phenotypically from asthmatic patients without hypersecretion and 2)
      mucins in asthmatic patients with hypersecretion of bronchial mucus and the expression of
      TLRs differ from non-mucus hypersecretory asthmatics patients.

    <textblock>
      Asthma with bronchial hypersecretion is a type of asthma poorly studied. Its pathogenesis is
      not well understood but probably is related to the innate impaired immunity, particularly
      with &quot;toll-like receptors&quot; (TLR) and secretory mucin (MUC).

      Objectives 1) Define the clinical and inflammatory phenotype of asthma with bronchial
      hypersecretion of mucus. 2) Compare the type of mucin present in induced sputum (IS) of
      patients with and without bronchial hypersecretion. 3) Determine the expression of TLRs in
      the IS and in the peripheral blood of asthmatics with and without bronchial hypersecretion.

      Method: Cross-sectional study which included 43 asthmatic patients, 19 with and 24 without
      bronchial hypersecretion. All patients underwent the following: IS, spirometry, fractional
      exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), prick test, total IgE and blood albumin. Analysis of mucins
      (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC1) was determined by ELISA and expression of TLR2 and TLR4 by
      flow cytometry. The level of asthma control was determined by the asthma control test
      questionnaire (ACT) and quality of life was assessed by the MiniAQLQ questionnaire.

      <textblock>
        Male and female subjects aged &gt; 18 years, non-smokers, who fulfilled the diagnostic
        criteria of asthma were consecutively enrolled from the Asthma Unit outpatient clinic of
        our institution. We defined asthma as a history of variable respiratory symptoms and
        evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation. All patients had a positive
        bronchodilator test or daily peak expiratory flow variability greater than 20%, or a
        positive methacholine challenge test documented in case history. Asthma severity was
        defined according to the Global Initiative for Asthma Management (GINA)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-smokers, asthma diagnosed as per the Global INitiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria
             on maintenance treatment for asthma, aged 18 to 80 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from the study if they had a respiratory tract infection and/or
             required the use of oral corticosteroids within 30 days prior to inclusion; if they
             had a concomitant disease (sarcoidosis, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis,
             bronchiectasis, nephropathy, rheumatic or liver disease); significant comorbidity that
             could affect the study results in the physician's judgment; or a cognitive impairment
             that could limit their comprehension of the subject under study or their ability to
             participate
