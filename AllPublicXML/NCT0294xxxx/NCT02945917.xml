  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of esophageal balloon catheter to estimate pleural pressure has gained renewed
      popularity in recent years. Indeed, measurement of transpulmonary pressure may allow a more
      pathophysiological-based approach to ventilator strategy in acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) patients. Nevertheless, it is well known that esophageal balloon catheter
      derived parameters can be influenced by several patient-related or technical-related factors.

      During a PEEP trial, the investigators will observe in-vivo the esophageal pressure and
      derived measurements obtained using different esophageal balloon calibration volumes.
