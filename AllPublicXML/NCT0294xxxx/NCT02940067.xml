      This is a pilot study to investigate the effect of prehabilitation on patients undergoing
      elective surgery for pancreatic disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic surgery is high risk. The injury associated with surgery causes a stress response,
      comprising a variety of hormonal and metabolic effects. Patients undergoing pancreatic
      surgery experience one of the largest stress responses. Prehabilitation is the process of
      enhancing an individual's fitness, thereby improving tolerance to an upcoming physiological
      stress such as surgery. Studies involving prehabilitation have been shown to improve recovery
      after surgery and reduce complication rates. There are currently no published reports of
      prehabilitation involving patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. This research study will
      explore the effect of prehabilitation in these patients.

      Patients with pancreatic disease are some of the least fit surgical candidates due to the
      disease process. Exercise training can improve physical fitness before elective abdominal
      surgery and nutritional supplementation can also influence clinical course via different
      mechanisms. Patients with pancreatic disease are often malnourished for several reasons. We
      propose a multimodal approach to prehabilitation involving dietary and exercise interventions
      during a four-week period preceding elective surgery. Core data will be collected from
      cardiopulmonary exercise tests and blood tests (to assess insulin sensitivity), before and
      after prehabilitation. Secondary outcomes such as length of stay and complications will also
      be measured postoperatively.
