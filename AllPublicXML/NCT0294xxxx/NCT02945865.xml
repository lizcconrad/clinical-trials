  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 45-80 % of nursing home residents have substantial pain at any given
      time. Residents with impaired cognition have been found to report chronic pain more often,
      more frequent and more severe, compared to residents with normal cognition. Approximately 3/4
      of permanent residents in nursing homes in Norway have developed dementia. The burden of
      dementia is often compounded by painful conditions. Despite over a decade of research on the
      subject, inadequate pain assessment and management remain significant problems among
      institutionalized older adults, with and without dementia. The poor pain management in
      patients with dementia has been attributed, at least in part, to difficulties with, and lack
      of, pain assessment in this population. Therefore, this study seek to determine the effect of
      regular pain assessment.

      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of regular pain assessment on pain management
      interventions applied and patient outcomes among patient with severe dementia.

      A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted. A cluster is defined as a single
      independent nursing home. The clusters will be randomly assigned to either the experimental
      or control condition. Appropriate information will be given to both the intervention and the
      control group. All nurses in the experimental conditions will be taught how to administer the
      DOLOPLUS-2. The study will start after the initial education session. During the 3-month
      study period, the participating nursing staff will be asked to complete the DOLOPLUS-2
      regularly. The control groups will receive standard methods of care. Data collection at
      baseline and at 4, 8 and 12 months.
