  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TGCT is a rare disease that is difficult to manage, surgical resection is the primary
      treatment currently available. To date no disease registry exists and there is little data
      available detailing the management of patients with diffuse TGCT, the burden of diffuse TGCT
      for patients (including pain, joint stiffness, swelling, reduced mobility and quality of
      life) or the economic impact of diffuse TGCT.

      This study aims to collect data by an observational disease registry involving no
      intervention to the patient or changes to investigators treatment decisions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GCT is a rare, benign, but potentially locally aggressive and recurrent disease. Treatment
      pattern and treatment initiation, continuation or changes are solely at the discretion of the
      physician and the patient.

      There will be no attempt to influence the prescribing patterns of any individual treating
      physician. All medication will be prescribed in the usual standard of care and will not be
      provided by the study sponsor.

      Participation in the study will in no way influence payment or reimbursement for any
      treatment received by patients during the study.

      It is the responsibility of the investigator and his study staff to enter all relevant
      patient data required for this registry in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and in the
      patients' medical records.

      Approximately 15 sites from up to 6 European Countries (France, Germany, Italy, The
      Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom) are planned to participate. The sites will be
      specialized sites that treat diffuse TGCT regularly.

    <measure>Mean Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Average Interference Score From Baseline through 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI short form is a 5 minutes self administered questionnaire that assesses severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week. The change from baseline at each time point reflects the month X value minus the baseline value. The BPI average interference score ranges from 0 (pain does not interfere) to 10 (pain completely interferes).

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Worst Stiffness numerical rating scale (NRS) is a one-item self-administered questionnaire assessing the &quot;worst&quot; stiffness in the last 24 hours. The NRS for this item ranges from 0 (&quot;no stiffness&quot;) to 10 (&quot;stiffness as bad as you can imagine&quot;).

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a set of person-centered measures, developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health. Physical function items relevant to the assessment of lower and upper limb function are to be selected from the PROMIS physical function item bank. Items assessing lower limb function will be administered to subjects with lower extremity tumors, and items assessing upper limb function will be administered to subjects with upper extremity tumors. The results from both sets of items will be combined and analyzed together.

    <measure>Mean Scores on the EuroQol Questionnaire (EQ) of 5 Dimensions (5D) on a Standardized 5-level (5L) Descriptive Health Status Scale (EQ-5D-5L), from Baseline through 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation.
The EQ-5D-5L is the health state description for measuring health status. The descriptive system comprises the 5 dimensions of mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The participants self-rate each dimension on a 5-point, categorical scale: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation.
The EQ VAS is the evaluation that records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, VAS with ends labeled &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot;.
