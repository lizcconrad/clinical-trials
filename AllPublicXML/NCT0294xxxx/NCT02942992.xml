  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop an intervention specifically targeted for these clients who have the frailty
      syndrome. The Investigators propose to develop an exercise intervention that can reduce
      frailty in older adults to facilitate their ability to age-in-place. The long-term objective
      of this work is to develop a package of interventions that can be administered within the
      existing Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Waiver programs. The specific goal
      of this proposal is to develop a resistance exercise intervention to reduce frailty in older
      adults receiving long term care services in their home through the Illinois Community Care
      Program, a HCBS Waiver Program.
