      The China Pulmonary Thromboembolism Registry Study (CURES) is a prospective multicenter
      registry project initiated in January 2008 and consisting in obtaining an extensive data
      registry of consecutive patients with pulmonary thromboembolism.

        -  The main objective of this registry study is to help physicians to improve their
           knowledge on the natural history of pulmonary thromboembolism, including epidemiological
           characteristics, personal history, risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnostic
           methods, therapeutic regimens, clinical outcomes, prognosis, etc..

        -  Secondly, this study is also aimed to find some useful information for some patients who
           are usually not recruited in randomized clinical trials (pregnant women, elderly
           patients, disseminated cancer, severe renal insufficiency, patients with
           contraindications to anticoagulation therapy, extreme body weight, etc).

        -  Thirdly, the ultimate purpose of CURES study is decreasing mortality, frequency of
           thromboembolic recurrences as well as bleeding complications and arterial events.

      The China Pulmonary Thromboembolism Registry Study (CURES) is a prospective multicenter
      registry study initiated in January 2008 and consisting in obtaining an extensive data
      registry of consecutive patients with pulmonary thromboembolism across P.R. China.

      This study is a three-stage design:

        -  Stage I: from January 2008 to June 2011, the CURES study consecutively enrolled about
           3,000 eligible pulmonary thromboembolism patients without follow-up;

        -  Stage II: from July 2011 to July 2016, the CURES study continued to enroll about 5,000
           objectively confirmed pulmonary thromboembolism patients with three month follow-up;

        -  Stage III: from August 2016 to December 2019, the CURES study plans to further enroll
           3,000 pulmonary thromboembolism patients with at least three month follow-up, as well as
           collect their blood samples for thromboembolism relevant biomarkers and genetic
           background.
