  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospectively registered database of patients with early breast cancer who will be
      treated with radiotherapy during surgery. More than 2000 women have already received this
      treatment in clinical trials. This study will monitor the health status of women who receive
      this treatment outside of a clinical trial, especially those who might not have been eligible
      for the original clinical trials. The aim is to confirm the long-term effectiveness and
      safety of the technique.

      Registration of patients selected for this treatment; collecting data regarding safety and
      toxicity on patients who have had treatment with TARGIT.

      Outcomes will be measured over short and long terms. Outcome measures will include
      effectiveness and safety, assessed in various cohorts of patients. Core outcomes will be used
      for effectiveness. In addition, true recurrence (basically, ipsilateral breast tumor
      recurrence at the same site as the original primary) will be used as defined by Recht. Safety
      outcomes will be based on Common Toxicity Criteria.

      Budget impact analysis of IORT in subgroups of patients will be assessed. This amounts to
      using cost data to calculate the mean incremental (or extra) cost per person treated using
      intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) versus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and mastectomies
      (where IORT could have been given instead) and then multiplying this by the total patients
      eligible nationally for IORT, to calculate the total expected budget impact on the NHS if
      IORT in these subgroups was rolled out nationally.

        The target population is very wide, reflecting the pragmatic nature of this study.

        There will be few inclusion and exclusion criteria. Basically, any person aged over 18 with
        early breast cancer suitable for breast conserving surgery will be eligible. More specific
        entry criteria for those aged 45 or less will be defined by a participating institution's
        multidisciplinary team. Experience to date has indicated that there are many patients who
        are deemed unsuitable for a course of external beam radiotherapy whose only option is
        therefore mastectomy; such situations can be difficult to define in advance, and should be
        decided on a case-by-case basis.
