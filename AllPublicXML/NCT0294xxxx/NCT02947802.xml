  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an online survey assessing consumer support for different labeling policies related
      to sugar sweetened beverages. The investigators will present consumers with three labels that
      are being considered for sugar sweetened beverages: a calorie label, a text warning label
      that says &quot;Warning drinking beverages with added sugar(s) can lead to health problems like
      obesity, diabetes and tooth decay&quot; and a graphic warning label that includes graphic images
      to correspond with each of the health problems listed with the text warning. The
      investigators will ask participants their support for each label. The investigators will also
      see if support for the labels change after learning of the effectiveness of these labels. The
      investigators will share the results of a recent field study that suggested calorie and
      textual warning labels had no influence on the purchasing of sugar sweetened beverages while
      the graphic label decreased purchasing by 11 percent.
