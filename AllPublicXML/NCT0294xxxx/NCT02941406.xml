  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the reproducibility of the MP3 and to compare
      the results with conventional perimetry using the Octopus 101 in healthy subjects and
      patients with macular disease.

    <measure>Reproducibility of retinal sensitivity measurements using microperimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>Two measurement within one week</time_frame>
    <description>Two study measurements are scheduled within one week. Test-retest reproducibility will be assessed for retinal sensitivity using the coefficient of repeatability and Bland-Altman diagrams.</description>
