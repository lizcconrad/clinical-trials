    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study genetically engineered NK92 cell therapy in
      treating patients with CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemias that is relapsed (after stem
      cell transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to further chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor NK92 cells transduced
      with the anti-CD33 vector (referred to as anti-CD33 CAR-NK cells).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-leukemia response due to anti-CD33
      CAR-NK cell infusions.

      II. For patients with stored or accessible leukemia blasts, determine leukemia cell killing
      by anti-CD33 CAR-NK in vitro.

      III. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD33.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.

      Patients receive anti-CD33 CAR-NK (coupled with CD28, CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)
      vector-transduced NK92 cell line on days 0,3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 10 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects with CD33+ acute myeloid leukemia in patients with no
             available curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic SCT) who have
             limited prognosis (&gt;12 weeks to &lt; 2 year survival) with currently available therapies
             will be enrolled.

          2. CD33+ acute myeloid leukemia CR (complete remission) can not be achieved after at
             least 2 prior combination chemotherapy regimens.

          3. AML in CR2 or CR3 and not eligible for allogeneic SCT because of age, comorbid
             disease, or lack of available family member or unrelated donor.

          4. Less than 1 year between last chemotherapy and progression (i.e. most recent
             progression free interval &lt; 1 year).

          5. Relapsed after prior autologous or allogenic SCT. AML patients with relapsed or
             residual disease after at least 1 prior therapy and not eligible for allogeneic SCT.

          6. Residual disease after primary therapy and not eligible for autologous SCT.

          7. All of those patients must also meet the following criteria:

        Expected survival &gt; 12 weeks. Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl ALT(alanine aminotransferase)/AST
        (aspartate aminotransferase)&lt; 3x normal Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl Any relapse after prior SCT
        will make patient eligible regardless of other prior therapy.

        Adequate venous access for apheresis, and no other contraindications for leukapheresis.

        Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate.

             of screening.

          3. Serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient to be managed
             according to the protocol, including active uncontrolled infection, major
             cardiovascular, coagulation disorders, respiratory or immune system, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease, or
             psychiatric or emotional disorders.

          4. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity to any of the agents including
             cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or aldesleukin.

          5. Concurrent use of systemic steroids. Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not
             exclusionary.

          6. The existence of unstable or active ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.

          7. Patients need anticoagulant therapy (such as warfarin or heparin).

          8. Patients need long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at a dose &gt; 300mg/d; clopidogrel
             at a dose &gt; 75mg/d).
