      [Purpose] To investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among healthy students
      of Ahlia University and to determine the relationship between the prevalence of
      musculoskeletal disorders and academic stressors and body mass index. [Subjects and Methods]:
      Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 94 students aged 18-26 years who were
      enrolled at various Ahlia University colleges and met other inclusion criteria. The students
      responded to the standardized Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire and the modified College
      Student Stress Inventory regarding musculoskeletal symptoms and academic stressors. Height
      and weight measurements were also obtained to determine body mass index.
