      As the &quot;two-child&quot; policy implementation, caesarean women's clinical pregnancy is a huge
      problem again, Especially the placenta planting abnormal disease is a serious threat to the
      maternal health and life. Through this research, the investigators can obtain relevant
      epidemiological data and provide objective data for the department of public health policy;
      Predicting an placenta abnormal planting early diagnosis model was constructed, it will fill
      the blank in this field, and high-risk groups in the early stages of pregnancy will be taken
      proper disposal, the related complications will be reduced to ensure the safety of maternal.

      This study focus on four hands: (1) to investigate different types of gestational sac
      implantation for pregnancy in caesarean women of childbearing age;(2) to explore the
      relationship between abnormal placenta planting disease in middle-late pregnancy and the
      different types of scar pregnancy (3) to explore the the value of ultrasound and serological
      markers for early diagnosis of placenta planting disease from scar pregnancy; (4) to compare
      the end and the influence of health economy of different termination method on scar
      pregnancy.
