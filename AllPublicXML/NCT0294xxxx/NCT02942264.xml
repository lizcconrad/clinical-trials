    <textblock>
      Background:

      TG02 is an investigational drug that penetrates the blood-brain barrier and might treat brain
      tumors. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a drug used to treat brain tumors.

      Objective:

      To find out if TG02 is safe, and to find out if it in combination with TMZ is as effective as
      TMZ alone in people with brain tumors.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with a brain tumor that has progressed after standard treatment

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      MRI of the brain if they have not had one in 14 days

      Heart test

      Tissue sample from prior surgeries

      Participants will take TG02 plus TMZ by mouth in 28-day cycles.

      Some will take TMZ for 7 days on and 7 days off. Others will take it every day.

      They will all take TG02 three days before Cycle 1, and then on four days during every cycle.

      They will all get treatment to prevent vomiting and diarrhea before and for 24 hours after
      each TG02 dose.

      They will all keep a diary of when they take the drugs and their symptoms.

      Participants will have study visits. These include:

      Physical exam, heart test, quality of life questionnaire, brain MRI, and urine tests every 4
      weeks

      Blood tests every 2 weeks

      Participants will continue treatment until their disease gets worse or they have intolerable
      side effects.

      Participants will also be enrolled in another protocol to test molecular markers for their
      brain tumor.

      Background:

        -  TG02 is a pyrimidine-based multi-kinase inhibitor that has been shown to have inhibitory
           effects on CDKs, Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) and Fm-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3). It is
           orally administered and penetrates blood brain barrier (BBB). There is clinical
           experience in using TG02 as both a single agent and in combination with other
           chemotherapy agents for cancer treatment.

        -  Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent that has proven efficacy in anaplastic
           glioma and glioblastoma. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
           to treat anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma in adults. Both a dose-dense (dd)
           schedule, 7 days on and 7 days off and a metronomic (mn) daily dosing schedule have been
           used to treat recurrent high-grade gliomas.

        -  Our preclinical data have demonstrated that TG02 down-regulates CDK9 activity and its
           target proteins, such as anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, XIAP and survivin. A treatment
           with TG02 and TMZ has synergistic anti-glioma effects in a variety of glioma models with
           different genetic background. This serves as the basis for this proposed clinical trial.

      Objectives:

      Phase I:

      -To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TG02 plus TMZ using both the dd and mn TMZ
      schedules in adult patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma or
      glioblastoma/gliosarcoma.

      Phase II:

      -To determine the efficacy of TG02 plus TMZ versus TMZ alone in patients with recurrent WHO
      grade III or IV astrocytoma as determined by progression free survival.

      Eligibility:

        -  Documented pathology diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma [WHO grade III], , or
           glioblastoma/gliosarcoma (WHO grade IV) with recurrent disease If the pathology
           diagnosis is anaplastic glioma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, evidence of either intact
           1p/19q chromosomes or molecular features suggesting astrocytic tumor must be present.

        -  No prior use of bevacizumab as a treatment for brain tumor.

        -  No more than two prior relapses for Phase I and no more than one prior relapse for Phase
           II.

        -  Patients must have recurrent disease, either histologically proven or with imaging
           suggestive of recurrent disease

        -  Tumor tissues available for review to confirm the histologic diagnosis.

        -  Tumor tissue blocks available for molecular profiling analysis.

      Design:

        -  Phase I:

             -  This portion of the study is conducted in two stages: The MTD finding and cohort
                extension. Two treatment arms and several dose levels are planned.

             -  In the MTD finding part, TMZ with two alternate schedules (dd and mn) in
                combination with TG02 will be administered.

             -  A cohort extension of both arms will be performed at each MTD and the treatment arm
                with a better progression free survival at 4 months (PFS4) will be selected for the
                combination treatment arm for Phase II.

             -  Pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic studies and neutrophil analysis will be performed
                during the cohort extension of both arms.

             -  A maximum of 72 patients will be enrolled to this component for the trial.

        -  Phase II:

             -  Patients will be randomized between two competing treatment arms: (&quot;winner&quot; of dd
                vs mn) TMZ + TG02 versus dd/mn TMZ alone using a Bayesian clinical trial design.
                The dosage for the combination arm will be derived from the MTD determined in the
                Phase I

      component of the study.

        -  The treatment schedule will be identical to that described above in the phase I
           component, with each cycle comprising 28 days.

        -  Patients will continue treatment until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity
           occurs.

        -  At progression, patients randomized to the control arm (TMZ alone) will be offered the
           opportunity to continue TMZ and additional treatment with TG02.

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible given all of the following conditions apply:

               -  At least 2 weeks (14 days) have elapsed from the date of surgery and the patients
                  have recovered from the effects of surgery.

               -  Evaluable or measureable disease following resection of recurrent malignant
                  glioma is not mandated for eligibility into the study.

               -  To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a MRI should be
                  done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or at least
                  within 4 weeks postoperatively, within 14 days prior to registration. If the
                  96-hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be
                  repeated. The patient must have been on a stable steroid dose for at least 5 days
                  prior to

        the baseline MRI. Steroids may be initiated as clinically indicated once baseline imaging
        has been completed with a goal of titrating steroids as soon as clinically warranted.

          -  Patients must have received prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of
             greater than or equal to 12 weeks (84 days) from the completion of radiation therapy
             to study entry except if there is unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence (such as
             histological confirmation or advanced imaging data such as PET scan) in which case the
             principal investigator s discretion may determine appropriate timepoint at which study
             therapy may begin.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative beta-HCG pregnancy test
             documented within 14 days prior to registration. The effects of TG02 on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must not be
             pregnant, must not be breast-feeding, and must practice adequate contraception for the
             duration of the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Male patients on treatment with TG02 must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception for the duration of the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of
             study medication as the effects of TG02 on the developing human fetus are unknown.

          -  Patients must agree to enroll on the NOB Natural History protocol to allow the
             assessment of molecular tumor markers.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. However, prior enrollment
             on a study using investigational agents is acceptable as per section

          -  Patients with prior bevacizumab use for tumor treatment. Patients who received
             bevacizumab for symptom management, including but not limited to cerebral edema,
             pseudoprogression can be included in the study(To date, there have been no effective
             regimens developed for recurrent malignant gliomas that are refractory to bevacizumab.
             Inclusion of this patient population may impact the ability to determine the efficacy
             of TG02 with TMZ.)

          -  Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from providing informed consent.

          -  Any condition, including the presence of clinically significant laboratory
             abnormalities, which places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to
             participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.
             These would include:

               -  Active infection (including persistent fever) including known history of HIV or
                  Hepatitis C infection, because these patients are at increased risk of lethal
                  infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

               -  Diseases or conditions that obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug metabolism

               -  Serious concurrent medical illness e.g. symptomatic congestive heart failure

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to temozolomide and/or TG02.

          -  Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or bladder), unless in complete remission and off all
             therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible.

          -  TG02 is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Patients receiving any medications
             or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP1A2 and/or CYP3A4 are
             ineligible.

          -  Patients, who continue to have prolonged QTc (males: greater than 450ms; females:
             greater than 470ms as calculated by Fridericia s correction formula) despite normal
             electrolyte balance and discontinuation of medications known to prolong QTc, will be
             excluded from the study.
