    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-randomized clinical trial of subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The
      objective of the study are to 1) determine the safety and efficacy of the BPH Rezum System
      and assess its effect on urinary symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),
      and 2) further document the safety and post-operative effects of the Rezum System in the
      treatment of obstructive BPH.

    <measure>Major Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is assessed by the frequency of systemic and local serious device related complications and the occurrence of unanticipated device-related adverse effects during treatment and at follow-up, up to 30 days. Due to the nature of the device, any device-related AEs are expected to present themselves during the immediate peri-procedure period (30 days post procedure).
The device related complications that will be compared for this safety endpoint are:
Severe Urinary Retention (Retention ≥ 24 hours)
Fistula between rectum and urethra
Perforation of the rectum or GI tract
New incidences of retrograde ejaculation</description>

    <description>The Rezūm System treats patients with bothersome urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The Rezūm System utilizes radiofrequency current to generate &quot;wet&quot; thermal energy in the form of water vapor, which is then injected into the transition zone and/or median lobe of the prostate tissue in controlled 9-second doses. The vapor that is injected into the prostate tissue rapidly disperses through the interstitial space between the tissue cells. As the vapor cools, it condenses immediately on contact with tissue and the stored thermal energy is released, denaturing the cell membranes and causing cell death. The denatured cells are absorbed by the body, which reduces the volume of prostate tissue adjacent to the urethra. The vapor condensation process also causes a rapid collapse of vasculature in the treatment zone, resulting in a bloodless procedure.</description>
