    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well probiotic yogurt supplement works in reducing
      diarrhea in patients with kidney cancer that has spread from the primary site to other places
      in the body and that are being treated with sunitinib. Studying samples of blood and stool
      from patients who eat probiotic yogurt and those who avoid probiotic yogurt may help doctors
      plan better treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if adding Activia yogurt (containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010) to
      the diet of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) increases the level of
      Bifidobacterium spp in stool.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if Activia reduces the incidence of diarrhea for mRCC patients treated with
      sunitinib therapy.

      II. To compare pre-treatment levels of circulating T regulatory (Treg) cells and levels of
      peripheral signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) in patients with and
      without diarrhea with sunitinib therapy, and correlate with Bifidobacterium, other bacteria,
      and Activia.

      III. To determine if patients with the diarrhea in mRCC patients treated with sunitinib
      therapy have a lower baseline of Bifidobacterium spp.

      IV. To assess the change in global stool bacteriomic profile of patients receiving therapy
      with sunitinib with or without Activia.

      V. To better assess the feasibility of stool collection and bacteriomic profiling.

      VI. To explore association between psychosocial symptoms (anxiety and depression) and
      bacteriomic profile and gastrointestinal toxicity in mRCC patients receiving sunitinib
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive probiotic supplement Activia yogurt twice daily (QD) during weeks
      2-13 of sunitinib treatment.

      ARM II: Patients avoid any intake of yogurt or yogurt-containing foods and refrain from
      taking/consuming other probiotic supplements for 3 months.

    <description>The relative abundance of OTUs will be calculated at phylum-, class-, order-genus- and species-level taxa. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances between samples will be calculated with a de novo tree constructed from representative sequences defining each OTU. A table of OTU counts will be generated and used in combination with the tree to calculate beta diversity. Principle coordinate analysis will be used to examine possible correlation between phylum/genus and other phenotypic variables.</description>
