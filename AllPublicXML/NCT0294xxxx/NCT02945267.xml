  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Monotherapy with S-1, oral fluoropyrimidine, shows non-inferiority to gemcitabine
      in overall survival (OS) with good tolerability for advanced pancreatic cancer in Asian
      patients. It is also shown that nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine could improve OS and progression
      free survival (PFS) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. However, it is still
      unknown whether nimotuzumab plus S1 would improve more to OS and PFS than single S-1.
      Maintenance treatment, as a new treatment pattern, has also been tried in these patients
      after first line treatment to improve the OS. Thus, this study is designed to compare
      nimotuzumab plus S1 to placebo plus S1 as maintenance treatment in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who has benefited from the first-line treatment of
      gemcitabine combined with nimotuzumab and S1 (complete response+partial response+stable
      disease).

      Patients and methods: 60 patients will be enrolled,and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to group
      nimotuzumab plus S1 and group placebo plus S1. nimotuzumab/placebo: 400 mg/w, intravenous
      infusion, Infusion time ≥ 60 min, d1, once every two weeks. S1: oral, 40 mg (Body surface
      area&lt;1.5 m2) or 60 mg (Body surface area&gt;1.5 m2), d1-d14, every three weeks for a cycle.
      Treatment interventions will be stopped under the conditions of disease progression or
      intolerable toxic reaction or participants ask to quit. The primary endpoint is the time to
      disease progression since randomization (TTP), secondary points include OS, 3 years overall
      survival rate (OSR) and safety.
