  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the Clinical Investigation is to assess the clinical safety and the
      inhibition of restenosis of the Investigational Device in the treatment of de-novo
      occluded/stenotic or re-occluded/restenotic lesions of the superficial femoral and/or
      popliteal arteries.

      The primary endpoint of the Clinical Investigation is Late Lumen Loss (LLL) of the target
      lesion, as measured by Quantitative Vascular Angiography (QVA) at 6 months post-index
      procedure.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the
             Clinical Investigation and to show sufficient compliance in following the Clinical
             Investigation Plan.

          2. Patients must agree to return for all required post-index procedure follow-up visits.

          3. Patients are able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks,
             benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of the Clinical
             Investigation. Patients, by providing their informed consent, agree to these risks and
             benefits as stated in the patient informed consent document.

          4. Patients have a documented diagnosis of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) classified
             as Rutherford class 2-3-4 in the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and/or Popliteal
             Artery (PA). Patients with a documented diagnosis of PAD classified as Rutherford
             class 2, may only be included in case conservative and medicinal treatment have proved
             ineffective in these patients.

          5. Patients are able to walk without assistive devices such as walker or cane.

          6. Patients are eligible for peripheral revascularization by means of PTA.

          7. The target vessel reference diameter must be ≥ 3.0 and ≤ 7.0 mm.

          8. The target lesion length must be ≤ 15 cm and stenosed or occluded.

          9. The target lesion must be in a native, non-stented SFA and/or PA target vessel and
             located ≥ 1 cm below the Common Femoral Artery (CFA) bifurcation and terminate
             distally ≥ 1 cm above the origin of the Tibial-Peroneal (TP) trunk.

         10. Treatment of multiple target lesions is allowed, as long as the composite target
             lesion length is ≤ 15 cm and the target lesions can be treated with a maximum of 2
             overlapping Investigational Devices.

         11. The target lesion must either be de-novo or restenotic (stenosis ≥ 70% diameter
             reduction or occlusion by visual estimate). If the target lesion is restenotic, the
             prior PTA must have been done &gt; 30 days prior-index procedure.

         12. The target lesion must have been successfully crossed with a guide wire and there must
             be successful pre-dilatation of the target lesion, in the absence of early recoil,
             significant remaining stenosis or flow-limiting dissection.

         13. There must be a patent (&lt; 50% stenosis) inflow artery, as confirmed by angiography.
             Treatment of inflow disease during the index procedure is allowed. Patients with
             flow-limiting inflow lesions can be included, if inflow lesions have been treated (use
             of DES or DCB not allowed) successfully (attainment of residual diameter stenosis ≤
             30% without major vascular complications).

        There must be at least 1 patent (&lt; 50% stenosis) native outflow artery to the ankle, as
        confirmed by angiography. Treatment of outflow disease during the index procedure is NOT
        permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, other
             anticoagulant/anti-platelet therapies, Sirolimus (or analogs) or sensitivity to
             contrast media that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          2. Patients with an obligatory need of cumarine or other anticoagulants (e.g. Novel Oral
             Anticoagulant (NOAC) drugs).

          3. Patients with any contraindications as mentioned in the Instructions for Use (IFU) of
             the Investigational Device.

             years.

          5. Patients that are currently participating in other clinical investigations involving
             any investigational drug or device that may potentially confound the results of the
             Clinical Investigation, or that would limit the patient's compliance with the
             follow-up requirements of the Clinical Investigation.

          6. Patients with a history of Myocardial Infarction (MI), thrombolysis or angina within
             30 days prior-index procedure.

          7. Patients with a history of major disabling stroke within 3 months prior-index
             procedure.

          8. Patients with any type of previous or planned surgical or interventional procedure
             within 15 days prior- and/or within 30 days post-index procedure.

          9. Patients with a presence or history of severe renal failure (Glomerular Filtration
             Rate (GFR) ≤ 30 ml/min).

             limb to treat atherosclerotic disease.

         11. Patients with clinically significant aneurysmal disease of the iliac, femoral or
             popliteal artery and patients with a history of clinically significant abdominal
             aortic aneurysm.

         12. Treatment of the contralateral limb during the same index procedure or within 30 days
             post-index procedure in order to avoid confounding complications.

         13. Patients under administrative or judicial custody (§20 Act on Medical Devices,
             Germany).

         14. Composite target lesion length is &gt; 15 cm.

         15. Treatment of target lesion(s) that requires more than 2 overlapping Investigational
             Devices.

         16. A COMPLIANCE360-Score of 3 or higher, showing a (moderately) severe circumferentially
             calcified target lesion as displayed on plain x-ray prior to the index procedure
             expected for early recoil and imperative need of plaque modulation or stenting as
             judged by the investigator prior to pre-dilatation.

         17. Significant inflow disease or treatment of inflow disease during index procedure not
             successful.

         18. Known inadequate distal outflow (&gt; 50 % stenosis of distal popliteal and/or all three
             tibial vessels), or planned treatment of vascular disease distal to the target lesion
             post-index procedure.

         19. Known required use of adjunctive treatment modalities (laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty,
             scoring/cutting balloon, etc.).

        Remaining acute or sub-acute thrombus in the target vessel.
