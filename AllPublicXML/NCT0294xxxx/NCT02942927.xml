  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an aging population, most seniors suffer from multiple chronic conditions. When the number
      of medications taken is ≥5 (polypharmacy), the burden of taking multiple concurrent
      medications can do more harm than good. Seniors take an average of 7 regular medications and
      studies link polypharmacy with adverse effects on morbidity, function and health service use.
      However, it is not clear to what extent these are reversible if medication burden is reduced.

      This trial will test the effects on medication numbers and patient health outcomes of an
      intervention to polypharmacy. This study will test a program focused on medication reduction
      number and dose. Prioritizing medications according to the patient's preference as reducing
      the dose also reduces the risk of drug side effects.

      Patients, aged over 69 years taking ≥5 medications, will randomly receive the program
      immediately or at 6 months. The program involves information gathering from the patient,
      including systematically seeking patients priorities and preferences medication review with
      the pharmacist and then a consultation with the family doctor. The intervention is focused on
      discontinuing/reducing the dose of medications where possible using a 'pause and monitor'
      framework to assess the need for restart. An electronic program that detects drug adverse
      effects and flags potentially inappropriate medications will be integrated into an electronic
      clinical pathway incorporating monitoring and follow up systems.

      This study will examine effects on patient and health relevant outcome measures as well as
      qualitative research exploring patients' and clinicians' experiences of reducing medication
      burden. The results will be used to determine whether this system can be implemented as part
      of routine preventative care in primary care for older adults.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive the intervention at study start or delayed
      appointment 6 months later. Initial baseline data collection from the patient include data on
      demographics, medications, and illness characteristics. The patient will then attend an
      appointment with a pharmacist to review medications appropriate for discontinuation/dose
      reduction, after which the patient will meet with his/her family physician to discuss patient
      preferences for discontinuation/dose reduction. Both health care providers will have access
      to TAPERMD, a web based program linked to evidence and tools to support reduction in
      polypharamcy. Follow up research assessments will take place at one week, 3 months and 6
      months (study end). Outcome assessments and a semi-structured interview will take place at
      the 6 month appointment.
