  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults living with incurable and advancing life-limiting illness frequently desire to
      spend as much time as possible comfortably at home, rather than in hospital. They often have
      complex problems that not only affect their ability to function, but also their and their
      family caregivers' overall quality of life (QOL). Routine assessment of their perceived
      health care needs and their self-reported QOL is necessary to ensure that patients' and
      family caregivers' concerns are visible to home care clinicians so that they can be
      effectively monitored and addressed. These types of assessments involve asking people to
      respond to questions about their symptoms, their physical, psychological, social and
      existential/spiritual wellbeing, and their experiences with the care provided. Handheld
      electronic information systems are increasingly used and recommended to facilitate such QOL
      assessments. However, there is a need for information about how such systems are best
      translated into practice improvements that ultimately may improve patient- and family-centred
      outcomes.

      This study is about the implementation of an electronic tablet-based innovative health care
      information system, the Quality of life Assessment and Practice Support System (QPSS), into
      routine care provided by home care services for older adults with life-limiting illnesses and
      their family caregivers. Nine home care sites in Canada are participating. At each site the
      investigators will first adapt the QPSS to the local context and develop a plan for its local
      implementation. Then home care staff will be asked to use it in practice and the
      investigators will evaluate the process of using the QPSS and its effect on patient and
      family caregiver quality of life, health, and satisfaction with care as well as the cost
      consequences of its integration into practice. The effect of its use will be studied in a
      randomized trial, which is the part of the study described in this registry. Patients and
      their family caregivers will be randomly assigned to 1) have their home care team use the
      QPSS in their care or 2) not to use it, instead receiving care as usual. The effect of using
      the QPSS will be measured using questionnaires completed by the participating patients and
      family caregivers every two months. If using the QPSS improves quality of life, health, or
      satisfaction with care, the last stage will explore how to scale up use of the QPSS in
      practice and its integration with existing health information systems.

      Older adults living with incurable and advancing life-limiting illness frequently desire to
      spend as much time as possible comfortably at home, rather than in hospital. They often have
      complex problems that not only affect their ability to function, but also their and their
      family caregivers' overall quality of life (QOL). Routine assessment of their perceived
      health care needs and their self-reported QOL is necessary to ensure that patients' and
      family caregivers' concerns are visible to home care clinicians so that they can be
      effectively monitored and addressed. These types of assessments involve asking people to
      respond to questions about their symptoms, their physical, psychological, social and
      existential/spiritual wellbeing, and their experiences with the care provided. Handheld
      electronic information systems are increasingly used and recommended to facilitate such QOL
      assessments. However, there is a need for information about how such systems are best
      translated into practice improvements that ultimately may improve patient- and family-centred
      outcomes. This study will try to improve patient and family caregiver QOL while improving the
      efficacy of the health care system by studying the implementation of an innovative health
      care information system, the Quality of life Assessment and Practice Support System (QPSS),
      into routine care provided by home care services for older adults with life-limiting
      illnesses and their family caregivers.

      Research aims and questions:

      This integrated knowledge translation project involves working with clinicians, patients, and
      family caregivers to answer the following aims and research questions.

      Aim 1: To examine the efficacy of the QPSS in home care for older adults who have advancing
      life-limiting illnesses.

      • Does the routine use of the QPSS in home care improve quality of care, as indicated by
      patients' and family caregivers' reports of enhanced QOL and experiences with the care
      provided?

      Aim 2: To evaluate the cost consequences of implementing the QPSS in home care.

      Aim 3: To understand the process of implementing the QPSS in home care.

      • How can the integration and routine use of the QPSS in the home care for older adults who
      have advancing life-limiting illnesses and their family caregivers be best facilitated?

      Aim 4: To examine how integration of the QPSS with health information systems will meet the
      needs of administrators for quality improvement and accreditation.

      Design:

      This project will be conducted in 3 stages at 9 home care service sites. The local adaptation
      stage will use qualitative methods (user-centered design focus groups and interviews with
      clinicians, managers, patients, and family caregivers) to adapt the QPSS to the unique
      context of each home care service site and develop site-specific protocols for its routine
      integration in daily practice. For evaluative purposes, this stage will also include (a)
      measurement of patient and family caregiver QOL and their health care experiences prior to
      integrating routine use of the QPSS into home care to serve as a pre-intervention comparator
      group (Aim 1) and (b) data collection regarding the cost of local adaptation of and training
      to use the QPSS (Aim 2).

      During the evaluation stage, the investigators will (a) conduct a randomized controlled trial
      to evaluate the impact of using the QPSS on the QOL and care experiences of patients and
      their family caregivers (Aim 1); (b) conduct an economic evaluation to estimate the cost
      consequences of implementing the QPSS in home care (Aim 2); and (c) apply qualitative and
      quantitative methods to examine the process of using the QPSS in home health care (Aim 3).
      The investigators aim to recruit 540 patients and 540 family caregivers.

      The sustainability stage will focus on discussion among all team members of (a) whether the
      results warrant sustained and widespread integration of the QPSS into practice, and if so,
      (b) how to scale this up and (c) how QPSS can best integrate with other health information
      systems to facilitate use by health care administrators for continuous quality improvement
      and accreditation. Broad dissemination of results will also take place.

    <ipd_description>As part of the project, the investigators will explore the possibility of using the tablets (intervention) as part of routine care. The tablet would be used to administer the questionnaires to patients and families as part of their care and to obtain a report of the assessment data that will drive the clinical team to service/care improvement, for clinical purposes. This generation of the report will happen in real time, will contain the patient's name and personal health identifier, and can be placed in the patient's chart as part of care services delivered to that patient. No other individual participant data collected for research is shared.</ipd_description>
