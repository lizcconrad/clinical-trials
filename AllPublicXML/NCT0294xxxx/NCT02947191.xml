    <description>After separating bilateral nasal septum mucosas via septum reconstruction incision under endoscopy, the clinical grade HUC-MSCs combined with collagen membrane will be transplanted between the bilateral nasal septum mucosas and fixed. The patients will be treated with antibiotics for 1 week, and with naristillae menthae compositae, mucus promoting agent and other drugs for improving microcirculation for 1 month.</description>
