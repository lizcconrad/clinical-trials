  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help adolescents and young adult cancer survivors address
      their psycho-social needs during the transitional period. The transitional period begins at
      completion of cancer treatment and continues throughout that first year. Patients often
      report this period can be difficult and distressing in many areas of life. This study will
      use a simple tool to measure, on a regular basis, the level of distress a young adult may be
      feeling. Based on this assessment additional mental health support and intervention can be
      recommended to help cancer survivors cope and enhance their feelings of well-being.

      Study Objective:

      To establish a successful distress based intervention program for adolescent and young adult
      survivors in the transition period.

      Study Design and Methods:

      The type of design for this study is a feasibility pilot study with repeated measure, within
      group quantitative design. There is no randomization for this study. The patient will be
      assessed; at baseline, upon completion of therapy, and at regular three month intervals for
      the first year, for a total of five assessments. After receiving a referral a member of the
      AYAST team will contact the patient and set up the initial visit.
