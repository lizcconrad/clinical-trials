      This blinded end point RCT will recruit high risk TIA and mild stroke patients (through the
      emergency TIA clinics and the acute stroke services at the Norfolk &amp; Norwich University
      Hospital) who require anti-hypertensive therapy to examine the clinical and cost
      effectiveness of self-monitoring and self management of Blood Pressure compared to self
      monitoring alone and treatment as usual.

      Research Question: In patients with a mild/moderate stroke or TIA who require drug treatment
      for BP control, does BP self-monitoring with or without patient-led management using a
      previously agreed treatment regime result in better BP control and patient satisfaction than
      standard GP based management?

      Planned sample size: 165 eligible participants distributed 1:1:1 between three groups. Group
      1 (control) - treatment as usual (TAU). Group 2 - Self-monitoring only (Se-MO). Group 3 -
      Self-monitoring and self-management (Se-Man).

      Primary outcome: Number reaching target Ambulatory BP levels at follow-up and change in mean
      Ambulatory BP levels between baseline and follow-up at 6 months.

      Secondary outcomes:

      Number of changes in anti-hypertensive treatment during study Side-effects profiles and
      adverse events BP variability Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) changes All cause and cause-specific
      mortality outcome at six month Recurrent TIA or stroke Incident CVD- stroke, TIA and
      myocardial infarction Costs Health related quality of life assessed Quality Adjusted Life
      Years (EQ-5D based) Patient satisfaction and experience of the process (qualitative data)

    <description>Participants in this group (Se-Mo) will be taught to use a validated British Hypertension Society (BHS) approved home BP monitor (with built in memory/printer) by the study nurse along with written information on the procedure and a copy of the BHS Home BP Monitoring DVD. Participants will be contacted before each recording week &amp; arrangements will be made to deliver and demonstrate the use of self BP monitor by the study nurse. Home BP monitoring will be performed over a 7 day period 3 times during the 6 month follow-up and on each occasion the patient will be given a copy of the BP results and asked to inform the GP of the results and the GP will decide if any alteration in therapy is needed.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will undergo exactly the same self BP monitoring training process as the Se-MO group and will undertake monitoring at the same time intervals. However they will be equipped with a validated BP monitor with a Bluetooth interface phone, BP values recorded by the patient will be transmitted automatically via mobile telephone to the trial coordinating centre. The data will be password protected and saved on a secure server and be available only to the trial team (study nurse &amp; supervising physicians). The patient would then be contacted by the study nurse and depending on BP levels recorded the patient will alter their medication to achieve target BP levels. This will be recorded on the CRF and the GP notified of any treatment changes.</description>
