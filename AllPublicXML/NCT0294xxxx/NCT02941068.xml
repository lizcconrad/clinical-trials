  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective intended to observe the influence of prophylactic and empirical anti-fungal
      treatment on Severe Sepsis patients with perforations. With the consent of patients' legal
      guardian for prophylactic use of antifungal agents, patients were divided into two groups:
      prophylactic group and Empirical group.

    <textblock>
      Intra-abdominal perforation is the high risk of fungal infection. The flora in digestive
      tract would colonize and go to the blood to develop severe bacteria and fungal infection in
      intra-abdominal perforation and about one-third of patients with gastrointestinal
      perforations or anastomotic leakages in ICU develop intra-abdominal fungal infection. In
      particular, the severe sepsis arisen from these infections could further increase the
      mortality. However, empiric/preemptive treatment in most studies failed to improve the
      prognosis and few of the studies that addressed the influence of prophylactic anti-fungal
      treatment in patients with GI Perforation.

    <description>An blood specimen and abdominal drainage fluids if available were obtained for microbiological culture at the time of the gastrointestinal perforations and intra-abdominal specimen was collected at the time of the immediately surgery. All specimens were also obtained 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th day after perforations and thereafter at 3 days intervals.</description>

The antifungal treatment would continue for 5 to 7 days.</description>
