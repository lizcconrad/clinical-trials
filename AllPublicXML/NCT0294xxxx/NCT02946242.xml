  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound devices components and accessories are under continuous development in order to
      optimize, validate and improve the devices, including improving the quality of images. In
      this study, GEHC proposes to collect data in order to achieve the following

        1. Aim 1: Perform iterative evaluations of the device (including features, accessories and
           components) to optimize device performance, assess feasibility of new features, and to
           perform testing necessary to support product and technology development;

        2. Aim 2: Perform activities to support design validation and/or to confirm user
           requirements and specifications have been met, as per design controls and other
           applicable requirements;

        3. Aim 3: Evaluate device complaints and analyze potential causes. There is no animal or
           phantom model that is adequate to accomplish these aims; therefore human subjects are
           required.

      Due to the inherently varied nature of study data, specific data points will be recorded on a
      per-case basis and the study final report will summarize at minimum number and type of study
      scans conducted. Electronic image data may be collected. The number and type of safety
      issues, including adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported.
      Unexpected device issues that occur outside of expected and controlled engineering
      optimization will be reported.

      Subjects will be considered enrolled that provide written informed consent to participate,
      and with thereafter be scheduled to attend up to up to five (5) ultrasound scans per day
      lasting up to 60 cumulative minutes each with approximately a 15 minute break before starting
      another study scan (limited to 15 cumulative minutes of scan time per eye, per day for
      ophthalmic scanning) as long as they remain eligible per the study inclusion and eligibility
      criteria. Vital sign information about subjects may be collected and subjects will be
      positioned for scanning of a variety of target anatomic areas using a variety of
      non-invasive, transcutaneous techniques, such as scanning abdominal, musculoskeletal,
      breast(s), peripleural, transcranial, cervical/neck, cardiac, ophthalmic, vascular,
      extremity, soft tissue, and other accessible anatomical regions. The subject will be
      monitored for adverse events throughout the research study scan. The resultant images and
      associated data will be recorded and stored as part of study data.
