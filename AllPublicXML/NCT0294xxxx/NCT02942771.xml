  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Study is to find out whether an investigational drug is safe and well
      tolerated. MW189 is being studied as a possible short-term treatment for people with
      different types of brain injury. MW189 has previously been given to healthy human volunteers
      as a single dose, and there were no significant problems or bad effects in people who
      received the Study drug. However, before it can be tested in people with brain injury, it is
      important to test MW189 in healthy volunteers when given multiple doses.

      This is a phase 1b study. Written informed consent will be obtained from each study
      participant before any study-specific procedures or assessments are done.

      At various time points noted below, pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling will be performed on
      study participants.

      Throughout the study the investigator will be assessing adverse events and concomitant
      medication.

      On-Study/On-Interventions Evaluations/procedures: Participants will arrive at the Phase 1
      unit after fasting a minimum of 10 hours, for admission into the unit and will undergo
