      Objective:

        1. To study the factors that influence the 3- year recurrence of liver carcinoma after
           surgery

        2. To study the related factors affecting recurrence of liver carcinoma after surgery

    <textblock>
      Liver carcinoma including 80% Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 20% Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)
      becomes the leading causes of death in East and South-East Asia. Though hepatectomy is the
      treatment of choice for early stage cancer, the recurrence has been reported as 30%, 62% and
      79% in 1st, 3rd and 5th year respectively. Chulabhorn hospital, a cancer institute
      established in 2011, has been performing a 3-years retrospective study on the influencing
      factors and its correlation to liver carcinoma after surgery.

    <description>There were 33 for Hepatocellular carcinoma between February 2010 to December 2013. All patients were staged according to the tumor-node metastasis (TNM) system and appraised by the hospital tumor board conference. After surgery, an attending physician followed up patients by tumor marker and imaging as standard treatment as well as diagnosed its recurrence. In addition, all recurrence cases had standard treatments till the end of life. The survival was classified as the dates between the operation and the death.</description>
