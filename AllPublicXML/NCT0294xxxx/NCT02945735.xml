  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving gaze-contingent feedback is an
      effective attention modification procedure, helping in the treatment of Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study examines giving depressive participants gaze-contingent feedback as a novel
      attention training procedure. Half of the participants will receive contingent feedback while
      the other half would receive non-contingent &quot;placebo&quot; feedback.
