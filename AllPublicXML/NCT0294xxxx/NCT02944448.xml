      The study schedule consists of a Screening Period (up to 14 days), a blinded 4- week
      Titration-to-Effect Period with weekly visits, a blinded 4-week Maintenance Treatment Period
      at the optimal dose level determined for each patient, and a 1-week Follow-up Period.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either CR845 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Every
      patient will be started on a 1-mg dose of CR845 or matching placebo. During the
      post-randomization Titration-to-Effect period, the dose of study drug may be increased to 2.5
      mg or 5 mg in a double-blind fashion. Patients may know their dose is being changed but will
      not know whether they were randomization to active study drug or placebo. Approximately 330
      patients will be enrolled in this study.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, titration-to-effect
      study of orally administered CR845 in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.

      The study schedule consists of a Screening Period (up to 14 days), a blinded 4- week
      Titration-to-Effect Period with weekly visits, a blinded 4-week Maintenance Treatment Period
      at the optimal dose level determined for each patient, and a 1-week Follow-up Period.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either CR845 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.
      Randomization will be stratified based on a patient's primary OA joint (knee vs. hip). Every
      patient will be started on a 1-mg dose of CR845 or matching placebo. During the
      post-randomization Titration-to-Effect period, the dose of study drug may be increased to 2.5
      mg or 5 mg in a double-blind fashion.

      Patients may know their dose is being changed but will not know whether they were randomized
      to active study drug or placebo. Approximately 330 patients will be enrolled in this study.

      During the Screening, Titration-to-Effect and Follow-up Period, pain intensity scores will be
      obtained at specified time points. Blood sampling and safety assessments will be conducted
      during this period as well.

      The use of rescue medication for the treatment of any pain (including but not limited to
      headache, menstrual cramps, or non-target joint pain) during the study will be discussed with
      the patients at the Screening Visit. Acetaminophen is the only allowable rescue medication
      for pain beginning from Day -5 until the end of the Maintenance Treatment Period. Starting at
      the Screening Visit Acetaminophen will be provided as 325-mg tablets and its use (number of
      tablets taken in the previous 24 hours) will be reported each evening in the patient diary.
