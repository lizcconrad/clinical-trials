  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is among the countries most affected by malaria in
      Sub-Saharan Africa. Condidering its size and the geographic position, the DRC is meant to
      play a major role in the malaria control in the region. The National Malaria Control program
      recommends artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs), in particular
      artesunate-amodiaquine or artemether-lumefrantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated
      malaria. Previous studies indicated that ACTs are still effective, with efficacy above the
      required threshold of 90%. It is required to assess regularly the efficacy of antimalarial
      drugs, in order to ascertain the relevance of treatment guidelines such that, in case of
      increasing failure rates, alternative options can be decided ontime.

      The purpose of this trial is to assess efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ
      Winthrop®), artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem Dispersible®) and
      dihydro-artemisinin-piperaquine (Eurartesim®) at day 42 in the treatment of uncomplicated
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria in six surveillance sites around DRC.

      This is a phase 4, randomized, open labelled clinical trial, aiming to assess efficacy and
      safety of 3 ACTs in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the Democratic Republic of the
      Congo. Children diagnosed with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum uncomplicated malaria will
      be randomized and followed-up during 42 days.
