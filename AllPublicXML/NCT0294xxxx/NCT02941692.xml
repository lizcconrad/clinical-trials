      Oxytocin is a promising new medication found to have positive effects on prosocial behavior,
      reduce negative affect such as fear and anxiety, and reduce stress-induced addictive
      behaviors. This study aims to investigate the extent to which a 40 IU dose of intranasal
      oxytocin improves couples' conflict resolution skills and subjective, physiological, and
      neuroendocrine responses to conflict. Conflict resolution discussions will take place in the
      laboratory and will be videotaped.

      Substance use disorders (SUD) are characterized by dysregulation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). The neuropeptide oxytocin, commonly administered as an
      intranasal spray, is a drug that has prominent anxiolytic and prosocial effects on human
      behaviors. While the mechanisms of action facilitating the behavioral effects of oxytocin in
      humans is complex and many questions about this process remain, there is a consensus in the
      existing literature that oxytocin modulates HPA axis reactivity to stressful social stimuli.
      Preliminary studies suggest that oxytocin is known to reduce couple conflict among normative
      couples. A more developed line of research indicates that oxytocin mitigates addictive
      behaviors in the context of various drugs of abuse. Given the high prevalence and severity of
      dyadic conflict among couples where one or both partner has substance abuse, and given the
      salience of dyadic conflict as a precipitant to substance use behaviors, it is critical to
      investigate the therapeutic effects of oxytocin among couples with substance use problems.
      Namely, oxytocin holds promise as a potential augmenter for conjoint couples therapies,
      particularly those targeting the reduction of substance use problems. However, only two
      studies have examined the effects of oxytocin on couples' communication behaviors. Those two
      studies found that couples' communication skills improved following the administration of
      oxytocin. It is important to extend this line of research to examine conflict resolution
      skills among couples with substance use problems. To date, no studies have examined the
      effects of oxytocin on subjective, physiological, or neuroendocrine reactivity to dyadic
      conflict. The present study aims to fill that gap in the literature.
