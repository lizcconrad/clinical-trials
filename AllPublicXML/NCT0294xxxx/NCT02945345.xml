    <textblock>
      The Evaluation of Clinical Responsiveness Using the Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area
      and Severity Index (CDASI), established in 2008, is a one-site database study conducted at
      the University of Pennsylvania. The database has yielded valuable information and clinical
      insights into the pathophysiology, disease processes, including psychological responses,
      treatments and quality of life associated with dermatomyositis. The CDASI database
      incorporates the Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index), a validated
      outcome measure of disease responsiveness in patients, and other assessment tools, surveys
      and patient information to help validate the clinical course and quality of life of patients
      with dermatomyositis.

      The CDASI database has led to publication of comparison studies of CDASI and other clinical
      instruments and the effect of dermatomyositis on Quality of Life (QoL).

      The CDASI database is an ongoing resource that enables clinicians to evaluate the evolving
      clinical changes, treatment modalities and patient response to a challenging disease. Data
      will be analysed over a 5 years.
