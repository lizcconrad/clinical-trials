  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine longitudinal brain development in young adolescent girls with a
      history of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). Specifically, three constructs outlined by the
      the Research Domains Criteria (RDoC) will be examined through self-assessment, MRI, and a
      cognitive battery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to study brain development in 12-14 year old females with a history of
      NSSI. Assessments will take place over the course of three years, with three visits per year
      - a total of nine visits.

      The first visit will take place at the Ambulatory Research Center (ARC) at the Fairview
      Riverside hospital complex. This visit will include a number of questionnaires designed to
      gather information about the participant's physical and psychological health. Additionally,
      measures of intelligence quotient (IQ) and demographics will be assessed.

      The second visit will again take place at the ARC. For this visit, participants will be asked
      to partake in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in which they prepare a short, five-minute
      speech and deliver the speech to an audience with an additional task to follow. The TSST will
      be videotaped. Following the completion of this task, the participant will complete computer
      tests in order to measure things like attention and memory. During the second visit, five
      saliva samples will be collected to measure levels of the hormone Cortisol. The participant
      will need to collect additional saliva samples at home.

      The third visit will take place at the University of Minnesota Center for Magnetic Resonance
      Research (CMRR) and will involve a brain MRI. Before the MRI the participant will be asked to
      provide a urine sample and complete a drug and pregnancy test. During the MRI, the
      participant will be asked to lie quietly in the scanner. The participant will do activities
      such as resting, listening to music, and playing games using a button box while in the
      scanner.

      The participant will need to come in to complete these assessments twice more at one and two
      years following the completion of the first set of visits - a total of nine visits overall.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 12 months; 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale will be used to assess NSSI frequency in the past month, past year, and lifetime; average age of onset; severity of injuries (number of injuries per episode, severity of tissue damage -- worst point and average), function (automatic versus social, negative versus positive) and other information.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Saliva Cortisol Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 12 months; 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>As a measure of stress response, cortisol levels will be measured after administration of the Trier Social Stress Test. This test is designed to measure HPA axis functioning in the context of an interpersonal threat. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variability will be calculated. Summary indexes including slope and area under the curve estimates of cortisol in response to threat and resting conditions will be used in subsequent analyses.</description>

    <description>A 19-item interview, assesses current suicidal ideation, with ratings for active suicidal desire, specific suicide plans, and passive suicidal desire. If the adolescent is assessed to be at risk, a member of the research team will work with the family and the adolescent to develop a safety plan.</description>
