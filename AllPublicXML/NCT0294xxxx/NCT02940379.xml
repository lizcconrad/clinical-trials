      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effect of repeated once-daily oral doses of sotagliflozin on CYP2D6 and CYP3A
      activities using a CYP probe cocktail of metoprolol and midazolam.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the clinical and laboratory safety of sotagliflozin coadministered with the
      cocktail probes as compared to that of cocktail probes alone.
