      A prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-masked, three-armed multi-centre phase
      II/III trial for the Study of a Topical Treatment of Ischaemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion
      to Prevent Neovascular Glaucoma - the STRONG Study

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The STRONG Study is a phase II/III prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled,
      double-masked, three-armed multi-centre study of aganirsen antisense oligonucleotide, a
      topical treatment for iCRVO intended to prevent Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG). The study will
      evaluate the efficacy of two different doses of aganirsen formulated in an eye emulsion in
      avoiding new vessel formation by blocking the Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS)-1. Eligible
      patients will be treated with aganirsen or placebo for a period of 24 weeks. They will also
      be invited to participate in sub-studies working on the analysis of gonioscopic images,
      detection of biomarkers for neovascular glaucoma and risk factors for ischaemic central
      retinal vein occlusion.
