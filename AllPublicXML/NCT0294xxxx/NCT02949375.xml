      Primary objectives:

      To evaluate the change in serum alanine transaminase [ALT] levels from Day 0 to Day 28,
      following daily doses of 4.5 or 6mg of GRI-0621 compared to placebo, in patients with chronic
      liver disease and elevated serum levels of ALT. Serum ALT level will be used as a marker of
      liver inflammation.

      To assess the safety and tolerability of GRI-0621 at these two doses.

      Secondary objectives:

      To assess the change in serum aspartate transaminase [AST] levels from baseline to Day 28,
      following daily doses of 4.5 or 6mg of GRI-0621 or matching placebo, in patients with chronic
      liver disease and elevated serum levels of AST. Serum AST level will be used as a second
      marker of liver inflammation.

      To evaluate the response to 4.5mg GRI-0621 versus 6mg GRI-0621 in terms of the change in
      serum ALT levels from baseline measured at the different trial time points.

      To assess changes in serum cytokeratin 18 [CK-18] levels from baseline to Day 28, following
      daily doses of 4.5 or 6mg of GRI-0621 or matching placebo, in patients with chronic liver
      disease. Serum CK-18 is used as a marker of hepatocyte cell death due to either necrosis or
      apoptosis.

      To measure Natural Killer T lymphocyte [NKT] cell activity at baseline and at Day 28
      following daily doses of 4.5 or 6mg of GRI-0621 or matching placebo.

      To describe the steady-state pharmacokinetics [PK] of GRI-0621 in patients with chronic liver
      disease.

      Exploratory objectives:

      To assess the effect, if any, that the investigational product may have on serum triglyceride
      levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi- centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial in
      participants aged 18 to 65 years with chronic liver disease. It is designed to assess the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of both 4.5mg and 6mg of GRI-0621 when administered once
      daily for 28 days.

      A total of 60 participants will be randomised to received 4.5mg or 6mg of GRI-0621 or
      matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The investigational product will be administered orally
      once daily in the morning for a duration of 28 days. Participants will return to the clinic
      for follow-up safety and efficacy assessments on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28. Additionally, PK
      sampling will be performed on Days 7 and 28, and samples for immunological assays to assess
      the activity of NKT cells will be drawn on Days 0 (baseline) and 28. An end-of-trial
      follow-up visit will be performed 14 days after the last dose of the investigational product
      on Day 42.

      The primary efficacy objective will be measured by the change from baseline to Day 28 in
      serum ALT levels. The baseline ALT level will be calculated as the mean of the Day -7 to -1
      and Day 0 serum ALT results.

      Safety and tolerability will be measured by the incidence and severity of adverse events and
      changes in physical examination findings, physical measurements, vital signs, ECG findings
      and standard laboratory safety parameters (including hematology, clinical chemistry,
      coagulation parameters and urinalysis).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A participant will be eligible for participation in the trial if all of the following
        inclusion criteria are met:

          1. Completion of the written informed consent process for trial participation prior to
             all trial-related procedures, including HIV testing.

          2. Male or female participants aged 18 to 65 years.

          3. Female participants of child-bearing potential must practice an effective method of
             birth control from four weeks prior to randomization and agree to continue this until
             6 months after the completion of the end-of-trial follow-up visit. Effective birth
             control must include two methods, one of which must be a barrier method. Female
             participants are considered not to be of child-bearing potential if they are
             post-menopausal (12 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with an appropriate clinical
             profile, or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with local laboratory serum
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels in keeping with post-menopause) or
             surgically sterile (after bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or salpingectomy). For
             the purpose of this trial any participant who has had a tubal ligation will not be
             considered surgically sterile due to the teratogenic nature of this class of chemical
             entities.

          4. Female participants of child-bearing potential must have negative serum and urine
             pregnancy tests at screening and randomization respectively.

          5. History of chronic liver disease [CLD] as a result of viral hepatitis, alcoholic
             steatohepatitis [ASH] or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH].
