  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to examine the effectiveness of a brief intervention that might
      better facilitate the transition into the community for people with schizophrenia. The
      intervention is called the Welcome Basket. It involves Peer Support Workers connecting with
      and supporting hospitalized individuals in the days before discharge and again in the
      community in the first month immediately following discharge. The investigators will compare
      the outcomes of discharge from hospital as usual with the full version of the welcome basket
      and a preliminary test of an abbreviated 2 visit version of the intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discharge from hospital has been highlighted as a critical time in the care of individuals
      with mental illness. The peak period of risk for readmission for individuals with severe
      mental illness is in the first month and the highest risk for post-discharge suicide is
      within the first 2 weeks with discontinuity of contact with providers highlighted as a key
      risk factor. One half of individuals with schizophrenia miss their first-scheduled outpatient
      appointment following discharge and this time is a key period of risk for medication
      non-compliance. Common problems that occur at the time of discharge from psychiatric care
      settings include poor communication between inpatient and outpatient providers and inadequate
      involvement and support of families. The research literature on effective practices linked
      with discharge is strikingly sparse given the evidence that this is a period of heightened
      risk.

      The investigators hypothesize that the full version of the Welcome Basket intervention will
      improve the discharge-related outcomes of individuals with schizophrenia. Investigators will
      also explore the outcomes of an abbreviated, 2-visit version of the intervention. This study
      will employ a randomized, controlled trial design. Inpatient clients with a schizophrenia
      spectrum diagnosis will be randomized with a 2:2:1 ratio to: treatment as usual, the full
      welcome basket intervention, and the abbreviated intervention. Measures will include
      re-hospitalization, symptomatology, quality of life, and community functioning. Assessments
      at baseline, 4 weeks post-discharge, and 6 months post-discharge will facilitate studies of
      relative effectiveness and sustainment of gains. This design will facilitate an examination
      of both overall outcomes as well as some preliminary dismantling of mechanisms of action.

    <description>Peer Support Workers (PSWs) hold 1-2 meetings with clients (30-60 minutes) in the 2-week period before they are discharged from hospital. They describe the program and undertake an assessment. From this assessment the two core components of the intervention are initiated. First, a &quot;welcome basket&quot; is created for the client. The PSW also forms a plan with the client about tours of their neighbourhood to familiarize them with the local resources and support them in building confidence in accessing their local communities. These activities will take place through weekly visits (2 hours/visit) in the 4 weeks immediately following discharge. WB will be provided in combination with core Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) compensatory interventions e.g. setting up and placement of a calendar, basic organization of living space.</description>

    <description>The brief version of the Welcome Basket (WBbr) was developed based upon the observation in feasibility testing that for some participants much of the benefit of this approach appeared to be centred upon the visits immediately prior and subsequent to discharge. In the WBbr the same core components will be present, albeit in an abbreviated form with one 30-60 minute visit in the week prior to discharge and a single, 3-hour visit in the week subsequent to discharge in which the welcome basket would be delivered, core CAT strategies discussed and implemented, and some basic orientation to community resources undertaken. This brief version of the intervention has not to date been studied.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants will be adults, 18 years of age or older, with a chart diagnosis of a
             schizophrenia spectrum mental illness confirmed by the Mini-International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.15). All participants will be on CAMH inpatient
             units at the time of recruitment and will have been in continuous inpatient care for 2
             or more weeks. This timeframe is guided by the rationale and experience indicating
             that an overly brief period of hospitalization circumscribes the relevance of the
             intervention.

          2. Participants will be returning to places of residence in the Greater Toronto Area
             (catchment of CAMH).

          3. Participants must have been referred to outpatient case management.

          4. Proposed housing arrangements must be stable and conducive to the intervention. If
             homelessness or emergency shelter residence appears likely, or boarding home policy
             precludes any external staff from entering the premises, such individuals will be
             excluded.

          5. Proficiency in English.

        Exclusion criteria:

        1. Do not meet the above criteria.
