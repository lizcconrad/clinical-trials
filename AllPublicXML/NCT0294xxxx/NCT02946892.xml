    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of carvedilol in patients who have undergone a Fontan heart
      operation. All participants will receive carvedilol and placebo for 12 weeks. Exercise tests
      will be performed at the end of each 12 week period.

    <textblock>
      Carvedilol is a well studied heart failure medication in adult heart failure that has been
      shown to improve outcomes. However, it has not been studied in patients who have had a Fontan
      heart operation. Study participants will receive either placebo or carvedilol for 12 weeks,
      at the end of the 12 weeks participants will perform an exercise test. Then study
      participants will receive treatment with placebo or carvedilol for 12 weeks (opposite of what
      participants go the first 12 weeks) and will again perform an exercise test.

          2. Male or female children between the ages of 10 and 35 years with congenital heart
             disease that has been palliated with a Fontan circulation.

          3. Ability of perform a maximal exercise test as defined by a respiratory exchange ratio
             (RER) greater than 1.0 at the time of maximal exercise

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The use of beta blockers within 2 months of randomization

          2. Patients actively listed for transplantation at time of entry into the study or

             corrective cardiac surgery during the 7 months following entry into the study

          3. Sustained or symptomatic ventricular dysrhythmias uncontrolled by drug therapy or the
             use of an implantable defibrillator, and/or significant cardiac conduction defects,
