  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) with respiratory failure and admitted in West China Hospital during April 2017 to
      March 2019. The following variables will be prospectively studied: age, sex, height, weight,
      respiratory function indicators, arterial blood gas analysis results, biochemical data,
      nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS 2002) score, short-term and long-term prognostic
      outcomes. The purpose of this study is to assess whether NRS 2002 is a useful prognosis
      predictor in COPD patients with respiratory failure.
