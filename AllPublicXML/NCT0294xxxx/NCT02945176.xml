  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ARGOS-IO pressure sensor is intended to be implanted in the human eye in combination with
      Boston Keratoprosthesis (BKPro) surgery and to remain in place indefinitely. It is intended
      to be used together with the hand-held Mesograph reading device to telemetrically measure the
      intraocular pressure (IOP) of patients with a BKPro.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the ARGOS-IO system in
      patients undergoing concomitant implantation of a BKPro and an ARGOS-IO sensor over the 12
      month period beginning at implantation.

    <description>This study will enroll a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 15 patients. It is anticipated to be large enough to provide an initial estimate of common safety events and assessment of performance. Any adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), ADE (adverse device event) and SADE (serious adverse device event) will be listed. Incidence will be estimated with a 95% confidence interval (Pearson-Clopper, two-sided). The Bland-Altman method will be used to assess the limits of agreement between the IOP measurements ARGOS-IO and surgical manometry. When appropriate, two-sided 95% confidence intervals, for these limits will be calculated accounting for repeated measurements based on the method proposed by Zou (2011). Other secondary performance endpoints will be analyzed by descriptive and explorative statistical methods.</description>

             the clinical trial only after they have consented to the keratoprosthesis operation.

         10. Severe generalized disease that results in a life expectancy shorter than a year

         11. Any clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the subject at increased
             risk with the placement of the device

         12. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding

         13. Participation in any study involving an investigational drug or device within the past
