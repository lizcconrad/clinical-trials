    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and tolerability of
      pembrolizumab when given to patients with advanced liver cancer.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is not FDA approved or commercially
      available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can
      explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 15 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive pembrolizumab by
      vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles (about 2 years). You will no longer be able
      to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if
      you are unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for genetic testing; to test for hepatitis B
           and C (if the doctor thinks it is needed); and pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PD testing
           measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to measure how some genes (DNA, genetic
           material) in your body may react to pembrolizumab; and to check the status of the
           disease, and to check for signs of inflammation.

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan.

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the above blood sample will used for a pregnancy
           test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the study doctor thinks
           it is needed, this sample will also be used to check for hepatitis B and C.

        -  At Cycle 2, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) will be drawn for PD testing.

        -  At Cycles 2, 5, and 6, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of
           the disease and to check for signs of inflammation.

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the above blood sample will used for a pregnancy
           test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, and every 9 weeks after that, you will have an MRI or CT
      scan.

      After 1 year, you will have an MRI or CT scan every 12 weeks.

      On Day 1 of even-numbered cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), urine will be collected for
      routine tests.

      After you have received the study drug for about 6 weeks (at about Cycle 2), you will have a
      biopsy to check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing.

      End-of- Study Visit:

      As soon as possible after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests; genetic and PD testing; to
           check for signs of inflammation; and to check the status of the disease.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests

        -  You may have a CT scan or MRI.

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the above blood or urine sample will used for a
           pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30-90 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, this sample will also be used to check
           for hepatitis B and C.

        -  Depending on when your last scan was performed, you may have a CT scan or MRI.

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the blood sample or a urine sample will used for a
           pregnancy test.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Every 9 weeks after your last dose of study drug, you will have an MRI or CT scan.

      If you stopped taking the study drug because the disease appeared to get worse or because you
      wanted to start a new anti-cancer therapy, you will be called by the study staff every 12
      weeks to ask how you are doing. This call should last about 10-15 minutes.

             for diagnosis is acceptable if tumor tissue is unavailable) or clinical diagnosis by
             AASLD criteria in cirrhotic subjects is required. For subjects without cirrhosis
             histological confirmation is mandatory.

          5. Have Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C disease or BCLC Stage B disease not
             amenable to locoregional therapy or refractory to locoregional therapy, and not

          6. Have a Child-Pugh A liver score within 7 days of first dose of study drug.

          7. Have a predicted life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          8. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as confirmed by the blinded MD Anderson
             radiology. Target lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered
             measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions. Note: the same image
             acquisition and processing parameters should be used throughout the study for a given
             subject.

          9. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) Performance Scale within 7 days of first dose of study drug.

         10. Have documented objective radiographic progression after stopping treatment with
             sorafenib or else intolerance to sorafenib. Intolerance to sorafenib is defined as:
             CTCAE Grade =/&gt;2 drug-related adverse event(s) which both a) persisted in spite of
             comprehensive supportive therapy according to institutional standards and b) persisted
             or recurred after sorafenib treatment interruption of at least 7 days and dose
             reduction by one dose level. Patients treated on sorafenib as the last treatment may
             start pembrolizumab at least 14 days after the last dose of sorafenib.

         11. Subjects with chronic infection by HCV who are treated or untreated are allowed on
             study. Subjects with a past or resolved HBV infection, defined as having a negative
             HBsAg test and a positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) test and negative
             HBV DNA test at screening, are eligible for the study. In addition, subjects with
             successful treatment (defined as sustained virologic response [SVR12] or SVR24) are
             allowed as long as 4 weeks have passed between completion of HCV therapy and start of
             study drug.

         12. Have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the
             first dose of study medication (Cycle 1, Day 1) (female subjects of childbearing
             potential). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
             pregnancy test will be required.

         13. Be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study
             through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (male and female subjects of
             childbearing potential. Acceptable methods of contraception are as follows: A) Single
             method (one of the following is acceptable): a) intrauterine device (IUD); b)
             vasectomy of a female subject's male partner; c) contraceptive rod implanted into the
             skin B) Combination method (requires use of two of the following): a) diaphragm with
             spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide); c) cervical
             cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only); d) contraceptive sponge (nulliparous
             women only); e) male condom or female condom (cannot be used together); f) hormonal
             contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/ progestin pill or progestin- only
             pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous
             contraceptive injection

         14. (Continuation of inclusion criteria #13) Abstinence (relative to heterosexual
             activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently
             employed as the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable
             by local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception. If a contraceptive method listed above is
             restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable
             method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region.

         15. Demonstrate adequate organ function. All screening laboratory tests should be
             performed within 7 days of treatment initiation: a) Hematological - Absolute
             neutrophil count =/&gt;1200/µL; Platelets =/&gt; 60,000/µL; Hemoglobin =/&gt; 8 g/dL without
             transfusion or EPO dependency within 7 days; b) Renal - Creatinine OR Measured or
             calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or
             creatinine clearance) =/&lt;1.5 × ULN OR =/&gt;60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels
             &gt;1.5 × institutional ULN. Note: Creatinine clearance should be calculated per
             institutional standard; c) Hepatic - Total bilirubin =/&lt;2 mg/dL, or direct bilirubin
             =/&lt;ULN for those with total bilirubin &gt;2×ULN; AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) =/&lt;5 × ULN ;
             Albumin =/&gt;3 g/dL; d) Coagulation - INR or PT aPTT =/&lt;1.5 × ULN unless subject is
             receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or aPTT is within therapeutic range of
             intended use of anticoagulants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

         17. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator, including
             dialysis.

         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment.

         20. Has received prior immunotherapy including anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2
             agents, or if the subject has previously participated in Merck pembrolizumab clinical
             trials.

         21. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

             active HBV therapy with viral loads under 100 IU/mL should stay on the same therapy
             throughout study treatment. Those subjects who are anti-HBc (+) and negative for
             HBsAg, Anti-HBs, and HBV viral load do not require HBV prophylaxis, but need close
             monitoring for reactivation.

         23. Subjects who have received therapy for HCV ≤ 4weeks from the start of pembrolizumab.
             Note: Those with untreated HCV and those who completed HCV therapy ≥4 weeks of study
