  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single site, prospective, observational trial utilizing a wrist-worn
      accelerometer to evaluate clinical outcomes of SCS and PNS in the treatment of chronic pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 150 evaluable subjects will be recruited at this site on an ongoing basis. Evaluable
      subjects are defined as subjects that complete the End of Study visit. Each subject will be
      assigned an accelerometer and have data recorded for a seven-day period pre-implant trial to
      collect baseline data. The accelerometer will also be worn during the trial for a period of
      up to seven (7) days. If the trial is successful and the subject is implanted, the subject
      will wear the accelerometer for a seven-day period at least six (6) weeks post-permanent
      implant. The following assessments will be administered to subjects at the baseline
      (pre-implant trial) visit, the end of implant trial visit and the end of study visit (8 weeks
      post-permanent implant): the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 11-point scale for pain; the SF-36
      Health Survey; the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Subjects treated for neck pain will also
      complete the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Additionally, the subjects will be asked to
      complete a subject diary to record average daily NRS scores for days the accelerometer is
      worn.

        The subjects recruited for this study will be representative of the population of subjects
        with chronic pain and a candidate for SCS or PNS trial. Subjects recruited for this study
        must be 18 years of age or older. It is anticipated that approximately equal numbers of
        males and females will be recruited. No subjects will be excluded based upon his/her race
        or ethnicity.

             requirements

          5. Subject is able to provide informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they meet any one of the
        following criteria:

          1. Subject has comorbidities that, in the judgment of the investigator, may confound the
             reliability of the information acquired in this study

          2. In the judgment of the investigator, the subject is not seeking an improvement in
             physical function as a treatment goal of SCS or PNS
