  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate whether the glucose response in type 1 diabetes
      patients measured using Continuous Glucose Monitoring measurement is reproducible in repeated
      standardized test sessions that include physical activity.

        20 patients with type 1 diabetes (treated with or without insulin pump) will participate in
        three identical test sessions on an exercise bike. During the three test sessions, patients
        will be monitored by heartrate, blood glucose (obtained by lancet) and CGM. The
        participants will also be using a diary for registration of diet as well as exercise during
        the study.
