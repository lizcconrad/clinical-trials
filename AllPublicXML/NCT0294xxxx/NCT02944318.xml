  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      School is a favorable environment for the development of actions aimed at healthy behavioral
      changes. This project proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention program on
      aspects of lifestyle, with a focus on physical activity (PA) and reducing sedentary
      behaviors, and the relationship of these factors with the academic performance of students in
      the school from Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

      This is a randomized controlled intervention study enroling classes of 7th to 9th grade of
      fundamental education.

      The intervention program will last for one year (about ten months), with three focuses:
      training of teachers, educational and environmental changes to behavior change.
