  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The axillary brachial plexus block is a technique of locoregional anesthesia indicated in the
      distal upper limb surgery : hand, forearm, the lower third of the arm including the elbow.
      The anesthesia of the posterior and the medial side of the arm requires a selective block of
      the medial brachial cutaneous nerve and the intercostobrachial nerve, for example to improve
      the tolerance of the inflatable tourniquet used by the surgeons. There are two techniques to
      achieve this block : the blind technique (without ultrasound) and the ultrasound-guided
      technique. At the moment, there are no studies which compare these two techniques. So, the
      purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided technique
      compared to blind technique in medial brachial cutaneous nerve block and intercostobrachial
      nerve block, in the axilla.

      For purposes of this single-blind monocentric study, 84 patients are randomized into two
      groups (42 patients for each), upon enrolment into the study.

      In the first group, the blind technique is used to perform the medial brachial cutaneous
      nerve block and the intercostobrachial nerve block : it consists in performing a subcutaneous
      injection of the local anesthetic at the root of the arm, in the anterior-posterior
      direction.

      In the second group, the ultrasound-guided technique is used to perform the medial brachial
      cutaneous nerve block and the intercostobrachial nerve block : ultrasounds are used to
      visualize the anatomical variations, the good position of the needle and the good local
      anesthetic diffusion.

      The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided technique compared to blind
      technique in medial brachial cutaneous nerve block and intercosto-brachial nerve block, in
      the axilla
