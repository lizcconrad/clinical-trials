  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients receiving implants in the esthetic zone, would the use of new Nano hybrid ceramic
      crown material (Crystal Ultra) improve esthetic patient satisfaction and peri-implant tissue
      success when compared with Lithium Disilicate crown (E-max)?

      The patient will be treated in visits designated as follows:

      Visit 1: Preoperative records, face-to-face adherence reminder session, signing consents,
      clinical, radiographic examination and primary impression for diagnostic cast construction.

      Visit 2: (first stage surgery): implant placement surgical procedure and postoperative
      radiograph.

      Visit 3: After 3months (second stage surgery): re-opening of surgical site, placement of
      healing abutments and temporary crowns.

      Visit 4: After 2 weeks, removing of temporary restorations and taking of final impressions
      Visit 5: placement of different ceramic crown superstructures and recording different outcome
      values.
