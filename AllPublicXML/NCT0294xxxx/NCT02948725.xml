  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the current state of knowledge and gaps in the literature we will conduct an
      intervention study to explore novel treatment and rehabilitation of patients at Royal
      University Hospital (RUH) with motor deficits following stroke. This project has the
      following objectives:

        1. To determine if cross-education, in addition to standard rehabilitation leads to better
           recovery of upper limb function for stroke patients with hemiparesis.

        2. To incorporate functional brain activation as measured by functional magnetic resonance
           imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural mechanisms associated with changes in motor
           function of the paretic arm post-stroke.

        3. To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to measure connectivity and examine
           the extent to which white matter tract thickness correlates with preserved motor output
           in patients post-stroke.

    <description>The cross-education group will engage in strength training of the non-paretic hand in addition to standard rehabilitation. Cross-education will be progressive in nature, beginning with 2 sets of 8 repetitions and increasing up to a maximum of 6 sets of 8 repetitions of maximal voluntary effort isometric handgrip contractions as tolerated. Grip training will be performed using standard grip trainers (Digi-Flex Grip trainers) to train both finger flexors and full hand and wrist isometric contractions. In addition, patients will perform controlled dynamic wrist flexion and extension training of the non-paretic hand using exercise tubing with the same prescription. Patients will be asked to complete exercises 3 times per week for 26 weeks, and to record adherence in a training log. An average of one session per week will be considered 'trained'.</description>

    <description>Standardized rehabilitation involves several strategies tailored to the patient and remains somewhat based on clinician preference. These therapies may involve functional electrical stimulation, neuro-facilitation, strengthening, range of motion (ROM), mirror therapy, and force-use therapy (e.g., CIMT). Patients engage in therapy 5 days per week as inpatients, and 2 days per week as outpatients with additional home exercises. Specific therapies for each patient will be tracked using a therapy log.</description>
