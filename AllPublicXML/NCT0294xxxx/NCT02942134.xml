    <textblock>
      Acute dyspnea after use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a common phenomenon in patients
      with COPD and emphysema. This trial aims to document incidence and severity of augmented
      dyspnea in patients with long term NIV therapy. These findings may help in understanding the
      pathomechanisms that lead to post-NIV dyspnea and thus give way to potential therapy schemes.

      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a widespread therapy option for patients with hypercapnic
      failure due to COPD and emphysema. Augmented dyspnea after use of NIV is commonly found and
      leads not only to high patient discomfort, but can also be associated with acute respiratory
      failure. This monocentric obervation trial includes patients with COPD III°-IV° (GOLD) and
      emphysema and an established long term NIV therapy. During their routine inpatient follow-up,
      we will extend the routine examinations, focussing on the vulnerable first hour after the
      nocturnal use of NIV. This includes monitoring of breath rate, heart rate, pulsoxymetry,
      trancutaneous CO2, blood pressure and capillary blood gas analysis. Sonographic measurement
      of diaphragm movement and thickness will be complemented. Subjective dyspnea will be
      documented by use of the BORG scale.

      By collecting this data, we hope to understand the pathomechanisms causing augmented dyspnea
      after NIV and thus provide information for therapeutical concepts to prevent it.
