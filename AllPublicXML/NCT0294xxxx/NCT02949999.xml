  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-centre, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, ascending
      multiple dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic
      profiles of voclosporin.

    <textblock>
      Ten subjects will be randomized into each of four treatment groups to receive approximately
      0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5mg/kg/dose of voclosporin vs placebo. For Day 1, subjects will be given
      oral treatment once a day; Day 2, subjects will not be given any oral treatment; Day 3-12,
      subjects will be given oral treatment twice a day; Day 13, subjects will be given oral
      treatment once a day. The duration of the study takes about 21 days (including follow up
      assessments).
