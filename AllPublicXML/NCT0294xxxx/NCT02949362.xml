      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide treatment of
      children with short bowel syndrome (SBS) who completed the TED-C13-003 study over a long-term
      period. It will evaluate how these children fared after the TED-C13-003 study ended. This
      study will also offer teduglutide treatment to eligible subjects, regardless of treatment
      received in TED-C13-003.
