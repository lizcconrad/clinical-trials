      Diagnosis: Acute myeloid leukemia refractory to intensive induction chemotherapy; Age ≥ 60
      years, no upper age limit; Study drug: low-dose azacitidine, pioglitazone, ATRA; Safety
      Run-In Phase; randomized Phase II, open-label

        -  Safety Run-In Phase: Based on a 3 + 3 modified design, the tolerable dose of ATRA for
           the randomized phase II is defined.

        -  Phase II: Experimental Arm: low-dose azacitidine, pioglitazone, ATRA; Standard Arm:
           standard-dose azacitidine; in both arms patients can receive further cycles (with no
           limit to the number given) as long as clinically appropriate

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are refractory*
             to induction therapy and not eligible for further intensive induction therapy based on
             documented medical reasons (e.g. disease characteristics or patient characteristics),
             or

          2. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are refractory*
             to induction therapy and not immediate candidates for allogeneic HSCT (bridge to
             transplant is allowed)

             *refractory to induction therapy is defined as no CR, no CRi and no PR (according to
             standard criteria, see Section 11.2.3) after at least one intensive induction therapy
             including at least 5 days of cytarabine 100-200 mg/m² continuously or an equivalent
             regimen with cytarabine with total dose not less than 500 mg/m² per cycle and at least
             2 days of an anthracycline (e.g. daunorubicin, idarubicin).

          3. Age ≥ 60; no upper age limit

          4. ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 at screening

          5. To control hyperleukocytosis or extramedullary involvement, medication with
             hydroxyurea is allowed up to 24h before start of study treatment. In case of
             hyperleukocytosis hydroxyurea should be given and start of study treatment should be
             delayed until leukocyte counts are &lt; 20 x 10^9/L.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential* may participate, providing they meet the
             following conditions:

               -  Have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine with a sensitivity of at least 25
                  mIU/mL; local laboratory) within 72 hours prior to starting study therapy. They
                  must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after
                  end of study therapy. This applies even if the subject practices true
                  abstinence** from heterosexual contact.

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence** from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use, and be able to comply with two
                  effective methods of contraception (e.g., oral, injectable, or implantable
                  hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier
                  contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner) without interruption
                  during the study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 3 months after
                  discontinuation of study drugs.

                    -  A female subject of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has
                       achieved menarche at some point 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or
                       bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal
                       (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing
                       potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any
                       time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

                         -  True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred
                            and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar,
                            ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
                            acceptable methods of contraception.

          7. Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to abstain
             from sexual intercourse or to the use of at least two effective contraceptive methods
             (e.g., synthetic condoms with spermicide, etc) at screening and throughout the course
             of the study and should avoid fathering a child during the course of the study and for
             3 months following the last study treatment.

          8. Signed written informed consent.

          1. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to the study drugs and/or any excipients

             with variant translocations

          3. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with isocitratdehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 mutations if
             results are available from the central AMLSG reference laboratories

          4. ECOG performance status &gt; 2

          7. Uncontrolled infection

          8. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          9. Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy requiring active therapy other
             than non-melanoma skin cancers (except for hormonal/antihormonal treatment, e.g. in
             prostate or breast cancer)

         10. Patients with &quot;currently active&quot; bladder cancer or bladder cancer in their history,
             patients with risk factors for bladder cancer (e.g. exposure to aromatic amines or

         11. Severe neurological or psychiatric disorder interfering with ability of giving an
             informed consent

         12. Known or suspected active alcohol or drug abuse

         15. Treatment with any other clinical study drug within 14 days before the first
             administration of the investigational drugs or at any time during the study

         16. Breast feeding woman or women with a positive pregnancy test at Screening Visit

         17. Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential not willing to abstain
             from sexual intercourse or to the use of at least two effective contraceptive methods
