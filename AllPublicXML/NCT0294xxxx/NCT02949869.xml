  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reported rate of unsuccessful traditional LP in children (defined as the inability to
      obtain cerebrospinal fluid or obtaining a traumatic puncture) is as high as 50%. Many factors
      affect LP success including provider experience. CSF is obtained by puncturing the
      subarachnoid space (traditionally at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspinous process space), and many
      have hypothesized that the width of this space may predict success. Anecdotally, trainees and
      those with less experience, tend to perform the LP too low (caudally), where the subarachnoid
      space tapers, or too laterally (off the midline) resulting in higher failure rates. The
      investigators seek to determine if planned LP insertion sites vary between training and
      attendings, and if so, could the decreased success be explained by smaller subarachnoid
      spaces.
