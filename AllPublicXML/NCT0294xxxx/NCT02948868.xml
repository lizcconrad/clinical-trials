      This study will correlate MA-abstinence outcomes from an 8-week contingency management (CM)
      program of voucher- based incentives using an escalating schedule that has been successfully
      implemented as an adjunct to MA treatment by the investigators collaborators in the United
      States. Pre- and post- treatment neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessments will assist in
      identifying structures and/or processes that may represent targets for development of novel
      behavioral and/or medication therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine addiction (MA) is a global health problem with high prevalence and great
      social and health costs in the United States and in the Republic of South Africa, and there
      is a strong need for development and implementation of effective MA treatment approaches.
      This study will correlate MA-abstinence outcomes from an 8-week contingency management (CM)
      program of voucher- based incentives using an escalating schedule that has been successfully
      implemented as an adjunct to MA treatment by the investigators collaborators in the United
      States. Pre- and post- treatment neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessments will assist in
      identifying structures and/or processes that may represent targets for development of novel
      behavioral and/or medication therapies.

      The study has two specific aims: (1) to determine whether changes in neural function within
      frontostriatal circuitry from baseline to end of the 8- week CM program are associated with
      parallel changes in measures of cognitive control and impulsivity and with MA abstinence
      outcomes; (2) to determine whether structural changes in frontostriatal circuitry over the
      8-week CM intervention correspond with neurocognitive, psychological and MA abstinence
      measures. Findings from this study will describe associations between: (1) functional and
      structural indices of brain areas that support working memory, cognitive control/inhibition;
      (2) performance on select neurocognitive and psychological assessments; and (3) associations
      between these with MA abstinence outcomes. Study activities and the neuroscience data
      generated will provide preliminary data for a larger, adequately powered study that will test
      ways to optimize behavioral therapies for treating stimulant use disorder.

      Furthermore, the public health relevance of this study is enhanced by its effort to develop
      capacity for a productive and impactful neuroscience research agenda between groups of strong
      clinical scientists in the U.S. and in the Republic of South Africa.
