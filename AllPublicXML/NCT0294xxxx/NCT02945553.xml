  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic knee injury is common and highly debilitating. Surgical reconstruction/repair
      improves knee biomechanics and function, but neuromuscular dysfunction persist for years
      despite rehabilitation, hindering resumption of normal activities, increasing risk of further
      injury and, in a majority of patients, hastening the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA).
      Our goal in this research study is to evaluate the utility of neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation (NMES), initiated following injury and maintained through the early post-surgical
      period, to prevent muscle atrophy and intrinsic contractile dysfunction compared to active
      control intervention of micro-electrical stimulation.
