  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the effects of combining physical
      activity with fish oil to treat fatigue in patients with advanced cancer receiving
      regorafenib.

      This is an investigational study. Fish oil is commercially available for use as a dietary
      supplement. The use of fish oil in combination with physical activity is currently being
      studied. The study doctor can explain how the study supplements are designed to work.

      Up to 96 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in a roll of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of
      being assigned to each group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take a fish oil supplement by mouth twice a day and
           perform physical activity for 8 weeks.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will take placebo by mouth twice a day and perform physical
           activity for 8 weeks. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not
           designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study
           drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.

        -  If you are in Group 3, you will take placebo twice a day and perform only stretching
           exercises for 8 weeks. You will meet with an exercise specialist during the first week
           who will teach you different stretches.

      Fish Oil/Placebo Administration:

      After your baseline tests, you will be given an 8-week supply of the fish oil/placebo to take
      home.

      Starting the next morning, you will take 2 capsules twice a day by mouth for 8 weeks. You
      should take the capsules with food and a cup (8 ounces) of water at around 8 o'clock in the
      morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

      You should store fish oil capsules at room temperature.

      Physical Activity:

      If you are in Group 1 or 2, you will complete resistance exercises and a walking program at
      home for 8 weeks.

      For the resistance exercises, you will use color-coded tubes that have 3 levels of
      resistance: light, moderate, or hard. You will move up in resistance as you gain strength.
      You will begin with 2 sets of 12 repetitions. You will complete these exercises 3 days a week
      with at least 48 hours between each session.

      You will also be asked to walk at least 5 days a week. The study staff will recommend how
      long each walk is and how many times a day to walk.

      You will also be given a log where you should record the number of steps you take each day.
      You must bring this log with you to each study visit.

      If you are in Group 3, you will meet with an exercise specialist during the first week to
      learn different stretching exercises. You will complete these stretching exercises 3 days a
      week for 8 weeks.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may continue receiving the fish oil/placebo and participating in the physical activity
      for 8 weeks.

      At the end of 8 weeks, depending on what group you were in, you may choose to continue
      receiving the fish oil supplement for an additional 4 weeks. If you were receiving the
      placebo, you may begin taking fish oil for 4 weeks. If you choose to continue or to begin
      receiving fish oil, you will also take part in the physical activity described above for
      Groups 1 and 2 for 4 weeks.

      You will no longer be able to take the fish oil/placebo or participate in the physical
      activity if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable
      to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the follow-up visit.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 8 (± 3), 21 (± 3), 36 (± 5), and 50 (± 5), you will complete 1 questionnaire about
      any symptoms you may be having. If you cannot make it into the clinic, this may be completed
      with a phone call. The phone call should last about 10 minutes.

      On Days 15 (± 3) and 43 (± 5):

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked to complete the same 7 questionnaires that you completed at baseline.
           If you cannot make it into the clinic, these questionnaires can be completed by phone
           call.

      On Day 29 (+/- 3 days):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked to complete the 7 questionnaires that you completed at baseline. If
           you cannot make it to the clinic, these questionnaires can be completed by phone.

        -  You will complete the 6-minute walk test.

        -  You will complete the 30-second chair-stand test.

        -  Your BMI and REE will be measured.

      You will receive 1 phone call each week during which you will be asked about your progress
      and helped with any problems you may be having completing the program. These calls should
      last about 10-15 minutes each.

      If the accelerometer an/or pedometer is lost or stolen, you will not be responsible for the
      replacement cost, but you should tell the study staff right away.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      At Day 57 (+/-5 days):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  If not done in the past 15 days, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine
           tests.

        -  You will be asked to complete the same 7 questionnaires that you completed at baseline
           and 1 additional questionnaire that asks if your symptoms are better or worse after
           starting the new treatment.

        -  You will complete the 6-minute walk test.

        -  You will complete the 30-second chair-stand test.

        -  Your BMI and REE will be measured.

        -  You will return the accelerometer and the pedometer to the study staff.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      One (1) month (+/-5 days) after the End-of-Study visit:

        -  You will be asked to complete the same 7 questionnaires that you completed at baseline.

        -  You will complete the 6-minute walk test.

        -  You will complete the 30-second chair-stand test.
