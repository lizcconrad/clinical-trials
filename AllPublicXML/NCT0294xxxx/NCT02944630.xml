      Further investigations studies are needed to determine the efficacy of psychological
      interventions for people with psoriasis. The aim of this study is to determine the benefits
      of individual psychotherapy on quality of life for people with psoriasis receiving medical
      treatment versus a control group (awaiting group) treated with medical treatment, without
      psychotherapy.

      This is an experimental randomized trial with control group. Quality of life, symptoms:

      pruritus, scaling and pain, distress and the illness will be measured before and after the
      intervention using psychological and quality of life questionnaires, and dermatological
      evaluations for 120 subjects.

      The investigators expect that the experimental group scores at the end of the psychotherapy
      program will be less than 4 points in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pruritus, scaling and
      pain. The Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DQLI) expected to be less than 4 points from the
      initial score, and the patients are expected to present less than 7 points in Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The experimental group scores will be less than the
      control group for quality of life, symptoms and distress.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index or DLQI, developed in 1994, was the first dermatology-specific Quality of Life instrument. It is a simple 10-question validated questionnaire that has been used in over 40 different skin conditions in over 80 countries and is available in over 90 languages. Its use has been described in over 1000 publications including many multinational studies. The DLQI is the most frequently used instrument in studies of randomised controlled trials in dermatology.</description>

    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS) for pruritus</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. Operationally a VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was originally developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983) and is commonly used by doctors to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a patient is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.</description>

    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is an index used to express the severity of psoriasis. It combines the severity (erythema, induration and desquamation) and percentage of affected area.</description>

    <measure>Body surface area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Body surface area is defined as 9% coverage for the head and neck, each arm, anterior and posterior leg as well as the four trunk quadrants respectively, leaving 1% for the genitalia. The BSA can also be estimated by the number of patients' hand areas affected, assuming that one &quot;handprint&quot; reflects approximately 1% of BSA</description>
