    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to develop a new test to identify prostate cancer patients
      at highest risk of radiotherapy-related complications. This research study would allow
      monitoring of total tissue damage within 24 hours of radiation exposure in blood samples that
      could give an initial result within a few days that would help clinicians make treatment
      decisions. Detection of unusual tissue damage at this early time, well before symptoms occur,
      could allow doctors to tailor interventions that could include patient therapies that would
      reduce or prevent the problems that occur due to treatment of their cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, a patient's risk for toxicity is based almost exclusively on population
      statistics. Radiation (and chemotherapy) dose are based on phase I data and not on the
      individual's specific genetics or hidden predispositions. RadTox measures cell damage within
      24 hours of radiation exposure and should help identify patients at higher risk for radiation
      complications. This should allow physicians to adjust radiation field size and dose to
      minimize long-term toxicity.

      Patients undergoing radiation treatment for stage I to III prostate cancer, using protons or
      X-rays, either as primary treatment or consolidation after prostatectomy (positive margins or
      prostate-specific assay [PSA]-related indications) will be eligible. Hormone treatment will
      be allowed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consent to participate in the study and a signed and dated an institutional review
             board (IRB)-approved consent form conforming to federal and institutional guidelines.

          -  â‰¥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (An ECOG) performance status
             of 0 or 1.

          -  A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Not yet begun definitive therapy with chemotherapy or radiation but may have hormones

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic disease.

          -  A history of invasive rectal malignancy or other pelvic malignancy, regardless of
             disease-free interval.

          -  Active inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., patients requiring current medical
