      The objective in this study is collecting post-marketing information on the safety and
      efficacy of Kovaltry under the routine clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This company-sponsored study is a single-arm, prospective, observational study in hemophilia
      A patients administered Kovaltry. 200 cases will be planned to be registered as safety
      analysis set in three-year period. Within 200 cases, 50 cases less than 12 years old will be
      planned to be registered. Target population are all hemophilia A patients. The treatment
      should be performed based on the product label in Japan. The standard observation period is
      two years.
