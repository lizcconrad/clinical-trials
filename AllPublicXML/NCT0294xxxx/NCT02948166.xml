      Comparison of two methods for revascularization of the superficial femoral artery: remote
      endarterectomy vs. stenting of the superficial femoral artery cin patients with
      steno-occlusive lesion of the femoro-popliteal segment of TASC C, D

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reported local percutaneous angioplasty and stenosis of femoral popliteal arteries indicate
      that the primary technical and clinical success above 95%. The technical success of
      recanalization of long occlusions femoral arteries less than 80%. Improvement of endovascular
      equipment designed for the treatment of total occlusions, increases the technical success of
      recanalization. The materials of the TASC II summarizes the results of several large studies
      that presented data on the operated segment artery patency at 56-73,7% within 2 years of
      observation. An alternative method of revascularization own femoral artery is remote
      endarterectomy. The two-year primary patency at remote endarterectomy is 86% (Moll F.L., Iio
      G.H. Closed superficial femoral artery endarterectomy: a 2-year follow up. Cardiovasc Surg.
      1997; 5: 398-400). Primary assisted patency for 33 months 88% (Rosenthal D, Martin JD,
      Schubart PJ, Wellons ED. Remote. superÔ¨Åcial femoral artery endarterectomy. J Cardiovasc Surg.
      (Torino) 2004; 45: 185-192). The length of the occlusion is not a limitation to the use of
      remote endarterectomy. Primary patency at 31 months was 60%.

    <description>A standard endovascular exposure is carried out under local anesthesia and a lesioned arterial segment is visualized. Stenosis or artery occlusion is passed by the hydrophilic guide. During the occlusion transluminal or subintimal artery recanalization (most frequently mixed) is conduced. Then balloon angioplasty of stenosis or occlusion are carried out. After the angiographic control if necessary stent (balloon expandable or self-expanding) of all the extension is mounted.</description>

    <description>Performed open endarterectomy of the common, deep, initial of superficial femoral artery. Proximal plaque exfoliate as far as possible in the superficial femoral artery. After that, the translational and rotational motions loops under fluoroscopic guidance, continuing detachment of plaque in the antegrade direction to the distal end of plaque. Plastic of arteriotomy wounds performed patches of ksenoperikard treated with epoxy compounds. Control patency of the arterial vessel is performed intraoperatively by X-ray angiography. When rendering residual stenosis or intimal dissection, limiting blood flow, complemented by endovascular intervention plasticity.</description>
