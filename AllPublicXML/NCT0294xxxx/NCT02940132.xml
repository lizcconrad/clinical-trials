  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SC10914 is a potent selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor. This study aims to determine the
      safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics profile of increasing doses of
      SC10914 when administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors. Furthermore, the
      safety and efficacy of SC10914 in patients with advanced solid tumors and negative expression
      of ATM or BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation will be evaluated in expanded cohorts to establish the
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose(RP2D).

    <description>In dose escalation study, SC10914 will be administered to patients with advanced solid tumors. MTD is defined as the maximum dose level at which no more than one subject out of three experiences has a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within 30 days after accepting SC10914.</description>

    <description>In dose expansion study,SC10914 will be administered to patients with advanced solid tumors and negative expression of ATM or BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.RP2D will be defined based on all available safety, pharmacokinetics(PK), pharmacodynamics(PD), and efficacy data collected after the start of SC10914 treatment.</description>
