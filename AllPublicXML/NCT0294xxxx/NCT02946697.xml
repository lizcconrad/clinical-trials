      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the health benefits of an education
      and peer mentor support intervention. Chinese American breast cancer survivors who have
      completed primary treatment will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a
      control group to receive enhanced usual care while waiting for the JLA. Health outcomes are
      assessed at baseline, immediately post intervention, and 1 and 4 months follow-ups.

    <description>Participants in the control group will receive enhanced usual care while waiting for the JLA program.

The peer-support component assigns each participant with a mentor who is a breast cancer survivor. They share their own experience with participants and also make weekly phone calls to mentees during the intervention to provide support and address remaining concerns.</description>
