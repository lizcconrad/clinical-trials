      This study [HOPE: Harnessing Online Peer Education] seeks to determine the efficacy of using
      online social networks to scale peer community leader models to increase HIV prevention
      within African-American and Latino men who have sex with men. The peer community leader
      model, which teaches community popular opinion leaders about how to disseminate behavior
      changes messages throughout the community, has been proven to increase HIV prevention
      behaviors. Social networks such as Facebook.com may be a cost-effective platform for scaling
      these models. Primarily upper middle-class White populations used the Internet in its early
      years, however, Internet use within African-American and Latino households has recently
      increased dramatically, especially on online social networks such as Facebook.com. People
      using the Internet may be at the highest risk for contracting HIV and are using novel
      Internet approaches to find sex partners, such as through online social networks. This is the
      first study to examine the effectiveness of the HOPE social media intervention to increase
      HIV testing among at-risk groups in the United States.
