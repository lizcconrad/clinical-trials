  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways have been shown to decrease length of stay
      and perioperative complications in a range of surgical specialties. To date, ERAS has not
      been studied in patients presenting for spine surgery. The investigators have recently
      developed an interdisciplinary pathway for spine surgery patients based on the latest
      available evidence and guidelines. The aim of this trial is to compare the investigators ERAS
      pathway with conventional perioperative management in patients undergoing 1-2 level posterior
      lumbar fusion.
