  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the registry is to collect procedural outcomes data when the Cardiva VASCADE
      Vascular Closure System (VCS) is used to seal femoral arterial access sites at the completion
      of ipsilateral peripheral interventional procedures performed through 5-7F introducer sheaths
      via an antegrade approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the growing adoption of antegrade femoral access and the use of VCDs to close these
      arteriotomies, it is important to collect performance and complication outcomes data related
      to this procedural variable. The aim of this registry is to consistently collect prospective
      data on procedural outcomes on antegrade access cases closed with the VASCADE VCS in a way
      that is consistent with the RESPECT Study design and the FDA-approved Instructions for Use
      (IFU).
