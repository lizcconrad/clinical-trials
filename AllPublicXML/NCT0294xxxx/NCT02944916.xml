  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Success of the trans anal irrigation (TAI) procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the study per patient will correspond to the realisation of 5 consecutive TAI in a maximum of 41 days of follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will practice TAI following his usual frequency (depending on his intestinal transit). After each TAI, the patient will evaluate the success of the procedure (defined as satisfying output evacuation of the bowel according to the patient usual pattern in term of volume of water instilled and absence of leakages between 2 irrigations).</description>
