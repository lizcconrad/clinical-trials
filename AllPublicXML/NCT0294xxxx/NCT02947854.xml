    <textblock>
      Fimaporfin (TPCS2a) is a photosensitiser drug being developed by PCI Biotech AS for use in
      novel Photochemical Internalisation (PCI) technology. PCI technology is designed to enhance
      the effects of other drugs in a site-specific, light-directed manner and is used to
      re-localise endocytosed molecules from endosomes to cytosol. This research study is
      evaluating the use of the PCI Technology in combination with adjuvant and vaccine antigens
      for safety and induction of immune responses.
