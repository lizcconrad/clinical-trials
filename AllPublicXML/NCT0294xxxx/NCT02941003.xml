      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To establish a set of diagnostic criteria of intraoperative frozen section of early
           stage lung adenocarcinoma, including clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics.

        2. To assess its clinical usefulness in guiding surgical procedure for early stage lung
           adenocarcinoma.

      The detection rate of small pulmonary nodules is increasing due to the widespread use of
      high-resolution computed tomography (CT) screening in clinical practice. These minute
      pulmonary nodules are suggestive of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AHH), adenocarcinoma in
      situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma. Hence, the
      precision diagnosis of intraoperative frozen section is particularly imperative for its
      fundamental role in assess indeterminate lung lesions and guide the extent of subsequent
      surgical procedure.

      However, it is still difficult for the surgical pathologist to apply the various features
      according to the newly revised WHO classification of lung adenocarcinoma (2015) to guide
      surgical management due to their unascertained accuracy or heterogeneity of lung cancer or
      technique problem. Therefore, the establishment and assessment for a set of diagnostic
      criteria of intraoperative frozen section of early stage lung adenocarcinoma are our primary
      aim in this study.
