      This project involves the development of a scaled-up model of a successful dual-generation
      intervention targeting attention, stress, and self-regulation in families attending Head
      Start, and improvements of outcome assessments of the intervention. The investigators
      hypothesize that families randomly assigned to receive the intervention, compared to families
      not receiving the intervention, will show improved brain function for attention and
      self-regulation and improved physiological function for stress regulation in both children
      and their parents, improvements in child school performance and cognition, and improvements
      in assessments of parent/family well being.

    <textblock>
      Based on basic research on the neuroplasticity of attention, stress, and family dynamics, the
      investigators developed a successful dual-generation intervention that targets attention,
      stress, and self-regulation. The intervention has been shown to improve brain function for
      attention, cognition, and behavior in preschool children in Head Start (HS) and also improves
      communication skills and reduces stress in parents. This project involves the development of
      a scaled-up model of this intervention working with with Head Start of Lane County (HSOLC).

      Goal 1: In partnership with HSOLC, the investigators have developed a scaled-up model of the
      intervention that is delivered by HS specialists and sustainable and replicable by other HS
      programs. This intervention is called Creating Connections: Strong Families, Strong Brains
      (CC).

      Goal 2: To characterize the degree to which CC improves distal outcomes related to
      parent/family well-being by assessing health and safety outcomes in parents and children,
      parental education, financial literacy and decision making, household chaos, and biomarkers
      of allostatic load related to health outcomes.

      Goal 3: To evaluate hypothesized mediating factors related to changes in family well-being,
      specifically changes in foundational systems (stress and self-regulation) by refining
      measures of family stress and self-regulation by assessing heart rate variability in parents
      and children and neurophysiological measures of self-regulation in parents.

      Children and parents at randomly assigned HSOLC sites will receive CC, and other HSOLC sites
      will deliver the regular HS curriculum. The investigators hypothesize that participation in
      CC will result in improved brain function for attention and self-regulation as well as
      improved physiological function for stress regulation in both children and their parents
      compared to families not receiving the intervention.

    <measure>Changes in brain function for selective attention: event-related potential (ERP) auditory selective attention paradigm (children and adults)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure brain function for selective attention using ERPs, participants selectively attend to one of two simultaneously presented stories that differ in location (left/right), voice (male/female), and content. ERPs are recorded to identical 100 msec probes embedded in stories when attended and unattended, and the effects of selective attention are quantified by comparing the brain response to probes embedded in the attended story with the response to identical probes embedded in the unattended story.</description>

    <measure>Changes in stress physiology: respiratory sinus arrhythmia (parasympathetic nervous system function) and pre-ejection period (sympathetic nervous system function)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>RSA is an index of high-frequency beat-to-beat variability of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, while accounting for variability in respiration rate. PEP is the amount of time between depolarization of the left ventricle, seen in the ECG wave as the &quot;Q&quot; component directly preceding a heart beat, and subsequent ejection of blood through the ventricles, measured via the maximal rate of change in the impedance waveform of the subsequent &quot;B&quot; component. Baseline values of RSA and PEP will be acquired upon arrival to the lab during a five-minute neutral video of ocean scenes. Following this, RSA and PEP will be collected during two ERP paradigms measuring selective attention (children and adults) and self-regulation (adults only). After the tasks, physiology will be recorded during a final five-minute recovery period while a neutral video is shown.</description>

    <measure>Changes in brain function for self-regulation: event-related potential (ERP) stop-signal task paradigm (adults only)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brain function for self-regulation will be measured with an ERP variant of the stop-signal task with an added feedback component. Each trial begins with a fixation cross for 500 ms, followed by an arrow cue pointing either left or right for 500 ms (the &quot;go signal&quot;), a feedback stimulus presented 400-600 ms after a response and remaining on the screen for 100 ms, and finally a jittered intertrial interval of 2000 to 4000 ms. On 25% of trials, an auditory stop signal is played at a variable latency and adjusts trial-by-trial to appear 50 ms earlier following failed stops and 50 ms later after successful stops, while adjusting to maintain 50% response accuracy over blocks of eight stop trials. Shorter delay between cue and stop signal for successful stops indicates better inhibitory control. ERPs will be averaged to the onset of auditory stop signals, responses, and feedback stimuli.</description>
