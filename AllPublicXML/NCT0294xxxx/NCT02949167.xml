  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 24,000 women attend a follow-up care program after end of primary treatment for
      breast cancer (BC) in Denmark. There is no well-conducted, larger randomized controlled
      trials (RCT) outlining a gold standard for follow-up programs ensuring early detection of
      recurrence, good management of symptoms and cost-effectiveness. The primary aim of this
      randomised, controlled trial is to test whether a nurse-led individually tailored symptom
      management program (MyHealth) will significantly reduce reported symptoms among BC patients
      following primary treatment compared to physician-led scheduled follow-up. Secondary, the
      investigators will examine patient activation (self-management), anxiety, depression, fear of
      recurrence, work ability, time to recurrence, overall survival, health behavior changes,
      health care utilization and financial costs in the two arms.

      The MyHealth program provides patients with a nurse-led education focusing on management of
      symptoms, an electronic platform to report symptoms to the nurses and support in symptom
      management and navigation of patients to appropriate health care services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During an 18-month period, 494 primary BC patients will be recruited from the Departments of
      Oncology at Naestved and Roskilde Hospital. The women will be enrolled in the study following
      completion of primary treatment. Participants are randomized 1:1 to the intervention
      (Nurse-led follow up) or control group (physician-led follow-up) and followed for 5 years. No
      matter group assignment, all women will follow the national mammography screening programs.

      Patients who accept to participate are asked to invite a close relative, preferably partners,
      to participate in the study. Patients, who do not want to participate in the randomization
      will be asked if they are willing to participate in the study by filling out two
      questionnaires. Patients who decline to participate in the MyHealth study will be enrolled in
      the standard follow-up.

      The investigators will collect data using questionnaires, clinical databases, and national
      registers before intervention and for 5 years after inclusion both in the control and
      intervention arm. Questionnaires from validated scales are used to measure primary and
      secondary outcomes in both groups whereas Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) are only collected
      in the intervention group. Patients who experiences relapse during the MyHealth intervention
      will not be asked to fill in the remaining outcome questionnaires or PROs since they quit the
      follow-up program in favor of treatment for recurrent disease.

      During follow-up, the patient will consult the nurse or the project physician if PROs reveal
      a need, or if the patient require a consultation. In order to ensure that treatment of
      symptoms and referral to other health professionals will meet clinical guidelines the nurses
      are instructed to follow a detailed response algorithm, which is developed by the project
      physician in collaboration with experienced oncologists.

    <description>The MyHealth intervention is a nurse-led individually tailored symptom management program, focused on patient education and regularly collection of Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) subsequently evaluated by specialist nurses and navigation to health care service. The nurse will meet with the patient on three-five planned appointments focused on adjustment of life after breast cancer treatment including information on symptoms of relapse or late effects and how to react on these. Close relatives are invited if patients accept. Patients will report PRO´s on symptoms of recurrence and late effects every three months during the first year and thereafter every six months.The appointments with the nurse are finalized within 3-6 month and patients will be followed with PRO for three years.</description>
