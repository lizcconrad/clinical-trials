  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to test a distal scanning capsule and a compact redesigned
      version of the OFDI imaging system in healthy and BE subjects to assess ease of use, safety
      and feasibility in preparation for its use in a multicenter clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten healthy volunteer subjects and ten volunteers with a previous diagnosis of Barrett's
      Esophagus (BE) will be enrolled in the study.

      The capsule is attached to a string-like tether which allows the operator to control as well
      as navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using peristalsis.

      Images of the esophagus will be acquired in real time to be analyzed later.
