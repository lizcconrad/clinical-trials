      Research Objectives: This is a 1-year trial designed to gather information about the use of
      the Quell for persons with chronic musculoskeletal low back pain. The investigators
      hypothesize that those assigned to using the device will report reduced back pain compared
      with those in the control condition; with those using the device also showing improvement in
      sleep, mood, and level of activity. The investigators hypothesize that frequency of using the
      Quell (increased tolerability and adherence) will be correlated with greater reduction in
      pain. The investigators hypothesize that the device will be safe to use and will demonstrate
      a reduction in healthcare utilization (reduced clinic and ED visits). Finally, based on
      preliminary analyses limited by few subject numbers, the investigators will investigate
      whether certain individuals report greater benefit from using the Quell than others and, in
      particular, would predict that those with more intense and longer duration of pain will
      demonstrate most benefit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants will be adults age 21 or older and diagnosed with axial
             musculoskeletal back pain without radiculopathy.

          -  Patients will be invited to participate if they own a smartphone phone (iPhone or
             Android device) and are able to download the pain app and the Quell Relief program app
             onto their device.

          -  Patients will also be included if they:

               1. have chronic pain for &gt; 3 months' duration

               2. average 4 or greater on a pain intensity scale of 0 to 10

               3. are able to speak and understand English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from participation if they meet any of the following

               5. any clinically unstable systemic illness judged to interfere with treatment

               6. a pain condition requiring urgent surgery

               7. an active substance use disorder, such as cocaine or IV heroin use, (positive on
                  the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; M.I.N.I. v.5.0) that would
                  interfere with study participation

               8. any prescription opioid use for pain

               9. have an implanted cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or other implanted device.
