  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio) clinical trial for patients with
      male-factor infertility with or without preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). Qualified
      650 patients are randomized into either of two groups: group A will undergo intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection (ICSI) without PGS (325 cases), Group B will undergo ICSI with PGS (690
      cases). The partners of all participants will receive the same protocol for ovarian
      stimulation and standardized luteal phase support.

      The target population will be patients with male-factor infertility aged between 20 and 50
      years, diagnosed by the ESHER Criteria (oligospermia and asthenspermia). Women with other
      reasons of infertility (eg. anovulation, endometriosis, and premature ovarian failure) are
      excluded.

      The randomization will take place before the oocyte pick-up day by a computer randomization
      system. The pregnancy test results, pregnancy complications, congenital anomalies, neonatal
      complications will be followed up by checking medical records and telephone calls.
