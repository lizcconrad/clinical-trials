  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of gabapentin 600 mg compared to placebo given 1-2
      hours preoperatively in conjunction with perioperative paracervical block for surgical
      abortion. The researchers hypothesize that adding gabapentin to local anesthesia will reduce
      perioperative and postoperative pain associated with surgical abortion. Additionally, the
      researchers hypothesize that gabapentin will reduce nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and
      consumption of pain medication.

      Project Summary

      Justification for the project

      One half of all pregnancies among American women are unintended, with nearly 4 in 10 ending
      in pregnancy termination by abortion. Elective abortions are among the most common outpatient
      surgical procedure, with an estimated 46 million performed worldwide annually. The management
      of pain is critical to patient care throughout the abortion experience since the vast
      majority of women will experience pain with the procedure. Patients are most affected by pain
      during paracervical block, cervical dilation, suction aspiration, and post operatively with
      uterine cramping. Innovation in pain control and reduction of anxiety, nausea and vomiting
      using a low cost, well-tolerated intervention could impact thousands of women each year.

      Proposed research

      This is a randomized controlled trial of gabapentin 600 mg compared to placebo given 1-2
      hours preoperatively in conjunction with perioperative paracervical block for surgical
      abortion. The researchers hypothesize that adding gabapentin to local anesthesia will reduce
      perioperative and postoperative pain associated with surgical abortion. Additionally, the
      researchers hypothesize that gabapentin will reduce nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and
      consumption of pain medication.

      New features

      The use of gabapentin in the setting of abortion has never been evaluated. Its use in similar
      surgical settings as an adjunct to pain management regiments has proven to be beneficial. It
      is generally well tolerated, inexpensive, has minimal side effects, and few
      contraindications.

      Problems anticipated

      The high volume at the study clinic will benefit recruitment efforts, however, as the
      coordination of this study may potentially disrupt clinic flow there will be limits on daily
      recruitment. Postoperative follow-up may be challenging, thus to reduce the impact of loss to
      follow-up, most of the outcomes are measured on the same day as the procedure. Further,
      multiple contact approaches will be employed and a second incentive offered after completion
      of the postoperative assessment.

    <measure>Pain at time of uterine evacuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 1, 1-2 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be pain score using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) measured intraoperatively at time of evacuation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perioperative pain level</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 1 to Postoperative Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Pain level at a variety of time points will be measured using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) to log the change in pain levels between the study arms. Pain will be assessed immediately prior to the procedure, at completion of the procedure (removal of the speculum), 10 minutes following the procedure, 30 minutes following the procedure, at discharge, and at Postoperative Day 1.</description>

    <measure>Change in perioperative nausea</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 1 to Postoperative Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Nausea level at a variety of time points will be measured using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) to log the change in nausea levels between the study arms. Nausea will be assessed immediately prior to the procedure, at completion of the procedure (removal of the speculum), 10 minutes following the procedure, 30 minutes following the procedure, at discharge, and at Postoperative Day 1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perioperative vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 1 to Postoperative Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report the number of times they have vomited during the perioperative period to assess changes in vomiting incidences between the study arms. Vomiting will be assessed immediately prior to the procedure, at completion of the procedure (removal of the speculum), 10 minutes following the procedure, 30 minutes following the procedure, at discharge, and at Postoperative Day 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 1, after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report how much anxiety they are currently experiencing by marking on a sliding scale ranging from &quot;No Anxiety&quot; to &quot;Extremely Anxious&quot;. Current anxiety level will be reported at a variety of time points to assess the changes in anxiety levels between the study arms. Anxiety will be assessed at 10 minutes after the procedure, 30 minutes after the procedure, and at discharge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety level</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>At the Postoperative Day 1 visit, participants will report if they have been been feeling worried or anxious during the previous 24 hours using a range between 0 (all of the time) to 10 (none of the time).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General satisfaction with the procedure</measure>
