  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost everyone is aware these days is aware about the risk of smoking. Still many people
      start this habit specially in early life and during college year. We aim to investigate in
      this study if there is a drive to smoke in people with vasovagal tendency to improve their
      symptoms, even if not aware of this. Vasovoagal symptoms are common and include dizziness,
      smoking, sweating, abdominal pain, fatigue and syncope. Some studies have shown correlation
      between smoking and a positive tilt table test which is indicative of vasovagal tendency. By
      collecting the information regarding smoking habit and vasovagal symptoms analysis can be
      done to see if there is correlation between these two factors

      Methods

      A questionnaire will be conducted among university students to investigate the tendency
      toward vasovagal symptoms and also smoking habits. Statistical correlation will be
      subsequently conducted to see if there is correlation between those two problems (vasovagal
      symptoms and smoking)

      Study criteria inclusion

      Benefit to the patient:

      There is no direct benefit for participation in the study. The information obtained may help
      in the future to find factors that increase smoking and being aware of these factors may help
      in controlling the habit of smoking.
