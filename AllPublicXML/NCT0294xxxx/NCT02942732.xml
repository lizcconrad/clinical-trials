      The investigators examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glucose homeostasis and
      metabolic markers in healthy normal weight and overweight young subjects and healthy
      normal-weight and overweight elderly subjects living in Beirut, Lebanon.

    <textblock>
      A low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration has been shown to correlate with
      higher fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin levels and other metabolic abnormalities like
      dyslipidemia. Previous studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation is able to improve
      insulin sensitivity and metabolic markers. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect
      of vitamin D supplementation on glucose homeostasis and metabolic markers in healthy normal
      weight and overweight young subjects and healthy normal-weight and overweight elderly
      subjects living in Beirut, Lebanon. Participants (n= 180; 93 men and 87 women) deficient in
      vitamin D were recruited from Saint Charles Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon. Four groups were
      recruited: normal-weight adults (n=30, age ≤ 65 years and BMI &lt; 25 kg/m²), overweight adults
      (n=30, age ≤ 65 years and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²), normal-weight elderly (n=60, age ≥ 65 years and
      BMI &lt; 25 kg/m²) and overweight elderly (n=60, age ≥ 65 years and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²).

      Participants received a supplement of 10,000 IU cholecalciferol to be taken three times per
      week for a period of 6 months. Glucose homeostasis and metabolic markers were measured at
      start of treatment, at 3 months and at 6 months.
