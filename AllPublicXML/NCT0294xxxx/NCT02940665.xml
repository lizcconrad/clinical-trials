  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective cohort study is to compare protein intake and
      adequacy between patients receiving Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols with
      patients receiving conventional care. The study will also compare energy intakes, gut
      function, and clinical outcomes between groups. The ability of nutritional parameters,
      including preoperative malnutrition risk and postoperative protein intake, to predict length
      of hospital stay will be evaluated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total protein intake (grams) as assessed by food records.</measure>
    <time_frame>Average in first three postoperative days</time_frame>
    <description>Protein intake from food records on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3 will be recorded. Patients will record the amount of food, fluid, and oral nutrition supplements consumed using quartiles (none, ¼, ½, ¾, all) on a food record. Research staff will verify the self-reported food records with the patients after each meal. Total protein intake in grams will be determined by comparing actual food intake (obtained from the food records) to the food composition records of our institution.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adult patients ≥18 years of age

          -  elective colorectal resection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  co-morbidities that could have interfered with oral intake (e.g., dysphagia)

          -  concurrent enteral or parenteral nutrition prior to surgery were excluded since food
             intakes could be influenced by these conditions.
