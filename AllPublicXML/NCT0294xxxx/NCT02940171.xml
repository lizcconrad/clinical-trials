  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognosis of burn patients has improved over the last decades. Early excision of full
      thickness burns is thought to be one of the key factors which have led to prognostic
      improvement. Best timing for burn excision remain uncertain however. In this multicenter
      observational study, we aim at exploring the impact of timing of surgery on outcome in
      severely ill patients using a propensity analysis.

      The first aim of the study is to explore the impact of timing of the first surgery on outcome
      of severely ill burn patients. Because a randomization would not be feasible in this setting,
      we will use a propensity analysis in matching patients receiving early surgery and those
      receiving late surgery. Secondary aims are to evaluate the impact of the timing of surgery on
      morbidity (organs failure, infections, sepsis) but also to assess the diagnostic and
      prognostic value of plasma and urine biomarkers in severely ill burn patients
