  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study consists of the participant agreeing to 1) the use of preoperative
      molecular testing (ThyroSeq) to guide extent of initial surgery and 2) the prospective
      collection of medical record data related to treatment of thyroid cancer.

      The aim of the proposed pilot study is to use a clinical algorithm that incorporates
      molecular, clinical and radiographic factors to inform surgical management. This study is the
      first to propose molecular-directed surgical management for this commonly diagnosed cancer.
