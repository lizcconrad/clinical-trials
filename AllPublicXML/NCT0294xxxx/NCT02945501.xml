  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the enhancement of electroencephalographic (EEG)
      slow-wave activity using transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) at Slow Oscillation (SO)
      frequency, during a restricted period of nocturnal sleep, enhances the restorative properties
      of that period of sleep and improves performance during a subsequent period of sleep
      deprivation.

      40 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to participate in this study. A 60 minute TES
      stimulation sequence consisting of a SO frequency stimulation (TES SO) using the NeuroConn DC
      Stimulator PLUS or a sham stimulation will be administered during the second hour of a two
      hour nocturnal sleep period. During wake period subjects will be tested using various
      cognitive, subjective and objective sleepiness and mood measures. Vital signs measurements
      will be taken to monitor general health issues. Up to 4 subjects will be enrolled per study
      session. Due to logistical reasons, no more then 2 subjects per session can be assigned to
      the TES SO group.

      Screening visit = approx. 2 hours At-home component = 7 days In-laboratory study period = 138
      hours Total in-laboratory period = approx. 138 hours per subject Total participation time (at
      home + in-laboratory components) = 15 days

          -  Clinically significant values (as determined by the appropriately licensed study
             investigator reviewing the study) for any hematology or chemistry parameter. The
             appropriately licensed study investigator reviewing the laboratory values may opt to
             repeat any clinically significant tests and include volunteers whose repeat test
             values are not clinically significant.

          -  Positive urine nicotine/cotinine result during screening visit (NicCheck™ I test strip
             results)

             during a seven night period at the beginning of the study

          -  Participation in any ongoing clinical trials.

          -  The preceding exclusionary criteria are known to alter sleep (e.g., epilepsy; some
             neurological disorders), substantially increase inter-subject variability, and/or the
             disease or condition puts the subject outside the range of what is considered healthy.
             The PI also maintains the prerogative to disqualify a volunteer if it is deemed that
             the volunteer's participation would be unsafe for the volunteer or staff or would be
             disruptive to study conduct or their inclusion could compromise data integrity.

          -  Volunteers meeting the Beck cut-off (a score of at least 14) and who carry health
             insurance will be instructed to call their health insurance Mental Health / Substance
             Abuse referral number.

          -  Volunteers meeting the first cut-off (score of at least 14 who are not insured will be
             provided with a community mental health referral contact specific to their county of
             residence.

          -  The review of the medical history with the volunteer and the physical examination
             itself will be performed by an appropriately licensed study investigator. Results of
             screening urine and blood tests will be reviewed by an appropriately licensed study
             investigator. The Post-consent Checklist will be administered by a trained research
             technician and reviewed by the study principal investigator or an appropriately
             licensed study investigator. If an appropriately licensed study investigator deems it
             medically advisable, the investigator will share abnormal results with the volunteer,
             who will be referred to his/her personal physician for follow-up.

          -  A volunteer who has been cleared for participation may participate in a session if the
             first day of the session is within 90 days of the screening date. If the first day of
             the study session is 91 or more days since the volunteer has been screened, the
             volunteer must re-screen to ensure there has not been a change in eligibility status.
