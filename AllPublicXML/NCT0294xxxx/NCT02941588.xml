    <textblock>
      Recent guidelines of the ACC/AHA suggest that elective non-cardiac surgery (NCS) should
      optimally be delayed one year after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with
      drug-eluting stent (DES). Regarding the antiplatelet agents, dual antiplatelet therapy, or at
      least aspirin is recommended to be continued considering the relative risk of bleeding and
      stent thrombosis especially during the first 4 to 6 weeks after DES implantation. However,
      these recommendations are based upon insufficient and conflicting evidences.

      Recent guidelines of the ACC/AHA suggest that elective non-cardiac surgery (NCS) should
      optimally be delayed one year after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with
      drug-eluting stent (DES). Regarding the antiplatelet agents, dual antiplatelet therapy, or at
      least aspirin is recommended to be continued considering the relative risk of bleeding and
      stent thrombosis especially during the first 4 to 6 weeks after DES implantation. However,
      these recommendations are based upon insufficient and conflicting evidences.

      The aim of our study was (1) to determine independent risk factors for postoperative adverse
      events and the strength of their association, (2) to assess the incidences of postoperative
      morbidities including major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral event as a function of time
      between PCI and surgery and (3) to compare bleeding amount and transfusion requirements
      between different intervals from PCI to surgery and durations of antiplatelet agent
      administration prior to surgery. To achieve this aim, we undertook a retrospective cohort
      study of the patients who underwent noncardiac surgery after PCI with DES.
