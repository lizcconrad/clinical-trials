  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 70% of people living with cancer are &quot;complex patients&quot; with multiple chronic
      conditions who must deal not only with effects of their cancer but also continuing diseases
      such as diabetes, depression, hypertension, or heart disease. Care coordination strategies
      shown to be effective in improving outcomes for common medical conditions seen in primary
      care include: systematic transitions for patients to and from specialty care; intensive case
      management; and a team-based approach to comprehensive care. Despite an Institute of Medicine
      report suggesting these strategies as potential ways to improve care for cancer survivors,
      their implementation has not yet been evaluated for cancer survivors. Parkland Health and
      Hospital Systems will be implementing care coordinator strategies as part of as quality
      assurance/quality improvement activities, which Aim 2 and Aim 3 (research components) will
      evaluate. This protocol has been organized to reflect this distinction between the aims. The
      investigators expect no more than 1500 patients to be included in these study aims.

      This project is a pragmatic trial. The investigators propose a quasi-experimental design
      where data will be collected both pre- and post-intervention on distinct cross-sections of
      patients with one or more highly prevalent ambulatory-sensitive chronic conditions (diabetes,
      hypertension, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, depression, or heart disease) and
      newly diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or gynecologic cancers (complex cancer survivors) in
      the Parkland Health &amp; Hospital system (Dallas, TX).

      Guided by the &quot;Primary Care Change Model&quot;, Parkland will implement evidence-based care
      coordination strategies to improve care for complex cancer survivors in this integrated
      safety-net system as a part of quality assurance/quality improvement activities (Aim 1), then
      this study will comprehensively evaluate how these strategies are implemented in the
      safety-net setting (Aim 3), and whether implementing these strategies improves care
      coordination and care outcomes (Aim 2) within the Parkland Health and Hospital System.
      Investigators expect approximately 1000 new survivors with â‰¥ 1 prevalent chronic condition to
      be eligible. The project does not include patients diagnosed with in situ and metastatic
      disease (Stages 0 and IV) due to insufficient evidence for routine follow-up and management;
      many of the latter continue indefinitely on active treatment for symptom management. The
      chronic conditions selected for inclusion are the most prevalent conditions cancer survivors
      have at Parkland as well as nationally.

        -  Aim 1: (Quality Assurance/ Improvement) Implement a system-level EMR-driven intervention
           for approximately 1000 complex cancer survivors at Parkland, combining three
           evidence-based care coordination strategies; (1) EMR-driven registry to facilitate
           patient transitions between primary care and oncology care, (2) co-locate a nurse
           practitioner trained in care coordination within a complex care team, and (3) enhance
           teamwork through coaching and technical assistance;

        -  Aim 2: (Research component) Test effectiveness of the strategies on system- and
           patient-level outcomes using a rigorous, quasi-experimental design with outcomes
           measured before and after implementation;

        -  Aim 3: (Research Component) Elucidate system and patient factors that facilitate or
           hinder implementation and result in differences in experiences of care coordination
           between complex patients with and without cancer. Investigators will collect
           quantitative (EMR data, patient surveys) and qualitative (structured observations,
           patient and provider interviews, EMR audits) data throughout.
