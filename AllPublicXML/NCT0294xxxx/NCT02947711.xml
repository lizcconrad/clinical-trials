    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, open-label, single-sequence, drug-drug Interaction study is conducted to
      evaluate the effect of diltiazem extended release (ER) (a moderate CYP3A inhibitor and P
      glycoprotein [Pgp] inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of E2027 in
      healthy participants.
