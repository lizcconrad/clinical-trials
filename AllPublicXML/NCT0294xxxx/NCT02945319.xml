    <textblock>
      The study aims at developing and validating an integrated clinico-molecular model for an
      accurate survival prognostication in newly diagnosed SMZL.

      Already existing and coded tumor biological material and health-related personal data will be
      retrospectively collected. Mutation analysis will be performed by targeted deep next
      generation sequencing of tumor genomic DNA. Deletion of 7q will be assessed by FISH on nuclei
      isolated from tumor tissues. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and mutation status will be
      analyzed on tumor genomic DNA by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The methylation status of target
      genes will be assessed by methylation specific PCR on tumor genomic DNA.

      The adjusted association between exposure variables and OS will be estimated by Cox
      regression. This approach will provide the covariates independently associated with OS that
      will be utilized in the development of a hierarchical molecular model to predict OS. The
      hierarchical order of relevance in predicting OS among covariates will be established by
      recursive partitioning analysis. An amalgamation algorithm will be used to merge terminal
      nodes showing homogenous OS. The discrimination capacity of the model will be assessed by
      calculating the c-index. Relative survival analysis will be used to provide a measure of the
      excess mortality experienced by patient's subgroups stratified according to the developed
      hierarchical molecular models, irrespective of whether the excess mortality is directly or
      indirectly attributable to the disease. The model developed in the training set will be
      tested in the validation sets and the model performance (c-index) in the validation set will
      be compared with that in the training set.
