  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: There are two goals we have for this prospective single arm study; to see an
      increase in the amount of gadolinium in 24 hour urine collection following each infusion
      treatment with Calcium and Zinc DTPA, and to see a reduction or elimination of gadolinium
      deposition disease (GDD) symptoms.

      Participants: Twenty (20) patients who are suffering from gadolinium deposition disease (GDD)

      Procedures: Over a series of three (3) treatment time-points patients will be treated with IV
      Ca-DTPA on day one, and Zn-DTPA on day two.

    <description>On Day 1, 2.5 mL of Ca-DTPA (1 g/5 mL) will be administered over a period of 1 minute. A solution of normal saline will then be administered at a rate of 300 mL/hr over 30 minutes. Patients will be seated with hands lowered to their sides to allow the chelator to dwell slightly in the soft tissues of the hands and feet. Patients will then be moved to a supine position and the infusion rate increased to 750 mL/hr over the next 60 minutes. At 90 minutes the remaining 2.5 mL of Ca-DTPA will administered IV over a period of 1 minute, and the normal saline will continue for the remaining 9 minutes. The IV line will then be removed. Patients will be instructed to drink plenty of fluids that evening.
The same treatment therapy will consist of 3 time-points, approximately 1 month apart.</description>

Calcium DTPA: On Day 1, 2.5 mL of Ca-DTPA (1 g/5 mL) will be administered over a period of 1 minute. A solution of normal saline will then be administered at a rate of 300 mL/hr over 30 minutes. Patients will be seated with hands lowered to their sides to allow the chelator to dwell slightly in the soft tissues of the hands and feet. Patients will then be moved to a supine position and the infusion rate increased to 750 mL/hr over the next 60 minutes. At 90 minutes the remaining 2.5 mL of Ca-DTPA will administered IV over a period of 1 minute, and the normal saline will continue for the remaining 9 minutes. The IV line will then be removed.

          <description>The ACPA QOL is a self-administered questionnaire measuring functionality for people with pain which looks at the ability to function, rather than pain alone and is intended to measure activity levels. The ACPA QOL consists of 10 possibilities ranging from 0 to 10 where 0 represents &quot;Non-functioning&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Normal Quality of Life&quot;.</description>

          <description>Subjects will receive IV administration of Ca-DTPA on Day 1 and Zn-DTPA on Day 2 at each of treatment time-points. Three identical treatment time-points are scheduled on Month 1, Month 2 and Month 3.
Calcium DTPA: On Day 1, 2.5 mL of Ca-DTPA (1 g/5 mL) will be administered over a period of 1 minute. A solution of normal saline will then be administered at a rate of 300 mL/hr over 30 minutes. Patients will be seated with hands lowered to their sides to allow the chelator to dwell slightly in the soft tissues of the hands and feet. Patients will then be moved to a supine position and the infusion rate increased to 750 mL/hr over the next 60 minutes. At 90 minutes the remaining 2.5 mL of Ca-DTPA will administered IV over a period of 1 minute, and the normal saline will continue for the remaining 9 minutes. The IV line will then be removed. Patients will be instructed to drink plenty of fluids that evening.
The same treatment therapy will consist of 3 time-points, approximately 1 m</description>
