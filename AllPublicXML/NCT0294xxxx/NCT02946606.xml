  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, sequential dose group, Phase 1b/2 study
      designed to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics
      of weekly and every other week doses of GX-H9 in the treatment of AGHD.

      The subjects who are adequately eligible to attend this clinical trial via screening will be
      sequentially assigned starting with Group 1. Each group will be comprised of subjects who
      will receive both GX-H9 and Genotropin, and subjects will be randomly assigned to either
      GX-H9 and Genotropin in the ratio of 4:1. The treatment will proceed as the proposed group
      order (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3), and safety and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) will be
      reviewed six weeks after each treatment by the safety monitoring committees before proceeding
      to the next group.

             to hypothalamic pituitary disease or due to genetic causes.

          2. Has documented confirmation (medical history) of GH deficiency during adulthood by 1
             or more growth hormone (GH) stimulation tests, as follows:

               -  Insulin tolerance test (peak hGHâ‰¤3.0 ng/mL)

             therapy, as appropriate, is acceptable.

          5. Has a BMI of â‰¥18.0 and 35.0 kg/m2 (both male and female subjects).

             conjunction with spermicide, sterilization, and intra uterine device) during the study
             and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug.

          8. Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening.

             1.5 Ã— ULN.

          8. Has had active acromegaly within 18 months before screening.

          9. Has active carpal tunnel syndrome.

         10. Has Prader-Willi syndrome.

         11. Has had active Cushing syndrome within 12 months before screening.

         12. Has any other major medical conditions, including eg, clinically manifested
             hypertension, tuberculosis, major surgery within the 3 months before screening, or
             significantly abnormal laboratory test results (eg, disturbed calcium homeostasis); or
             any other conditions (eg, acute infections) that may influence drug absorption,
             metabolism, or excretion, or that may interfere with any study variables in the
             judgment of the investigator.

         13. Has been treated with systemic corticosteroids other than replacement therapy within 3
             months before screening.

             within 2 months before screening. Oral estrogen replacement and hormonal
             contraceptives are not allowed in female subjects. For replacement purposes,
             transdermal estrogens are permitted in female subjects.

         16. Has a history of noncompliance with medications, uncooperativeness, or alcohol/drug
             abuse.

         17. Has a positive result from serology examination for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis
             C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         18. Has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to rhGH.

         19. Has donated blood or had any major blood loss greater than 500 mL within 90 days
             before screening.

         20. Has a history of any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator would pose a risk for participation in this study or interfere with the
             compliance needed for this study.

         21. Has received an investigational drug or product or has participated in a drug study
             within 60 days before screening.
