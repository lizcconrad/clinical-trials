      The aim of this work is determine the more successful noninvasive method by comparison of two
      noninvasive methods ( IVC ultrasound - noninvasive hemoglobin measurement (SpHb)) that used
      in the detection of patients with blood loss.

      The works were completed in 6 months. The study was conducted at the blood donation center
      and in Emergency department. Vital parameters were measured and recorded before making the
      voluntary blood donation. Following Masimo brand portable device fingers SpHb value was
      measured.Then IVC diameter of patients in the supine position were measured using
      ultrasonography. Then he left to donors return in routine blood donation programme. A unit
      (500ml) of blood were drawn from each donor. After the blood donation process measured and
      recorded the vital signs again. SpHb was measured noninvasively from finger again. Following
      these measurements were recorded again by measuring the diameter of IVC.
