    <textblock>
      This is a sample collection study, participants will be required to collect one (if last
      menstrual period ≥12 months) or two (if last menstrual period &lt;12 months) urine samples and
      return them to the study site, together with collection sample information. Participants
      having a menstrual cycle within the last 6 months will also be required to provide follow-up
      information on pregnancy status and date of next menstrual bleed.

      Each subject will be provided with a urine sample collection container, a transport
      container, barcode labels, prepaid envelopes and a full set of study instructions, together
      with the materials required to facilitate the collection of a follow-up urine sample and
      completion of follow up form, where applicable.

      Subjects admitted into the study that are unsure of their pregnancy status will be provided
      with a marketed Clearblue HPT, to test for pregnancy prior to beginning the study. If a
      subject informs the trial site that they have become pregnant prior to urine sample
      collection, they will be withdrawn from the study and no urine sample will be collected. The
      subject will return their materials to the study site, and the co-ordinator will complete the
      exit form.

      Subjects will be required to collect a urine sample, label their sample (as soon as
      collected) with the appropriate bar-coded label provided and return this to the study site.
      Where it is not possible to return the sample as soon as collected, urine samples must be
      stored in a domestic fridge in the container provided for a maximum of 1 week and then sent
      to the study site at their earliest convenience.

      Subjects will receive follow-up to establish pregnancy status unless ≥ 12 months from their
      last menstrual period (LMP). On completion of the study, subjects will be reimbursed for
      their participation.

      It is anticipated that sample collection will be carried out remotely (i.e. at the volunteers
      home) but volunteers may attend the study site for sample collection should they require.
