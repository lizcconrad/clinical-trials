  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to test the capability of the CareTaker monitor to extract
      the respiration signature from its acquired signal, and to determine a respiration rate of
      breaths/minute that meets or exceeds the performance levels of its predicate device.

      The goal of the proposed study is to test the capability of the CareTaker monitor to extract
      the respiration signature from its acquired signal, and to determine a respiration rate of
      breaths/minute that meets or exceeds the performance levels of its predicate device.

      The detection approach of RSPR (respiratory rate) that the CareTaker technology takes is
      based on peak detection and pulse analysis of arterial pressure pulse signals, as well as
      spectral analysis of the raw CareTaker sensor signal.

      The study was performed under the supervision of the Chesapeake IRB and involved 21 subjects
      &gt;18 y who were monitored during spontaneous and metronome-paced breathing.
