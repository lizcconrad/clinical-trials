    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating patients with
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back or has not responded to treatment. Ibrutinib
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by
      targeting certain cells. Giving ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating patients
      with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the complete response (CR) rate with ibrutinib at the standard dose of 560 mg
      daily in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks up to 16
      infusions in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) with ibrutinib and nivolumab in combination
      in patients with relapsed or refractory classical HL.

      II. To determine safety and toxicity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients
      with relapsed or refractory cHL.

      III. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed or refractory
      cHL treated with combined ibrutinib and nivolumab.

      IV. To determine the duration of response in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL treated
      with ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on the distribution of T-, B-, and NK
      cells in the peripheral blood.

      II. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on Th1/Th2 cytokines profile and
      correlate this with treatment response.

      III. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on Th1/Th2 ration and specific IgG
      sub-isotypes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and nivolumab IV
      continuously over 60 minutes on day 1.Treatment with nivolumab repeats every 21 days for up
      to 16 courses and treatment with ibrutinib continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
