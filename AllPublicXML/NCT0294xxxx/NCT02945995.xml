      The purpose of the study is to evaluate outcome after arthroscopy if the hip in patients
      previous treated with periacetabular osteotomy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known the patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip beyond the bony
      malformation has intraarticular damage to labrum and chondral structures.

      In DK, if the patients has persistent pain in the hip joint after PAO, they have been offered
      a hip arthroscopy, however we do not if their hip functions and pain improved by the surgery

      The investigator aimed to make a short to middle-term followup study to see if the patients
      had benefits of the surgery.
