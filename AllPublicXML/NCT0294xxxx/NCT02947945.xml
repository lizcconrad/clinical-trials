  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reslizumab is a type of medicine called a monoclonal antibody that is made in the research
      clinic; it works by blocking a specific protein in the body called interleukin-5. The study
      medicine, reslizumab, is not yet approved for doctors to treat patients with EGPA. It is
      considered an experimental drug in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is open-label which means that all subjects will receive the study medication. The
      study medicine - reslizumab - will be given to the participants in addition to the medicines
      they are already taking to treat their EGPA such as oral steroids (e.g. prednisone) and
      medicines that reduce the activity of their immune system (the study doctor will tell the
      participants which medications these are) - this is what is meant by 'standard of care' and
      can vary in different countries. Drugs that are sometimes used (i.e., 'standard of care') to
      reduce the activity of the immune system in EGPA (in addition to oral steroids) include
      azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide. Information about how
      the study drug affects the human body and health will be collected through a number of tests,
      procedures and questions.

      The study medicine, reslizumab, will be given to the participants at a dose of 3mg/kg
      intravenously (within a vein) every four weeks for 28 weeks for a total of 7 treatments.
      During the treatment phase of this study, a study staff member will call the participants
      every two weeks to see how they are doing, what medications they are taking, and if they are
      able to decrease their steroid use. The study is a total of 11 study visits in a 44 week time
      period. Everyone who takes part in the study will continue to receive his/her existing
      treatments for EGPA (although the dose of oral steroids may be reduced during the study).

    <description>All adverse events will be reported to the sponsor and the IRB in accordance with the policy of National Jewish Health and the FDA. Adverse events will be recorded on Case Report Forms as non-serious or serious events (DAEs). Serious adverse events, whether or not considered related to the investigational drug, will be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event form and faxed to the IRB and the sponsor as soon as site personnel are aware of the event. Every attempt will be made to collect discharge summaries for each hospitalization should they occur to provide further details.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demonstrate the steroid sparing effect of reslizumab therapy by titrating corticosteroid dosage</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Goal is to demonstrate the steroid sparing effect of reslizumab therapy by titrating corticosteroid dosage while using this anti-IL-5 therapy or to reduce the rate of EGPA exacerbations during the study period. Change in steroid dose will be assessed by comparing the corticosteroid dose of subjects at the end of the steroid stable phase and compare to steroid dose at the end of the treatment period. Change in the rate of exacerbations will be assessed by comparing the rate of exacerbations during the study period with the rate during the washout and safety-monitoring period as well as with the self-reported rate of exacerbations from the year prior to the study.</description>
