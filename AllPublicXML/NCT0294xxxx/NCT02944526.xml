  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with subacute, less than 6 months of evolution, adhesive capsulitis are
      randomly attributed to the control or study group. Both groups receive a series of 3
      suprascapular nerve blocks under ultrasound guidance with either 5ml saline or 5ml
      ropivacaine 2mg/ml ( ref) at 1 week interval. Testing consists of glenohumeral range of
      motion (ROM) (anterior elevation, lateral elevation, external and internal rotation) measured
      by goniometer, Constant score and visual analog scale (VAS) pain score. Evaluations are done
      immediately before and one hour after every suprascapular block and at 4 weeks after the
      third suprascapular block.

      All suprascapular nerve blocks are performed by one physician and the evaluations are done by
      a occupational therapist or MD experienced in glenohumeral function evaluations. All
      practitioners are blinded to the assigned group.

      All patients continue their pre-study treatment of physiotherapy and per os pain medication.
      Patients keep a record of analgesics and NSAID use during the trial. Drop-out rate is
      measured.

      Introduction: Adhesive capsulitis is a painful and debilitating condition affecting adult
      shoulders. Although relatively rare the condition is more common in diabetic patients and
      effective pain diminishing treatments without the use of corticosteroids are needed.

      Methods and Material: Patients presenting with subacute, less than 6 months of evolution,
      adhesive capsulitis are randomly attributed to the control or study group. Both groups
      receive a series of 3 successive suprascapular nerve blocks under live ultrasound guidance
      with either 5ml saline or 5ml ropivacaine 2mg/ml conducted at 1 week interval. Testing
      consists of glenohumeral ROM (anterior elevation, lateral elevation, external and internal
      rotation) measured by goniometer, Constant score, VAS pain score. Evaluations are done
      immediately before and one hour after every &quot;suprascapular block&quot; and at 4 weeks after the
      third suprascapular block.

      All suprascapular blocks are performed by one physician and the evaluations by either a
      occupational therapist or MD experienced in glenohumeral function evaluations. All
      practitioners are blinded to the assigned group.

      All patients continue their physiotherapy, consisting of electrotherapy, range of motion,
      stretching and strengthening exercises and their per os medication. Patients keep record of
      analgesics and NSAID use during the trial. Drop-out rate is measured during the entire study
      protocol.
