  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of Ixazomib in HIV
      infected patients who are on a stable regimen of ART that suppresses HIV replication. A
      secondary goal is to determine the effect of ixazomib on the size of the HIV reservoir.

             ≤ULN, PLT ≥ LLN and ≤ULN

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ULN and the direct bilirubin must be ≤ ULN; AST &lt;1.5 x ULN and ALT

          -  Patient must have HIV viral load &lt;20 copies/ml on two occasions at least 3 months
             apart.

          -  In the opinion of the treating physician, patients must have available other regimens
             likely to suppress HIV should their current regimen fail.

          -  Male or female patients age &gt;=18 years

          -  A plasma HIV RNA viral load demonstrating a measure of &lt;20 copies/mL within 30 days
             prior to study initiation.

          -  CD4 count &gt;500 cells/mm3 within 30 days prior to study enrollment

               -  OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,
