  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial eczema and perioral dermatitis are clinical entities that develop exclusively in the
      face and present a special therapeutic challenge. Topical corticosteroids that are commonly
      applied to treat eczema/dermatitis at other body sites are best avoided in the face, as they
      may result in rapid atrophy of facial skin and in the long term rather aggravate facial
      dermatoses. Black tea compresses have been successfully used by German-speaking
      dermatologists to treat facial eczema/dermatitis for decades. The precise mechanism of action
      is unknown but is presumably based on astringent properties of tannins in the black tea and
      on the antiinflammatory action of a wet compress as such. This therapy is cheap, universally
      available and practically free of side-effects. Despite these perceived advantages the
      effects and tolerance of black tea compresses have not been formally studied to date.
      Therefore, the investigators plan to treat 25 patients with facial eczema/perioral dermatitis
      over a period of 6 days each within the current trial. The disease activity will be assessed
      before, during and after completion of treatment using several clinical scores. In addition,
      side-effects, if any, will be documented.
