  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a relative high prevalence of constipation and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD)
      in the elderly residents of nursing homes, mainly due to high antibiotic and medication
      usage. Constipation and diarrhoea causes a substantial burden on lives of the frail elderly
      and significantly reduces the quality of life (QoL). In addition, these circumstances lead to
      a higher workload for healthcare workers and treatment of constipation and diarrhoea increase
      costs in healthcare. There are indications that the gastrointestinal microbiome is altered in
      conditions, such as constipation and AAD. Research indicates that probiotics show potential
      in the treatment of constipation, AAD and infectious diarrhoea. Probiotics can restore the
      aberrant gastrointestinal microbiome and thereby possibly treat/prevent constipation and
      diarrhoea in the frail elderly population. To illustrate, a previous pilot study of probiotic
      administration in elderly residents of a nursing home demonstrated a reduced prevalence of
      constipation and diarrhoea stool types and a higher prevalence of ideal stool types during
      the intervention compared to the baseline period. These promising results demand for a
      confirmatory study in this population.

      The primary objective is to assess the effect of a probiotic intervention and a non-probiotic
      intervention on bowel habits of elderly (&gt;80 years on average) in several nursing homes in
      the Netherlands.

      A randomized, double-blind, superiority, multicentre trial. In this trial a probiotic
      fermented milk drink will be compared to a non-probiotic drink on its potential to improve
      bowel habits. Both drinks are commercially available in the supermarket. After a run-in
      period of 2 weeks, 260 subjects will be randomized (1:1) into either the probiotic fermented
      milk arm (n=130) or the non-probiotic drink arm (n=130), both for a period of 10 weeks.

      The study population consists of 260 frail elderly of relatively high age (&gt;80 years old on
      average) living in several nursing homes in The Netherlands. One arm receives daily one
      bottle (65 ml) of Yakult Original (YOR), a probiotic fermented milk drink containing at least
      6,5*10^9 colony forming units (cfu) of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS), for 10 consecutive
      weeks without changing the regular diet. The other arm will receive a dairy milk drink (AH
      Basic Dairy Peach Drink, 65 mL) for 10 consecutive weeks, also without changing the regular
      diet.

      The change in bowel habits of the subjects will be measured according to two main study
      parameters; (a) Stool-quality according to the 7-point Bristol stool chart, and (b)
      defecation frequency, measured as number of stools per time unit.

    <description>The primary objective is to assess the effect of a probiotic intervention and a non-probiotic intervention on bowel habits of elderly (&gt;80 years on average) in several nursing homes in the Netherlands.
Stool quality: will be monitored using the 7-point Bristol stool chart.
Type 1 &amp; 2 stools are associated with constipation, stool type 3 &amp; 4 are characterized as ideal stools, type 5,6 &amp; 7 stools are associated with diarrhoea.
Bristol stool chart:
Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy
Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface
Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily)
Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely liquid</description>

    <measure>Defecation Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Defecation frequency: will be calculated from the number of stools per time-unit.
The frequency of defecation will be related to the Rome III criteria. For functional constipation a patient must fulfill the following diagnostic criteria:
Fewer than three defecations per week
Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives
Insuﬃcient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome</description>
