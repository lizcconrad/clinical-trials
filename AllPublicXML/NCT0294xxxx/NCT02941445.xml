      Weight reduction is the most important treatment target in obese women with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS), yet it is usually hardly achievable with lifestyle intervention alone.
      Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) liraglutide was recently approved as an
      anti-obesity drug but with some limitations, which include high cost and the lack of
      long-term efficacy and safety data regarding weight reduction. In addition, weight loss
      achieved with liraglutide is often non-sustainable after treatment cessation. Although DPP-4
      inhibitors are weight neutral, they reduced weight regain in animals previously treated with
      GLP-1 RAs if they were switched to DPP-4 inhibitor rather than placebo. The aim is to
      evaluate whether DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin in combination with metformin reduce body weight
      regain more effectively than metformin alone in obese PCOS who had been previously treated
      with liraglutide.
