  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators general goal is to identify approaches to risk stratification and health
      promotion through lifestyle modification that are acceptable, effective and efficient for
      prevention of T2D in South Asian communities from diverse settings.

      The specific aims of the proposed iHealth-T2D study are:

        1. Determine whether intensive lifestyle modification vs usual care reduces risk of T2D
           (primary endpoint) amongst South Asians with i. central obesity; ii. prediabetes and
           iii. overall (with central obesity and / or obesity).

        2. Investigate secondary endpoints, including health gains in family members. Identify
           social, demographic and environmental factors influencing primary and secondary
           endpoints.

        3. Carry out a health economic analysis of lifestyle modifications vs usual care for
           prevention of T2D on the Indian subcontinent and Europe. Quantify the cost-effectiveness
           of screening by waist circumference vs HbA1c.

    <description>the investigators will recruit 3,600 South Asian men and women aged 40-70 years with i. central obesity (waist≥100 cm) and/or ii. prediabetes (HbA1c 6.0-6.4%) to the study (Index cases). Recruitment will be from the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) and Europe (UK). Index cases will receive either i. intensive lifestyle modification (N=1,800); or ii. usual care (N=1,800).
Intensive lifestyle modification follows clinically accepted, evidence based strategies to achieve &gt;7% reduction in weight through improved diet and increased physical activity, and is delivered as 9 face-face and 13 telephone contact sessions over 12 months.
Index cases will be followed for three years to identify new-onset T2D.</description>
