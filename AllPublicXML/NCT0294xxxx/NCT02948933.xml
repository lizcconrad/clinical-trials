      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of Dengvaxia® when used in the
      real-world immunization setting

      Primary Objective:

        -  To measure the incidence of selected adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs)
           occurring over a period of six (6) months after each Dengvaxia® dose administration;

        -  To quantify the association between Dengvaxia® and each of the selected AEs and SAEs for
           which a risk window after vaccination can be defined, using estimates of relative risk

        -  To monitor the occurrence and frequency of hospitalized dengue disease as well as any
           other SAEs leading to hospitalization or death, including new and previously
           unrecognized SAEs, following Dengvaxia® administration on a longer term (up to 5 years
           after the first Dengvaxia® dose administration.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To identify risk factors for hospitalized dengue disease (severe or not) among subjects
           vaccinated with Dengvaxia®;

        -  To describe the frequency of hospitalized dengue disease and/or other SAEs or selected
           AEs according to the number of Dengvaxia® doses and/or interval between doses.

      This is a prospective multi-national non-interventional study that includes two components of
      Cohort Event Monitoring (i) Short-term safety surveillance with a follow-up of 6 months after
      each Dengvaxia® dose administration and (ii) a long-term safety surveillance with a follow-up
      of five years after the first dose.

      No vaccine will be provided as part of this study.

      Study population will be identified in a convenient sample of sites as representative as
      possible of vaccination centers in each country. Subjects who received their first dose of
      Dengvaxia® at participating sites during the recruitment period and who meet the eligibility
      criteria will be asked to participate. After enrollment, vaccinees will be contacted
      periodically by telephone, e-mail, or Short Message Service (SMS) during follow-up for the
      identification of outcomes and Dengvaxia® vaccination status.
