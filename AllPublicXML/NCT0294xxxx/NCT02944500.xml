        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Obese: BMI&gt; 30 kg/m2 or &gt;27 kg/m2 with comorbidities (including but not limited to
             insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, sleep
             apnea, gallbladder disease, hyperuricemia and gout, and osteoarthritis).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or wanting to become pregnant.

          2. Women using metal IUD

          3. Any change in the dosage of hormonal contraceptive medications (birth control pills,
             implanon). Subjects should remain on same medication/ same dose during the time of the
             entire study.

          4. Moderate (creatinine clearance of 30-59 ml/min) and severe renal impairment
             (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min) and end-stage renal disease

          5. Moderate, or severe hepatic impairment

          6. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients in liraglutide

          7. History of diabetic ketoacidosis

          8. Congestive heart failure

          9. EKG abnormalities (as listed above)

         10. Inflammatory conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, Rheumatoid arthritis etc

         11. Gastroparesis

         12. Pancreatitis

         13. Gallstones- as they may cause increased risk of pancreatitis

         14. Alcohol consumption- the maximum quantity for men is 140g—210g per week. For women,
             the range is 84g—140g per week or drinking as consuming no more than two drinks a day
             for men and one for women. Alcohol can cause increased risk of pancreatitis and
             hypoglycemia.

         15. Untreated thyroid disease like hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism

         16. Subjects taking the following medications: warfarin, steroids (inhaled or systemic due
             to reduced hypoglycemic effect), and subjects on other hormones (LHRH analogs etc).

         17. Subjects on any oral anti-diabetic agent except metformin

         18. Personal or family history of MEN II or medullary thyroid cancer

         19. Subjects with any type of bioimplant activated by mechanical, electronic, or magnetic
             means (e.g. cochlear implants, pacemakers, neuron or biostimulators, electronic
             infusion pumps, etc.)

         20. Subjects with any type of metallic implant that could potentially be displaced or
             damaged during MRI, such as aneurysm clips, metallic skull plates, surgical implants
             etc. or metal containing tattoos

         21. Anxiety of small spaces and/or claustrophobia

         22. Uncontrolled cardiac impairment, circulatory impairment, or inability to perspire
             (poor thermoregulatory function)

         23. Significant sensory or motor impairment

         24. Epilepsy, particularly photo-sensitive epilepsy, which may place the individual at a
             higher risk for adverse events during fMRI scanning with visual stimulation

         25. Subjects with neurological or psychological problems which may interfere with or
             complicate testing (e.g. presence of titubation)

         26. Body weight above the limitation of the MRI scanning table (330lbs/150 Kg) or body
             dimensions that could difficult the performance of the scan.

         27. Subjects who cannot adhere to the experimental protocol for any reason

         28. Anemia with Hgb less than 10

         29. Uncontrolled infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatitis, chronic infections etc)

         30. Any uncontrolled endocrine condition, e.g Cushing's, Acromegaly, etc

         31. Any cancers or lymphoma

         32. Eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia

         33. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides &gt;500 mg/dl)

         34. Weight loss surgery or gastrectomy

         35. Any changes in medications that affect brain function, e.g. anti-depressants,
             anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety, anti-seizure medications, antihypertensives etc
             (subjects should remain on same medication/ same dose during the time of the entire
             study).

         36. Vegetarians- as food images presented will include numerous non-vegetarian items and
             thus will not be appealing as high calorie food items.

         37. Suicidality, as measured by the MSSI at screening visit.
