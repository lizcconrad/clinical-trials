  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prolonged stay in intensive care unit (ICU) after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary
      bypass increases not only cost of patient care but also morbidity and mortality of patients.
      The ability to predict which patient has the tendency to have a prolonged ICU stay would help
      in patient and resource management of the hospital. There are many predictive models aiming
      at identifying patient at risk of prolonged ICU stay after cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass but almost all involve the preoperative assessment for proper resource
      management with one model, Open-Heart Intraoperative Risk (OHIR) Scoring concerning
      intraoperative manipulatable risk factors to improve anesthetic care and patient outcome. The
      OHIR model comprises 6 risk factors, 5 of which can be managed intraoperatively, with total
      score of 7 and a score of â‰¥ 3 indicating a likely prolonged ICU stay. The objective of this
      study was to re-validate the performance of OHIR score in the recent context.

      This will be a retrospective, observational, analytical study. The study protocol was
      approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee, Khon Kaen University (HE581287).

      The investigators will review all eligible medical records at Srinagarind Hospital and Queen
      Sirikit Heart Center of the Northeast, Khon Kaen University during January 2013 and December
      2014. The extracted data consist of patient's clinical data and all risk factors in the OHIR
      score. The investigators will apply the OHIR scoring to the data to assess its performance.
      The investigators will use the same criteria for a prolonged ICU stay as in the previous
      study, i.e. a stay longer that the median.
