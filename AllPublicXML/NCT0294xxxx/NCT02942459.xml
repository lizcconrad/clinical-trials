  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Aim of this National study is to examine whether music therapy can reduce negative
      symptoms and raise Quality of Life for patients suffering from Schizophrenia. It is an
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), double-blinded study with two arms. 120 Participants are
      anticipated. The two Arms consist of 25 weekly hours of Music Therapy by educated Music
      Therapists and time compensated Music Listening by unknown Care Staff Members.

      The Study is a close Cooperation between Aalborg University (The Music Therapy Research
      Clinic) and Aalborg University Hospital,Psychiatry (The Center of Psychosis Research).

      Schizophrenia includes 1 % of the Population in Denmark (DK) and often ends up to be
      chronically. Negative Symptoms are difficult to reduce by Medication and Psychosocial
      Treatment Possibilities are searched for. Two Cochrane Reviews (2005, 2011) have been
      conducted concerning Music Therapy and Schizophrenia with Positive Results. This RCT,
      double-blinded Study aims at verifying, if these Results can be Recognized in the Danish
      Health System. It also aims at being similar to Biomedical Study Designs as much as possible
      to strengthen the Evidence of the Study. A Power Calculation showed, that a minimum of 44,5
      Participants in each Arm should be available, but as drop out can be anticipated with this
      Population, 60 Participants in each Arm were recommended. The screening Procedure is
      Comprehensive as it aims at securing, that the negative Symptoms are part of the Illness
      Schizophrenia and not side Effects from Medication or simultaneous Depression. The same
      Raters do the screening Process all over the Country. (See the Inclusion- and Exclusion
      criteria).

      The Measurement Tools are as follows:

      At Baseline, after 25 Sessions and at Termination:

        -  The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),

        -  Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS),

        -  Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref),

        -  Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS),

        -  Board of Clinical Examinations (Danish Questionnaire) (UKU)

        -  Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) 4 Weeks after Termination GAF is repeated
           as Follow Up Interview. In the Arm of Music Therapy Audio Recording of Music
           Interventions are done in Session 1 , 15 and 25.

        -  Helping Alliance Questionnaire, patient version, (Haq-II) This last questionnaire is
           filled out after 5 sessions and after 15 Sessions and at Termination together with a
           Research Assistant in both Arms.

    <description>25 Weekly Hours of Music Therapy adapted to the Needs of the Participants. Interventions can be Active (playing Music, singing, improvising, Song-writing) or Receptive (Listening to selected Play-lists, or to the Participants´ favored Music).
A Manual is created and trained with the Music Therapists, which distinguishes between
Unique and Essential Principles for Music Therapy with people suffering from Schizophrenia with negative Symptoms,
Essential but not Unique Principles,
Acceptable but not necessary Principles,
Not acceptable and Proscribed Principles. These Principles concern Attitude and Listening Perspectives by the Music Therapist, how to conduct the Musical Interventions and Questions of Frames for the Music Therapy Work.</description>

    <description>25 Weekly Hours of Being together with an unknown Care Staff Member listening to Music from selected Play-Lists. Music Therapists at the Music Therapy Research Clinic at Aalborg University Hospital, Psychiatry have developed Play-Lists in a Taxonomy from very Supportive to less Supportive Music including around 100 Hours of Music all together on the Lists.
A Manual is created and trained with the Care Staff Members. Here the Activities are much more limited (only Music Listening to the Play-Lists are allowed). No Therapeutical Conversation is allowed.</description>
