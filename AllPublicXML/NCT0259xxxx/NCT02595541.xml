    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a consequence of an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
      (PVR), pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary venous pressure, or a combination of these elements.
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a frequent complication of congenital heart disease,
      particularly in patients with systemic-to-pulmonary shunts. Persistent exposure o f the
      pulmonary vasculature to increased blood flow and pressure may result in vascular remodeling
      and dysfunction. This leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and, ultimately, to
      reversal of the shunt and development of Eisenmenger's syndrome. It may be more appropriate
      to define pulmonary hypertension according to the ratio of MPAP to mean systemic arterial
      pressure (MPAP/MAP) because children may have a low mean systemic blood pressure. MPAP/MAP
      ratio of &lt; 0.25 is normal, a ratio of 0.33-0.5 indicates moderate pulmonary hypertension, and
      a ratio of &gt; 0.5 is indicative of severe pulmonary hypertension

      30 Patients were randomly allocated in two equal groups; group MS (received intravenous
      milrinone and oral sildenafil) and group M (received only intravenous milrinone). Demographic
      data, patient's clinical data and different intraoperative times were recorded. In 1st
      postoperative 24 hours, we recorded; hemodynamic parameters [mean pulmonary arterial pressure
      (MPAP), mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, central venous pressure]. We
      calculated MPAP/MAP and inotropic score. The incidence of pulmonary hypertensive crisis, side
      effects of studied drugs and complications related to pulmonary artery catheter were
      recorded.

After baseline measurements, sildenafil (1mg/kg) administered in ICU via a nasogastric tube, to be repeated every 4 hours via a nasogastric tube or orally. Sildnafil is presented in tablet form which was dissolved in water to make a concentration of 1 mg/ml.</description>
