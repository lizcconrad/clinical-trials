    <textblock>
      This is a single-center (University Malaya Medical Centre), randomized, double-Blind,
      placebo-controlled versus bupropion hydrochloride sustained-releases study trial on 70 men
      who have methadone emergent sexual dysfunction. Bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release
      (Wellbutrin SR) 150mg once a day for 7 days then 150mg twice a day for 42 days. Taken orally
      by the subjects.The total duration of the study is expected to be 24 months. 20months for
      subject recruitment and 4 months for final subject follow-up.

      The primary endpoint is Mean improvement in scores on the Clinical Global Impression Scale
      adapted for sexual Function (CGI-SF). Secondary endpoints are Change from baseline
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) score. Mean improvement in scores on the
      sexual desire inventory 2 (SDI2). Other evaluation included: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression
      Rating Scale (MADRS- Malay version ), Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
      (M.I.N.I), Opiate Treatment Index (OTI), World health organization Quality of Life-Brief
      Scale (WHOQoL-Brief, Malay version), Malay Version of the Golombok-Rust Inventory of Marital
      State (Mal-GRIMS) and Rapid urine drug test. Safety evaluation included: Incidence of adverse
      events. Data will be analyzed using linear mixed-effects model.

Score range: 1 to 5; total 2 to 10. 3/ EF Domain: sum of scores for Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 15 from IIEF. Score range: 0 to 5 (Q1 to Q5), 1 to 5 (Q15); total 1 to 30. .4/.Intercourse Satisfaction Domain: sum of scores for Questions 6, 7 and 8 from IIEF. Score range: 0 to 5; total 0 to 15. 5/Overall Satisfaction Domain was sum of scores for Questions 13 and 14 from the IIEF. Score range: 1 to 5; total 2 to 10. Higher score indicates better outcome in all domain.</description>
