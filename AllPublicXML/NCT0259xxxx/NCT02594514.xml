  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe obesity (SO), defined as BMI≥95th percentile, has increased worldwide among
      adolescents. American studies estimated that 1.3-2.8% of 12-19-year-old individuals have a
      BMI &gt;40 kg/m2 or a BMI &gt;35 kg/m2 with at least one serious co-morbidity. The immediate and
      long-term risks associated with SO in adolescents include cardiovascular and metabolic
      diseases, obstructive sleep apnoea and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the results
      of sleeve gastrectomy in adolescents are still uncertain.

      Objective and hypotheses: Investigators aimed to assess the long-term safety, efficacy, and
      cardiovascular risk changes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in adolescents with SO.

      Method: Longitudinal retrospective study of 22 adolescents with SO who underwent laparoscopic
      sleeve gastrectomy. Clinical and metabolic variables immediately before surgery and after 6,
      12, 18 and 24 months were assessed.
