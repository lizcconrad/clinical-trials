    <textblock>
      The two main objectives of this prospective study are:

        -  to identify those patients for whom pre-treatment FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) PET (positron
           emission tomography) CT-scan (Computed tomography scan) provides useful information for
           the treatment of breast cancer (ASAINT 1),

        -  to improve FDG PET-CT-scan imaging criteria for assessing response to neoadjuvant
           therapy early, in M0-patients (ASAINT 2).

      The secondary objective is to better understand the interactions between the imaging
      parameters of FDG PET-CT-scan and biological and histological features of breast cancer .

      This is a non-interventional study. Two PET-CT-scans are performed, one before starting
      treatment, and the other after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The two PET-CT-scans are
      prescribed by oncologists from the center of breast diseases Unit at St. Louis hospital, in
      Paris, France. Oncologists provide clear information to the patients on the purpose of the
      examination. The examinations are performed in the nuclear medicine department at St. Louis
      hospital. PET-CT-scans data, tumor characteristics, results of other imaging and biological
      tests, results of surgery and patient's follow-up are summarized in a &quot;de-identified&quot; file.
      This file has been declared to the National Commission on Informatics and Liberties (CNIL).
      The data in this file are established prospectively and secondary analyzed to assess the
      precise role of PET-CT-scans in the initial staging of breast cancer and to determine the
      optimal PET-CT-scans criteria to evaluate response to neoadjuvant treatment early.
