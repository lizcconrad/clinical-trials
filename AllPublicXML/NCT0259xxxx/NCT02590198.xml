  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal bacterial infection remains a serious pathology in industrialized countries despite
      the use of prophylaxis measures for group B streptococcus (GBS) (peri-partum antibiotic in
      women with GBS colonization), which was implemented in the United States in 1996 and in
      France in 2001 and has led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of neonatal bacterial
      infections. However, early onset neonatal infection (EONI), which is defined as an infection
      occurring during the first 6 days after birth (as opposed to late onset neonatal infections
      (LONI) occurring between days 7-89), is still one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity
      and mortality. Physicians consider EONI a significant diagnostic and therapeutic emergency
      due to the potential for sudden onset and rapid evolution of sepsis in newborns with immature
      immune systems. Currently, in France, detection of EONI is based on national consensus
      guidelines published in 2002 (ANAES recommendations). There are broad indications to provide
      empirical antibiotic treatment pending diagnostic confirmation through different
      complementary exams. To ensure that every infected newborn is diagnosed, biological
      assessments are often repeated and result in the use of invasive and painful procedures,
      anemia and financial concerns. Moreover, in cases of abnormal biological results, many
      newborns are subjected to intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatments requiring hospitalization
      and separation from their mother. However recent studies have shown that antibiotics can have
      a potentially deleterious effect on the neonatal digestive microbiota and result in the
      appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with possible long-term consequences on the
      health of the child.

      Procalcitonin (PCT) is a calcitonin prohormone secreted from the parenchymal tissues. This
      marker of inflammation has been shown to be a valuable diagnostic marker for bacterial
      infection in adults and in children. It also seems to be a reliable marker for neonatal
      bacterial infection, which would make it useful in the detection of EONI. Because
      physiological levels of PCT vary during the first days of life, possibly due to postnatal
      intestinal bacterial colonization, levels of this marker are difficult to interpret in the
      early neonatal period. However, in a study of 2151 newborns with suspected EONI, Nicolas
      Joram et al. found that PCT obtained from the umbilical blood cord, prior to newborn
      intestinal colonization, bypasses this postnatal physiological peak of PCT and effectively
      constitutes a discriminant marker to distinguish between infected and healthy infants using a
      cutoff value of 0.6 ng/ml.

      Subsequent to this pilot study, several studies on PCT in umbilical blood cord confirmed its
      good diagnostic performance for EONI, particularly when included in a diagnostic algorithm.
      This marker could contribute to a better estimation of EONI risk in order to limit the use of
      unnecessary complementary exams and prescription of antibiotics and their associated short-
      and long-term side effects in healthy newborns.

      Therefore, in this study, the investigators propose to test the diagnostic value of a
      PCT-based algorithm in newborns suspected of having EONI. The investigators hypothesize that
      this algorithm is as efficient as those currently used (ANAES), but will limit coinciding
      biological exams and exposure to antibiotics during the neonatal period.

    <time_frame>6 days after birth</time_frame>
    <description>The primary noninferiority endpoint is a composite of overall adverse outcomes induced by EONI occuring within 6 days following birth. It includes death, Neonatal Intensive care Unit (NICU) admission, or hospital readmission. The investigators chose this primary endpoint because the French definition of EONI diagnostic is subjective, specifically in case of possible EONI in case of gastric fluid positivity, and is finally rarely objectivated. Moreover, the new PCT-based algorithm do not require any gastric fluid analysis and modify the usual French definition of possible EONI, impossible to use in this context. Focusing on serious adverse event outcomes seems a very pragmatic and efficient methodologic strategy.</description>
