  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for patients with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma who are not surgical
      candidates is poor. Patients characterized as having &quot;borderline resectable&quot; disease treated
      with preoperative chemo-radiotherapy fair somewhat better - although many of these patients
      are not converted to resectability. It may be argued that intensification of local and
      regional therapy might 1.) Increase the share of patients able to undergo curative surgery
      and 2.) Improve the local disease control interval and extend survival for patients who
      remain unresectable. Therefore, the purpose of this research study is to determine if an
      increase in the number of surgical resection pancreatic adenocarcinoma is higher than
      historical data by using a combined treatment of proton radiation with capecitabine (oral
      chemotherapy).

      Participants as part of this research study will receive Proton radiation over 6 weeks with
      oral chemotherapy (capecitabine) only taken on radiation days.

      In addition, If surgery is an option, then surgical resection will be performed at least 8
      weeks after treatment with radiation and chemotherapy.

      Quality of Life questionnaires are a part of this study.The Fact-Hep questionnaires will be
      filled out by the participant at strategic time points in the treatment course.

    <description>The following will be performed in this group: Proton Radiation Therapy with concomitant oral chemotherapy, capecitabine taken on radiation treatment days for 6 weeks. A surgical resection will be performed between 8 and 16 weeks if radiographic studies suggest operability.
Additionally, a Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-Hep) questionnaire is to be filled out by participants at baseline, at week 4 and week 6, then 1 month after completion of treatment, then every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years. The FACT-Hep questionnaire is specific to those with gastrointestinal cancers focusing on hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancer.</description>
