  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if C16G2 Gel administered over a certain period of
      time either with a toothbrush or a custom dental tray can effectively kill bacteria in the
      mouth that cause dental cavities.

      This multi-center, multiple-arm study will evaluate the microbiological activity and safety
      of C16G2 Gel in male and female dental subjects, 12 to 75 years of age. The study will be
      conducted in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and open-label manner and enroll
      adolescent (12-17 years of age) and adult subjects (18-75 years of age).

      A total of approximately 128 study subjects will be enrolled into up to 7 study arms. Study
      drug (C16G2 Gel or Placebo) will be administered via manual brush gel application (MBGA) or
      tray gel application (TGA). Two C16G2 concentrations will be evaluated. Four study arms will
      be conducted in a double blind manner, with a treatment allocation ratio of 4:1
      (C16G2:Placebo), three study arms will be conducted in an open-label manner. Before dosing,
      eligible subjects will undergo professional dental prophylaxis on Day 0. Clinic visits for
      all study arms will include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -21 to 0), and a varying number of dosing
      and follow-up visits.

             gel or mouth rinse Note: Placebo subjects are not excluded

         10. Presence of any condition or concurrent illness, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would compromise normal immune function (e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid
             arthritis, lupus, liver disease, organ transplant, etc.), interfere with the use of
             study dentifrice and oral care products, or interfere with the ability to comply with
             study requirements, or jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the
