    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study aimed to validate the effectiveness of the combined use of the
      Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) and the One-Minute Osteoporosis Risk Test
      (IOF test) in a population from Wuhan, China.

      This cross-sectional study was a field investigation. A total of 400 Wuhan residents who
      visited the Health Examination Department at our hospital were invited to participate in this
      study. Potential participants were informed of the aim and procedures and were asked to sign
      an informed consent form before participation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age of at
      least 20 years, able to read and fill out the questionnaire, and willingness to participate.
      Exclusion criteria were as follows: severe liver, heart, or kidney impairment, and tumor.
      Procedures of the study were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved
      by the local ethics committee.

      The study population was divided into four groups according to age and sex: Younger Women
      (age ≤ 55 years), Younger Men (age ≤ 55 years), Older Women (age &gt; 55 years), and Older Men
      (age &gt; 55 years). A research assistant and a nurse distributed the Chinese version of the IOF
      test to participants. The Chinese version of the IOF test includes 10 questions, two of which
      are specific to women and one to men. The maximum number of risk factors is 8 for women and 9
      for men. Individuals were regarded as susceptible to osteoporosis risk if they answered &quot;yes&quot;
      to any of the 10 questions.

      To assess the grade of osteoporosis risk, the OSTA index was calculated by the equation (body
      weight (kg) - age (years))*0.2. An OSTA index of -1 to -4 is regarded as medium risk, greater
      than -1 as low risk, and less than -4 as high risk.

    <description>The IOF test were filled out by participants. The Chinese version of the IOF test includes 10 questions, two of which are specific to women and one to men. The maximum number of risk factors is 8 for women and 9 for men. Individuals were regarded as susceptible to osteoporosis risk if they answered &quot;yes&quot; to any of the 10 questions.The OSTA index was calculated by the equation (body weight (kg) - age (years))*0.2. weight in kilograms. age in years.An OSTA index of -1 to -4 is regarded as medium risk, greater than -1 as low risk, and less than -4 as high risk. Then detect any association between the results of IOF test and the risk grade.</description>
