      This clinical trial studies the use of early oral supplementation in improving nutritional
      status in participants undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Impaired nutritional
      status in participants undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant has been linked to
      decreased outcomes such as increased length of hospital stay and increased time to
      engraftment (an important milestone in transplant recovery). Early oral supplementation may
      increase nutritional status and help to promote a positive outcome in participants undergoing
      transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if early oral supplementation improves nutritional status, decreases length
      of hospital stay, and shortens time to engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Serum albumin, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and the degree of mucositis, as scored by the
      National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC), a validated and widely
      accepted scale used for rating mucositis. The purpose of our secondary aims is to observe a
      potential correlation between the retrospective and prospective groups, as well as assess the
      need for future research based on these correlations.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive Boost Plus orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or Pro-Stat 101 PO BID
      beginning one week before scheduled HSCT and continuing until hospital discharge. If
      participants do not tolerate the Boost Plus or Pro-Stat, they receive a milkshake PO once
      daily (QD) as an alternative.
