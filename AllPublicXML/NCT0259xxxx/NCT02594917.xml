    <textblock>
      The investigators are performing this research study to determine whether having low
      iron-sulfur cluster levels can cause a disease known as pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is
      defined as abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.

      Usually, small specialized structures inside each human cell called mitochondria are in
      charge of generating energy within lung arteries for normal function. During situations of
      disease or stress, lung arteries undergo a change in the function of mitochondria, resulting
      in the development of PH. In studies on mice, investigators have learned that alterations in
      the production of specific metal complexes called iron-sulfur clusters are responsible for
      these changes. This makes it more likely that mice will develop PH.

      In this study, the investigators want to find out if alteration of iron-sulfur cluster
      formation leads to increased likelihood of developing PH in humans.

      After informed consent has been obtained, all participants will be asked to complete the
      following:

        -  Medical history/chart review

        -  Physical exam

        -  Vital signs

        -  Blood draw (see details below)

      TEST GROUP: The study will include two visits for the test group. The research
      activities/procedures completed will depend on participant approval and physical condition
      (ability to physically perform the activities/procedures).

      Visit 1: This visit will last ~ 7-8 hours.

      Consenting individuals will be asked to complete:

        -  Medical history/chart review

        -  Physical exam

        -  Vital signs

        -  Blood Draw(s) that will be used for laboratory tests routinely performed to assess
           participants' health (e.g. comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood cell count,
           coagulation tests), to see if female participants are pregnant, stored for research,
           used for assays (e.g. microRNA expression, those related to iron-sulfur cluster
           expression/genetics) and used to isolate PBMCs for generation of induced pluripotent
           stem cells (iPSCs).

      In addition participants may be asked to do the following:

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)

        -  6 Minute Walk Test

        -  Skin Biopsy from underarm or inner thigh completed by a physician

        -  Resting Echocardiogram completed by a trained sonographer. Duration ~ 30-45 minutes

      Visit 2: All participants who completed Visit 1 may be asked to do the following:

        -  Cardiac (Right Heart) Catheterization performed by professionals at UPMC's Cardiac
           Catheterization Lab. Duration ~ 3 hours

        -  Female participants may be asked to do a pregnancy test before the procedure.

        -  Exercise Testing:

        -  IF the results of the Cardiac (Right Heart) Catheterization show that the pressure in
           the lung vessels is elevated without exercise AND there is no other abnormality in the
           heart function, we will NOT do exercise testing.

        -  IF the participants are both physically able to perform exercise testing and agree to do
           it, they may complete:

             -  Cardiac (Right Heart) Catheterization WITH EXERCISE: Duration ~ 2-3 hours

             -  Rest and Stress (WITH EXERCISE) Echocardiography: Duration ~ 1-2 hours. If the
                participant is unable to exercise, a medication (Dobutamine) will be given.

      CONTROL GROUP: The study will include one visit for the control group.

      Visit 1: This visit will last ~6-7 hours

      Consenting individuals will be asked to complete:

        -  Medical history/chart review

        -  Physical exam

        -  Vital signs

        -  Blood Draw(s) that will be used for laboratory tests routinely performed to assess
           participants' health (e.g. comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood cell count,
           coagulation tests), to see if female participants are pregnant, stored for research,
           used for assays (e.g. microRNA expression, those related to iron-sulfur cluster
           expression/genetics) and used to isolate PBMCs for generation of Induced pluripotent
           stem cells (iPSCs).

      In addition participants may be asked to do the following:

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)

        -  6 Minute Walk Test

        -  Skin Biopsy from underarm or inner thigh completed by a physician
