  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A complete intrastromal ring, MyoRing (Dioptex, GmbH, Linz, Austria), suggested by Albert
      Daxer in 2007, is a relatively new technique that has been demonstrated to treat keratoconus
      safely and effectively.Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL), introduced by Wollensak et al. in
      2003, has become a standard treatment for progressive keratoconus to slow or possibly stop
      progression of disease.

      The formation of the stromal pocket during MyoRing implantation offers the opportunity for
      simultaneous introduction of riboflavin 0.1% into the pocket followed by UVA irradiation to
      provide combined treatment in patients with progressive keratoconus.

    <description>Surgical technique: Implantation of a MyoRing in a corneal pocket was performed by using a PocketMaker microkeratome a guided, vibrating diamond blade to create a stromal pocket 9 mm in diameter at a 300-μm depth via a 4- to 5-mm-wide corneal tunnel followed by Corneal Collagen Crosslinking (standard surface UVA irradiation (370 nm, 3 mW/cm2) using Ufalink device)</description>

    <description>Sterile riboflavin solution 0.1% was then continuously injected for 3 minutes into the corneal pocket via a standard 0.3-mm cannula through the incision tunnel.
Standard surface UVA irradiation (370 nm, 3 mW/cm2) was then applied at a 5-cm distance for 30 minutes.
After UVA irradiation, a flexible MyoRing intracorneal implant was inserted into the corneal pocket,</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &gt;18 years old

          -  a diagnosis of keratoconus, intolerance for contact lenses or glasses

          -  a documented progression of disease. This progression was defined by the following
             changes over 1 year: an increase of the steepest K by 1.0 diopter (D) or more in
             manifest cylinder, or an increase of 0.5 D or more in manifest spherical equivalent
             (SE) refraction by repeated keratotopography ODP-scan ARK-1000 (Nidek, Japan)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  minimal pachymetry of less than 380 μm,

          -  a history of previous ocular pathology or ocular surgery;

          -  pregnancy or breastfeeding;

          -  corneal scarring.
