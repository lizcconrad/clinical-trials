  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo abdominal wall reconstruction for giant ventral hernia repair will be
      randomized to either methylprednisolone or saline preoperatively, to examine the effects of
      methylprednisolone on postoperative pain, nausea and recovery after giant ventral hernia
      repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative high-dose glucocorticoid has been shown to attenuate the postoperative
      inflammatory response leading to decreased morbidity and length of stay (LOS) after
      colorectal and aortic surgery, as well as decreased pain and subjective recovery after
      orthopedic surgery. Methylprednisolone (MP, &quot;Solu-Medrol&quot;) is one such glucocorticoid, which
      has been shown to be safe for usage in surgery. Giant ventral hernia repair is associated
      with a high risk of postoperative morbidity and prolonged LOS compared with other hernia
      repair procedures requiring laparotomy. Further, the total costs of these procedures remain
      high. Systemic administration of high-dose preoperative MP in ventral hernia repair has only
      been described anecdotally in the literature, and never with the aim to improve the treatment
      of this patient group specifically. It is however unknown to what extent benefits weigh out
      downsides from usage of high-dose MP in giant ventral hernia repair, patients often at
      increased risk of postoperative wound infection. On this background we hypothesize that a
      preoperative high-dose MP results in improved recovery after giant ventral hernia repair
      compared with placebo.
