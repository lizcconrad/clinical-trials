  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare dynamic inspiratory flow rates achieved by a
      population of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients through the Breezhaler®,
      Ellipta® and Handihaler® dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices. No active drug or placebo will be
      administered to patients in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inspiratory flow rates achieved by the COPD patients, via the breath actuated devices,
      are one of the important factors that can influence the efficiency of the drug delivery by
      the inhalation route. The peak inspiratory flow (PIF) rates achieved by COPD patients through
      different breath actuated dry power inhalers may differ because of the differences in
      internal resistance of the different type of devices. The results of inspiratory airflow rate
      and pressure drop over time, from this study, will provide an assessment of the range and
      variability of inhalation profile characteristics generated by COPD patients within the
      population selected for this study (e.g. demographics, gender, disease control) through the
      Breezhaler and the other marketed comparator DPIs.

      The inhalation profiles will be obtained through an Inhalation Profile Recorder (IPR). The
      inhalation profile recorder is a data acquisition device which consists of a computer, an
      interface unit and a pressure transducer. This allows it to be able to measure the real time
      dynamic pressure drop at the mouthpiece of the inhaler during an inhalation maneuver. On the
      graphic user interface, plots of inspiratory pressure drop versus time and flow rate versus
      time are displayed in real time. The investigator or designated study personnel at site is
      responsible for typing in the Test Location, selecting the Inhaler Type (Breezhaler, Ellipta,
      Handihaler), typing in the Patient ID and Patient Age, selecting Male or Female, and
      recording Patient Comments made during the test session, as necessary.

      Each patient will be required to generate three (03) inhalational profiles through each of
      the three (03) study devices: Breezhaler®, Ellipta® and Handihaler®.

             within 6 hours prior to or during inhalational profile assessments for the study
             [Note: Use of rescue medication should not be restricted if patient feels the need of
             the rescue/ reliever medication because of the diseased state. Safety and disease
             management should be priority and the suitability of such a patient for the study or
