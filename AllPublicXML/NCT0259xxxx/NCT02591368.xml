  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized trial aims to ascertain differences in outcome measures for the
      operative treatment of basilar thumb arthritis by comparing the two most common surgical
      treatments: LRTI and mini tightrope suspensionplasty. The Investigators will evaluate both
      subjective and objective data to determine if a particular surgical method offers more
      favorable outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective randomized-controlled trial comparing LRTI and mini tightrope
      suspensionplasty for the surgical treatment of basilar thumb arthritis. Patients meeting
      operative criteria who present to Level One Orthopaedics at Orlando Health will be consented
      for study participation. Subsequently, consented patients will be randomized into one of
      three treatment arms: LRTI, suspensionplasty with one-suture construct and suspensionplasty
      with two-suture construct. The patient will be blinded prior to the procedure; however, the
      performing surgeon will not be able to be blinded. The patient will become un-blinded
      postoperatively when the performing surgeon informs them which method was used. The
      investigators will then follow the patients for 5 years to assess the primary and secondary
      outcomes (see below) and analyze the data with an intention-to-treat method before publishing
      the conclusions. Follow-up visits will occur at two weeks, one month, three months, six
      months, one year, and five years. Outcome measures will incorporate subjective and objective
      measures and will include the SF-36 and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder &amp; Hand (DASH)
      questionnaires, pinch/grip strength, visual analog pain scale, patient satisfaction and
      postoperative complications.
