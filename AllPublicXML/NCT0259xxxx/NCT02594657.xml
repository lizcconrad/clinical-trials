  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, ECC exercise can be realized using various modalities that target small or large
      muscle masses in a segmentary or dynamic way. The training program proposed in this study is
      realised on an handmade ergocycle which allows eccentric contractions.

      With this type of ergometer, O2 consumption (VO2) is three to five fold lower than during an
      exercise realised at the same power output with a concentric ergocycle. Due to this later
      propertie, which origins are not yet fully identified, there is an increasing interest to
      embed ECC in rehabilitation programs.

      The investigators hypothesis that a higher pedal rate will induce a lower oxygen consumption,
      with the same benefits.

      This study aims to compare oxygen consumption at two pedal rates : 50 and 80 rotation per
      minute (rpm).

      The ultimate goal is to assess efficacy and tolerance of eccentric training on ergocycle and
      to enhance comprehension of the physiological mecanisms involved in the lower O2 consumption
      observed.

      The training program proposed in this study is realised on an handmade ergocycle which allows
      almost pur eccentric contractions.

      Fifteen healthy volunteers realize a incremental test until exertion on a concentric
      ergometer. If the minimal power output of 200W is reached, the volunteers are familiarized
      with eccentric exercise during several bouts of exercise. This habituation session allows
      avoiding the secondary muscular effects of high intensity eccentric exercise.

      Then, volunteers could take part in a two-stepped eccentric protocol: 1) an incremental test
      consisting in 3 stages. Each stage lasts 4 minutes.

      2) A constant-load test realized at 320W during 6 minutes. Each test is realized twice: at 50
      and 80 rpm and sequence is randomly assigned.

      [One step (incremental or constant load) = two tests (50 and 80 rpm)]

      During each step, oxygen consumption is continuously measured, as well as cardiac output and
      muscular activity and intramuscular oxygen kinetic.
