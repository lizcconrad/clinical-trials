  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate pharmacokinetic similarity of Mylan
      trastuzumab (Hercules) versus EU-approved Herceptin® and US-licensed Herceptin® and
      pharmacokinetic similarity of EU-approved Herceptin® versus US-licensed Herceptin® after 8
      mg/kg as single dose administered as intravenous infusion over 90 minutes in healthy male
      subjects based on the equivalence criterion that AUC0-∞, AUC0-last, and Cmax least square
      mean ratios are bounded within the 90% confidence intervals, 80.00% - 125.00%. Three
      similarity assessments were performed, 1) Hercules vs. EU-approved Herceptin®, 2) Hercules
      vs. US-licensed Herceptin® and 3) EU-approved Herceptin® vs. US-licensed Herceptin®.
      Secondary objectives included further pharmacokinetic assessment of similarity of Hercules,
      EU-approved Herceptin® and US-licensed Herceptin® λz, tmax and t1/2 along with assessment of
      safety (including immunogenicity) and local tolerance.

      All subjects checked into the clinical facility on the day prior to dosing. On study day 1,
      each subject received either a single i.v. infusion of 8 mg/kg BW in 250 mL normal saline
      over a 90 minute period of Mylan trastuzumab (Hercules), EU-approved Herceptin®, or
      US-licensed Herceptin®. Dosing occurred following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. On
      the day of dosing, subjects fasted for the first 3 hours after the start of the infusion then
      received standard meals approximately 3, 6 and 9 hours post-dose. In each study period, blood
      samples were collected just immediately prior to dose administration (0 hour) and at 45 and
      90 minutes (just prior to end of infusion). Blood samples were collected post-dose at 3, 6,
      9, 24 and 48 hours, relative to the start of infusion. The subjects were allowed to leave the
      clinical facility after the 48-hour blood sample collection. Subjects returned to the
      clinical facility for the scheduled blood sample collections post-dose on Day 5, 8, 11, 15,
      22, 29, 43, 57, and 71. Serum samples were stored at −80°C ± 15°C until shipment for
      analysis. Blood samples for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were collected prior to dosing on Day
      1 and on Day 71. Blood samples for C-reactive protein (CRP) were obtained at Screening, prior
      to dosing and at 3, 24 and 48 hours post-dose and on Day 8 and 71. Blood samples for analysis
      of immunoglobulins were collected prior to dosing on Day 1 and on Day 8 and 71.
