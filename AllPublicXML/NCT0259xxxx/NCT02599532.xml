      This study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban in
      nephrotic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, and patients
      with nephrotic syndrome are known to be hypercoaguable with increased incidence of venous
      thromboembolism necessitating anticoagulation. While classically warfarin has been used as an
      anticoagulant in NS, newer oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, are increasingly used to
      treat venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the general population. It is unknown how
      hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban.

      This will be a parallel arm, single-dose pilot study of the pharmacokinetics of apixaban in
      adults with nephrotic syndrome. Goal enrollment of twenty subjects with non-diabetic
      nephropathy who have nephrotic-range proteinuria, defined as &gt;3.5g/24 hours or UPC &gt;3.5 and
      ten healthy control subjects without nephrotic syndrome. Each subject will be administered a
      single dose of apixaban 10 mg. Plasma drug concentration level and plasma anti-Xa activity
      levels will be measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours after drug administration in order
      to determine the maximum plasma concentration of apixaban, area under the curve, and
      half-life of apixaban in the setting of hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria due to nephrotic
      syndrome. Apixaban levels will be measured via liquid-chromatography spectrometry mass.
      Additionally, thrombin generation will be measured at 0, 3, 6, and 24 hours.

        Special consideration for patients on aspirin: for patients on chronic low-dose aspirin
        therapy, we will allow a 7 day wash out period. This will only be allowed for patients who
        are taking aspirin as primary prophylaxis or for unclear indications. Patients who are on
        aspirin therapy for following indications will be excluded: primary prophylaxis of stroke
        due to atrial fibrillation, secondary prevention of stroke or myocardial infarction,
        history of coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease. For patients who meet
        the potential criteria for the 7-day wash out, their medical history will be reviewed by
        one of the clinician investigators to ensure that it is safe and appropriate to hold the
        agent.

        Those subjects taking aspirin for the following reasons will be excluded:

          -  Primary stroke prevention from atrial fibrillation

          -  Secondary prevention due to prior stroke, heart attack or cardiac stent

          -  Existing heart disease or peripheral vascular disease.
