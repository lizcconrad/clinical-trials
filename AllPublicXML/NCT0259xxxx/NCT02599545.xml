  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants have more health and developmental problems than normal
      birth weight full-term infants. These problems are more common in males than female VLBW
      preterm infants. Male VLBW infants also experience less positive mother-infant interactions
      than females, especially when mothers are emotionally distressed. This is a significant
      problem because positive mother-infant interactions function as an important protective
      factor against the negative health and developmental outcomes associated with prematurity.
      The source of the vulnerability of male VLBW infants to health problems, suboptimal
      mother-infant interactions, and poor development goes beyond gender socialization differences
      and includes biological factors. Identification of infant and maternal biological
      markers/predictors of infant health and developmental outcomes could ultimately lead to
      interventions for VLBW preterm infants.

      The purpose of this study is to confirm that testosterone rather than cortisol is a more
      reliable marker/predictor of complications affecting infants' health outcomes, mother-infant
      interactions, and infant cognitive/motor/language developmental outcomes; and that male
      infants exhibit a higher sensitivity to testosterone levels than female infants.

      This longitudinal study will examine the associations of the steroid hormones, testosterone
      and cortisol, levels with infant health, mother-infant interactions, and infant
      cognitive/motor/language development ('infant development') in very low birthweight (VLBW, BW
      &lt; 1,500 g) preterm (gestational age &lt; 32 weeks gestation) infants after adjusting for
      maternal physical and mental health state, infant socioemotional and behavioral development,
      and characteristics of infants and mothers. Concurrent and repeated measurement of
      testosterone and cortisol levels both in infants and mothers will be conducted through
      infancy and early childhood (at birth, 40 weeks postmenstrual age, 12 and 24 months corrected
      age).

      A blood sample will be obtained only from the infant by collecting the leftover cord blood
      from the hospital lab. If no remnant blood is available, a blood specimen will not be
      collected. Mothers will be asked to provide a saliva sample within 72 hours of delivery, then
      mother and infant saliva sampling will be collected in the morning on the same day when the
      infant reaches 40 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) or discharge from the Duke Intensive Care
      Nursery (ICN) (whichever comes first), 12 months, and 24 months corrected age (CA)(+/- 1
      month).

        Mothers will be eligible for consent if they are a patient in the Duke University Hospital
        Labor &amp; Delivery department and meet all eligibility criteria. Potential mothers will be
        approached about the study before delivery or within 72 hours after delivery. 150
        mother-VLBW infant pairs, a total of 300 participants, will be recruited for the final
        sample size of 120 pairs. English or Spanish speaking mothers may participate. If the
        mother is between 15-17 years of age, a minor mother consent will be used. If the mother is
        Spanish speaking, a Spanish short form consent will be used with a Spanish interpreter. If
        the mother is pre-consented, the infant may or may not be enrolled at delivery. The infant
        could be excluded if he/she is delivered at a gestation or weight that is outside of study
        limits, or if she/he has a severe health problem/congenital anomaly detected at birth.
