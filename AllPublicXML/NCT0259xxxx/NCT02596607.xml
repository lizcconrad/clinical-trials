  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute stroke management represents a true medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis
      and urgent treatment. However, only a small percentage of patients access to thrombolysis on
      time. Various actions have been implemented since 2006 in the Rhone area as part of research
      projects and of the 2010-2014 national stroke action plan: training of health professionals
      involved in the stroke management, increase of public awareness through sensibilization
      campaigns, implementation of telemedicine and increase of the number of hospital beds
      dedicated to stroke (stroke units beds).

      The main objective of the STROKE 69 study is to assess the impact of these actions on
      intra-hospital acute stroke management times in the Rhône area. The secondary objectives are
      to assess the impact of these actions on the rate and place of thrombolysis, the rate of
      post- thrombolysis hemorrhage, the rate of thrombectomies, mortality in the acute phase, at 3
      and 12 months, the level of disability at 3 and 12 months, pre-hospital times, the number of
      calls to SAMU centre 15 (French mobile emergency medical services, equivalent to 911) and
      management channels.

      The investigator will perform a prospective cohort study between 06/11/2015 and 06/06/2016
      and data will be compared to data collected in a previous cohorts study, the AVC-69 cohort
      study (Porthault Chatard et al, Int J Stroke. 2012 Oct;7(7):E13), between 06/11/2006 and
      06/06/2007, before the implementation of the actions in the Rhône area.

      The cohort will be constituted of all consecutive patients treated for a stroke suspicion by
      the Rhône SAMU centre 15, or in one of the emergency unit or stroke unit of the Rhône area,
      and presenting a symptom-onset (the last time the patient was seen without deficit) less than
      24 hours.

      After collecting data in the acute phase, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of stroke or
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) will be followed for 12 months after their inclusion by
      telephone calls at 3 and 12 months to assess the level of disability and mortality.

      AVC 69 study allowed us to include 1306 patients between 2006 to 2007, the investigator plan
      to include at least 1300 patients in the STROKE 69 cohort with approximately 1000 confirmed
      strokes or TIAs.
