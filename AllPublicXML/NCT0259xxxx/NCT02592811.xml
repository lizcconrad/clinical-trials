  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bile duct stone extraction is impossible after endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) alone in
      approximatively 10% of cases (mostly because of stones' size). Adjunction of a mechanical
      lithotripsy (ML) is well established to improve clearance of common bile duct (CBD) stones.
      Because of inconstant success, high cost, and length of procedure, an alternative method was
      proposed in 2003: endoscopic sphincterotomy plus large balloon dilatation (ESLBD). If the
      safety of ESLBD is accepted in all recent published studies, it remains controversial wether
      ESLBD is superior to conventional endoscopic treatment associating ES± ML for CBD stones.
      Procedure treatment and place of ESLBD in CBD stones therapeutic strategy is unclear.

      The purpose of this prospective comparative multi center randomized study is to evaluate the
      superiority or not of ESLBD on conventional treatment (ES±ML) for the treatment of large bile
      duct stone (≥13mm) after standard ES, and to propose a new CBD stones therapeutic strategy.
