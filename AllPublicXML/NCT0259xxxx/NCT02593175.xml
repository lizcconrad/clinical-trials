      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if receiving 4 cycles of an experimental
      chemotherapy combination before surgery can help to shrink or slow the growth of tumors
      before they are removed through surgery. The safety of this combination will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      About 1 week before Cycle 1, if you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you
      will receive a single dose of panitumumab by vein over about 1 hour.

      You will then receive the study drug combination for 4 cycles. Each cycle is 21 days.

      On Day 1 of each Cycle, you will receive panitumumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel by vein.
      Panitumumab will be given over 30-60 minutes, paclitaxel over about 2 hours, and carboplatin
      over about 2 hours.

      On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle, you will receive panitumumab and paclitaxel by vein following
      the same timing as Day 1.

      If you have side effects, the study doctor may decide to lower the study drug dose(s) or to
      have you stop taking the drug(s). You may be able to restart the study drug(s) later at the
      same or a lower dose. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Study Visits:

      About 1 week before Cycle 1, the same day that you receive the single dose of Panitumumab,
      you will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing
      measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.

      About 1 week after the first panitumumab dose, you will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons)
      for PK testing.

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 21 (+/- 1 day) of Cycle 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing.

      Surgery:

      After you have received 4 cycles of chemotherapy, or at any time that the disease appears to
      get worse, you will have an MRI, mammogram, or ultrasound to check the status of the disease.
      Based on the scans, the doctor will decide the type of surgery that you will have to remove
      the tumors.You will be given a separate surgery consent form that describes the procedure and
      its risks. If you come off study, you may be offered chemotherapy, more surgery, or another
      option.

      At the time of your surgery, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over at least 2 years after surgery.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3-4 months, the study team will track your standard of care physical exam visits.

      This is an investigational study. Paclitaxel and carboplatin are FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer. Panitumumab is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of colorectal cancer. It is currently being used for
      research purposes only in the breast cancer setting. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 37 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
