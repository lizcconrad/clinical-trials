  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the implementation of
      collaborative pharmaceutical care on drug support at admission for patients 65 years of age
      and older.

      This is a cluster-randomized study with a stepped-wedge design. Clusters correspond to
      participating centers. A randomly selected center is crossed-over into the intervention every
      fifteen days after the start of inclusions.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate:

      A. The potential and observed clinical impact of the implementation of collaborative
      pharmaceutical care.

      B. The acceptance rate of pharmaceutical interventions during collaborative pharmaceutical
      care.

      C. Avoidable costs related to the consumption of care generated by the occurrence of serious
      adverse drug reactions.

      D. The satisfaction of health professionals concerning the transfer of information on the
      patient's drug therapy carried out as part of collaborative pharmaceutical care.
