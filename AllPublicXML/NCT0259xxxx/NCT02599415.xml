  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the effect of TL01 narrow band UVB therapy on the
      resident dermal dendritic cells characterized by expression of CD1c and CD141. These cells
      were reported to have a role in induction of tolerogenic regulatory T cells and production of
      IL-10. The investigators proposed to investigate the effect of NB-UVB on these subsets of
      cells after two weeks of treatment to provide better understanding of the mechanism of action
      of light treatment.

    <textblock>
      Six patients with plaque psoriasis were recruited from the phototherapy unit. These patients
      were referred by their dermatologist to receive narrow-band UVB (TL01) light treatment. Two 6
      mm lesional skin punch biopsies were taken at baseline and 2 weeks after commencing the light
      treatment to study the effect of light on innate immune cells involved in psoriasis
      pathogenesis.
