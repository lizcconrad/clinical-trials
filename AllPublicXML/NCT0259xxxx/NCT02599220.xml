      This study examines the clinical outcomes and healthcare costs associated with gram negative
      bacteremia at Duke University Medical Center from 2002-2015.

      Specific Aim 1: Define the clinical impact of gram negative bacterial (GNB) bloodstream
      infections (BSI). In this objective, the investigators will describe the prevalence, source
      of bacteremia, and location of acquisition (i.e., community-acquired, healthcare-associated,
      hospital-acquired) of GNB BSI. The investigators will also examine the outcomes associated
      with GNB BSI including length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, in-house mortality, and
      hospital costs.

      Specific Aim 2: Describe antibiotic resistance patterns in GNB BSI, and explore associations
      between antibiotic resistance and clinical and economic outcomes. In this objective, the
      investigators will describe the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of
      multidrug resistant phenotypes including MDR bacteria, which are defined by resistance to
      three or more drug classes, ESBL-producers, and CRE. The investigators will examine the
      differences in mortality, resource use (length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay), and
      direct medical costs between cases with and without antibiotic resistance.

        The Duke Bloodstream Infection Biorepository (BSIB) contains prospectively collected
        clinical data on ~2000 unique inpatients at Duke with monomicrobial gram negative bacteria
        bloodstream infections.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Since January 2002, one investigator (VGF) has received daily reports from the clinical
        microbiology laboratory on all hospitalized patients at Duke University Medical Center with
        one or more blood culture(s) positive for gram negative rods. Patients were then evaluated
        within 36 hours of the detection of bacteremia for clinical evidence of infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients were excluded from the study for the following reasons: age less than 18 years,
        polymicrobial infection (blood culture positive for more than one pathogen), neutropenia
        (white blood cell count less than 1.0 x 109/L), or death prior to the return of positive
        blood cultures. In order to preserve the independence of observations, only the initial
        episode of gram negative bacteremia was included in the analysis (e.g., patients were only
        included once). The study was approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional
        Review Board.
