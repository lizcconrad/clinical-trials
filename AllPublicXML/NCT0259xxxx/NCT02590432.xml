  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the potential of linaclotide treatment to
      induce the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The secondary objectives are to
      provide additional evidence supporting the long-term safety and efficacy of linaclotide in
      adult irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation
      (CIC) patients and to evaluate lower doses of linaclotide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes up to a 3-week Screening Period, followed by a 52-week treatment period.
      Patients with CIC meeting the entry criteria will receive linaclotide 145-ug capsules,
      orally, once daily and patients with IBS-C meeting the entry criteria will receive
      linaclotide 290-ug capsules, orally, once daily.

          -  Patient has any protocol excluded or clinically significant medical or surgical
             history that would limit the patient's ability to complete or participate in this
             clinical trial or could confound the study assessments.

          -  Patient has ever received linaclotide as a treatment (including commercially-available
             product) or has been randomized into any clinical study in which linaclotide was a
             treatment. (Patients who enrolled into linaclotide clinical studies conducted prior or
             during this study but failed to be randomized are eligible for the current study).

          -  Patient has ever received plecanatide, SP-333, or has participated in a plecanatide
             clinical study.
