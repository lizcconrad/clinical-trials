  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled interventional study is to determine the effects
      of a high intensity exercise training program on objective sleep measures, daytime
      sleepiness, mobility, and brain health/functional connectivity in patients with Parkinson's
      disease.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary outcome measure is the change in sleep efficiency (the number of minutes asleep
      divided by the number of minutes in bed), as measured by polysomnography. In addition,
      because patients with Parkinson's disease have excessive sleepiness/impaired vigilance
      (alertness) and impaired motor function, and because these might be expected to improve with
      the exercise intervention, this study will also assess vigilance and motor outcomes.
