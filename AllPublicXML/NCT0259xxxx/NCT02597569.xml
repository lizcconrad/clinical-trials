  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cognitive impairments following a stroke are often denied access to inpatient
      rehabilitation, despite evidence of its benefits for them. Patients with cognitive impairment
      who are admitted to inpatient stroke rehabilitation often receive services based on outdated
      impairment-reduction models, rather than recommended function-based approaches. These two
      issues, reduced access to rehabilitation and the knowledge-to-practice gap, both stem from a
      reported lack of skills and knowledge on the part of some stroke rehabilitation teams to
      foster recovery in people with cognitive impairments. To address these issues, the
      investigators will implement and evaluate a multi-faceted, supported, integrated knowledge
      translation initiative, targeted specifically at the inter-professional application of the
      Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP), called CO-OP KT. CO-OP is a
      contemporary, effective, cognitive strategy-based treatment approach. CO-OP KT is a
      combination of the CO-OP Approach with multi-faceted knowledge translation support. Clinical
      staff at participating institutions will receive CO-OP KT training.

      The long-term objective of CO-OP KT is to optimize functional outcomes for individuals with
      stroke and cognitive impairments. Three specific research questions have been posed, one of
      which is the focus of this registration. That sub study relates to patient outcomes following
      the CO-OP KT training initiative and it will be addressed using a non-randomized design with
      historical controls. Patient participants who enroll in the project prior to implementing the
      CO-OP KT training will belong to the historical control group. Patient participants who
      enroll in the project after the CO-OP KT training will belong to the CO-OP KT Exposure group.

      The investigative team will implement and evaluate a multi-faceted, supported, integrated
      knowledge translation initiative called CO-OP KT.

      The long-term objective of CO-OP KT is to optimize functional outcomes for individuals with
      stroke and cognitive impairments. Three specific research questions are posed, one of which
      is the focus of this registration:

      1. Is CO-OP KT associated with changes in activity, participation, and self-efficacy to
      perform daily activities in patients with cognitive impairment following stroke at discharge
      from inpatient rehabilitation and at 1, 3, and 6-month follow-ups? The research question,
      which relates to patient outcomes, will be addressed using a non-randomized design with
      historical controls.

      Recruitment:

      Five inpatient stroke rehabilitation units or combined stroke/neurology units within the
      Toronto Stroke Networks have agreed to participate. It is estimated that the 5 units together
      will have approximately 80 admissions per month. Patients admitted to the inpatient stroke
      unit who have at least some cognitive impairment will be recruited. Cognitive impairment will
      be determined using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Patients with scores lower than
      26 will be included. Based on data from a previously published study, a sample size of 13 per
      group will have 80% power to detect a between-group difference of 9 points on the FIMâ„¢,
      standard deviation of 8. Allowing for 30% attrition from all sources, the investigators will
      recruit 17 participants per group, 34 in total. Based on past experience, the investigators
      expect a consent rate of 1 participant per site per month. Thus, recruitment is highly
      feasible, and will likely be completed in 4 months for each group.

      Data Analysis:

      Descriptive statistics will be compiled for all quantitative data collected. Between- and
      within-group differences on the outcome measures will be examined using repeated measures
      ANOVA for the non-randomized trial of individual patients with historical controls.

    <description>A system of disability measurement that rates the level of a patient's disability on a 7 point scale and indicates how much assistance is required for each.

    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a standardized instrument for eliciting performance issues from the client perspective, and for capturing perceived changes in performance over time.

    <description>The Self-Efficacy Gauge (SEG) was designed to measure an individual's self-efficacy in his or her ability to perform daily occupations that span a range of self-care, productivity, and leisure activities. Participants are asked to rate their confidence in their ability to perform 28 items, each on a 10-point scale, with 1 representing &quot;not confident at all&quot; and 10 representing &quot;completely confident&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a 59-item questionnaire about the perceived impact of stroke on function and everyday life. The SIS evaluates eight domains. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale related to the degree of difficulty the person with stroke is experiencing. The SIS is widely used in stroke intervention studies as an outcome measure and the psychometric properties of the instrument are well-defined.</description>
