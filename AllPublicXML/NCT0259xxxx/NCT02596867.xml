    <textblock>
      This trial is a Phase II study using the &quot;window-of-opportunity&quot; design in which the
      treatment-free window between breast cancer diagnosis and surgical tumor resection is used to
      study the biological effects of the beta blocker propranolol .

      -  Patients will be recruited from the Garbar Breast Care Center and University Medical
           Center following diagnosis of invasive breast cancer by breast biopsy.

        -  The sympatholytic nonselective beta blocker propranolol will be administered to all
           participants in a non-randomized manner at an equal dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day.

        -  Following surgical resection of the tumor , the primary endpoint of this study is
           quantified by comparing the proliferative index of the tumor before propranolol
           administration (quantified using the initial tumor biopsy) and after 3 weeks of
           propranolol (quantified using the surgically resected tumor).

        -  Additional molecular analyses and evaluation of safety and toxicity will also be
           performed to better understand the effects of this treatment on breast cancers and
           patient adherence to the drug.
