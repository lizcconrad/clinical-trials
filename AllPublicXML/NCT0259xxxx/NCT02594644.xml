  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate how varying incubation periods of topical
      aminolevulinic acid after pretreatment with microneedle application can facilitate the
      penetration and efficacy of photodynamic therapy.

    <textblock>
      The current standard of care of photodynamic therapy to treat actinic keratoses includes
      pre-treatment of the area with topical aminolevulinic acid for 1 hour, followed by treatment
      with blue light. In a previous study, the investigators showed pretreatment of microneedles
      enhance penetration of topical aminolevulinic acid as compared to the control group.
