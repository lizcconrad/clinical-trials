               -  Elevated fecal calprotectin at screening (&gt; ULN accepted lab assay)

               -  Endoscopic evidence (colonoscopy or small bowel video capsule endoscopy) of
                  active Crohn's ulcerations within 3 months of baseline or during screening

          4. Taking a stable dose of corticosteroids (oral or anorectal) ≤ 40 mg/day, or
             equivalent, for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline.

          5. Taking a stable dose of 5-ASA, antibiotics, anti-diarrheals, analgesics, and/or

          6. Taking a stable dose of immunosuppressants for at least 8 weeks prior to baseline.

          7. Have screening laboratory test results within the following parameters:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL

               -  WBC count ≥ 3.5 x 103 µL

               -  Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 103 µL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 103 µL

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.7 mg/dL

               -  AST and ALT concentrations must be within 2 times the ULN range for the
                  laboratory conducting the test

          8. Subject has a negative TB Screening Assessment (including a PPD test) and negative
             chest x-ray (posterior-anterior or PA and lateral view) within 2 months prior to
             screening.

          9. If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             (&gt; 45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 18 months) or surgically sterile
             (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or otherwise incapable
             of pregnancy) or is of childbearing potential and is practicing on of the following
             methods of birth control:

               -  Implants, injectables, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), intrauterine hormone
                  releasing system (IUS), hormonal prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive
                  patch, or double barrier method

               -  Male partner sterilization

               -  Not heterosexually active

         10. Negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at
             baseline.

         11. If male, not surgically sterile, and heterosexually active with a woman of child
             bearing potential, subject must agree to use a double barrier method of birth control
             and not donate sperm during the study and for 12 weeks after receiving study agent.

         12. Subject must be able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with
             the requirements of the study protocol.

        Subject Exclusion Criteria

          1. Any and all contraindications to the use of certolizumab pegol including: active or
             latent TB, active viral infection or chronic recurrent infections, evidence of
             dysplasia or history of malignancy, congestive heart failure (CHF), demyelinating
             disease and cytopenia.

          2. Subject who previously received treatment with certolizumab pegol or previously
             participated in a certolizumab pegol study.

          3. Has complications of Crohn's disease such as symptomatic strictures or stenoses, short
             bowel syndrome, or any other manifestation that might be anticipated to require
             surgery, could preclude the use of the HBI to assess response to therapy, or would
             possibly confound the ability to assess the effect of treatment with certolizumab
             pegol.

          4. Subject has had surgical bowel resection(s) within 6 months or any other intra-
             abdominal surgery within 3 months prior to baseline.

          5. Subject with an ostomy or ileoanal pouch.

          6. Subject has received anti-TNF agents &lt; 8 weeks prior to baseline.

          7. Subject has received other immunomodulatory biologic agents, &lt; 8 weeks or within 5
             half-lives of agent prior to baseline, whichever is longer

          8. Subject is known to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C

          9. Subject with positive Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin stool assay during
             the Screening period.

             endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, cerebral, or psychiatric disease, or signs
             and symptoms

         11. Has a known history or lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphoma, or signs and
             symptoms suggestive or possible lymphoproliferative disease, such as lymphadenopathy
             or splenomegaly

         12. History of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse in the 12 months prior to
             baseline.

         13. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant or a
             man who plans to father a child while enrolled in this study or within 20 weeks after
             the last dose of study agent.
