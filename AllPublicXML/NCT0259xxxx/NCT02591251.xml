  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive method used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It
      allows surgeons to take a look on the abdominal and pelvic organs. Diagnostic laparoscopy is
      usually done in an operating room under general anesthesia. The procedure takes about 25
      minutes and the patients usually discharged in the same day. The laparoscopy can diagnose
      pelvic pathological conditions in approximately 50% of the cases. However, the laparoscopy
      has some complications, such as infections, hemorrhage and injuries of visceral organs.

      A preoperative vaginal preparation is important to prevent the bacteria colonization in a
      trial to avoid postoperative infection after laparoscopic surgery. The povidone-iodine (PI)
      is normally used as a skin and vaginal disinfectant to prevent postoperative infections,
      however; it can be the cause of significant postoperative irritation.

      There are many reports in the literature proved that the mechanical cleansing of the vagina,
      not the use of an antiseptic solution, is responsible for the efficacy of vaginal
      preparations. In the field of assisted reproductive technology; A study in 1992 concluded
      that the infection rates with normal saline solution are comparable to PI.

      Another proved that, a normal saline solution can be effective in prevention of preventing
      postoperative infections after vaginal surgery.

      The most recent study by Lewis et al has been shown that the Baby shampoo is preferable than
      PI in vaginal cleansing before gynecologic procedures because it has minimal vaginal
      irritation and cheaper than PI.

      So the optimal vaginal antiseptic solution is unknown, the investigators want to conduct a
      randomized trial comparing 2 commonly used vaginal antiseptic solutions: PI and the saline
      solution before the laparoscopic surgery.

      The normal saline is used in medicine as an intravenous isotonic infusion and for cleaning
      wounds. It is a mild but effective cleaning agent and will not harm normal tissue, unlike
      many stronger antiseptics. It is available and inexpensive in comparison to povidone iodine.
