  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances for the treatment of post-menopausal hormone receptor-positive BC, in
      the last decade there was no major improvement of hormonal therapy specifically for
      premenopausal metastatic breast cancer. The median age of breast cancer is much younger, and
      the proportion of young breast cancer (YBC) patients (less than 40) including premenopausal
      women is much higher, in Asia, including Korea.

      Capecitabine, the comparator in this trial, is an orally-administered fluoropyrimidine
      derivative and has shown high efficacy and low toxicity in metastatic breast cancer patients.
      Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitors, in combination with endocrine therapy showed marked
      advance in hormone receptor-positive MBC in the post-menopausal setting. After a median
      follow-up of 16.5 months, preliminary results from Part 1 of this Phase 2 trial suggest that
      the combination of PD-0332991 with letrozole is superior to letrozole alone, and improved
      objective response and disease control rates (52% vs 32% and 76% vs 47%, respectively) in
      patients treated with the combination. These remarkable results may contribute to have much
      benefit with endocrine therapy for premenopausal women. Most importantly, recent PALOMA-3
      trial revealed superior results of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant (median PFS 9.2 vs 3.8
      months, P&lt;0.001).

      Based on these rational backgrounds, the purpose of this phase II study is to assess the
      safety and the clinical anti-tumor activity of exemestane plus goserelin acetate in
      combination with palbociclib vs capecitabine in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive
      advanced breast cancer patients
