  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study, which will examine the effect of secukinumab on the
      immunologic and genetic environment within psoriatic lesions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quantitative analysis of the immunologic changes in immune cell populations will be performed
      after secukinumab treatment in 15 patients at weeks 2, 4, and 12 compared to baseline week 0.
      The immunologic profiles in psoriasis patients will also be compared to healthy control skin
      surgical discard specimens (n=10). The number of differentially expressed genes in each cell
      population will be quantified by RNA-seq at weeks 2, 4, 12 after secukinumab compared to
      baseline.

             test (QFT) with a positive chest X-ray at screening, or untreated latent tuberculosis
             defined by positive QFT with a negative chest X-ray without prophylactic therapy with
             isoniazid for a course of 9 months with one month of therapy completed prior to first
             dose of secukinumab.

         10. History of an ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease including past medical
             history record of HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

         11. Subjects possess other diagnoses that, in the investigator's opinion, preclude him/her
             from safely participating in this study or interfere with the evaluation of the
             subject's psoriasis.
