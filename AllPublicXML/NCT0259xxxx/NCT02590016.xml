    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with gestational diabetes who are treated with insulin and their daily insulin
      dose is 30 IU or more will be randomized into two groups. Active treatment group will recieve
      insulin-glucose-infusion during labour. In the observational group, blood glucose level
      during labour will be monitored and insulin-glucose-infusion is started only if needed. The
      hypothesis is that there will not be a difference in rate of hypoglycemia between the two
      groups and that the proportion of observational group participants that need infusion is low.

    <textblock>
      Intrapartum blood glucose level has negative correlation to neonatal blood glucose level in
      type 1 diabetics. In gestational diabetes the correlation is less clear. In the view of
      current knowledge, it seems that moderately elevated intrapartum blood glucose may not cause
      neonatal hypoglycemia. There is no consensus of how to treat intrapartum blood glucose level
      in gestational diabetics. Some studies have implied that most of mothers with gestational
      diabetes would have normal blood glucose level during labour and hence would not need any
      intervention if their daily insulin dosage is less than 0,5-1 IU/kg.

      Study participants are recruited into the study at Tampere University Hospital Maternity Ward
      when their daily insulin dose exceeds 30 IU. Randomization is done at 37th gestational week,
      if vaginal delivery is planned, and HbA1c is measured. Randomization envelope is opened at
      the delivery ward when active labour begins and treatment of blood glucose level is carried
      out accordingly. If insulin dose is 1 IU/kg or more, the participant is treated as in active
      treament group despite of result of randomization. All neonates will recieve milk substitute
      after birth in labour ward. Plasma glucose is measured immediately if neonate has symptoms of
      low blood sugar. If not, plasma glucose is measured approximately two hours after birth and
      after that every 4 hours until plasma glucose is 3,0 mmol/l or more in three consecutive
      measurements.

    <description>Insulin aspart Novorapid® Penfill 40 IU/0,4 ml is diluted into 1000ml of 0,9 % sodium chloride (NaCl). Infusion is started at rate 48 ml/l, which equates insulin dosing at rate of 2 IU/h. Glucose infusion is started simultaneously. 5 ml of potassium chloride (KCl) is added to 500 ml of 10 % Glucose solution. Infusion rate is 100 ml/h giving glucose infusion rate of 10 g/l. Plasma glucose level is measured every 1-2 hours and infusion rate of insulin is increased by 6ml/h if plasma glucose is more than 7,5 mmol/l and decreased by 6 mmol/h if plasma glucose is below 4 mmol/l.</description>
