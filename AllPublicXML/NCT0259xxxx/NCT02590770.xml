  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving gaze-contingent feedback is an
      effective attention modification procedure, helping in the treatment of social anxiety
      disorder (SAD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study examines giving social anxious participants gaze-contingent feedback as a novel
      attention training procedure. Half of the participants will receive contingent feedback while
      the other half would receive non-contingent &quot;placebo&quot; feedback.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline - the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale - Diagnostic Interview scores</measure>
    <time_frame>post treatment (1 week after treatment completion) and 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The LSAS is a 24-item scale, each item corresponding to a situation selected on the basis of clinical experience. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3 with regard to the passing week, measuring separately two components of social anxiety, specifically, fear/anxiety and avoidance of social interaction and performance situations. Although the assessor may request and ask for further detail and adjust the rating based on clinical experience, this option is not often exercised, and inter-rater agreement is not considered to be a relevant concern. It has been shown to have strong psychometric properties, including high internal consistency, strong convergent and discriminative validity and high test-retest reliability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline - the Social Phobia Inventory scores</measure>
    <time_frame>post treatment (1 week after treatment completion) and 3-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 17-item self-report measure of social anxiety evaluating fear, avoidance and physiological discomfort. Each item is rated on scale ranging from 0 to 4 with a possible total score of 68. The SPIN has been used in clinical and nonclinical samples and its psychometric properties have been found to be sound.</description>

    <measure>changes in the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>post treatment (1 week after treatment completion)</time_frame>
    <description>a structured diagnostic interview for DSM - IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders, which takes approximately 20 min to administer and is a valid and time-efficient alternative to the SCID-P and CIDI.</description>
