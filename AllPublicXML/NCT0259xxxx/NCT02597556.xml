  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cheap and effective drugs called 'anthelmintics' are routinely administered to children in
      developing countries to eliminate infections by parasitic helminths. However, the effects of
      anthelmintic treatment on other pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, protozoa) remain unknown.
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of anthelmintic treatment on the incidence
      of viral- and bacterial-induced diarrhea in school children in southern Vietnam. Diarrheal
      disease remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in children in Vietnam, and
      these children are typically co-infected with intestinal helminths. As helminths and
      diarrheal pathogens infect the same intestinal niche, anthelmintic treatments may alter host
      immune responses and the composition of the gut microbiota in ways that affect infection and
      disease risks caused by diarrheal pathogens.

      This study will recruit 350 helminth-infected and 350 helminth-uninfected children aged 6-15
      years. Recruited children will be randomized to receive either anthelmintic or placebo
      treatment once every three months and will be monitored for incidences of diarrheal disease
      for 12 months. At the 12-month time point, all children will receive anthelmintic treatment.
      Blood and stool samples will be collected throughout the study and used for evaluation of
      anemia and host immune responses, and for classification of gut microbes and parasite
      detection, respectively. The interventional study proposed here will provide an important
      first test of whether anthelmintic treatments have any indirect effects on infections caused
      by diarrheal pathogens.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of
      400 mg albendazole treatment against placebo on the incidence of diarrheal disease caused by
      viral and bacterial pathogens in school children in southern Vietnam. Children will be
      enrolled from three primary schools in Cu Chi district in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Children
      will be screened for infections by the four most common soil-transmitted helminths, Ascaris
      lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Necator americanus, and Ancylostoma duodenale. Infected
      and uninfected individuals will be recruited into the study and randomized to either receive
      albendazole treatment once every three months for 12 months, or to placebo once every three
      months for 9 months, after which albendazole treatment will be given at month 12, in
      accordance with the current deworming schedule in Cu Chi district. A questionnaire regarding
      the participant's demographics, his/her daily habits, and potential sources of infection will
      be administered at baseline. Weekly active and passive surveillance of diarrheal cases will
      be conducted throughout the study, and a health questionnaire will be administered during all
      cases of diarrhea and at the end of the study.
