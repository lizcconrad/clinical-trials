  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if oxaloacetate (OAA) is safe and tolerable at
      doses of up to 2 grams per day in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that causes memory and thinking
      problems. The exact cause of AD is unknown. Researchers believe mitochondria (the part of
      your cells that produce energy) might be linked to symptoms of AD. Some studies have shown
      that the brains in patients with Alzheimer's disease have reduced mitochondrial activity,
      have fewer mitochondria present in the nerve cells, and have reduced ability to utilize
      glucose (sugar) for energy.

      Oxaloacetate (OAA) is a natural chemical that has been shown to have an effect on brain
      mitochondrial activity and brain energy in non-human animals.

      This study is divided into two parts. In the first part of the study, researchers will test
      whether a dose of 1 gram per day of OAA, taken for approximately 4 weeks in 15 people with AD
      is safe and tolerable. After all 15 participants in part 1 have completed their
      participation, and it is determined that the study drug was safe at this dose, the second
      part of the study will begin. In part 2, researchers will test a dose of 2 grams per day of
      OAA, taken for approximately 4 weeks in 15 people with AD, to assess safety at this dose.

      Participants will be in this study for about 10 weeks.
