    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a phase-II proof of concept trial to investigate if a treatment
      strategy where stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is given with pembrolizumab is
      sufficiently active to warrant further investigation in randomized phase II or III studies.
      Metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) patients with PD-1 expressing immune cells are more
      likely to have larger more aggressive tumours and reduced survival and renal tumours that
      express PD-L1 are more aggressive with poorer outcome. Blocking this receptor/ligand
      interaction with monoclonal antibodies can restore the activity of tumour specific T-cells
      within the tumour with durable responses documented in early clinical trials in several
      tumour types including renal cell carcinoma. The study drug pembrolizumab is designed to
      directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. SBRT will be
      given to the 1-3 most clinically significant lesions at the time of progression on
      pembrolizumab or at the 2nd course of pembrolizumab treatment in an effort to improve the
      activity of pembrolizumab. A total of 35 patients refractory to the approved first line
      therapy with a targeted drug (Sunitinib or Pazopanib) or untreated RCC patients with
      sarcomatoid differentiation will be enrolled on study. This group of patient has a poor
      outcome on any other 2nd line therapy and urgently need novel therapy.

      A phase II proof of concept, multi-centre, safety and efficacy study with a biomarker
      component to investigate if a treatment strategy where stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) is given with pembrolizumab is sufficiently active to warrant further investigation in
      randomized phase II or III studies. The study will run for approximately 3 years, including 2
      year of recruitment and 1 year of follow up. There will be two study arms. Enrollment of 15
      patients into arm A will occur before the start of enrollment of the next 20 patients on arm
      B.

      In arm A, pembrolizumab will be started and SBRT will be given to the 1-3 most clinically
      significant lesions only at the time of progression on pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab will be
      continued after progression to detect if the addition of SBRT leads to stability or response
      in progressing lesions. After SBRT, untreated measurable disease must remain to assess the
      activity of continued pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab and SBRT will continue until progression
      as per immune related response criteria (irRC). This cohort of patients will allow us to more
      clearly understand if SBRT does play a part in improving progression free survival when given
      in combination with pembrolizumab.

      In arm B, pembrolizumab will be started and SBRT given before the 2nd course of pembrolizumab
      to the 1-3 most clinically significant lesions. After SBRT, untreated measurable disease must
      remain to assess the activity of pembrolizumab. The value of a treatment strategy that
      combines pembrolizumab and SBRT up-front is evaluated in this arm. Giving SBRT early to the
      most clinically significant cancer lesions may give pembrolizumab more time to work and may
      improve response by generating neo-antigens.

      Patients will remain on study until progression as per irRC, withdrawal of consent or if they
      meet any of the premature withdrawal/discontinuation criteria.
