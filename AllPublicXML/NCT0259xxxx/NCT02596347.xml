  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current studies suggest that alveolar macrophages (AM) act as silencers of most immune
      responses in the lung. However, in pathological conditions, such as asthma, hypersensitivity
      pneumonitis, and sarcoidosis, AMs become involved in the maintenance and further expansion of
      the immune response in the target organ. The Investigator has preliminary data demonstrating
      that CBD AMs at the site of disease involvement (bronchoalveolar lavage, BAL) display an
      activated cell surface phenotype compared to AMs from healthy controls. Furthermore, exciting
      data from our group demonstrates significant differences in gene expression profiles between
      CBD and Beryllium Sensitivity (BeS) bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) cells, in pivotal immune
      response genes and networks. Specifically, the Investigator has found the JAK/STAT pathway
      and the JAK2 gene was dramatically overexpressed in CBD BAL cells. In addition,
      constitutively phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2) was found in AMs from Chronic Beryllium Disease
      (CBD) patients by Westernblot and was increased after beryllium (Be) stimulation for 30 min.
      Moreover, the JAK2 inhibitor TG101348 significantly inhibited Be-induced CBD AMs TNFa and
      IFNy production. Meanwhile, overexpression of the JAK2 inhibitor SOCS 1 (suppressors of
      cytokine signaling) protein decreased Be-induced TNFa production from AMs. Based on this
      information, the Investigator hypothesizes that CBD AMs overexpress JAK2, which augments the
      immune response to Be and development of CBD but not BeS.

      The investigators believe that these studies are highly innovative since they will
      undoubtedly shed light on exposure-mediated immune dysregulation in Alveolar Macrophages
      (AMs) that lead to disease development and likely progression and with additional study of
      this pathway will reveal potential biomarkers for clinical prognosis and diagnosis. The
      results obtained from this study will improve the investigators understanding of factors
      involved in the development of Chronic Beryllium disease (CBD), as well as define targets for
      therapy, and will serve as a model of other exposure-related immune responses and
      environmentally-induced chronic diseases. Most importantly, these studies will provide the
      investigator with preliminary data to submit a high quality R01, allowing the Investigator to
      apply similar approaches to other genes, define a potential target for this and other similar
      immune-mediated diseases and continue research efforts at National Jewish Health (NJH.)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome for the aims is the downregulation of Th1 cytokine TNFalpha with the inhibition of the JAK2 using siRNA and the inhibitor INCB018424, CEP-701 and TG101348 in CBD or overexpression of the JAK2 gene.</measure>
    <time_frame>year 1</time_frame>
    <description>As the primary outcome is the downregulation of TNFalpha level with the inhibition of the JAK2 using the inhibitor TG101348 in CBD, we expect a 50% reduction with a standard deviation of 0.2 based on our preliminary data. We will have more than 95% power with n=6 CBD patients for these aims.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcomes for the aims are the changes in BeLPT and AMs phenotype from BeS, CBD and Healthy controls (HC).</measure>
    <time_frame>year 2</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will use repeated measure Welch's ANOVA in SAS 9.4, which correctly accounts for the correlation between measurements and allows for comparisons within and between groups. Normalizing transformations will be performed when necessary to conform to model assumptions and Mauchly's sphericity test will be assessed and adjustments will be added to the analysis as necessary. Estimate and contrast statements will be developed to test hypotheses of interest.</description>
