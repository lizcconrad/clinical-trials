  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children, adolescents and young adults with relapsed or treatment refractory pineoblastoma
      (rPB) represent a group of patients with dismal prognosis for whom a recommended standard
      salvage therapy is currently not available.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multimodal metronomic approach combining molecular targeted drugs (rapamycin and
      dasatinib) with conventional chemotherapy (irinotecan and temozolomide) will be investigated
      in a randomized fashion as new treatment strategy for patients with rPB. The intention is to
      assess the therapeutic benefit of molecular targeted drugs for the treatment of rPB.

      The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide showed activity in the treatment of several
      solid organ tumors, brain tumors and neuroblastoma. In one study relapsed neuroblastoma (rNB)
      patients received a median of 5 courses of 5 days irinotecan and temozolomide every 3 to 4
      weeks with a cumulative dose of 35% lower than in the RIST design. 33% had disease regression
      with 8% CR or PR. A phase II study in rNB also using irinotecan and temozolomide with a
      substantially lower intensity showed a response rate of 15%.

      The combination of a mTOR inhibitor with a multi-kinase inhibitor demonstrated in preclinical
      studies a synergistic effect on cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and sensitization for radio- and
      chemotherapy. It is assumed that this combination of molecular targeted drugs with a
      tolerable conventional chemotherapy consisting of irinotecan and temozolomide can
      substantially improve the outcome of this patient population. A group of 20 rNB patients
      treated with the RIST therapy approach in a compassionate use setting showed an overall
      survival of 55% at a median of 80 weeks with a tolerable adverse event profile.
