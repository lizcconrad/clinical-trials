    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric randomized parallel group open trial comparing 5-year survival of
      chemotherapy followed by LT (Group LT+C) versus chemotherapy alone (Group C) in patients with
      confirmed unresectable liver-only metastases, well controlled by chemotherapy (no
      progression) and extensively explored by modern imaging techniques. The primary objective of
      the trial is to validate in a large multicentric cohort of selected patients the possibility
      to obtain at least 50% 5-years survival with LT combined to chemotherapy compared to around
      10% with chemotherapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) has recently been proposed as alternative treatment for
      definitively unresectable colorectal liver metastases in selected patients with a 60%
      estimated survival at 5 years in a recent prospective Norwegian study. However, disease free
      survival (DFS) in this preliminary study has been poor with 90% of recurrence after LT.

      The objective of our study is to validate LT as a therapeutic option on a large multicentric
      scale throughout a highly strict policy selection in term of survival, disease free survival
      and quality of life. In order to reduce selection bias, unresectability criteria and
      theorical indication to LT will be confirmed by an independent Steering Committee including
      HPB surgeons, oncologists, radiologists and hepatologists.
