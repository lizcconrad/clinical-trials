    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if the investigators can use only the cytosponge ( A 10
      minute, in office procedure that does not require sedation) to replace the 6-10 endoscopies
      routinely perform during dietary restriction and food reintroduction in EoE?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary Therapy has been shown to be successful in the treatment of adult and pediatric
      patients with eosinophilic esophagitis Dietary studies were initially reported in children,
      but the results appear to be similar in adult patients. Elemental diets are successful in
      70-95% of patients but are poorly tolerated. A six food elimination diet has been effective
      in about 70% of adult patients with EoE . In these adult studies skin prick testing was not
      helpful in predicting which foods would lead to a flare of disease when reintroduced into the
      diet. Therefore, the current standard of care requires multiple EGDs with esophageal biopsy
      during the dietary restriction and reintroduction phases of this study. Since the
      investigators are making lifelong dietary decisions during this process of food
      reintroduction, it is imperative the investigators be accurate. Unfortunately, these multiple
      EGDs have significant cost and are invasive procedures with some risk. Moreover, there is
      significant indirect costs with travel and time off work for the patients and drivers.
      Previous studies have found the esophageal sponge to be an accurate technique of accessing
      esophageal eosinophilia in EoE . The sponge is swallowed as a 12 mm capsule on a string. The
      capsule rapidly dissolves upon entering the stomach and the sponge then expands and can be
      pulled out the mouth five minutes after ingestion. In previous studies, the procedure was
      very well tolerated and all patients preferred the sponge to endoscopy.

      Therefore the sponge is a well tolerated, inexpensive, very low risk procedure that would be
      an ideal option to replace EGD esophageal sampling in the evaluation of dietary treatment of
      EoE.

    <description>The EEsAI Pro uses the VDQ is visual dysphagia question AMS is avoidance, modification, slow eating question . These two along with questions on frequency of, duration of, pain associated with dysphagia make up the PRO (patient reported outcomes). The PRO is a number (0-100) calculated from the answer to the questions. A PRO &lt; 20 defines asymptomatic EoE</description>

    <description>Patients going through the six food elimination diet (clinically)for EoE, will be asked to participate. We will introduce 1 of the 6 foods previously eliminated for two weeks, than another for two weeks, at the end of 4 weeks the participant will return to swallow the cytosponge to monitor them through the diet, rather than multiple repeat Upper Endoscopies. The cytosponge is a 10 minute procedure done in the office. This will be sent for histology, &lt;15 phf would be considered a responder. Results of the histology will help the investigator to direct the diet, which foods to add or take out of the diet.</description>
