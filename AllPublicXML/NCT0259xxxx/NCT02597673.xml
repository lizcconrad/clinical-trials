  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to compare the three home-managed treatment regimens
      for PFPS: neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS), and NMES combined with TENS to a standard home exercise program (HEP).
      Each of the three treatment arms will be supplemented by HEP and compared to a group
      receiving standard HEP alone. The central hypothesis is that the combination of NMES with
      TENS will show significantly greater improvements in muscle strength, mobility, pain, daily
      activity and quality of life (QOL) than HEP alone.

      The investigators are examining: 1) whether the three treatment regimens are significantly
      more efficacious than standard HEP alone in improving lower extremity muscle strength,
      physical activity, mobility, pain, and quality of life; 2) lower extremity muscle strength,
      physical activity, mobility, pain, and quality of life differ significantly across the 4 time
      periods; 3) is there an interaction between treatment and time in relation to lower extremity
      muscle strength, physical activity, mobility, pain, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common diagnosis among active duty military
      presenting with knee pain in the military ambulatory care setting. The incidence of PFPS has
      shown a striking increase of &gt;11.3% over the last 4 years, affecting work performance,
      limiting activity, and impacting military deployment health. The investigators have shown
      that home-based neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is safe, portable, easy-to-use
      and improves quadriceps muscle strength with some pain relief. NMES and transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) devices are widely used by warfighters in the theatre of
      operation for knee problems. The overall objective of this project is to compare three
      home-managed treatment regimens for PFPS: NMES, TENS, and NMES combined with TENS to a
      standard home exercise program (HEP). The central hypothesis is that the combination of NMES
      with TENS will show significantly greater improvements in muscle strength, mobility, pain,
      daily activity and quality of life (QOL) than HEP alone. The rationale for this study is that
      increasing muscle strength and decreasing pain will significantly improve mobility, physical
      activity and QOL. Such outcomes will ultimately result in improved deployability, retention
      of military personnel and decreased economic costs in this population. The specific aims are
      to determine whether the three treatment regimens are significantly more efficacious than
      standard HEP for improving muscle strength, physical activity, mobility, QOL and symptoms of
      PFPS including pain. After consent and baseline testing, the investigators will randomly
      assign active duty male and female subjects, ages 18 to &lt;45, (n=136) with PFPS to one of the
      four groups. Each of the three treatment arms will be supplemented by HEP and compared to a
      group receiving standard HEP alone. All groups will receive 9 weeks of home therapy. Using
      GEE methods, the investigators will build longitudinal regression models so that differences
      in time trends for the outcome variables among controls and those in the treatment groups can
      be statistically assessed. Positive results could translate into accelerated rehabilitation,
      decreased symptoms and lower medical costs with better patient outcomes.

    <time_frame>0, 3, 6, 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NMT is a handheld device which measures knee extensor (KE) and flexor (KF) muscle strength. Three locations (per limb) for the strength measurement will be taken using the MMT. For each test, participants will perform three maximal efforts holding each contraction for 4 seconds, separated by 30-second rest; the highest value of the three trials will be accepted in kilograms.</description>

    <time_frame>0, 3, 6, 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The KAKPS is a 13-item knee specific self-report questionnaire. Scores range from 0-100 (higher scores indicate better performance). Change in baseline symptoms is assessed as the change in score.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline symptoms of PFPS at 3, 6, and 9 weeks as measured by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3, 6, 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC subjective knee form is a a well standardized outcomes questionnaire that is knee-specific and assesses patients with various knee disorders. The 18-item instrument assesses symptoms, function and level of sports participation for those with an injured knee. Higher scores indicate higher functioning and reduced symptoms. Change in symptoms is assessed as the change in score.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline symptoms of PFPS at 3, 6, and 9 weeks as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3, 6, 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS pain scale will be used to assess pain at rest and after activity. . Participants will complete this scale following the stair climb, step down test, 6-minute walk and the chair rise test. This VAS pain subscale is a 100-mm horizontal line index with descriptive anchors at each end. At the far left (0.0 cm) is &quot;no pain&quot; and at the far right (10 cm) is &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. The participant is instructed to place a vertical line at some point between the anchors to describe his/her level of pain. The VAS pain scale shows high correlations with acute pain levels. Change in symptoms is assessed as the change in reported pain level.</description>

    <time_frame>0, 3, 6, 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 multidimensional scale has two summary scores for physical and mental health as well as eight subscale scores. Each subscale score is transformed into a 0-100 score, with a higher score corresponding with less disability. Change in QOL is assessed as the change in score.</description>

    <description>The CES-D has 20 questions measuring symptoms of depression in 9 areas. Possible scores range from 0-60. Categorization of results ranges from No clinical significance (&lt;16 total score) to Meets Criteria for Major Depressive Episode (depends on responses to specific categories). Change in QOL is assessed as change in score.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive a standard home-based exercise rehabilitation protocol for PFPS. HEP teaches muscle strengthening exercises and self-management strategies to prevent recurrence. The HEP sessions provide the participant with a self-management framework for returning to duty following PFPS rehabilitation. The exercises are quadriceps strengthening exercises. These exercises consist of stretching exercises of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles and a combination of open chain and closed chain exercises. The combined open and closed chain exercises are active straight leg raises, quadriceps straightening, step up, and squats.</description>

    <description>To ensure consistent interventions across participants, a specified percentage of baseline maximal voluntary contraction (% MVC) will be used to determine the intensity of the training contraction. The electrical amplitude to obtain the desired intensity will be determined for each participant. Participants will train at 20-30% of MVC during weeks 1-3, 30-40% of MVC during weeks 3-6, and 40-50% of MVC during weeks 6-9. Incremental increases will be made at the 3 and 6 week clinic visits. Individualized instructions for adjusting the amplitude dial settings, with a return demonstration, will be used to maintain the appropriate percentage of MVC. During the home training sessions, participants will adjust the amplitude required to achieve the desired goal, as tolerated.</description>
