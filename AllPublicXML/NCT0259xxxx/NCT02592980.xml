      Background: Time in therapeutic range (TTR) is a measurement of quality of warfarin therapy
      and lower TTR values (&lt;50%) are associated with greater risk of thromboembolic and bleeding
      events. Recently, the investigators developed a pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing
      algorithm specifically calibrated for a Brazilian patient sample. The newly developed
      algorithm was shown to be more accurate for individuals from the Brazilian population than
      algorithms developed from international samples. The aims of this study are: to evaluate the
      impact of a genetic-based algorithm, compared to traditional anticoagulation, in the time to
      achieve the therapeutic target and in TTR percentage; and to assess the cost-effectiveness of
      genotype-guided warfarin dosing in a specific cohort of patients with low TTR (&lt;50%) from a
      tertiary cardiovascular hospital. Methods/Design: The investigators will recruit 300 patients
      with TTR&lt;50% based on the last three INR values. At the first consultation, patients will be
      randomized into two groups: TA (Traditional Anticoagulation) group and PA (Pharmacogenetic
      Anticoagulation) group. For the first group, the physician will adjust the dose according to
      current INR value and, for the second group, a pharmacogenetic algorithm will be used. At the
      second, third, fourth and fifth consultations (with an interval of 7 days each) INR will be
      measured and, if necessary, the dose will be adjusted based on guidelines. Afterwards,
      patients who are INR stable will begin measuring their INR in 30 day intervals; if the
      patient´s INR is not stable, the patient will return in 7 days for a new measurement of the
      INR. The main outcomes will be the time to achieve the therapeutic target and the percentage
      of TTR at 4 and 12 weeks. In addition, as a secondary end-point, pharmacoeconomic analysis
      will be carried out. Discussion: With a sample size of 150 patients for each arm separately,
      the study will have a power of 93% to observe a difference of 10% between TTR means of the TA
      and PA groups. This randomized study will include patients with low TTR and it will evaluate
      whether a population-specific genetic algorithm might be more effective than traditional
      anticoagulation for a selected group of poorly anticoagulated patients.

      Investigators will recruit 300 patients with low TTR (&lt;50%) from the Heart Institute-
      Clinical Hospital- University of São Paulo Medical School (InCor- HCFMUSP). The patients will
      be randomized into two groups: Traditional Anticoagulation (TA) group and Pharmacogenetic
      Anticoagulation (PA) group. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for
      Medical Research on Human Beings of the Clinical Hospital of the University of São Paulo
      Medical School (SDC 4033/14/013). Signed informed consent will be obtained from all
      participants.

      Only patients with atrial fibrillation, above 18 years, and with TTR &lt;50% based on the last
      three values of INR will be included in this study. Patients will not be included if they
      have reached a stable dose of warfarin, liver dysfunction, alcoholism, use of another
      anticoagulant, use of chemotherapy, or if they do not meet the inclusion criteria.

In these cases, the physician will adjust the dose following clinical criteria based on published guidelines</description>
