  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This French multicentre open-label randomized trial will test the hypothesis that a
      coordinated health circuit based on obstetric risks, backed up by an electronic patient care
      reporting information system will optimize the continuum of pregnancy care monitoring. The
      electronic patient care reporting information system will be shared between patients, private
      practice physicians/midwifes, hospital physicians/midwifes and supervised by a coordinating
      midwife.

    <description>The intervention is carried out in 3 steps:
At the start of the pregnancy: a number of process steps are defined for a patient's pathway adapted to medical, obstetric and social risk factors.
During pregnancy: city based doctors and midwives work together with their hospital peers enabling patients to participate through the reporting via a medical information system
The entrance in the delivery room: patients are classified as low or high risk for greater vigilance from midwives.</description>

    <description>At the start of the pregnancy, medical, obstetric and social risk factors are checked in the same way than the PROSPERO group. An adapted patient pathway was defined by a Clinical Research Assistant but unreachable from patients, midwifes and physicians. The electronic patient care reporting information system will be disabled and midwifes cannot create the classification checklist for low or high risk delivery.</description>
