  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Protocol 2, the investigators will determine the role of pancreatic hormones (increase in
      plasma glucagon and decrease in plasma insulin concentration) in the stimulation of EGP
      following SGLT2 inhibition.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inhibition of the renal (kidney) SGLT2 transporter has proven to be an effective
      therapeutic intervention to reduce plasma glucose levels (amount of glucose found in the
      liquid part of blood) and HbA1c.

      In this study, the investigators hope to define the role of increased plasma glucagon,
      decline in plasma insulin, and fall in plasma glucose concentration. The investigators will
      examine whether the signal for the increase in EGP (endogenous glucose production) caused by
      glucosuria (an excess of sugar in the urine, typically associated with diabetes) is mediated
      via the decrease in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, or by the increase in plasma
      glucagon concentration.

    <measure>Change in pancreatic hormones by measurement of baseline and end of study following SGLT2 inhibition over 1 year. - Glucagon (pg/mL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We believe a decrease in peripheral plasma glucose conc plays very little direct or indirect (via stimulation of glucagon secretion and decrease in insulin secretion) role in the glucosuria-induced increase in EGP. Measurement of glucose production under glucose clamp conditions will provide a definitive answer to this question. Thus, we anticipate that the increase in plasma glucagon, decrease in plasma insulin, and increase in EGP will take place despite clamping plasma glucose conc at the fasting level in T2DM subjects. We anticipate that clamping the pancreatic hormones (glucagon and insulin) with somatostatin in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will prevent, in part, the increase in EGP/HGP. We believe that, under these pancreatic clamp conditions, the decrease in plasma glucose conc produced by dapagliflozin will be greater than the decrease observed without the pancreatic clamp.</description>
