  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this Phase II clinical trial is to further evaluate the ability of 18F-FSPG to
      diagnose, prognosticate, and evaluate response to therapy in patients with a wide variety of
      metastatic cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Correlate the uptake of 18F-FSPG in patients with biopsy proven cancer, before and during
      therapy, to evaluate the ability of 18F-FSPG to identify and assess response to therapy,
      correlating to patient outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison of 18F-FSPG accumulation with other available imaging such as PET/CT (including
      but not limited to 18F-FDG, MRI, and diagnostic CT.

      II. Safety and tolerability of 18F-FSPG.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 18F-FSPG and 60 minutes after injection, undergo 18F-FSPG PET/CT once before
      and again once after the start of therapy.
