      The role of impulsivity and its contribution to suicidal behavior seems intuitively clear.
      Empirical results have proved the existence of a relationship between the two yet many
      questions are left unanswered, especially what differentiates suicide ideators from
      attempters.. Obsessive thinking patterns are thought processes which share a repetitive
      behavior domain and are exerted by an inner voice. 3 types of obsessive thinking patterns are
      self destructive thoughts, ruminations and overvalued ideas. Impulsivity and obsessive
      thinking patterns are presumed to have a common mechanism of behaviors which are resulted
      from basal ganglia dysregulation and thus effect inhibition. Novel research in the field of
      decision making could help to learn more about behavioral patterns associated with self harm
      behavior and suicide. Eating Disorders involve suicidal and self harm behavior, which both
      feature impulsivity and obsessive thinking patterns. The investigators study proposes a
      3-step theoretical model which asserts there is a connection between impulsivity, obsessive
      thinking and poor decision making, all effecting self harm behavior. Contemporary research
      has not been able to fully understand the nature of impulsivity and its effect on self harm
      behavior, including eating disorders symptoms, nor addressed the impact of obsessive thinking
      patterns on the latter. 100 female participants with Eating Disorders and suicidal behavior
      will be recruited for the proposed research. Subjects will be given self-report
      questionnaires and computerized behavioral tasks. A one way ANOVA of two eating disorder
      subgroups, impulsive and non impulsive, will be conducted, following a hierarchical multiple
      regression with self harm behavior being the dependent variable.

      Aim of Study impulsivity and its relation to different self harm behaviors, specifically
      suicidal attempts, is an ongoing field of study which has already been widely discussed. Yet
      to this date, the relationship remains unclear and somewhat confusing. Possible explanations
      for this might be due to the fact that impulsivity is an ill-defined concept leading to
      numerous definitions used by different studies and the fact that it has a trait and state
      aspect to it. Clinical experience and theory leads to the assumption that impulsivity plays a
      very important role in suicide. Novel research in the field of decision making could possibly
      lead to a breakthrough in improving assessment and prevention of suicide attempts and
      learning more of this complex relationship.

      The study of obsessive thinking patterns and their contribution to suicide is less prominent.
      In spite of the lack of magnitude in research, when looking at underlying mechanisms it is
      noticeable that both impulsivity and obsessive thinking share common factors and are
      congruent in many ways. Determining more about the nature of different obsessive thinking
      patterns such as self destructive thoughts, rumination and over-valued ideas manifested by an
      inner voice is crucial from two points of view: on one hand learning more about the relation
      between the different patterns, and their mutual and independent effect on self harm
      behavior. On the other hand, observing them as complementing factors to impulsivity which may
      lead to a better understanding of the latter. Studying the interaction between trait
      impulsivity and different obsessive thinking patterns could lead to a better understanding of
      the theoretical gap discussed in the literature review between suicidal ideators and
      attempters.

      Literature has proven that observing behavioral patterns in decision making tasks could serve
      as a better predictor to self harm and suicidal behavior, compared to solely relying on self
      report. The investigators intention is to try and find correlations between the personality
      dimensions of impulsivity and obsessive thinking and specific behavioral patterns indicating
      suicidal and self harm behavior. Understanding more on impulsive and obsessive thinking
      patterns and their effect on self harm behaviors in &quot;real life&quot; situations can raise the
      ecological validity and aid in exporting research conclusions to a clinical setting.

      The investigators research will recruit a population which is known to feature both
      impulsivity and obsessive thinking patterns, such as in Eating Disorders, where their
      co-existence has been proven empirically yet the nature of the interaction is not fully
      understood. Eating disorder individuals are also at higher risk of attempting suicide and
      exhibiting self harm behaviors in general compared to a non clinical population, making it a
      relevant group to the proposed study.

      The investigators propose that impulsive behavior and obsessive thinking patterns have a
      negative effect on performance in decision making situations. When there is a tendency to
      make bad decisions the risk of executing different forms of self harm rises, including
      suicidal behavior and eating disorders.

      Method:

      Participants The investigators will recruit 100 participants from a sample of female
      patients, diagnosed with Eating Disorders and suicidal behavior, admitted to mental health
      departments in general and psychiatric hospitals. Diagnosis will be made by the hospital
      staff. After receiving approval from the medical staff participants will be interviewed,
      handed questionnaires and computerized tasks.

      Procedure Research will consist of two parts: at first investigators will conduct a
      preliminary research on 20 subjects which is intended to decrease questionnaire bandwidth.
      Analysis of items administered and correlations will indicate on unsuitable and congruent
      items which will be removed from research. In the second part of the study 100 female
      participants will be nominated for research. Participants will be briefed about the research
      rationale and procedure and instructed to sign an informed consent (parents of minors will be
      briefed and instructed to sign as well) indicating on their willingness to participate.
      Following this participants will be administered interviews, self report questionnaires and
      computerized tasks by the research team. It will be clarified to participants that
      questionnaires are anonymous and there are no wrong or right answers. Participants that are
      not able to handle research demands due to their physical condition will be interviewed by
      the research team in accordance with the nature of the questionnaire.
