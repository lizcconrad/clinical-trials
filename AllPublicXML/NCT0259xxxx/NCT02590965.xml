    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase II clinical trial
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib plus best supportive care in patients
      with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who failed to second-line standard
      chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized to Fruquintinib plus best supportive care or
      placebo plus best supportive care at a 2:1 ratio.

      Randomization will be stratified by EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene status:
      mutant vs. wild type vs. unknown.

      All subjects will receive Fruquintinib/placebo for consecutive 3 weeks, followed by one-week
      rest. A treatment cycle consists of 4 weeks. Tumor assessment will be performed every 4 weeks
      in the first 3 cycles, and every 8 weeks since the 4th cycle, until disease progression.
      Further treatment and survival follow-up after progression will be recorded.
