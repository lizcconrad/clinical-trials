  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there is a difference in the bile acid content
      in the bowel in patients after right versus left colectomy. There is compelling evidence that
      patients under going resection of the right colon versus left coolon have a lower polyp
      detection rate in surveillance colonoscopies. The investigators intend to evaluate feces of
      patients undergoing left and right colectomies; prior to their surgery and again three and
      six months aftet the surgery. The investigators plan to compare the content of the different
      bile acids and to compare the content between the two groups.
