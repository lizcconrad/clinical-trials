    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well alternative dosing of exemestane before
      surgery works in treating in postmenopausal patients with stage 0-II estrogen positive breast
      cancer. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs to keep breast cancer from forming or coming
      back. The use of exemestane may treat early stage (stage 0-II) breast cancer. Comparing the
      exemestane standard dose regimen versus two alternative, less frequent dose regimens may
      decrease undesirable symptoms and have similar efficacy in reducing serum estradiol.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Non-inferiority of percent change in time of serum estradiol levels, adjusted for baseline
      levels, following four up to six weeks of exemestane 25 mg given three times per week or one
      time per week compared with exemestane 25 mg daily dosing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and toxicity. II. To support the preventive activity of exemestane we
      will investigate the change in Ki-67 and progesterone receptor (PgR) levels in tumor cells
      and the adjacent intraepithelial neoplasia or benign histologic structures.

      III. To assess possible association of estradiol level with tissue and circulating
      biomarkers.

      IV. To investigate possible pharmacogenetic markers. V. To assess drug levels on tissue
      samples. VI. To investigate tissue and circulating proteomics profiling.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7.

      ARM II: Patients receive exemestane PO QD on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients also receive placebo
      PO QD on days 2, 4, 6, and 7.

      ARM III: Patients receive exemestane PO QD on day 1 and placebo PO QD on days 2-7.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 7 days for 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery on days 29, 36, or 43.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 20-30 days.

    <description>Full distribution and median values of estradiol at baseline (before treatment), at post (after treatment) will be presented, and changes and percentage changes (with interquartile ranges) of estradiol level, from baseline to post, by arms. Differences by arms of percent change, change and final values will be tested considering t-test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models. Estradiol at baseline will be included as explanatory variable together with other possible confounders such as BMI, age and time since last dose. Normal distribution of residuals from full model will be checked and, if needed, a transformation will be considered. Percentages of patients with final values of estradiol below the detectable level will be compared by arms with Chi-square tests and logistic models.</description>
