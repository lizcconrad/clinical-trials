    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to use a type of non-invasive brain stimulation technology during
      sleep to improve measures of sleep quality and memory in young healthy students and older
      adults. The type of brain stimulation is called transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS), which uses small currents of electricity to increase or decrease the activity of
      specific areas of the brain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive, and inexpensive brain
      stimulation modality that has been shown to have the ability to modulate both cortical and
      deep brain structure activity. This technique has undergone a significant amount of
      investigation in varied neuropsychiatric populations and interest in this technique has
      increased dramatically as of late.

      Some researchers have studied the effects of this modality on sleep as well as memory with
      promising results. One such study demonstrated that by using bilateral tDCS with a pattern of
      stimulation in the delta frequency range (0-3 Hz) delivered during slow wave sleep, that it
      is possible to increase delta power during slow wave sleep, as well as improve sleep
      efficiency. In addition to showing that it is possible to enhance slow waves, it was also
      demonstrated that this increase was associated with an improvement of a measure of
      declarative memory consolidation (one of the theorized functions of slow wave sleep).
      Enhancing memory function in a normal healthy group raises the possibility that it would also
      be possible to enhance memory in clinical populations who would benefit from such an
      intervention.

      The investigators propose to test this intervention for replication in a similar cohort.

    <description>Prior to and directly after a night of sleep we will assess declarative memory using a paired word association tests. In the pre-sleep assessment there will be a learning phase where the word list will be presented serially, until 60% of the words are retained. In the post sleep assessment the word list will be given again once. The outcome measure is the change in words retained between pre and post sleep assessments. Subsequently the followup interval is approximately 8-9 hours with baseline before bedtime, and follow up assessment once the patient is awoken.</description>

    <description>tDCS is a type of brain stimulation that uses low current applied directly over the scalp to increase, or decrease cortical activity under the stimulating electrodes. tDCS applied bi-frontally using Chattanooga Ionto™ Iontophoresis System - Phoresor. A square wave will be delivered at 0.75 Hz for five blocks of five minutes each with one minute inter-train interval. Stimulation will be applied following 8 epochs of consecutive stage 2 or deeper sleep.</description>
