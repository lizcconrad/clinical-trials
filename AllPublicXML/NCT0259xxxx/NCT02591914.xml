  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to establish the safety and tolerability of intravitreous
      administration of altering regimens of Fovista™ (Anti-PDGF-B pegylated aptamer) administered
      in combination with Anti-VEGF therapy (Lucentis®, Avastin® or Eylea®) in subjects with
      subfoveal neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

      Subjects will be treated with Fovista™ and Anti-VEGF therapy every month for the first three
      months. Retreatment with Fovista™ and Anti-VEGF will occur if the following findings are
      present PER INVESTIGATOR DISCRETION:

        -  ≥ 5 ETDRS letters loss OR;

        -  Significant hemorrhage OR;

        -  New or increased RPE elevation consistent with increased disease activity OR;

        -  Increased neovascular lesion size OR;

        -  New or increased foveal intraretinal fluid

      If anti-VEGF re-treatment is not administered based on the re-treatment criteria noted above,
      Fovista™ anti-PDGF therapy MUST be administered at a minimum of every 3 months (as
      monotherapy).

      Therefore, subjects will be treated with Fovista™ or Anti-VEGF therapy for a total of 3-24
      administrations.

    <description>All subjects will be treated with Fovista™ 1.5 mg/eye in combination with anti-VEGF therapy.
The following doses of Anti-VEGF therapy will be delivered based on the Investigator's discretion:
Lucentis® 0.5 mg/eye
Avastin® 1.25 mg/eye
Eylea® 2 mg/eye
Subjects will be treated with Fovista™ and Anti-VEGF therapy every month for the first three months.
The regimen for administration of each intravitreal agent will be as follows:
Injection Day #1-Administration of Fovista™ 1.5mg/eye
Injection Day #2-Administration of Fovista™ 1.5mg/eye followed by anti-VEGF therapy after Fovista™ injection
The same regimen will be delivered monthly until the subject reaches maximum visual acuity benefit. Maximum visual acuity is defined as no increase in ETDRS visual acuity at two consecutive visits.
Subsequent re-treatment with the Anti-VEGF therapy will use a PRN (&quot;as-needed&quot;) regimen based on protocol specified retreatment criteria.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye between 20/40 and 20/400, inclusive. The
             VA must be re-confirmed at Day 1 prior to randomization.

          -  Active CNV must compromise at least 25% of the lesion as measured on fluorescein
             angiogram (including blood, neovascularization, and scar/atrophy)

          -  Presence on OCT of subretinal hyper-reflective material (SHRM) within the central 1 mm
             subfield; SHRM is defined as hyper-reflective material located external to the outer
             retina and internal to the RPE, or, when the RPE is not well defined, internal to
             Bruch's membrane.

          -  Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to allow collection of fundus
             photographs and fluorescein angiograms of a sufficient quality to

        Exclusion Criteria:

             fundus photography with or without fluorescein angiography, with or without OCT.
             Subjects with any subfoveal scar or subfoveal atrophy directly below the center of the
             fovea are excluded.

          -  More than 50% of the total lesion size consisting of subretinal hemorrhage.

          -  Presence of retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP).

          -  Presence of significant serous pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs), such as large
             PEDs that constitute greater than 50% of the total lesion or have a vertical height of

             disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or clinical laboratory
             finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the
             use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of
             the study or render the subject at high risk for treatment complications.

          -  History or evidence of severe cardiac disease (e.g., NYHA Functional Class III or IV -
