  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-blinded, cluster randomized control trial will assess the effectiveness of an
      audit and feedback bundle on internal medicine physician performance on selected quality
      metrics. The feedback bundle includes an electronic dashboard and weekly feedback rounds in
      which physicians will review their performance. The control arm will undergo audit and
      feedback per the current system, which is biweekly feedback emails with performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded, cluster randomized control trial of 48 internal medicine teams (24
      teams will be randomized to the intervention arm and and 24 teams randomized to control arm)
      on inpatient medicine wards. Each team consists of at least 4 members (attending physician,
      senior resident, two interns). The intervention arm teams will receive the new audit and
      feedback bundle, which includes access to the electronic dashboard and weekly feedback rounds
      in which they review their performance on several inpatient quality metrics via the
      electronic dashboard. The control arm will undergo audit and feedback per the current system,
      which is biweekly feedback emails with performance on selected quality measures. This primary
      aim of the trial will be to compare the effectiveness of performance feedback on inpatient
      quality metrics specifically high quality after visit summary, medical reconciliation and
      discharge summary timeliness. Other group comparisons will include other inpatient quality
      metrics and satisfaction with feedback.
