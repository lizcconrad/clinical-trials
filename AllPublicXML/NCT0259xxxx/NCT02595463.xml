      The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving lidocaine intravenously during and
      after a tonsillectomy surgery is effective in decreasing postoperative pain when compared to
      placebo.

      Participants will be in one of two arms. Those in Arm 1 will receive a lidocaine bolus and
      infusion throughout the initial recovery period while those in Arm 2 will receive an equal
      volume of normal saline. Subjects will be monitored and assessed for pain during their time
      in the hospital and followed up on at home for a week after the surgery. Primary outcomes
      will be measure of pain. Secondary outcome measures will include pain medication use,
      emergence delirium, incidence of laryngospasm, and side effects.
