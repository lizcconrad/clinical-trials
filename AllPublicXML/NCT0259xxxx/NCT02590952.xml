  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epitinib (HMPL-813) is a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Epitinib has demonstrated
      strong inhibitory effects on multiple tumors with overexpressed EGFR or sensitive EGFR
      mutations in pre-clinical setting. This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), safety and tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of Epitinib.

    <description>Based on single-dose PK result, multi-dose stage subjects take epitinib either once a day or twice a day. For twice a day epitinib uptake, on day 1/14/28, PK samples are collected predose, 1, 4, 8, 12 hours post-dose in the morning and 4 hours post-dose in the evening. On day 2/3/7, PK samples are collected predose, 4, 12 hours post-dose in the morning and 4 hours post-dose in the evening. On day 15/29/56, PK samples are collected predose in the morning.
For once a day epitinib uptake, on day 1/14/28 PK samples are collected predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose. On day 7, PK samples are collected predose and 4 hours post-dose. On day 2/15/29/56, PK samples are collected predose in the morning.</description>
