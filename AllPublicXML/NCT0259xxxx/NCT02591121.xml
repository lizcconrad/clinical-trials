      Prospective, single-centre study in healthy volunteers to establish a reference range for the
      RAMP Procalcitonin (PCT) test. The primary objective of this study is to establish the
      reference range for measurement of PCT levels using the RAMP Procalcitonin test.

      Healthy volunteers who meet eligibility criteria and have provided informed consent will be
      enrolled in this study. Each participant will be required to donate 1 blood sample via
      standard venipuncture into an EDTA (lavender top) tube for testing on one occasion. The
      maximum trial duration for each participant is one visit/occasion. Sample collection will
      take place within a single clinical session. The maximum trial duration for each participant
      is one clinic session.
