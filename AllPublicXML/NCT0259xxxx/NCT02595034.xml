      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence and safety of
      Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 1%/5% (Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and BenzaClin®
      (clindamycin 1%/benzoyl peroxide 5%) Topical Gel (Sanofi Aventis, US) in the treatment of
      acne vulgaris and to demonstrate the superiority of the efficacy of the test and reference
      products over the placebo control

          5. Use for less than 3 months prior to baseline of estrogens or oral contraceptives; use
             of such therapy must remain constant throughout the study.

             surgery, 5) intralesional steroids, or 6) x-ray therapy.

          7. Use within 1 month prior to baseline of: 1) spironolactone, 2) systemic steroids, 3)
             systemic antibiotics, 4) systemic treatment for acne vulgaris (other than oral
             retinoids, which require a 6-month washout), or 5) systemic anti-inflammatory agents.

          8. Use within 2 weeks prior to baseline of: 1) topical steroids, 2) topical retinoids, 3)
