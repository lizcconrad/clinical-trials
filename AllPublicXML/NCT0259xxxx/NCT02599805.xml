    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot complications care represent a significant burden to the Canadian healthcare
      system. The estimated annual expenditure in Canada for diabetic foot ulcers is more than $150
      million. A small sized randomized controlled trial (n=17) investigating the use of topical
      oxygen therapy (n=9) against placebo (n=8) for diabetic ulcers was done recently and showed a
      87% average reduction of ulcer size in treatment group versus 46% average reduction in the
      control group (p&lt;0.05).

      Despite the standards of care used today in diabetic foot ulcer treatment, wounds may be
      non-healing when they do not heal within the appropriate time frame expected by an
      experienced clinician. Current diabetic foot ulcer standards of care include: full medical
      assessment in all cases, surgical intervention where indicated and local treatment of the
      ulcer.

      Given the scarcity of controlled trials specifically designed to review the effects of
      topical oxygen in ulcer care, this study will contribute to the understanding of the
      management of these ulcers by assessing the reductions in ulcer size achieved using Natrox™
      topical oxygen therapy.

      Diabetic foot complications care represent a significant burden to the Canadian healthcare
      system. The estimated annual expenditure in Canada for diabetic foot ulcers is more than $150
      million. Topical oxygen therapy has historically been recognized as essential for its
      antibiotic properties and as a nutrient. A number of studies have suggested that this method
      of treatment may contribute to better healing of wounds, particularly in ulcers. The Natrox™
      oxygen delivery system (ODS) is a device designed to overcome a number of problems associated
      with previous methods of oxygen therapy by delivering continuous oxygen to the ulcer bed
      through a dressing. It consists of a small battery-powered oxygen concentrator which
      processes oxygen from air, is portable, and can be held in place by a lightweight strap. In
      this study, we will seek to determine the effectiveness of the Natrox™ Topical Oxygen device
      in patients with non-healing diabetic foot/leg ulceration in conjunction with standard best
      practice. The Diabetic foot ulcer standards of care include:

        -  Full medical assessment in all cases.

        -  Surgical operation/Intervention where indicated.

        -  Local treatment of the ulcer (debridement followed by ulcer care according to &quot;modern
           ulcer healing&quot; standards and management of diabetes.)

      In both the treatment group and the control group, comparative changes in ulcer surface area
      will be measured over a period of 8 weeks to analyze wound healing.
