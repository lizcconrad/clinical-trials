  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JNJ-64041757
      a live attenuated double deleted (LADD) Listeria monocytogenes (bacteria in which two
      virulence genes, which encode molecules that help cause disease, have been removed) when
      administered intravenously to participants with advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (Stage
      IV) NSCLC (adenocarcinoma).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicenter and 2-part study in
      participants with advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma). Part 1 of study will be Dose Escalation phase to determine the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety and pharmacodynamic assessments and Part 2
      will be Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate 2 expansion cohorts (Cohort 2A and 2B) after the
      RP2D for JNJ-64041757 is determined in Part 1. The study will consist of a Screening Period
      (from signing of informed consent until immediately before the first dose), an open-label
      Treatment Period (from the first dose of study drug until the End-of-Treatment Visit); and a
      Post treatment Follow-up Period (after the End-of Treatment Visit until study
      discontinuation). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in part 1, antigen-specific T-cell response in
      part 2 and incidence of adverse events in both the parts will be primarily evaluated.
