  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) current smokers who are
      eligible for lung cancer screening will be identified using the electronic medical record at
      the University of Minnesota and Minneapolis VA (N=1000). All participants will receive 8
      weeks of evidence-based first-line smoking cessation treatment. Participants will be eligible
      for three potential randomizations during one year of smoking intervention: 1) to timing of
      identifying early response to treatment at 4 vs. 8 weeks (all participants), 2) to
      telephone-based tobacco longitudinal care (TLC) vs. TLC plus pharmacist-administered
      Medication Therapy Management (incomplete responders to first-line treatment, Primary Aim),
      and 3) to monthly TLC contact vs. quarterly TLC contact (complete responders to first-line
      treatment, Secondary Aim). The primary outcome will be 6 months of prolonged abstinence
      measured 18 months after the beginning of treatment.

    <description>The primary (dichotomous) outcome for all analyses will be whether or not smokers achieve 6-month prolonged abstinence measured at 18 months after the baseline assessment. All analyses will be by intention-to-treat, and include all participants randomized to intervention, regardless of whether they are lost to follow-up.</description>
