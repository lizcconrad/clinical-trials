    <textblock>
      This research seeks to examine psychological factors that may impact relationship between
      incentives and health behavior engagement, specifically fruit and vegetable consumption.
      Additionally, it will compare the impact of two different incentive schedules on behavior
      engagement, one providing immediate rewards (i.e. rewards received on a daily basis) and
      another providing delayed rewards (i.e. rewards received at the end of the study period),
      with a control condition in which no rewards are offered. Study participants will provide
      reports of their fruit and vegetable consumption each day for three weeks, and in the two
      incentive conditions, they will receive small monetary rewards for their fruit and vegetable
      consumption. Following the three week reporting and reward period, participants will complete
      two additional assessments, measuring psychological constructs and behavior engagement
      following the cessation of rewards.
