      Twelve acute wounds (6 on either side of the umbilicus) will be surgically created in the
      lower abdominal area. One side of the umbilicus will be randomized to Oxygenesys treatment
      arm and the other side will be receiving a standard Tegaderm treatment arm. Time to wound
      healing will be observed over 14 days.

      At least 12 study visits will occur over a 3 month timeframe. Twelve acute wounds (6 on
      either side of the umbilicus) will be surgically created in the lower abdominal area. One
      side of the umbilicus will be randomized to Oxygenesys treatment arm and the other side will
      be receiving a standard Tegaderm treatment arm. Time to wound healing will be observed over
      14 days (follow up assessments include wound photography, pain scores, wound biopsies,
      exudate collection, gene expression and proteomic analysis, scar assessment and adverse event
      collections. Study visits will occur at:

      Prescreening Visit; Day of wounding; Day 2; Day 7; Day 8-14 (until all wounds have healed);
      Day 28; Day 42; Abdominoplasty Surgery. An abdominoplasty will occur after day 42.

    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will report pain level on each side of their abdomen at day 14. The Wong-Baker scale is: 0 points = no hurt, 2 = hurts little bit, 4 = hurts little more, 6 = hurts even more, 8 = hurts whole lot, 10 = hurts worst. A grand mean and standard deviation (reported below) were determined by combining participant scores.The identical group mean and standard deviation values reported below are correct.</description>

    <measure>Biopsy &amp; Histology of Wounds.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Biopsies will be taken from all wounds at day 28. Analysis of tissue samples will specifically evaluate differences and rates of collagen deposition, angiogenesis and re-epithelialization between the two study arms.</description>

    <measure>Scar Quality Analysis; Modified Vancouver Scar Scale (MVS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Scar quality will be assessed and analyzed between the two groups using the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale at day 42. The MVS assessment is the tool that the Investigator will use to evaluate scar pliability (0 points = normal, 1 = supple, 2 = yielding, 3 = firm, 4 = adherent), height (0 = normal, 1 = 1-2 mm, 2 = 3-4 mm, 3 = 5-6 mm, 4 = &gt; 6 mm), vascularity (0 = normal, 1 = pink, 2 = red, 3 = purple), and pigmentation (0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = moderately, 3 = severely). An average score for each participant was calculated by combining scores from each subscale. Average participant scores in each study group were combined to produce a grand mean and standard deviation for each group (reported below).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scar Quality Analysis; Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Scar quality of each study participant was assessed by using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at day 42. The VAS is an 11-point scale that ranges from 0 (normal skin) to 10 (worst possible scar). The values on the scale indicate the observer's global impression of the scar (lower numbers are better than higher numbers).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scar Quality Analysis; Elastometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Scar quality was to be assessed for each study participant using an elastometer at day 42. An elastometer is used to assess scar elasticity. Unfortunately, the data for this study endpoint were not collected properly, and despite our best efforts, there is no way to resolve this issue. Thus, no data can be reported for this study outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scar Quality Analysis; Colorimeter</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Scar quality was to be assessed for each study participant using a colorimeter at day 42. A colorimeter was to be used to measure the extent of erythema, and melanin content, of the skin. Unfortunately, the data for this study endpoint were not collected properly, and despite our best efforts, there is no way to resolve this issue. Thus, no data can be reported for this study outcome.</description>

             of the final study dressing.

          -  Subject is willing to undergo the creation of twelve experimental donor sites 1.0&quot; x
             1.0&quot; in size with a depth between 0.0012&quot;-0.0018&quot; taken from the abdomen per a
             modification of the Northwestern Abdominoplasty Scar Model

          -  Subjects who are medically acceptable candidates for abdominoplasty (BMI approximately
             25-35 kg/m2) as determined by per-study laboratory assessment and clinical evaluation.

          -  Willingness to provide informed consent and to comply with the requirements of this
             protocol for the full duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have received treatment with systemic steroids during the 30 days prior
             to study enrollment.

          -  Subjects who have received immunosuppressive drugs, radiation or chemotherapy during
             the three months prior to study enrollment.

          -  Subjects with a history of malignancy in the previous three years.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes (A1C &gt; 8%).

             interfere with the assessment of safety, tolerability or efficacy.

          -  Subjects who have previously had skin grafts harvested from the area to be studied.

          -  Subjects with a skin disorder (other than chronic venous ulcers) that is chronic or

             healing of the acute wounds or involves the areas to be examined in this trial.

          -  Subjects with extensive severe striae that would make it difficult to perform a skin
             graft on the abdomen and/or evaluate the final scar appearance.

          -  Subjects with a history of clinical significant hypersensitivity to any of the
             surgical dressings to be used in this trial.

          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken any Investigational drugs within 3 months prior
             to the screening visit.

          -  Subjects who are participating in other research Investigations.

        <title>Scar Quality Analysis; Modified Vancouver Scar Scale (MVS)</title>
        <description>Scar quality will be assessed and analyzed between the two groups using the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale at day 42. The MVS assessment is the tool that the Investigator will use to evaluate scar pliability (0 points = normal, 1 = supple, 2 = yielding, 3 = firm, 4 = adherent), height (0 = normal, 1 = 1-2 mm, 2 = 3-4 mm, 3 = 5-6 mm, 4 = &gt; 6 mm), vascularity (0 = normal, 1 = pink, 2 = red, 3 = purple), and pigmentation (0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = moderately, 3 = severely). An average score for each participant was calculated by combining scores from each subscale. Average participant scores in each study group were combined to produce a grand mean and standard deviation for each group (reported below).</description>

          <title>Scar Quality Analysis; Modified Vancouver Scar Scale (MVS)</title>
          <description>Scar quality will be assessed and analyzed between the two groups using the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale at day 42. The MVS assessment is the tool that the Investigator will use to evaluate scar pliability (0 points = normal, 1 = supple, 2 = yielding, 3 = firm, 4 = adherent), height (0 = normal, 1 = 1-2 mm, 2 = 3-4 mm, 3 = 5-6 mm, 4 = &gt; 6 mm), vascularity (0 = normal, 1 = pink, 2 = red, 3 = purple), and pigmentation (0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = moderately, 3 = severely). An average score for each participant was calculated by combining scores from each subscale. Average participant scores in each study group were combined to produce a grand mean and standard deviation for each group (reported below).</description>
          <population>Each participant was assigned to both study groups (acted as her own control), as four wounds on one side of each participant were treated with OxyGenesys dressing, and four wounds on the opposite side of each participant were treated with the Tegaderm control dressing. One participant did not report for her day 42 measurement.</population>

        <description>Scar quality of each study participant was assessed by using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at day 42. The VAS is an 11-point scale that ranges from 0 (normal skin) to 10 (worst possible scar). The values on the scale indicate the observer's global impression of the scar (lower numbers are better than higher numbers).</description>
