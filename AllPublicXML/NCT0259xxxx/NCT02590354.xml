  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-1 infected patients with normal peripheral blood CD4+ T-cell counts and undetectable
      viral load will be recruited in four Belgian HIV reference centers. Selected patients will
      undergo a two-step screening in which a viral reservoir measurement will be performed and
      among those with a very low viral reservoir an analytical treatment interruption of their
      longstanding antiretroviral therapy (ART). There is no randomization foreseen. Patients will
      receive an intense clinical and laboratory follow-up during 48 weeks followed by 12 weeks
      post intervention.

    <measure>Assessment of the proportion of participants with a HIV plasma viral load below the lower limit of detection 48 weeks following interruption of antiretroviral treatment</measure>

    <description>The proportion of post treatment controllers (PTC - i.e. patients under ART at baseline that show low peripheral blood proviral DNA and still will show sustained viral suppression at 48 weeks after treatment interruption) will be determined. The assessment will be based on the plasma viral load (expressed in copies/ml) measured two-weekly (or four-weekly after W12) until W48 after treatment interruption. Patients below the lower limit of detection (&lt;50 HIV RNA copies/ml plasma) at 48 weeks after treatment interruption will be considered as PTC.</description>

          -  Participant should take ART for at least 2 years before baseline with no changes in
             the ART regimen for at least 90 days prior to study entry. ART regimen is defined as
             mono- or bi-therapy or a combination of three or more active antiretroviral drugs

          -  CD4 T-cell count is &gt;= 500/μl for a period of at least 3 months prior study entry

          -  Nadir CD4+ T-cell count is ≥300/μl. A lower nadir CD4+ T-cell count will be allowed if
             measured at time of acute infection as far as the relative CD4+ count remains above
             20%. An acute infection is defined as an association of a clinical picture of
             retroviral syndrome together with a seroconversion in HIV serology or an incomplete
             confirmation test.

             occasional blip is defined as an intermittent viremic episode with a viral load above
             detection level but below 200 copies/ml and a return to an undetectable level in a
             next control).
