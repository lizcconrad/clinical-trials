      The study evaluates the safety and the efficacy of the addition of intravenous
      transplantation of donor bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with idiopathic
      interstitial pneumonia or connective tissue disease associated with interstitial lung
      disease, which have actively progressing disease with rapid loss of pulmonary function on the
      background of routine treatment.

    <textblock>
      Despite significant progress in the treatment of interstitial lung disease, achieved thanks
      to new drugs, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, there are many patients for whom these
      drugs are not available or poorly tolerated. In addition significant evidence of their
      effectiveness and safety is valid only for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The transplantation
      of allogeneic stem cells is a promising direction in the modern medicine with the proven
      safety for different diseases. But the effectiveness of this therapy is still under research.
      We believe that in most severe cases of a rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease the
      transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells may be an effective technology due to their
      immunomodulatory properties.
