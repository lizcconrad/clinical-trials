      The aim of this study is to establish PAtient-Centered Computerized Educating System for
      Stroke (PACCESS) for patients with different demands and lack of knowledge.Those in the
      intervention group will receive the PACCESS and the control groups will receive traditional
      health education to test the effects of PACCESS in increasing clinical decision-making,
      health behavior, activities of daily living and knowledge of stroke, and health care quality.
