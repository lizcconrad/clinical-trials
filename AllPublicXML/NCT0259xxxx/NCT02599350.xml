  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an attempt to standardise the degree of impairment of gas exchange in the lungs of ICU
      patients a number of indices of oxygen exchange have been developed. These include: the
      arterial−alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/APO2), the arterial oxygen tension−inspired oxygen
      concentration ratio (PaO2/FIO2), the respiratory index (RI), [A−a)DO2/PaO2) and the
      alveolar−arterial oxygen tension difference [A−a)DO2). These are used clinically despite the
      fact that they do not accurately predict gas exchange particularly with changing the amount
      of inspired oxygen or when there is mixing of oxygenated blood with unoxygenated blood in the
      patient (called shunt). None of the indices reliably reflect the behaviour of the
      physiological shunt. In a pilot study as inspired oxygen (FIO2) was increased incrementally
      from 0.30 to 1.00, up to 55 per cent of the measured changes in these indices were opposite
      in direction to the corresponding changes in the physiological shunt. The investigators have
      developed a computer algorithm and a slide rule to try and improve on these clinical
      measures. The investigators wish to test their slide rule on ventilated patients by altering
      the inspired oxygen to see if it will predict what the actual change in oxygen will be.

    <textblock>
      30 adult patients admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary ICU, requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation and with impaired gas exchange will be recruited and the following baseline
      demographic data will be recorded: cause of respiratory failure, APACHE II score,
      cardiovascular shock (presence / absence), duration of mechanical ventilation prior to
      inclusion, duration of respiratory failure prior to inclusion. Also the following baseline
      physiological data will also be recorded: FIO2, SaO2, PEEP, arterial blood pressure, central
      venous pressure, haemoglobin, PaO2, PaCO2, arterial pH and inotrope / vasopressor infusion
      rates.

      The FIO2 will then be varied in random steps to 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6 and 0.65.
      After changing the FIO2 a 3−4 minute equilibration period will be allowed prior to taking an
      arterial blood gas sample for analysis. In the event of a PaO2 &lt; 8kPa being recorded, further
      reductions in FIO2 will not be undertaken.

      The data collected will then be utilised using a slide rule computer programme to generate
      FIO2 vs. SpO2 graphs. Other indices of gas exchange, e.g. PaO2/FIO2 ratios will also be
      generated from the data. Predicted versus actual PaO2 will be plotted and a correlation
      coefficient obtained.

      Patients will then be followed for up to 5 days and depending on progression the same
      procedures will be repeated between days 3 and 5.
