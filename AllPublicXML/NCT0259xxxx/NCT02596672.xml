    <textblock>
      The multi-level 12 week peer-led walking intervention incorporates aspects from all three
      levels of the ecological model (with the aim of producing sustained (&gt;6months) physical
      activity behaviour change in older adults living in independent living communities.

      The proposed study is a cluster randomized controlled feasibility trial of a multi-level
      peer-led walking intervention. The socio-ecological model and social cognitive theory
      provides the framework that will help inform and test the feasibility of a multi-level
      peer-led walking intervention for inactive older adults living in independent living
      communities in Northern Ireland. The behaviour change techniques identified and extracted
      from a previous systematic review on the effectiveness of peer-led physical activity
      interventions helped guide the decision-making process of which behavior change strategies
      should be included in this study. The logic model helped inform the design and development of
      the 12 week peer-led walking programme.

    <description>They will complete a 12-week peer-led walking programme. Participants will be paired together as walking partners and will be given a pedometer and step count logs for self-monitoring. The walking co-ordinators will facilitate walking groups two times a week in the local areas, lasting for 30 minutes. The nature of the walks will be tailored to the participants stated preferences of types of activity. Participants will also receive local walking route maps. After 12 weeks, the formal peer-led component will finish and participants will be encouraged to continue walking with their walking partners other activity programmes organised in the fold in order to maintain activity levels.</description>

    <description>Folds assigned to the control group will not receive any additional support to change their physical activity behaviour over the course of the intervention period.
At the six-month data collection point they will be offered a referral to a local walking group in their area or advice on beginning a self-directed walking programme (similar to Public Health Agency www.choosetolivebetter.com/content/getting-active). They will be asked to complete outcome measures at baseline and follow up time-points. Post-study a sample of control participants will be asked to attend a focus group, exploring their views on social activity as form of physical activity for older adults in folds.</description>
