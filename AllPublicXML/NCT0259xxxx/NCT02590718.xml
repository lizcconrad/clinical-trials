    <textblock>
      The study is carried out in a prospectively randomly controlled way. In the context of
      acknowledgement and understanding from parents, by comparing with traditional process (lying
      without the pillow and fasting water and food for four hours following lumbar puncture), an
      optimized postoperative management (lying without the pillow for half an hour following
      lumbar puncture) is randomly selected. All children will be evaluated by the FLACC (The face,
      legs, activity, cry, consolability behavioral tool) scale to assess the degree of pain after
      lumbar puncture. Any postoperative condition will be recorded and analyzed. A questionaire
      about bad memory during lumbar puncture for all parents and children will be investigated in
      order to establish an optimized lumbar puncture management process.

      The purpose of this study is to establish an optimized lumbar puncture management process on
      the basis of fully understanding of parents and children. An improved process consisting of
      comfortable LP will be established upon completion of this study.
