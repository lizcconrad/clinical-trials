  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been widely used in diagnosis and
      treatment of pancreaticobiliary diseases. Traditionally, ERCP has been performed in the prone
      position. The prone position for ERCP can facilitate selective bile duct cannulation, offer a
      better fluoroscopic image of pancreaticobiliary anatomy, and prevent aspiration of gastric
      contents. However, in cases of difficult in the prone position, ERCP has been performed in
      the left lateral or supine position. Compared with the prone position, left lateral position
      is more comfortable for patients, especially with limitation for cervical movement including
      cervical cord injury, cervical spine operation, parkinson's disease, contracture due to
      cerebral infarction, and allow more easy passage of the scope through the pharynx, and useful
      to secure airway. However, in the left lateral position, it is difficult to obtain
      fluoroscopic image of right hepatic duct and intrahepatic bile duct.

      In cases of severe abdominal pain, severe abdominal distension, large amount of ascites,
      recent abdominal surgery or cervical spine surgery, intra-abdominal catheter insertion,
      severe obesity, it is difficult to position in prone or left lateral, therefore, ERCP may be
      performed in the supine position. In supine position for ERCP, there has been documented
      increased risk of cardiopulmonary adverse event and decreased success rate of selective bile
      duct cannulation.

      There have been reported the efficacy and safety between the prone position and supine
      position for ERCP in several studies. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety between
      the prone position and left lateral position for ERCP in this prospective, randomized study.

      Methods

        1. Written informed consent for the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is
           obtained from all patients.

        2. Blood culture is performed, and intravenous 3rd generation cephalosporin is administered
           routinely.

        3. Before endoscopic procedure, patients are randomly assigned to left lateral position or
           prone position for the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

        4. Conscious sedation is performed by non-anesthesiologist-assisted method. Intravenous
           midazolam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg and/or intravenous propofol 0.5mg-1mg/kg is administered.
           Analgesics was administered intravenous meperidine 25mg in patients with older than 50
           years and meperidine 50mg in patients with younger than 50 years. To limit duodenal
           peristalsis hyoscine-N-butylbromide is administered intravenously.

        5. All patients are provided oxygen 2liter/minute via nasal prong. Patient's oxygen
           saturation, heart rate, blood pressure and respiration are monitored during procedure.

        6. Selective bile duct cannulation is performed by wire-guided cannulation method. If
           adverse event is occur during endoscopic procedure, it is recorded in the case report
           form as intra-procedural adverse event.

        7. After 4 hours, 24 hours, 2 weeks and 6 weeks of the procedure, white blood cell count,
           hemoglobin, platelet count, total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine
           transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transaminase, amylase, lipase,
           abdomen X-ray, chest X-ray are performed.

        8. Oral feeding is started with sips of water after 24 hours of endoscopic sphincterotomy
           and/or endoscopic papillary balloon dilation.

        9. Development of adverse event including bleeding, perforation, pancreatitis,
           hyperamylasemia, infection, basket impaction, cardiopulmonary adverse event, mortality
           are recorded according to left lateral position or prone position for the endoscopic
           retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

    <description>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is started using conventional duodenoscope (TJF 240 or 260V, Olympus Optical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) in randomly assigned left lateral position or prone position.
Selective bile duct cannulation is performed using wire-guided cannulation.
In case of difficult cannulation, precut is performed using a needle-knife.
After selective cannulation, cholangiogram is obtained using ERCP catheter, and endoscopic sphincterotomy and/or endoscopic papillary balloon dilation is performed.</description>
