    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. Please note this was a 2 treatment by 3 period study design. Therefore, some subjects were randomized to receive one of the study lenses twice, hence the number of observations were summarized per lens type. For the senofilcon A lens 134+138+134=406 (Observations- 1 per subject per period, however 1 observation was not recorded) from period 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For the delefilcon A lens 138+134+138=410 from period 1, 2 and 3 respectively.</description>

    <description>Test/control/test using the Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care (JJVC) Marketed contact lens (test) and the Competitor Marketed contact lens (control). Lenses will be worn as daily wear, daily disposable on both eyes for approximately one week each in between lenses for total study duration of approximately three weeks per subject. Subjects are required to wear the lenses at least five days for at least eight hours per day worn.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          -  The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          -  The subject must be between (and including) 18 and 39 years of age.

          -  The subject must be an adapted wearer of spherical soft contact lenses in both eyes.
             That is, the subject must wear their habitual lenses at least five (5) days per week
             and eight (8) hours per day worn for at least 30 days immediately preceding the study.

          -  The subject must have vertex-corrected distance refraction that allows a plano
             over-refraction with the available contact lens powers of -0.50 to -6.00 Diopters (D)
             in each eye.

          -  The subject must have refractive astigmatism, if present, of less than or equal to
             1.00 D in each eye.

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently pregnant or breastfeeding (subjects who become pregnant during the study
             will be discontinued).

          -  Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any autoimmune disease or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          -  Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, or aphakia.

          -  Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.).

          -  Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          -  Monovision, multi-focal, toric, or extended wear contact lens correction.

          -  Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14 days
             prior to study enrollment.

          -  History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus that is likely to affect
             successful contact lens wear.

          -  Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or contagious immunosuppressive
             diseases (e.g., HIV) by self-report.

        <title>Overall Comfort</title>
        <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. Please note this was a 2 treatment by 3 period study design. Therefore, some subjects were randomized to receive one of the study lenses twice, hence the number of observations were summarized per lens type. For the senofilcon A lens 134+138+134=406 (Observations- 1 per subject per period, however 1 observation was not recorded) from period 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For the delefilcon A lens 138+134+138=410 from period 1, 2 and 3 respectively.</description>
