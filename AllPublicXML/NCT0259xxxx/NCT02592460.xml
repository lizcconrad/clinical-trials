  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal studies have shown that the level of pain sensitivity is highly dependent on the
      amount of polyamines in food. This fundamental observation of a nutritional approach to pain
      led the authors to develop diets completely depleted in polyamines whose anti-nociceptive
      properties have been confirmed in animals.

      Postoperative pain after foot surgery are currently fairly well controlled but at the cost of
      a high consumption of grade II analgesics which is associated with a high rate of side
      effects (nausea, vomiting ...). The investigators' hypothesis is that a diet low in
      polyamines may have an additive effect on pain control and reduce the consumption of level 2
      analgesics.

      The objective of this study is to show the efficacy of a polyamines-poor diet on
      postoperative pain in ambulatory surgery of the foot.
