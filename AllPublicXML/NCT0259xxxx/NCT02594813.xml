    <textblock>
      The bleeding rate of both EGD (including biopsy) and colonoscopy (including biopsy or cold
      snare polypectomy) in patients who continue to take various antithrombotic drugs is studied
      prospectively. The immediate or delayed bleeding that requires hemostatic clipping or other
      endoscopic treatments is defined as the bleeding. Immediate bleeding requiring hemostatic
      clipping is defined as spurting or oozing which continued for more than 30 seconds. Delayed
      bleeding is defined as bleeding that requires the endoscopic treatment within 2 weeks after
      endoscopy. Prophylactic clipping is not performed after taking biopsy and doing polypectomy.
      Additionally, investigators evaluate the rate of injured submucosal arteries of the excised
      specimen when the bleeding occurs.
