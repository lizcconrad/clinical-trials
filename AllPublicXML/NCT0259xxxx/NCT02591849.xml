  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) develops in 10-15 % of all renal transplant
      recipients within 10 weeks after transplantation, and has been associated with increased risk
      of cardiovascular disease and impaired patient survival. PTDM is primarily believed to be a
      variant of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the pathophysiology underlying the impaired
      glucose metabolism in renal transplant recipients with PTDM is unclear and some aspects are
      still poorly investigated. Hyperglycemic clamp investigations with concomitant infusion of
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are warranted for a thorough characterization of the α-cell
      and β-cell function.

      The primary objective of the present study is to investigate whether hyperglucagonemia is
      present in renal transplant recipients with PTDM. Furthermore, the investigators aim to
      examine the insulinotropic and glucagon suppressive effects of GLP-1 (compared to placebo) in
      PTDM patients during fasting glycemia and during hyperglycemic conditions (hyperglycemic
      clamp), respectively.

    <description>The primary objective of the present study is to measure fasting plasma glucagon concentration and the suppression of glucagon during hyperglycemia (hyperglycemic clamp) measured in picomoles per liter with and without concomitant iv infusion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in renal transplant recipients with and without PTDM</description>

    <description>Twelve eligible renal transplant recipients with PTDM and twelve age, gender, BMI and renal function-matched non-diabetic renal transplant recipients will be randomized to continuous unblinded intravenous infusion of GLP-1 with an infusion rate of 0.8 pmol/kg/min or isotonic saline (placebo) on two experimental days performed 2-4 weeks apart. The GLP-1 infusion will consist of 42.5 nmol/mL GLP-1 (7-36) amide, 12.5 mL 5% human albumin and isotonic saline added to a total volume of 50 mL. After 60 min, a 2 hour hyperglycemic clamp will be initiated, where plasma glucose will be elevated by 5 mmol/L from each individual fasting plasma glucose in both groups. This will be done to measure concentrations of glucagon and insulin in hyperglycemic conditions.</description>
