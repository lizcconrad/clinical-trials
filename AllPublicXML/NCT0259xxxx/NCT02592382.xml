  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most prevalent and costly illnesses in children
      throughout the world. AOM can lead to chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) resulting in
      conductive hearing loss that can cause speech, language, academic, and social developmental
      delays.

      Complementary and alternative medicines are being widely used for prevention of AOM.

      Xylitol is a five carbon polyol (sugar alcohol) produced from natural plants and is used for
      preventing dental caries and AOM in children. It is commercially available in chewing gums,
      syrups and toothpastes washes, and other products. Xylitol was shown in several studies to
      prevent the culture if bacteria in the nasopharynx and oral cavity. It was proven to
      eliminate the ability of bacteria to attach to the mucosa of the upper respiratory system.

      In this study the investigators aim to test the yield of Xylitol nasal spray compared to
      isotonic saline spray in prevention of recurrent AOM.
