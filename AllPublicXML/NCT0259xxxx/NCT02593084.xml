  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise programs, particularly resistance training programs using weights or resistance
      bands, can help improve or maintain mobility and function in older adults, preserve
      independent living, and improve quality of life. This study will examine the safety and
      feasibility of a novel, higher intensity resistance training program in older adults, and
      compare the effects with standard care, lower intensity training. It is anticipated that both
      programs will be safe and feasible, but higher-intensity training will lead to greater
      improvements in quality of life, mobility and strength, which are part of the physical
      phenotype definition of frailty and markers of mobility disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is critically important to identify effective strategies to reduce the risk and impact of
      mobility disability and frailty in older adults. Exercise, particularly resistance training
      (RT), has the potential to influence a person's ability to navigate around their environment
      and impact the components of the frailty phenotype which include weakness, physical
      inactivity, and slowness. Higher training intensities have been used with athletes and
      younger adults to achieve greater gains in strength, but the feasibility and effectiveness is
      less established in older persons who exhibit preclinical disability, or are at-risk for
      mobility decline where conservative protocols are typically employed. Higher intensity RT may
      be an innovative and effective strategy in preclinical disability pre-frailty to reduce the
      risk and impact of future frailty and mobility decline.

      This study aims to examine: 1) the safety and feasibility of a 12-week higher intensity RT
      protocol in community dwelling older adults at risk for mobility disability, and 2) the
      effects of this protocol on walking, balance, muscle strength, quality of life compared to
      lower intensity RT

      It is hypothesized that the higher intensity RT: 1) is safe and feasible for at-risk
      community-dwelling older adults, 2) more effective in improving walking, balance, muscle
      strength, and quality of life than lower intensity RT
