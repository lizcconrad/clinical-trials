  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The significance of parameters of the central hemodynamic is based upon their strong
      association with left ventricular hypertrophy and target organ damage at the heart.
      Noninvasive, auscultatory/ oscillometric and therefore easy applicable measurements of the
      central hemodynamic such as presented by the Schiller BR-102 plus PWA device implicate highly
      promising potential for research and daily clinical praxis for improved cardiovascular risk
      assessment on the population level. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity of
      the central and peripheral blood pressure and central arterial stiffness measured with the
      device BR-102 plus PWA from Schiller (Schiller AG, Baar, Switzerland).

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study is an open, monocentric cross-sectional research study for the evaluation
      of the validity of the central and peripheral blood pressure and central arterial stiffness
      measured with the device BR-102 plus PWA from Schiller (Schiller AG, Baar, Switzerland). For
      that purpose measurement of the respective parameters in cardiovascular disease free
      individuals will be compared with validated devices and the agreement between the devices
      will be statistically analyzed. Central blood pressure and central arterial stiffness are
      clinically increasingly meaningful parameters of the cardiovascular system that allow
      improved, early cardiovascular risk stratification. The significance of parameters of the
      central hemodynamic is based upon their strong association with left ventricular hypertrophy
      and target organ damage at the heart. Noninvasive, auscultatory/ oscillometric and therefore
      easy applicable measurements of the central hemodynamic such as presented by the Schiller
      BR-102 plus PWA device implicate highly promising potential for research and daily clinical
      praxis for improved cardiovascular risk assessment on the population level.
