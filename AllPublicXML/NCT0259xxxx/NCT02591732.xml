    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics of patients treated with
      different OATs and whether these characteristics differ between treatments.

      Furthermore to describe persistence to each OAT and risk of bleeding after initiating each
      OAT.

    <time_frame>Approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Persistence will be defined as treatment discontinuation and will be measured by estimating the following:
Discontinuation - the absence of any delivery of this product and of any other anticoagulation therapy of interest for 30 days. The date of discontinuation the OAT will be determined according to predefined algorithms to calculate treatment duration in the national prescription registry. Sensitivity analysis including a 30 and 60 day grace period will be performed to take into account incomplete adherence to treatment and dose modifications</description>
