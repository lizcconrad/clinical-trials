    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well ATR kinase inhibitor M6620 (M6620) and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride work compared to standard treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride
      alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that
      has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). ATR kinase inhibitor M6620 may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking an enzyme needed for cell growth, and may also help
      gemcitabine hydrochloride work better. Gemcitabine hydrochloride is a drug used in
      chemotherapy that works to stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking cells from growing and
      repairing themselves, causing them to die. It is not yet known whether adding ATR kinase
      inhibitor M6620 to standard treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride is more effective than
      gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess and compare progression free survival (PFS) between gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride)/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine and compare overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

      II. Determine and compare the safety profile of gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine
      alone regimens.

      III. Assess and compare PFS at 6 months between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine
      alone arms.

      IV. Determine and compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970)
      and gemcitabine alone arms.

      V. Determine and compare the duration of response (DOR) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970)
      and gemcitabine alone arms.

      VI. Determine and compare cancer antigen (CA)125 reduction by &gt;= 50% between
      gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

      VII. Determine and compare overall survival (OS) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and
      gemcitabine alone arms.

      VIII. Determine the ORR for subjects in the gemcitabine alone arm who cross over to the
      gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) arm.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients experiencing disease progression may crossover to Arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in Arm I and ATR kinase inhibitor M6620
      IV over 60-90 minutes on days 2 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
