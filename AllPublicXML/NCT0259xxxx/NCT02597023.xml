      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of supplementation with the
      mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, mitoquinone (MitoQ), for improving physiological function
      (vascular, motor, and cognitive) in middle-aged and older adults.

      Overall, the proposed research project has the long-term potential to influence clinical
      practice by establishing novel therapies for treating multiple domains of age-associated
      physiological dysfunction and thereby reducing the risk of clinical disease and disability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women will be confirmed as postmenopausal (either natural or surgical) based on
             cessation of menses for &gt;1 year.

          -  Ability to provide informed consent

          -  Baseline brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) &lt; 6%Î” (rationale: non-invasive
             screening to ensure exclusion of subjects with exceptionally high baseline endothelial
             function.

          -  Ability to perform motor and cognitive tests (e.g., can rise from a chair, walk for 2
             min, climb 10 stairs)

          -  Willing to accept random assignment to condition

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current smoking

          -  Having past or present alcohol dependence or abuse, as defined by the American
             Psychiatry Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2 (FMD measurements can be inaccurate in severely obese
             patients)

          -  Chronic clinical diseases (e.g., coronary artery/peripheral artery/cerebrovascular
             diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, neurological disorders
             or diseases that may affect motor/cognitive functions [multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
             disease, polio, Alzheimer's disease, dementia or other brain diseases of aging]),
             except hypertension and hyperlipidemia

          -  Regular vigorous aerobic/endurance exercise (&gt;3 vigorous bouts/week).

          -  Not weight stable in the prior 3 months (&gt;2 kg weight change) or unwilling to remain
             weight stable throughout study (rationale: recent weight change or weight loss can
             influence vascular function.

          -  Current treatment or recent cessation (&lt; 3 mo) of hormone replacement therapy

          -  Moderate or severe peripheral artery disease (ankle-brachial index &lt;0.7).

          -  A graded exercise test will be performed by all subjects, if there is physician
             concern or an adverse event, the subject will not participate in a maximal oxygen
             consumption (VO2max) test (this will be determined in accordance with stated
             contraindications for exercise testing provided by the American Heart Association).

          -  Thyroid disease that is not controlled by medications or &lt;3 month's use of a
             particular medication and/or dosage (uncontrolled thyroid diseases are associated with
             alterations in vascular function).
