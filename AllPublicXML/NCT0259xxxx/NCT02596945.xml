    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, observational study investigates the efficacy, safety and usability
      of methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta in participants on peritoneal dialysis.
      Participants who were prescribed methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta by their doctor and
      who meet the selection criteria were to be enrolled and documented in this study for a period
      of 9 months of treatment with methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta with respect to
      efficacy, safety and usability.
