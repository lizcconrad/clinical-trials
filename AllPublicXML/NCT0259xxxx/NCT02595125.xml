  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are contraceptive methods of long-acting (from 3 to 10 years
      depending on the model) and among the most effective. However, there are many obstacles to
      the use of IUDs including pain felt by patients during installation. Several medical means
      were studied without evidence of their efficacy in pain related to IUD insertion. In order to
      remove this brake, it's important to find another way to act against this pain. The direct
      technique is one of the techniques described by health professionals. It seems trusted by its
      users as a more reliable technique but also less painful for patients. However, there is no
      study available on its evaluation. The aim of this study is to investigate the interest of
      the direct technique in reducing the pain experienced by patients during installation.
