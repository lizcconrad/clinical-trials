    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies docetaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with
      castration resistant prostate cancer that has spread from the primary site (place where it
      started) to other places in the body (metastatic) and contains inactivated genes in the BRCA
      1/2 pathway. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess rate of 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline to docetaxel and
      carboplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess PSA response duration to docetaxel and carboplatin. (Phase 2)

      II. To assess response of measurable disease. (Phase 2)

      III. To assess time to progression of bone lesions or measurable disease (Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]). (Phase 2)

      IV. To assess response to docetaxel and carboplatin in tumors with mutation of
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair pathway genes (breast cancer [BRCA]1, BRCA2, ataxia
      telangiectasia mutated [ATM]). (Phase 2)

      V. To correlate the presence of DNA repair pathway mutations and copy number alterations in
      metastatic tissue versus in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and cell free DNA. (Phase 2)

      VI. To correlate changes in CTC number with PSA and radiographic response. (Phase 2)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and carboplatin IV over
      30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 10 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
