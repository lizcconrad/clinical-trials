  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pharmacogenetic (PGx) guided treatment
      when implemented into the pre-operative process for patients undergoing an elective spinal
      surgical procedure and requiring post-operative acute pain management, as compared to a group
      of subjects with the same attributes without the guidance of PGx testing for their
      post-surgery pain management. This study will also evaluate whether PGx testing can reduce
      narcotic consumption, opioid-related adverse effects, time to mobilization, medical visits
      and costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of opioid related adverse drug events can reach as high as 50% in surgical
      patients and poor pain management is a significant risk factor for early readmission. In
      addition, the rate of non- response to certain analgesics is double in patients who are poor
      metabolizers as demonstrated by mutations in both CPY26d alleles. Finally, there is a growing
      body of literature that ineffective acute pain management contributes significantly to the
      risk of chronic pain syndromes. Genetics and drug interactions can alter both the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a multitude of drug compounds and in turn influence
      both the safety and efficacy of selected therapeutic regimens.

      Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection can enhance patient response by facilitating the
      selection of the most appropriate medication at the most effective dose in the shortest
      possible time.

      In this prospective, randomized, single-blind study, the investigators will evaluate the
      clinical impact of pharmacogenetics-guided treatment on the duration of the post-surgical
      hospital stay and on patient well-being as determined by post-op pain assessments.
      Additionally, the impact of PGx-guided treatment on narcotic consumption, number of adverse
      events, re-admission rates and costs will be evaluated during the study duration.
