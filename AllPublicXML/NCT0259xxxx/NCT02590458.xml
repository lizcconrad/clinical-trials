  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to test if a short breast MRI scan (about 10
      minutes) can be used for breast cancer screening in high risk people and to learn if it is as
      effective as a routine breast MRI scan (30-60 minutes).

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the short breast MRI scan (the scan
      for research purposes) with contrast on a different day than your scheduled routine MRI
      screening scan with contrast. You will have your routine scan the first day and the research
      scan at least 1 day after. The research scan will take about 10 minutes to complete.

      After your short breast MRI scan is completed, you will complete a questionnaire about your
      comfort level and experience of the research scan. It should take about 10 minutes to
      complete the questionnaire.

      This is an investigational study. The short breast MRI is considered investigational.

      Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Radiologists blinded to patient outcome review images from each study independently and rate the possibility of breast cancer using BI-RADS score. BIRADS 0, 3,4, 5 considered positive, BIRADS 1 and 2 considered negative results for the analysis. Each reader's score for a given case assessed both independently and on a separate session, as consensus.</description>
