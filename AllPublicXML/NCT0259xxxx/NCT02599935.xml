  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effect over the nutritional status in patients who are malnourished with
      chronic heart failure, of an educational intervention and the provision of nutritional
      supplements. Randomized clinical trial with blind assessors. Unicentric. Follow up: 12 months

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial with blinded evaluators. (The evaluators will not know the group
      the patients are assigned. Blinded evaluators are no responsible for randomization and
      intervention once the patients have been randomized). Patients will be recruited from the
      cardiology inpatient unit of tertiary hospital, before discharge. Patients will be divided in
      two groups randomly:

      In one arm will be held a double intervention:

        -  A structured educational intervention oriented to the patient and primary caregiver,
           with respect to dietary habits, highly energetic and healthy food, the frequency and
           manner of eating, exercise and programming breaks.

        -  supplementation with dietary supplements, distinguishing one type of product or another,
           depending on whether the subject to study: diabetes and or kidney failure.

      In the other arm of the study was carried out regular interventions
