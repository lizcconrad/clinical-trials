    <textblock>
      Compared to early postpartum (10-15 weeks) observations, paracetamol clearance was
      significantly higher (21.1 vs 11.7 l.h-1, + 80 %) at delivery. This higher clearance was due
      to a disproportional increase in glucuronidation (11.6 vs 4.76 l.h-1, + 144 %), a
      proportional increase in oxidation clearance (4.95 vs 2.77 l.h-1, 78 %) and primary renal
      clearance (1.15 vs 0.75 l.h-1, 53 %) [KUlo et al, Int J Obstet Anesth]. This increase in
      glucuronidation clearance may in part be driven by oestradiol, and may explain within and
      between individual differences in paracetamol metabolism (e.g. oral contraceptives,
      follicular vs luteal phase, postpartum, pregnancy, or duration of pregnancy) in young women.

      Based on a pooled analysis, investigators aimed to further explore the impact of these
      covariates on paracetamol metabolism based on plasma and urine collections in women at
      delivery, in postpartum (early, or late) and healthy volunteers, either or not on oral
      contraceptives (OC) following intravenous (iv) paracetamol administration.

      This study aims to perform a pooled analysis of:

        1. Paracetamol PK data recently published in 47 pregnant women. In these cases, iv
           paracetamol was administered q6h after delivery (caesarean) for 24 h. 8 were recruited a
           second time for an additional single dose pK study in postpartum (Kulo et al, Br J Clin
           Pharmacol 2013).

        2. The PK data as initially published by Gregoire et al, but limited to female volunteers,
           all on oral contraceptives (n=14) (Gregoire et al, Clin Pharm Ther 2007)

        3. A dataset in 8 young women not on oral contraceptives, iv paracetamol, single dose.

    <description>women who underwent cesarean at delivery, and needed iv paracetamol as part of multimodal analgesia. In these cases, paracetamol was administered q6h (2g loading dose, 1g q6h for 24 h), and blood and urine samples were collected to describe paracetamol disposition at delivery.</description>

    <description>a subgroup of 8 women initially included in at delivery, underwent a second PK study 2-3 months postpartum and another PK study about 1 year after delivery. This PK study was based on a single iv paracetamol administration (2 g), and blood and urine samples were collected to describe paracetamol disposition in postpartum</description>

    <description>a group of 8 young healthy women not on oral contraceptives underwent a single PK study (2 g intravenous paracetamol) and blood and urine samples were collected to described paracetamol disposition in healthy female volunteers, not on oral contraceptives.
Raw data as published by Gregoire et al (Clin Pharm Ther 2007) were available in 14 young women, all on contraceptives.</description>
