      The aim of the study is to assess the peripheral endothelial function in adult asthmatic
      patients and the relationship between the peripheral endothelial function and the pulmonary
      function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary criteria is the peripheral endothelial function that will be assessed by the
      measure of flow-mediated dilation (reactive hyperemia-peripheral artery tone index). The
      pulmonary function will be assessed by the measures of the FEV1, the forced vital capacity
      (FVC) and the expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75%). The relationship between these
      parameters of the pulmonary function and the peripheral endothelial function will be
      analyzed. In addition, a relationship between peripheral endothelial function and the level
      of asthma control (Asthma Control Test (ACT)), the cardiovascular risk factors (SCORE INdex)
      and the treatment for asthma (controllers) will be also assessed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a clear-cut history of asthma at the time of enrolment into the
             trial (eventually confirmed in the past and documented by an increased
             hyperresponsiveness to methacholine; or a bronchodilator reversibility to a
             beta-2-adrenergic drug).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with unstable asthma

          -  Patients with a significant acute disease other than asthma. A significant disease is
             defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may influence the
             results of the trial.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.
