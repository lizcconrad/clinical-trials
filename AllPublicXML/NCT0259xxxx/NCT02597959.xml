  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. What are the risk factors that contribute to musculoskeletal injuries and fatigue on
           allied health professionals in surgical care (e.g. scrub nurses, surgical assistants,
           and circulating nurses)?

        2. Can the investigators design wearable devices that the investigators can later evaluate?

    <measure>Frequency of awkward postures</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Awkward postures will be quantified with motion tracking using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a lightweight, small sensor. IMU data will be collected and transmitted wirelessly to a real time monitoring system.</description>

    <measure>Open-ended questionnaire on workflow and usability process to develop automated, unobtrusive, and cost-effective wearable device</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Description: Open-ended questionnaire will present participants with the following questions after viewing a presentation on surgical ergonomics and vibrotactile feedback: &quot;Would this device interrupt your work; if so, in what ways,&quot; &quot;Are you concerned you may be distracted,&quot; Might it interfere with movement in any way,&quot; &quot;Could you provide feedback on the vibration settings,&quot; etc.time work postures and these data will control tactor activation.</description>
