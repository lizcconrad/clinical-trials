      Primary Objective To substantiate the efficacy of 2.2 g FLEXISEQ® for the treatment of pain
      related to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in patients contraindicated for or with clinical
      intolerance to NSAIDs.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To substantiate the efficacy of 2.2 g FLEXISEQ® for the treatment of stiffness and
           improvement of joint function in patients contraindicated for or with clinical
           intolerance to NSAIDs and with OA of the knee.

        -  To substantiate safety and tolerability of 2.2 g FLEXISEQ® in patients contraindicated
           for or with clinical intolerance to NSAIDs and with OA of the knee.
