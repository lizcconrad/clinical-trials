    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the effects of electronic cigarettes on the
      lungs. Studying the effects of electronic cigarettes on the lungs may provide the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) and other government regulators with important information, which
      may help in developing future regulations to make electronic cigarettes safer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a pilot cross-sectional study of electronic (e)-cigarette (cig) users,
      never-smokers, and smokers (n=30), assessing use patterns and biomarkers by bronchoscopies
      using bronchoalveolar lavage (cell counts, inflammatory cytokines, and untargeted
      metabolomics), and bronchial brushings for gene expression (micro ribonucleic acid [miRNA]
      and messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA]).

      II. To conduct a 4 week pilot clinical trial of nicotine-free and flavor-free e-cig use in
      regular smokeless tobacco (ST) users (n=30), randomized to e-cig use or control (no e-cig
      use), and assess biomarkers as in Objective 1 by bronchoscopy at baseline and at 4 weeks
      while on product (week 5 of trial).

      OUTLINE:

      PART I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo bronchoscopy of the left lung over 30-60 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients undergo bronchoscopy of the right lung over 30-60 minutes.

      PART II: Patients who are regular ST users are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive nicotine-free and flavor-free electronic cigarettes and instructed to
      use them twice daily (BID) over a 2 hour period for 4 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients receive no intervention.

      In both arms, patients undergo a second bronchoscopy during week 5.

    <description>Using bronchoalveolar lavage, and bronchial brushings for gene expression use patterns and biomarkers will be assessed and compared between two groups (e.g., non-smokers vs. smokers). For univariable comparisons, non-parametric methods such as the Kruskal-Wallis H-test for more than two independent groups and the Mann Whitney U-test for two independent groups will be used. Group associations controlling for possible confounders or effect modifiers will be explored using multiple linear regression models.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aim 1 only: 1) smokers who smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day with a stable smoking
             pattern of at least 6 months and no prior e-cig use within one year; smoking status
             will be confirmed by salivary cotinine; subjects with at least 10 ng/ml cotinine in
             their saliva being considered smokers; 2) e-cig users who report using e-cigs daily
             for 3 months with at least one nicotine-containing cartridge/day or 1 ml of
             liquid/day; they should have not smoked a cigarette for at least one year; 3)
             non-smokers who have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and not for at
             least 1 year, and not have used an e-cig for at least 1 year; lack of regular smoking
             will be confirmed by salivary cotinine

          -  Aim 2 only: Smokeless tobacco users who use ST daily (&gt;= 6 dips or pouches/day) for at
             least 6 months and no other tobacco use or e-cig use for at least 1 year (ST use will
             be confirmed by salivary cotinine), and in good physical and mental health; no serious
             quit attempts in the last three months particularly for those randomized to the
             control condition

          -  No unstable and significant medical conditions as determined by medical history (to
             ensure safety of the subject, to minimize the effects of poor health on biomarker
             measures and to maximize compliance to study procedures)

          -  Able to read adequately to complete the survey and related study documents or give
             consent
