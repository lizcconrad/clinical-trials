  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) is an autoimmune metabolic disease in which the insulin
      producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed and the subject is left totally dependent of
      external supply of insulin. There is no known cure for DM1 except for in very specific
      situations. Thus, management of DM1 concentrates on keeping blood glucose levels as close to
      normal levels.

      As an aid to subjects with DM1 for managing their blood glucose levels as close to normal as
      possible, blood glucose monitoring systems have been developed. Available blood glucose
      monitoring systems today require a capillary blood sample that is analysed by a glucose
      meter. Subjects are normally advised by health care professionals on the appropriate blood
      glucose monitoring regime for their condition. However, many subjects fail to measure blood
      glucose as often as needed to achieve good blood glucose control despite every effort from
      health care professionals.

      Research and development of non-invasive interstitial blood glucose monitoring methods is
      ongoing. All attempts to develop a non-invasive continuous glucose measuring device have so
      far failed. Prediktor Medical AS has developed a non-invasive sensor, GlucoPred, based on the
      combination of several non-invasive measurement principles and multivariate analysis and
      dynamic models of glucose/insulin interaction. The device will be body mounted in the form of
      a bracelet or a watch communicating with a mobile phone or a tablet for data presentation and
      collection. Development of GlucoPred is now at a stage where testing of the sensor in
      subjects under controlled settings is required before further development can take place.

      If successful, this will be a major step ahead for all patients with diabetes and markedly
      increase their possibility to take care of their disease on a day to day basis without the
      burden of frequent blood sampling or wearing an invasive device.
