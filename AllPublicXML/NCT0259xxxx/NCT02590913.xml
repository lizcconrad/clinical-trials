    <textblock>
      The study was a double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial. Twenty healthy volunteers were
      randomized to two groups: group A (300ml of 22.5% glucose) and group B (300ml of 22.5%
      fructose).Volunteer was randomized into either group A or B, after an 8-h overnight fasting,
      took 300ml of solution at 0830 within 5 minutes. After one-week washout period, volunteer was
      crossed over for either group B or A. each intervention, venous blood was collected at 0h,
      0.5h, 1h, 2h, and 3h and blood pressure was tested at 0h, 1h, 2h, and 3h.
