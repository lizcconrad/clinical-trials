      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 and
      irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other
      places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or
      cannot be removed by surgery. ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 and irinotecan hydrochloride may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ATR
      kinase inhibitor VX-970 (VX-970) in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the safety and tolerability of VX-970 in combination with irinotecan.

      II. To document anti-tumor activity. III. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of VX-970 and irinotecan.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify molecular subpopulations of patients with increased sensitivity to the
      irinotecan and VX-970 combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and ATR kinase
      inhibitor VX-970 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, then at 3 and 6
      months.
