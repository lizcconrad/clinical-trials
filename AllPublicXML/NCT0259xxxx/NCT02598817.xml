      This is a multicenter, open label, observation study; 500 formula fed infants are planned to
      be enrolled from a network of general pediatricians in the Gulf countries (UAE, Kuwait,
      Qatar, and KSA). Eligible infants will consume a high sn-2 palmitate infant formula for 12
      weeks. All enrolled infants will be evaluated at enrollment and at 4 weeks and 12 weeks.
