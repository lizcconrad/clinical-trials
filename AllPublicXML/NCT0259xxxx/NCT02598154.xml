      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the metrological characteristics of the data
      processing algorithms from inertial sensors (FOX © HiKoB) for the reconstruction of movement
      relative to the reference system (VICON) for measurement of dorsiflexion at the beginning of
      a step and in the middle of the oscillating phase.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        1. / - to assess the metrological characteristics of the data from inertial sensors (FOX ©
           HiKoB) for the reconstruction of the movement in comparison with reference systems
           (GaitRite or Zebris systems, VICON) in terms of:

           A. Ability to determine the walking speed, stride length, the acceleration of plantar
           flexion at the beginning of the weight-bearing phase B. Ability to objectify performance
           reduction during a 6 minute test. C. Ability to identify different types of movement:
           simple walking, turn, obstacle clearance, staircase.

        2. / - to analyze the EMG signal upon voluntary dorsiflexion of the foot of the paretic
           side from a sitting position before and after a fatigue test (objective D)
