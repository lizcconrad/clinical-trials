      using local anesthesia compared with those using general anesthesia for patients with
      incarcerated hernia.

    <description>Patients in LA group received the local infiltration technique. A mixture of 2% lidocaine 20ml and 0.9%NS 30ml was used as the local anesthetic. Patients required extra analgesia during the surgery were given 20-40mg parecoxib sodium intravenously. Conversion to GA was performed if LA was intolerant for patient, which was evaluated by both anesthetists and surgeons.</description>

    <description>In group GA, anesthesia was induced with propofol 2mg/kg and fentanyl 0.1-0.2mg intravenously. Inhalation anesthesia was given at the same time with a mixture of oxygen and isoflurane 1-2% through an intubation.</description>
