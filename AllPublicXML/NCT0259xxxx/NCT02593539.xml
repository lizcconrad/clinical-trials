  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomised, open-label, uncontrolled, single group study to
      investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) during 84 days repeat dosing treatment with
      1000 micrograms (mcg) of inhaled GSK2269557 in addition to standard of care, in subjects with
      activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) delta syndrome /p110delta-activating mutation
      causing senescent T Cells, lymphadenopathy and immunodeficiency (APDS/PASLI). To date
      GSK2269557 has been administered to healthy subjects (smokers and non smokers), subjects
      with: stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD); subjects experiencing a COPD
      exacerbation; and subjects with persistent, uncontrolled asthma. As this study is the first
      administration of GSK2269557 to subjects with APDS, this study will provide safety,
      tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data in this patient population. Up to 20 subjects
      will be enrolled into the study. The total duration of the study is approximately 30 weeks,
      including pre-screening/screening and follow-up.

             comply with the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of
             study medication until completion of the follow-up telephone call at 1-2 weeks from
             last dose. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. Male condom plus partner use
             of one of the following contraceptive options: 1. Contraceptive subdermal implant 2.
             Intrauterine device or intrauterine system 3. Combined estrogen and progestogen oral
             contraceptive, 4. Injectable progestogen 5. Contraceptive vaginal ring 6. Percutaneous

             when used consistently and, correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the
             product label. For non-product methods (e.g. male sterility), the investigator
             determines what is consistent and correct use. The GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) definition is
             based on the definition provided by International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH).

          -  Female subject. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as
             confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not

             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. 2. Reproductive potential and agrees
             to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods
             for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior
             to the first dose of study medication and until completion of the follow-up telephone
             call at 1-2 weeks from last dose.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in protocol which includes

             consultation with the Medical Monitor if required, agree and document that the finding

             alternative drug in the same class (or unrelated class) that is not a strong CYP3A4
             and/or CYP2D6 inhibitor can, after signing informed consent, be substituted for the

             immunoglobulin regimen, as per local practice, such as regular injections with a
             consistent dosing interval (e.g. monthly) is acceptable.

          -  Previous use of an mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) antagonist (e.g. rapamycin,

             (including lactose) or a history of drug or other allergy (including a milk protein

             their participation.

          -  History of previous intolerance of the induced sputum procedure.

          -  Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) sub study only: History of bronchospasm in response to

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dose of study medication
             in the current study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological
             effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          -  Exposure to more than 4 investigational medicinal products within 12 months prior to
