    <textblock>
      This study will enroll subjects who received the RSV F vaccine or placebo in the earlier
      study (RSV-E-201, Year 1) and re-randomize them to receive either vaccine or placebo in a
      second season. This design will permit evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of
      revaccination in a second RSV season, and the safety and immunogenicity of revaccination over
      two years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females ≥60 years of age who are veterans of the RSV-E-201 clinical trial
             and who are ambulatory and live in the community or in residential facilities which
             provide minimal assistance, such that the subject is primarily responsible for
             self-care and activities of daily living. Subjects may have one or more chronic
             medical diagnoses, but should be clinically stable as assessed by:

               -  Absence of changes in medical therapy within one month due to treatment failure
                  or toxicity,

               -  Absence of medical events qualifying as SAEs within two months, and

               -  Absence of known, current, life-limiting diagnoses that, in the opinion of the
                  investigator, render survival to trial completion unlikely.

          2. Willing and able (on both a physical and cognitive basis) to give informed consent
             prior to study enrollment.

          3. Able to comply with study requirements, including access to transportation for study
             visits. The investigator may use his/her discretion to assess potential ability and
             willingness to comply based on performance in the prior trial, RSV-E-201.

          4. Access to inbound and outbound communication by telephone with caregivers and study
             staff.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in research involving investigational product (drug / biologic / device)
             within 45 days before planned date of first vaccination, with the exception of
             participation in the preceding study RSV-E-201.

          2. History of a serious reaction to any prior vaccination, or Guillain-Barré syndrome
             (GBS) within 6 weeks of any prior influenza immunization, or withdrawal from the
             preceding RSV-E-201 clinical trial due to an adverse event deemed test article-related
             or at the advice of the investigator.

          3. Receipt of any vaccine other than IIV in the 4 weeks preceding the study vaccination;
             or any RSV vaccine at any time unless administered in the preceding study, RSV-E-201.

          4. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, as
             determined by history and/or physical examination.

          5. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the
             study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a
             systemic dose ≥10mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical, inhaled,
             and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.

          6. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.

          7. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature ≥38.0°C on the planned
             day of vaccine administration).

          8. Known disturbance of coagulation. Potential subjects receiving aspirin, clopidogrel,
             prasugrel, dipyridamole, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban or warfarin under good
             control for cardiovascular prophylaxis or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disease or
             stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation will NOT be excluded.

          9. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or
             other substance abuse.

         10. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric
             conditions deemed likely to impair the quality of study compliance or safety
             reporting).
