    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food intake on PF-04136309
      pharmacokinetics (PK) following a single dose at 1000 mg.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be conducted in healthy adult subjects. The single dose of 1000 mg has
      been shown to be safe in a previous study in healthy subjects. To evaluate the effect of food
      on PF-04136309 PK at the dose of 1000 mg, which is the maximum dose that may be evaluated in
      the multiple dose setting in patients, will provide information to guide the dose
      administration in regards to food intake at relevant therapeutic dose levels for further
      studies in patients.

    <description>Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the body. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
