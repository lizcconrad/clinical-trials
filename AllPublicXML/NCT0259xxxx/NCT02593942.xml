  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol and remifentanil are routinely used drugs for
      this purpose. The hemodynamic stability and at the same time early emergency are the main
      goals following neurosurgery. However there is no standard for discontinuation time for
      manually controlled systems today.

      The investigators aimed to study the effect of remifentanil infusion alone for early
      emergence and hemodynamic stability during the closure period in patients undergoing
      supratentorial craniotomy.

      Adult, American society of Anaesthesiologist score I-II, 80 patients who underwent elective
      supratentorial craniotomy for tumour resection were randomly assigned to group I or II. In
      group I; propofol was discontinued during the dural closure. After the propofol was
      discontinued, remifentanil dose was increased with the guidance of bispectral index spectrum
      and hemodynamic parameters. In group II; propofol discontinued before the end of the surgery.
      Time to awakening and extubation time, adverse events, total remifentanil and propofol
      consumptions and side effects were recorded. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded
      during this period.

    <description>After the surgery, starting from three-pin head holder removal, an investigator asked each patient to open his or her eyes, squeeze the investigator's hand. When the patient opened his or her eyes, obeyed commands, resumed adequate respiration, hemodynamically stable and bispectral index spectrum &gt; 70-80 was extubated, and the time will be recorded. The patients will be followed for an expected average of 3 hours.</description>
