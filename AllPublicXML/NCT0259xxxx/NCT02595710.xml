    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 volunteers who have received a liver transplant and have been diagnosed with
      cryptogenic cirrhosis will be included in this study. Blood samples will be analyzed for
      Bartonella using the state-of-the art Bartonella Alpha Proteobacterium Growth Medium (BAPGM)
      multi-platform testing, including liquid culture, enriched agar plating and molecular
      techniques. Blood smears will be analyzed for intra-erythrocytic Bartonella spp.
      Four-millimeter skin biopsies from non-lesional skin will be acquired from the same patients,
      processed using our published techniques, and imaged using confocal microscopy and compared
      to BAPGM test results. additionally, urine samples will be collected and analyzed for
      microRNAs.
