    <textblock>
      This is a randomized withdrawal, double blind, placebo controlled study of pediatric subjects
      (2 to &lt;18 years of age) with JIA. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of
      tofacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of JIA at Week 26 of the
      double blind phase as measured by the percentage of subjects with disease flare (according to
      PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare criteria) after Week 18 of the open label run in phase.All
      eligible subjects enrolled in the study will initially receive open label tofacitinib for 18
      weeks (run in phase). At the end of the 18 week run in phase, only subjects who achieve at
      least a JIA ACR 30 response will be randomized to the 26 week double blind, placebo
      controlled phase. Subjects who do not achieve a JIA ACR 30 response at this time point will
      be discontinued from the study. In addition, subjects who experience a single episode of
      disease flare at any time during the study (including the open label run in and double blind
      phase) will also be discontinued from the study. All subjects participating in this study,
      including those discontinued from the study, will have the option, if eligible (based on
      inclusion and exclusion criteria), of enrolling in the tofacitinib JIA long term extension
      study (A3921145).

      Subjects who are eligible for the 26 week double blind phase will be randomized (1:1 ratio)
      to either active tofacitinib or placebo. For subjects with polyarticular course JIA (ie,
      extended oligoarthritis, polyarthritis RF+, polyarthritis RF , systemic JIA with active
      arthritis but without active systemic features), randomization will be stratified by JIA
      category and baseline CRP (normal, above normal). For subjects with psoriatic and enthesitis
      related arthritis, randomization will be stratified by JIA category.

      Approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled in the open label run in phase. Among subjects
      with polyarticular course JIA, stratification will target at least 50% with a baseline CRP
      above the upper limit of normal. The first cohort (ie, polyarticular course JIA) will have at
      least 170 subjects enrolled in the run in phase with the minimum number of JIA categories as
      follows: 24 with extended oligoarthritis, 20 with polyarthritis RF+, 62 with polyarthritis
      RF-, 20 with systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features.
      Additional cohorts (ie, psoriatic and enthesitis related arthritis) will include a minimum of
      20 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, and 20 subjects with enthesitis related arthritis. The
      overall target minimum number of subjects to be enrolled in the study by age is as follows:
      20 subjects 2 to &lt;6 years, 20 subjects 6 to &lt;12 years, and 20 subjects 12 to &lt;18 years. The
      duration of subject participation among those who complete the study (without
      discontinuation) is expected to be approximately 44 weeks.

             stable dose of an oral glucocorticoid, and/or a stable dose of methotrexate is
             permitted.

             For subjects receiving an oral glucocorticoid: Glucocorticoids may be administered at
             a maximum dose of 0.2 mg of prednisone equivalent per kilogram per day or 10 mg per
             day for ≥ 2 weeks before baseline, whichever is lower.

             For subjects receiving methotrexate (MTX) treatment: MTX may be administered either
             orally or parenterally at doses not to exceed 25 mg/wk or 20 mg/m2/week (whichever is
             lower); participants must have taken MTX for 3 months and be at a stable dose for at

          3. Inadequate response or intolerance to at least one Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic
             Drug (DMARD), which may include MTX or biologic agents; in the case of ERA and
             psoriatic arthritis, inadequate response to Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs
             (NSAIDs).

          4. No evidence or history of untreated or inadequately treated active or latent
             tuberculosis (TB) infection as evidenced by the following:

               1. A negative QuantiFERON ®TB Gold In Tube test performed within the 3 months prior
                  to screening. A negative purified protein derivative (PPD) test can be
                  substituted for the QuantiFERON® TB Gold In Tube test only if the central
                  laboratory is unable to perform the test or cannot determine the results to be
                  positive or negative and the Pfizer medical monitor is informed and agrees on a
                  case by case basis.

               2. Chest radiograph without changes suggestive of active tuberculosis (TB) infection
                  within 3 months prior to screening is recommended and should be performed
                  according to local standards of care or country-specific guidelines.

               3. No history of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB
                  infection.

             If a subject has previously received an adequate course of therapy for either latent
             (9 months of isoniazid in a locale where rates of primary multi drug resistant TB
             infection are &lt;5% or an acceptable alternative regimen) or active (acceptable multi
             drug regimen) TB infection, neither a PPD test nor a QuantiFERON-Gold®TM test need be
             obtained. A chest radiograph should be obtained if not done within the 3 months prior
             to screening. To be considered eligible for the study, the chest radiograph must be
             negative for active tuberculosis infection.

             A subject who is currently being treated for latent TB infection can only be enrolled
             with confirmation of current incidence rates of multi-drug resistant TB infection,
             documentation of an adequate treatment regimen, and prior approval of the Sponsor.

          5. Fertile males and females who are, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active
             and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must be willing and able to use a

         21. Prior treatment with non B cell specific lymphocyte depleting agents/therapies (eg,
             almetuzumab [CAMPATH], alkylating agents [eg, cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil], total
             lymphoid irradiation, etc.). Subjects who have received rituximab or other selective B
             lymphocyte depleting agents (including experimental agents) are eligible if they have
             not received such therapy for at least 1 year prior to study baseline and have normal
             CD 19/20+ counts by FACS analysis.

         22. Use of prohibited prescription or non prescription drugs and dietary supplements
             listed in Appendix 1 and Appendix 4 within the specified time frame prior to the first
             dose of study medication.

         23. Herbal supplements must be discontinued at least 28 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication.

         24. Use of certain biologic and non biologic DMARDs are disallowed at any time during this
             study (Appendix 1).

         25. For subjects with PsA, oral and topical medications and alternative treatments that
             could affect psoriasis are prohibited (see Inclusion Criterion 2 for exceptions). This
             includes topical corticosteroids, tars, keratolytics, anthralin, vitamin D analogs,
             and retinoids which must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of study
             drug. Also prohibited is ultraviolet B (UVB) (narrowband or broadband) phototherapy
             that must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.
             Psoralens + ultraviolet A (UVA) phototherapy (PUVA) must be discontinued at least 4
             weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

         26. Subjects who are children of or related to investigational site staff members, site
             staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or Pfizer employees directly
             involved in the conduct of the study.

         27. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 4 weeks or 5
             half lives (whichever is longer) prior to study entry and/or during study
             participation. Exposure to investigational biologics should be discussed with the
             Sponsor.

         28. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

         29. Pregnant or nursing females are excluded.
