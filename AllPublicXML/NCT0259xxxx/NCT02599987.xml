    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis may have reduced diffusion
      capacity, lung function and gas exchange due to mechanical and hemodynamic changes in the
      respiratory system, and decreased respiratory muscle strength resulting from uremic myopathy.
      The inspiratory muscle training (IMT) appears as an instrument to improve the inspiratory
      muscle strength, with positive effects on functional capacity and quality of life of kidney
      patients, however, the effects of IMT were not addressed in the specific variables of the
      respiratory system and to date there are no studies on the use of daily training in this
      population. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of daily inspiratory muscle training on
      respiratory muscle strength, chest wall volume, diaphragm thickness and mobility of end-stage
      renal disease patients. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial to be developed in
      Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE)
      during the period from November 2015 to December 2016. The sample is composed of 24
      individuals aged 18 and 65, having CKD, to perform hemodialysis for at least twelve months
      and provide inspiratory muscle weakness. Patients will be divided into two groups, the
      training group will be IMT with POWER-breathe®, load of 50% of MIP, duration of three sets of
      30 inspirations, frequency of two sessions per day, 7 days a week for 8 weeks, since the sham
      group will be subjected to the same procedure (duration and frequency), but without load.
      Participants will be assessed before and after intervention through a global assessment form,
      questionnaire Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form - KDQOL-SF, diaphragmatic
      ultrasound, opto-electronic plethysmography, spirometry, manometer and six-minute walk test.

    <description>Will use the breathing coach POWERbreathe® Classic Light. Participants will hold the workout three sets of 30 inspirations, 2 sessions per day, 7 days per week for 8 weeks. The training group will carry with IMT load of 50% of MIP. Weekly, patients attend the Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory for evaluation of MIP and load adjustment, performing a training session in the presence of the therapist, while other sessions will be held by the participant at home and registered in the diary training. The training took place with the patient sitting in chair with a back, with knees and hips flexed to 90 °, the participant will use a nose clip and the device coupled to the nozzle mouth, will be instructed to diaphragmatic breathing pattern.</description>

The sham group will carry without load, but will be subjected to the same procedures in the experimental group (simulation of load adjustment in the Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory) to ensure blinding of the study, other sessions will be held by the participant at home and registered in the diary training.
