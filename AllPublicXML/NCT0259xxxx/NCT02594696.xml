  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are
      dying younger than the general population; cancer is a leading cause of death in this
      population. People with SMI have higher rates of dying from breast, lung, and colon cancer,
      and disparities in treatment appear to be one contributing factor. Individuals with SMI may
      be diagnosed with more advanced stage cancer and less likely to receive stage-appropriate
      cancer treatment. Although collaborative care models integrating medical and psychiatric care
      have shown promise in other populations, the challenge of treating SMI and cancer is distinct
      and relatively understudied. Patients may have uncontrolled psychiatric symptoms that can
      impact their understanding of their diagnosis and treatment decisions. Oncologists have less
      training and inadequate time to address multiple unmet needs. Mental health care is
      frequently fragmented from cancer care.

      The investigators want to understand if it is helpful for patients with SMI to be connected
      to a psychiatrist and case manager when cancer is diagnosed. Optimizing psychiatric symptoms
      and facilitating communication between the patient, the oncology team, and mental health
      providers may improve care. The goal is to pilot a pragmatic intervention for patients with
      cancer and SMI that can be integrated into cancer care, is acceptable to patients and
      oncology clinicians, and may promote the delivery of stage-appropriate cancer treatment to an
      underserved population.

      Patients will be connected to a psychiatrist and case manager at cancer diagnosis who will
      follow the patient and communicate with the oncology team during the 12 week intervention.
      All participants will complete brief surveys at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Oncology
      clinicians will provide feedback about the intervention at 12 weeks. Cancer treatment
      received and healthcare utilization will be assessed at 6 months post-intervention.

      Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of proactive psychiatry consultation and
      case management among individuals with SMI treated at the MGH Cancer Center and their
      oncology clinicians.

      Aim 2: To describe the rates of receipt of stage-appropriate cancer treatment and patterns of
      healthcare utilization in patients with SMI and cancer who are receiving the intervention

      Aim 3: To explore patterns of change in psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, illness
      understanding, and alliance with the oncology clinician in patients with SMI and a recent
      cancer diagnosis who are receiving the intervention.

    <description>The patient is linked to a psychiatrist and case manager at cancer diagnosis who deliver team-based, patient-centered care. The psychiatrist collaborates with the oncologist to guide cancer treatment. The psychiatrist and case manager proactively monitor patient symptoms and potential barriers to care and remain in communication with the patient, oncology team, and community-based providers for the duration of the intervention.
Patients complete study assessments at baseline, 4 +/- 2 weeks after baseline, and post-intervention (12 +/-2 weeks after baseline)
Oncologists provide feedback about the usefulness of the intervention (12 +/- 2 weeks after baseline)</description>

    <description>The psychiatrist conducts a tailored, cancer-specific assessment to optimize psychiatric symptoms and collaborates with the oncologist to develop and modify the cancer treatment plan.
The case manager, a social worker, engages with the patient to promote self-management, identify and address barriers to care, and bridge communication with oncology and mental health.
The psychiatrist and case manager proactively monitor symptoms and the process of cancer care, remain in regular contact with the patient and communicate with the oncology team at least every 4 weeks
The psychiatrist and case manager are available for consultation across care settings (outpatient, inpatient, home).
Recommendations are documented in the medical record and communicated directly to the oncology team</description>
