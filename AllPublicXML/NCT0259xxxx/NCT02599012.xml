    <textblock>
      -  Multifactorial pathogenesis is involved in anemia of cancer patients and defining the
           causes of anemia is not always simple.

        -  Currently, treatment options available for anemia in cancer patients include red blood
           cell (RBC) transfusion, erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA), and iron
           supplementation, accompanying considerable pros and cons for each treatment.

        -  Previous studies have demonstrated benefit when treating with IV iron in combination
           with ESA and, more recently, evidence is emerging to suggest a role for IV iron alone.

        -  In this study, investigator will assess the efficacy of intravenous iron for the
           treatment of anemia in cancer patients.
