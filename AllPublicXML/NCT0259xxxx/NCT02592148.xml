  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an interest to assess nutritional status of vitamins in humans in a non-invasive
      way, i.e. by avoiding taking blood samples. Saliva could potentially be an alternative to
      blood for this purpose. The suitability of saliva for status determination will be
      investigated by analysis of (forms of) vitamins A and E, B1, B2, B3, B6 and C in both saliva
      and blood.

      There is an interest to assess nutritional status of vitamins in humans in a non-invasive
      way, i.e. by avoiding taking blood samples. Saliva could potentially be an alternative to
      blood for this purpose. However, literature data on vitamins in saliva is scarce. The
      occurrence is best demonstrated for 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 where already indications for a
      correlation to blood levels have been observed in a small scale supplementation study.
      Occurrence of (forms of) vitamins A and E, B1, B2, B3, B6 and C has been reported but is less
      well documented. Some information is somewhat ambiguous and for none of these latter vitamins
      blood levels have been investigated in parallel to saliva.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify and quantify selected forms of vitamins in saliva and blood/plasma samples</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Selected forms of vitamins: vitamins A (retinol), E (alpha-tocopherol), D (25-hydroxy-vitamin D3), B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavine, FAD and FMN), B3 (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide), B6 (pyridoxal and pyridoxamine) and C (ascorbic acid). The measurement of this vitamin concentrations in blood/plasma and saliva will add to our knowledge of the occurrence or absence of these vitamins in saliva, and their concentration levels. Such information is only scarce in literature. Concentrations will be reported in ng/ml or microg/ml for each subject, and as mean for all participants.
Sampling of saliva, blood and plasma takes place at one time point only. Samples will be measured and reported within 3 month</description>

    <measure>Determination of the relationship of saliva and blood/plasma concentrations of vitamins A, E, D, B1, B2, B3, B6 and C.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Concentrations measured in saliva and blood/plasma will be correlated to by e.g. linear regression models. The correlation coefficients will be reported. They give an indication on a possible positive relationship of saliva and blood/plasma status of vitamins in humans.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Generally healthy males and females

          -  Age: 20-65 years

          -  Non-smokers

          -  No recent or recently (within the last four weeks) started intake of vitamin
             supplements; long-term intake of supplements on regular base is o.k., but needs to be
             documented (type of supplement and dosage)

          -  Subjects willing and able to give written informed consent and to understand, to
             participate and to comply with the biomedical research project requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion would impact volunteer safety and/or
             a volunteer's ability to complete all study related procedures. (e.g. psychiatric
             illness, drug addiction, alcoholism, etc.)

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis.

          -  Chronic intake of substances affecting blood coagulation (e.g. acetylic acid,
             anticoagulants, diuretics, thiazides), which in the investigator's opinion would
             impact volunteer safety

          -  Allergy or known hypersensitivity against disinfection solutions

          -  Women: pregnancy, or during lactation

          -  Currently participating in another study
