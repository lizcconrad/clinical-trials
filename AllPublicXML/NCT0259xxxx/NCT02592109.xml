  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemic of pediatric obesity has become a public health burden in both developed and
      developing countries, due to its serious health consequences, including an increased risk of
      type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and heart disease. Currently, dietary and exercise changes are still
      the center of preventive and treatment measures of obesity. Recently, the omega-3 group, one
      of the groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been associated with many positive
      effects leading to the improvement of many diseases related to obesity. Nevertheless, the
      consumption of this essential nutrient requires certain ration to optimize its favorable
      result. Although previous studies have examined the efficacy of dietary counseling approach
      as treatment for obesity, none of them as explicitly explore the use of linear programming to
      create a tailored diet containing high omega-3 fatty acid food as a part of dietary
      counseling in obesity management program among children. Thus, this study is intended to
      contribute the clinical evidence regarding this area of knowledge, specifically the effects
      of enhanced counseling containing complementary feeding recommendation on nutritional status,
      omega-3 fatty acid, malondialdehyde, and alpha Tocopherol among children with risk of
      overweight aged 12 -23 months in East Jakarta.

      Randomized-Controlled-Trial with two arms of intervention:

        1. Control group: receive standard counseling with general existing menu recommendation

        2. Intervention group: receive enhanced counseling (additional information on omega-3 fatty
           acids) with population-based menu ganerated from linear programming (LP)

      There is a protocol on stratified block randomization. 2 blocks, stratified by: area, age,
      BMI-for-age status.

      Total sample size for analysis:

      Overall: 20 control - 18 intervention Blood sample: 18 control - 14 intervention

    <description>The counseling will be done by individual face-to-face communications. The intervention's arm will get a counseling with an additional of 7-day cycle with adequate n-3 and optimal n-3/6 ratio for complementary feeding menu obtained from linear programming formulation.
The counseling consisted of nutritional status in children aged 12-23 months and how to determine the nutritional status; the principle of balanced diet; definition, function, and source of omega-3; example of menu that contains adequate omega-3. The duration of counseling is approximately 30 minutes, once a week for ten weeks. The mother or caregiver will also receive daily menu for seven days that should be followed during the intervention. The daily menu comprised of 3 main meals and 2 snacks.</description>
