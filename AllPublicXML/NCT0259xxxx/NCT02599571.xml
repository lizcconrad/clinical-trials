      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of very low nicotine content (VLNC)
      cigarettes on smoking behavior, psychiatric symptoms and functioning, and acceptability and
      adverse outcomes in young adult smokers with ADHD. Participants will attend a screening
      session, 2 baseline sessions, 6 experimental sessions, and a 30 day follow-up visit.
      Participants will be asked to smoke only the study cigarettes that we provide for 6 weeks.
