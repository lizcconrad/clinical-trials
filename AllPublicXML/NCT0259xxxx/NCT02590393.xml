  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the nicotine and non-nicotine chemicals that
      are part of e-cigarettes and their effects on cigarette smokers by assessing smokers'
      experiences with different e-cigarettes using a battery of self-report, biochemical, and
      behavioral indices. This is not a smoking cessation study; smokers will not be asked to quit
      smoking, and e-cigarettes will not be used as a medical device or therapy.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will shed light on the behavioral effects of: 1) varying e-cigarette nicotine
      content, known to be important in maintaining conventional cigarette use; and 2) varying
      e-cigarette non-nicotine tobacco alkaloid (NNTA) content, about which little is known
      regarding the role in product use or dependence. The study will assess the effects of
      e-cigarette nicotine and NNTA content on cigarette smokers who will be randomized to
      conditions that manipulate the nicotine and NNTA content of e-cigarettes.

      The study will include N = 375 adult smokers of menthol or non-menthol cigarettes with
      randomization of enrolled participants to one of three groups (125/group).

      Group 1: Nicotine + NNTAs. (Standard Nicotine Standard NNTA group) E-cigarette cartridges
      will contain tobacco extract with nicotine + NNTA amounts in the range of typical commercial
      cigarettes, with a ratio of NNTA:nicotine that is also typical of commercial cigarettes.

      Group 2: Nicotine control (Standard Nicotine Low NNTA group). E-cigarette cartridges will
      contain the same concentration of nicotine, but 1/10th of NNTAs as in Group 1. This group
      will control for nicotine content and allow for evaluation of the roll of various levels of
      NNTAs in e-cigarette use.

      Group 3: Vehicle control (Low Nicotine, Low NNTA Group). E-cigarette cartridges will contain
      less than 1/10 of the nicotine in the other two groups, and NNTA levels will be
      correspondingly low. This group will control for changes in cigarette consumption that may
      occur due to study participation or to the non-nicotine behavioral/sensory factors entailed
      in e-cigarette use, which could influence cigarette consumption.

    <description>Participants will be asked to switch from cigarette use to use of e-cigarettes for eight weeks. E-cigarette cartridges will contain tobacco extract with nicotine + NNTAs in a vehicle of propylene glycol. The yields of nicotine and NNTAs will be in the range of typical commercial cigarettes (e.g., 0.6 mg nicotine delivered in 10 puffs of 35 mL), with a ratio of NNTA:nicotine yield that is also typical of commercial cigarettes.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to switch from cigarette use to use of e-cigarettes for eight weeks. E-cigarette cartridges will contain the same concentration of nicotine, but very low amounts (1/10th) of NNTAs as in Group 1. This specialized product will be developed from low nicotine, low NNTA content tobacco extract currently used in the &quot;Spectrum&quot; cigarettes offered as part of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) drug supply program. This extract will then be fortified with additional nicotine to match nicotine levels in Group 1. A propylene glycol vehicle will remain the same as in Group 1.</description>
