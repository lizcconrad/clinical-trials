    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the usefulness and safety of HD6610 granule for
      oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. The investigators examined the efficacy and safety
      of the treatment algorithm for 64 patients with colorectal cancer by evaluating the side
      effects and degree of improvement of subjective symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin is the third generation platinum-based cytotoxic agent, widely used in colorectal
      cancer, in metastatic disease and in the adjuvant setting . Moreover, oxaliplatin is being
      used as an alternative option to cisplatin in various cancers, such as ovarian, gastric.
      Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy is characterised by acute and transient cold
      hyperaesthesia in the hours and days following oxaliplatin infusion (&gt;90% of patients), but
      also by retarded chronic neuropathy due to the repetition of chemotherapy cycles (30-50% of
      patients). Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy impairs the health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) of patients and no preventive or curative strategies have as yet proven
      effective so far. Animal experiment show that HD6610 granule can relieve mouse's peripheral
      neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin. In clinical practice, the investigators also find that
      HD6610 granule can relieve patient's oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in the
      treatment of chemotherapy. So the investigators design this randomized, parallel-group,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study to estimate the efficacy and
      safety of HD6610 granule for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in colorectal cancer.

    <description>FOLFOX regimens are combination therapy of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m^2) administered as a 2-hour infusion on Day 1; leucovorin (400 mg/m^2) administered as a 2-hour infusion on Day 1; followed by a loading dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 400 mg/m^2) IV bolus administered over approximately 2 to 4 minutes on Day 1, then 5- FU (different dose like FOLFOX4/FOLFOX6) via ambulatory pump administered for a period of 46 to 48 hours.
XELOX is a combination therapy of Oxaliplatin 130mg/ m^2 d1 Intravenous infusion, every 3 weeks. and Capecitabine 1000mg/m^2 bid, days 1-14, every 3 weeks.</description>
