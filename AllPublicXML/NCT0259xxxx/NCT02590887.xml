  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the health effects of the 4 weeks intake of a drink
      manufactured from lupine protein hydrolysates in healthy volunteers. For that, blood markers
      of inflammation, oxidative stress, carbohydrate, lipid, protein and liver metabolism,
      together with general hematology and blood coagulation will be assessed at baseline time (day
      0) and after (day +14, +28 and +42) drink ingestion.

      The main objective of the present study is to verify the hypothesis that the intake of the
      drink based on lupine peptides has beneficial effects on the immune and oxidative status.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Assess the effect of the drink on biological parameters of the carbohydrate, lipid,
           protein and liver metabolism as well as hematology and blood coagulation.

        -  Assess whether the new product is well tolerated.

        -  Evaluate the effect of the drink on the general health of the volunteers through a
           general health test of 36 items.

        -  Determine the degree of drink acceptability through the acceptability Likert test.

    <description>Beverage drink containing 0.5mg/ml of protein hydrolysate extracted from food grade lupine flour. The drink will be formulated as 200 mL tetra brik subjected to a test of microbiological safety according to the Spanish law (RD 135/2010 of 12 February 2010). The final beverage shall consist of:
Oily phase: refined sunflower oil 5% w/w of the emulsion
Aqueous phase (water) 95% w/w of the emulsion, containing:
Hydrolyzed Lupine 0.5% w/w of the aqueous phase
Xanthan Gum 0.125% w/w of the aqueous phase
Sugar 6% w/w of the aqueous phase
The samples will guard and kept by the investigator until the day of delivery to the volunteers.
The duration of treatment is 4 weeks, during which the volunteers consume the contents of a tetra brik daily.</description>
