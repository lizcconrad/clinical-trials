    <textblock>
      This study has two main goals :

        -  to investigate the impact of aging on cortical excitability (CE)

        -  to investigate the impact of &quot;state dependency&quot; on CE, using a cognitive task and an
           emotional one.

      A Neuronavigation system of transcranial magnetic stimulation is used, and electromyographic
      response are recorded.

    <description>Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) from the first dorsal interosseous are register during the stimulations.
Intracortical Inhibition (ICI) and Facilitation (ICF) are a paired-pulse TMS measure of cortical excitability. A short Interval interstimuli (2ms) leads to a cortical inhibition, which reflects the GABAergic neurotransmission; whereas a longer interval interstimuli leads to a cortical facilitation, which reflects glutamatergic neurotransmission.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for an expected average of one month</time_frame>
    <description>Cortical Silent Period (CSP) is a single-pulse TMS measure of cortical inhibition, stimulations are applied while subjects are exerting a muscular contraction of the thum-index pinch and lead to a muscular cancellation. Duration of this silence is measured.</description>
