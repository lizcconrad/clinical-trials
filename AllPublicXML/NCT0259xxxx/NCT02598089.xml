  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two groups of
      subjects to receive seasonal trivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine (A/H1N1;
      A/H3N2 and B strains) or placebo (phosphate buffered saline). A total of 60 healthy male and
      female adults 18 through 45 years of age will be randomized to receive vaccine (30) or
      placebo (30).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, single center, double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Sixty
      (60) healthy male and female adults, 18 to 45 years of age, will be enrolled into the trial.
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment allocations: 30 to vaccine, 30 to
      placebo. The study will utilize a &quot;randomized block design&quot; to assure a balance of 1:1
      vaccine and placebo when all subjects are enrolled. The study will be double blinded, meaning
      the study subjects, investigators, and the sponsor will be unaware of the treatment allocated
      to each subject until the clinical trial database is declared final and locked. The study
      should take about 5 months to complete, with each subject involved for 3 months from the day
      of injection. The justification for the 3 month follow up, rather than 6 month follow up is
      that this is an inactivated vaccine that follows very standard manufacturing practices with
      standard antigens. The safety of inactivated influenza vaccines is well-established. Adding
      length to the follow up results in delays in future testing of the vaccine for licensure.
