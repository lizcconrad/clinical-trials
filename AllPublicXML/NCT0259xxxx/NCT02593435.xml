      Purpose:

        1. Screening of large samples is to search the gene mutation of the breast cancer
           susceptibility gene (BRCA1 and BRCA2) in Chinese high risk group.

        2. To build the breast cancer BRCA1/2 mutation database of Chinese group.

        3. To build the hazard model of breast cancer BRCA1/2 mutation of Chinese group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is the first large-scale and systematic study that fully recognize and review on the
      mutation spectrum of BRCA1/2 and the risk of Breast cancer in Chinese high risk group, it
      will be a Landmark research of susceptibility genes in Chinese breast cancer.

          2. Patients' age at diagnosis: 50 years or younger.

          3. Breast cancer patients: it must meet the one or more of the following family medical
             histories.

             3.1 Patients' age at diagnosis: 50 years or younger, and the one or more of the next
             of Kin has breast cancer.

             3.2 Patients' age at diagnosis: any of age, and the one or more of the next of Kin has
             breast cancer that its age at diagnosis was 50 years or younger.
