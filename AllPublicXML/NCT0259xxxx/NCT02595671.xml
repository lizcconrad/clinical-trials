      The purpose of this study is to carry out a field trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      b-SLIM digital Super Coach in a convenient sample of overweight and obese adults. The
      effectiveness will be evaluated at the individual level by means of a randomized trial. By
      combining or not combining the use of the b-SLIM digital Super Coach with a conventional
      physical activity and nutrition coaching, the effectiveness of the Super Coach of the
      (user-driven) 'Super Coach' compared to a conventional face to face weight loss program can
      be determined. Outcomes will be measured at the level of health behavior (i.e., physical
      activity and nutrition), body composition, physical fitness, psychosocial factors (e.g.,
      motivation) and program adherence. The field trial will take place in Leuven (Belgium).

      This study can be seen as a pilot trial. The central hypothesis of this field trial is that
      using the multi-source b-SLIM digital Super Coach will support and assist overweight and
      obese adults to change their health behavior (i.e., physical activity and nutrition) and to
      lose body weight by improving their self-control, self-determined motivation and attitude
      towards regular physical activity and healthy diet. The investigators will check if the Super
      Coach can be a valuable alternative for a conventional physical activity and nutrition
      coaching.
