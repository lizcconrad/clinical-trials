      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Healthy male subjects according to the investigatorÂ¿s assessment, based on a complete

             criteria:

               -  Chinese; born in China or ethnic Chinese born outside of China, and a descendent
                  of 4 ethnic Chinese grandparents who were all born in china

               -  Japanese; born in Japan, have lived outside of Japan &lt;10 years, and have parents
                  and grandparents who were all born in Japan

               -  Caucasian

          3. Age of 20 to 45 years (incl.)

          4. BMI of 18.5 to 25 kg/m2 (incl.) for Chinese and Japanese subjects, BMI of 18.5 to 29.9
             kg/m2 (incl.) for Caucasian subjects.

          5. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation.

          6. Male subjects who agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming pregnant by
             fulfilling any of the following criteria starting from at least 30 days before the
             first administration of trial medication and until 30 days after trial completion:

               -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. any of the following methods plus condom:
                  implants, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device

               -  Sexually abstinent

               -  Vasectomised (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to enrolment)

               -  Surgically sterilised (including hysterectomy)

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator

          2. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          3. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

             immunological or hormonal disorders

          5. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the trial
             medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia repair)

          6. Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          7. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

             QuantiFERON TB-Gold (or T-SPOT) test. Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold (or
             T-SPOT) test may participate in the study if further work up (according to local
             practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the subject has no evidence of
             active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established, then treatment
             must have been initiated and maintained according to local country guidelines.

          9. History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients)

         10. Intake of biologic agents other than current study medication or drugs considered
             likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the study

             interval

         13. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 90 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is greater) prior to planned administration of trial medication

         17. Drug abuse or positive drug screening

         18. Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

         19. Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

         20. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

         21. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

         22. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

         23. Have received any live bacterial or live viral vaccination in the 12 weeks prior to
             the date of screening. Subjects must agree not to receive a live bacterial or live
             viral vaccination during the study and up to 12 months after the last administration
             of study drug

         24. Have received Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in the 12 months prior to the
             date of screening. Subjects must agree not to receive BCG vaccination during the study
             and up to 12 months after the last administration of study drug

         25. Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study
