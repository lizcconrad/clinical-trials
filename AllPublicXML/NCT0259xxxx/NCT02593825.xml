      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of Sitting Together And Reaching To
      Play (START-Play), an intervention designed to target sitting, reaching, and motor-based
      problem solving to improve development and readiness to learn in infants with motor delays or
      dysfunction. There is limited research examining the efficacy of early physical intervention
      on infants with neuromotor dysfunction. In addition, most early motor interventions have not
      been directly linked to learning, despite the research demonstrating an association between
      motor activity and cognitive skills. START-Play specifically targets motor skills that lead
      to greater physical exploration, which has been associated with improved problem solving and
      global development. A randomized controlled trial of START-Play will be conducted across four
      states to investigate the impact of the intervention on changes over time in sitting and
      reaching, subsequent changes in global cognitive development, and the mediating influences of
      motor skill changes and problem solving. The research team will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial to evaluate the impact of START-Play on motor development, motor problem
      solving, global development including cognitive problem solving of infants with neuromotor
      delay and dysfunction. Infants will experience either the intervention or services as usual
      for 3 months, with following testing at three time points up until 9 months post
      intervention. The researchers will determine whether the intervention leads to improved
      sitting and reaching, which leads to improved motor-based problem solving, which leads to
      improved global development and problem solving.

      Setting: The research will take place in the homes of infants and their families in
      Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington, and Virginia.

      Sample: There will be approximately 140 infants with neuromotor disorders completing
      participation in this study, beginning at the age the age of 7 to 16 months, as well as their
      families and interventionists. Infants will have gross motor delays but be able to sit
      propped up for at least 3 seconds when they are recruited for participation.

      Intervention: Sitting Together And Reaching To Play (START-Play) is an intervention for
      infants with motor dysfunction or delay in which physical therapists visit the child's home
      to target work on siting, reaching, and problem solving. The therapist visits the home twice
      weekly for 3 months. During these visits, therapists and families work together to provide
      intensive, individualized, daily activities to advance reaching and sitting through small
      increments of challenge and support for these skills, which then become the building blocks
      for motor-based problem solving. More specifically, the intervention focuses on
      self-initiated, goal-directed movements to build orientation and attention to objects, while
      learning basic relationships of cause and effect. Infants and families in the intervention
      group will receive this intervention in addition to their usual early intervention services.

      Research Design and Methods: This study will use a randomized controlled trial in which
      infants and their families are randomly assigned to the intervention group (START-Play in
      addition to usual services) or control group (usual early intervention services), stratified
      by severity of neuromotor disorder. There will be six measurement sessions during the 12-week
      intervention period, following by assessments during 1-, 3-, and 9-month follow-up visits.
      The study aims to determine the efficacy of the intervention on sitting and reaching
      (proximal outcomes) and motor-based problem solving skills (longer-term proximal outcome),
      which is hypothesized to serve as mediators to the more distal outcomes of global cognitive
      development and readiness to learn. The investigators will also explore fidelity of
      implementation to identify conditions that support fidelity and outcomes, as well as identify
      other moderating factors related to the child (severity of disorder, health, age, cognitive
      skill at entry), family (socioeconomic status, home environment), or services (fidelity of
      implementation, other services provided to child) to explore change over time.

      Control Condition: Infants and their families in the control condition will continue to
      receive their regular Part C early intervention services.

      Key Measures: Primary outcome measures in the study include the Gross Motor Function Measure
      and an observational measure of toy contacts for sitting and reaching, and the Individual and
      Growth Development Indicators (Early Problem Solving Indicator) and Bayley Scales of Infant
      and Toddler Development -Third Edition for problem solving and global development. Secondary
      measures include additional measures of postural control and reaching, child and family
      characteristics, and fidelity of implementation (logs and checklist).

      Data Analytic Strategy: The investigators will use linear mixed modeling (LMM) to determine
      the efficacy of the intervention on child outcomes. Parallel process growth modeling within a
      structural equation modeling framework will be used to examine whether improvements in
      sitting and reaching are mediators leading to improvements in problem solving, which is then
      a mediator leading to long-term global cognitive development. LMM will also be used to
      examine moderating variables, as well as secondary motor outcomes.

    <description>The START-Play group is a perceptual-motor approach, which uses self-initiated goal-directed movements to bolster orienting and attending to objects, while understanding basic relationships of cause and effect through manipulation and focused attention. Generally, activities focus on helping the child attend to significant environmental information, which can be correlated to forces useful for controlling posture and movement. Unlike passive movement therapy, the investigator's approach encourages activity and learning to solve problems linked by movement and manipulation of objects, which then scaffold cognitive skill; the focus is not on a &quot;normal&quot; movement pattern. Parents and children learn to problem-solve motor challenges, and link small motor changes to cognitive skills.</description>
