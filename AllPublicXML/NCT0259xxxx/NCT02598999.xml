      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending
      doses (MAD) of Hypothiocyanite (OSCN-), bovine lactoferrin (bLF) and their combination
      (ALX-009) in healthy male volunteers and patients suffering from cystic fibrosis.

      Part I: SAD of OSCN- and bLF in healthy male volunteers (cohorts 1 to 3) - Part II: SAD and
      MAD of ALX-009 in healthy male volunteers (cohorts 4 and 5) - Part III: MAD of OSCN- and bLF
      in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (cohorts 6 to 8) - Part IV: MAD of ALX-009 in
