  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Stroke Transitions Education and Prevention (STEP) Clinic is a new type of clinic
      designed for stroke patients and was established to provide a comprehensive approach to
      stroke risk factor reduction. The goal of this study will be more effective than usual care
      at reducing blood pressure in patients with poorly controlled blood pressure after an
      ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STEP clinic patients will receive personalized goals, instructions to self-monitor, a blood
      pressure monitor, prescription medications, sleep apnea screening, dietary counseling, and
      more frequent follow-up if needed. A stroke neurologist will see patients in the usual care
      group and recommendations will be sent to their primary care providers.

    <description>Patients will visit with STEP clinic staff (including a stroke nurse practitioner or stroke doctor) to receive personalized goals, stroke education (including diet and exercise), instructions to self-monitor using blood pressure cuff, and prescription medications Patient will be scheduled for additional clinic follow-up or be contacted for telephone follow-up for management of your blood pressure. Questionnaires will be administered to determine medication adherence and persistence (following instructions for prescribed medication), disability, depression, cognition, self-efficacy, and sleep apnea. The care plan determined by the STEP clinic will be shared with the patient's primary care provider.</description>
