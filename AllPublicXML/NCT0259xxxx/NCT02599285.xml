  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In AO Weber type C fractures, there is a combination of a proximal fibular fracture, a medial
      fracture or ruptured deltoid ligament, and a syndesmotic injury. Anatomical repair and
      reduction of the syndesmosis is essential to prevent diastasis in the ankle-joint. Widening
      and chronical instability of the syndesmosis is related to worse functional outcome and
      development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis in the ankle. There is limited biomechanical and
      clinical evidence that syndesmotic stability in AO Weber type C fractures with an additional
      posterior malleolar fracture can also be reached by fixation of the posterior malleolar
      fragment. Maybe, this is even superior to the usual treatment with syndesmotic positioning
      screws. Some authors concluded that stability of the syndesmosis in these fractures can be
      much more achieved by fixation of the posterior malleolar fragment than by placement of
      syndesmotic positioning screws alone. Another additional benefit of open reduction and
      fixation of the posterior malleolar fragment is that this will lead to an anatomical
      reconstruction of the syndesmosis. Although there is no current evidence, it is likely that a
      malreduction of the fibula in the tibial incisura will lead to a worse functional outcome on
      the long-term. No clear consensus in the literature is found as to which fragment size of the
      posterior malleolus should be internally fixed. The general opinion is that displaced
      fragments that involve more than 25% of the distal articular tibia should be fixed.
      Traditionally, reduction of these larger fragments is indirectly, followed by percutaneous
      screw fixation in anterior-posterior direction. Disadvantages are that it is hard to achieve
      an anatomical reduction, and that percutaneous fixation of smaller fragments is very
      difficult. Recently, a direct exposure of the posterior tibia via a posterolateral approach
      in prone position, followed by open reduction and fixation with screws in posterior-anterior
      direction or antiglide plate is advocated by several authors. This approach allows perfect
      visualization of the fracture, articular anatomical reduction, and strong fixation. Another
      advantage is that even small posterior fragments can be addressed. Several case series are
      published, which describe minimal major wound complications, good functional outcomes, and
      minimal need for reoperation.
