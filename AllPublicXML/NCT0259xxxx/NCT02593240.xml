  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worksites offer attractive locations for reducing the national prevalence of overweight and
      obesity. Interventions that are both effective and sustainable for producing long-term
      changes in health and employee wellness are urgently needed. In an 18-month worksite
      randomized controlled trial in 12 worksites this study will test two lifestyle approaches
      designed to facilitate behavior modification for achieving long-term improvements in health
      and quality of life. Worksites randomized to the immediate intervention arm will receive the
      two on-site wellness programs and the randomized control sites will participate in outcomes
      assessments for the initial 6 month period after which participants will receive vouchers to
      participate in the program of their choice. The primary focus of the worksite wellness study
      is to identify ways to improve health related quality of life, with a particular focus on a
      decrease in cardiometabolic risk factors, including weight, improved weight-related wellness,
      and improved energy level in work and life. The combination of 2 interventions will be tested
      against the control condition in an intention to treat model and with a completers analysis.

    <description>Intensive iDiet group behavioral weight loss program delivered in-person at the worksite or by videoconference and with support of the program's web platform. This intervention will be delivered by trained group leaders and will initially include weekly 1-hour support and education meetings of 20 participants/group with a message board for group communication and individual communication with the group leader. Over time support will be provided online rather than in live meetings. The intervention involves a weight loss behavioral program with particular emphasis on hunger reduction and craving control for both weight loss and prevention of weight regain. Ten participants per worksite per iDiet intervention arm will be randomized to receive commercial dried food products (partial supply) from Yevo Intl., which are designed to help with weight control and health.</description>
