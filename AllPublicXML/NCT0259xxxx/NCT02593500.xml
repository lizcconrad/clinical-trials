      A SINGLE CENTER, SINGLE DOSE, OPEN-LABEL, RANDOMIZED, TWO PERIOD CROSSOVER STUDY TO DETERMINE
      THE BIOEQUIVALENCE OF TWO INHALATION FORMULATIONS CONTAINING BUDESONIDE 200 µg ADMINISTERED
      AS 3 PUFFS (TOTAL DOSE OF 600 µg) IN AT LEAST 52 HEALTHY MALES AND FEMALES UNDER FASTING
      CONDITIONS

      The study objective is to determine whether the inhaled test product, budesonide 200 µg
      (pressurized inhalation suspension) and the inhaled reference product, Budesonida Pulmictan®
      200 µg (budesonide; pressurized inhalation suspension) are bioequivalent.

      For this purpose the PK profile of budesonide will be compared after administration of a
      single dose of 600 µg (3 puffs) of each of the two inhalation formulations, under fasting
      conditions.

      The sponsor has developed a new formulation (test product) of an existing medication
      (reference product) which is intended for a variation in the existing marketing
      authorization.

      The proposed study in healthy males and females is designed to establish a PK profile under
      fasting conditions for the orally inhaled test and reference products to evaluate
      bioequivalence.

      This will be a single-dose, open-label, laboratory-blind, randomized, two-period crossover
      study with inhalation administered budesonide200 µg conductedunder fasting conditions inat
      least 52 healthy males and femalesat a single study center.

      The study will comprise:

        -  Screening period, including serum cortisol levels and documented inhalation training, of
           maximum 21 days;

        -  Two treatment periods (each of which will include a profile period of 24 hours)separated
           by a wash-out period of 7 calendar days (minimum number of days based on half-life of
           the analyte) to 14 calendar days (maximum number of days based on logistical
           arrangements) between consecutive administrations of the IMP;

        -  A post-study visit within 72 hours of completion of the last treatment period of the
           study.

      Participants will be assigned randomly to treatment sequence, prior to the first
      administration of IMP.
