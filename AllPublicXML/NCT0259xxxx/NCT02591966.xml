      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of systemic treatments on genomic
      profiles in patients with breast cancer and to compare genomic profiling between
      premenopausal and postmenopausal women by systemic treatments in breast cancer.

      Prospective single arm trial using three patients' cohorts. One-hundred patients for each
      cohort and a total of 300 patients (600 biopsy samples) will be entered to this trial.

      The hypothesis is that genomic alterations measured by CancerSCAN and cfDNA, Whole exome
      sequencing (WES), Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), FACS(Fluorescence-Activated Cell
      Sorting), cytokine and immunologic signature analysis would be different between pre- and
      post-menopausal women and would be predictive biomarkers for each cohort according to pre-
      and post-menopausal status. Three groups of patients will be recruited:

        1. The patients who receive neoadjuvant systemic treatments:

        2. The patients who have distant metastatic sites at first and recur from surgery:

        3. The patients who are going to receive first-line chemotherapy

          6. Patients must have acceptable bone marrow, liver and renal function measured within 28
             days prior to study as defined below:
