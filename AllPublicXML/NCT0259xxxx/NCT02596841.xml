  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) is based on computed tomography (CT)
      imaging, whereas lung function studies are used for staging and follow up. Lung diffusing
      capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is generally reduced but weakly correlated with the
      severity of CT-determined fibrotic process. A possible explanation of this finding is that
      DLCO is relatively insensitive to changes in alveolar membrane diffusive conductance (DMCO).
      Lung diffusion capacity for nitric oxide (DLNO) was strongly correlated with CT-determined
      amount of fibrosis/honeycombing in both usual and non-specific interstitial pneumonias.
      Moreover. Both DLNO and DMCO were below the lower limit of normality even in patients with
      small amount of fibrosis. Measurement of DLNO may provide a more reliable assessment of
      fibrotic changes than DLCO because it better reflects DMCO.

      Rationale: Lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is decreased in both usual
      interstitial pneumonia-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP-IPF) and nonspecific interstitial
      pneumonia (NSIP), but is weakly related to computed tomography (CT)-determined fibrotic
      changes.

      Objectives: To determine whether measurement of lung diffusing capacity for nitric oxide
      (DLNO) better reflects fibrotic changes than DLCO.

      Methods: DLNO and DLCO were measured simultaneously in 30 patients with UIP-IPF and 30 with
      NSIP. The amount of pulmonary fibrosis was estimated by volumetric analysis of visually
      bounded areas showing reticular opacities and honeycombing. Alveolar membrane conductance
      (DMCO) and pulmonary capillary volume (Vc) were calculated.
