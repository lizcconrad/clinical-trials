  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The morphologic change of microvessels has the clinical value to distinguish cancerous from
      non-cancerous mucosa. The aim of this study was to observe gastric mucosa microcirculatory
      hemodynamic changes real-time using pCLE, compare the differences between chronic nonatrophic
      gastritis and GIM; then evaluate the possible mechanisms associated with gastric mucosal
      blood flow in GIM.

      Consecutive patients with GIM under endoscopic surveillance or examination at Qilu Hospital
      from March 1 to September 31, 2015 were recruited into this study. Before the endomicroscopic
      examination, 20,000 U α-chymotrypsin and 80 mg dimethylpolysiloxane were given orally to
      remove gastric mucus. All patients were given intravenous injections of 1 ml of 2%
      fluorescein sodium (Baiyunshan Mingxing Pharmaceutical, Guangzhou, China) as an allergy test
      before procedures were carried out. Conscious sedation was achieved for each patient by using
      propofol and fentanyl, and vital signs were monitored during the entire procedure. After
      successful intubation of the endoscope into the gastric antrum, 1 mL fluorescein sodium
      solution was applied intravenously as a contrast dye. The CLE procedure did not differ from
      that of conventional colonoscopy, except for the additional storage of pCLE images and videos
      in the gastric antrum. Finally, targeted biopsy of the examined site was performed.

    <description>Flow determination cannot yet be done automatically. It requires a semi-quantitative analysis involving subjective assessment. Assessment of flow determination was based on the previously published consensus criteria, in which flow was classified into seven grades.
Flow was categorized as: &quot;linear flow&quot; (fast and continuous flow, like plastic tape without grainy), &quot;linear particle flow&quot;(fast and continuous flow, like ribbon with mild grainy), &quot;particle linear flow&quot;(fast and continuous flow, like cotton tape with obvious grainy), &quot;particle flow&quot;(sluggish flow like mud-sand flow), &quot;slowly particle flow&quot;(slow but continuous), &quot;particle of pendulum flow&quot;(swinging silt flow) and &quot;stagnate&quot;(no flow).</description>

    <description>We analyzed the CLE images by using Adobe PhotoShop CS6 software. Ten images selected randomly and good displays of the vascular network were chosen from each sample for the analysis of the vascular structures. The Picture Cutout Guide and straight line tool were used to manually measure the area and length of each vascular segment. Each vascular segment was labeled and measured. We defined the microvascular length as the ratio of microvascular area to the microvascular diameter. The final measurement results of the microvascular area and diameter are the average of the 10 groups' testing values, respcetively. The results were exported in an Excel file and reported as the mean ± standard error (SD) for each individual case.</description>

      Targeted fresh biopsy samples from each examined site were fixed in 10% pH neutral formalin,
      and embedded in paraffin. Slides of 4-um sections were deparaffinized and hydrated. After
      antigen retrieval and blocking procedures, Immunology and Histology Chemistry (IHC) staining
      for CD34 was performed by mouse anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody (ZM-0046, ZSGB-BIO, Beijjing,
      China) as per the manufacturers' instructions.
