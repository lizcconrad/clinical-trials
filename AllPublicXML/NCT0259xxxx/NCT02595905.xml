      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cisplatin works with or without veliparib in
      treating patients with triple-negative breast cancer and/or BRCA mutation-associated breast
      cancer that has come back or has or has not spread to the brain. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. It is not yet known if cisplatin is more effective with or without veliparib in
      treating patients with triple-negative and/or BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or without ABT-888 (veliparib) on
      progression-free survival (PFS) in each of the following groups: patients with germline BRCA
      (gBRCA) mutation-associated breast cancer, patients with germline BRCA wild-type breast
      cancer who have evidence of BRCAness phenotype, and patients with germline BRCA wild-type
      breast cancer who do not have evidence of BRCAness phenotype.

      II. To compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or without ABT-888 on PFS in patients with
      triple negative and/or gBRCA mutation-associated breast cancer and brain metastases. (Brain
      Metastases Cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with gBRCA mutation associated breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) with or without BRCAness phenotype, to compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or
      without ABT-888 on overall survival (OS), response rate, and clinical benefit rate.

      II. To compare the differential benefit of ABT-888 across the three groups using both PFS and
      OS as outcomes.

      III. For patients in the brain metastases cohort, to compare the efficacy of cisplatin with
      or without ABT-888 on OS.

      IV. For patients in the brain metastases cohort, to compare the efficacy of cisplatin with or
      without ABT-888 on intracranial and extracranial response rates (intracranial by Response
      Assessment Neuro-Oncology Criteria [RANO] and extracranial by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors version 1.1 [RECIST 1.1]).

      V. To compare toxicities of ABT-888 to placebo in each of the four groups separately.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of homologous recombination deficiency score (independent of other
      BRCAness markers) on response rate (RR) and PFS in patients treated with chemotherapy versus
      chemotherapy plus ABT-888.

      II. To evaluate the overlap among various markers utilized to define the BRCAness phenotype.

      III. To evaluate the combined impact of PAM50 basal subtype and BRCAness phenotype on RR and
      PFS in patients treated with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus ABT-888.

      IV. To evaluate the impact of BRCA1 mRNA expression (independent other BRCAness markers) on
      response rate (RR) and PFS in patients treated with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus
      ABT-888.

      V. Application of somatic BRCAness phenotype markers on metastatic tumor tissue to identify
      patients likely to benefit from platinum-based therapy and ABT-888.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and placebo orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and veliparib PO BID on days 1-14.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 9 weeks for 54 weeks,
      every 18 weeks until progression, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years after
      progression.

             controlled neurologic symptoms, defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy
             followed by 14 days of stable neurologic function prior to registration; patients with
             previously incidentally discovered or asymptomatic brain metastasis(es) must receive

             pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation; however, if at any point a
             previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time
             period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is
             responsible for beginning contraceptive measures

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated

             entered in the system

          -  Progressive Brain Metastases Cohort

               -  S1416 is one study with two cohorts; patients who have progressive brain
                  metastases after surgical excision and/or intracranial radiation will be in the
                  Progressive Brain Metastases Cohort and will require a baseline magnetic
                  resonance imaging (MRI); patients with previously treated brain metastases,
                  stable disease and stable neurologic function for 14 days prior to trial
                  registration will be in the Standard Cohort and may obtain MRI of the brain at
                  the physician's discretion; randomization and treatment is the same for both
                  cohorts

                  radiation therapy) must also meet the following criteria to enroll as part of the
                  brain metastases cohort:
