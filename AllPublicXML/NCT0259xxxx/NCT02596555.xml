    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, multinational, phase IV, interventional single-armed
      (management) trial will focus on the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a new oral
      anticoagulant in the treatment of patients with acute intermediate-risk PE based on validated
      imaging (echocardiographic or CT angiographic) and laboratory biomarker (circulating levels
      of cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides) parameters and their combinations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years

          2. Objectively confirmed diagnosis of acute PE by multidetector CT angiography,
             ventilation/perfusion lung scan, or selective invasive pulmonary angiography,
             according to established diagnostic criteria, with or without symptomatic deep vein
             thrombosis

          3. Absence of hemodynamic collapse, or decompensation, at presentation; Hemodynamic
             collapse or decompensation

          4. Intermediate-risk category of PE severity indicated by a positive (score ≥1)
             simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI), in combination with the presence
             of at least one of the following criteria at presentation:

               -  At least one sign of RV pressure overload/dysfunction on CT angiography or
                  echocardiography

               -  Signs of myocardial injury as indicated by elevated troponin levels

               -  Signs of (RV) failure as indicated by NT-proBNP levels &gt;600 pg/ml at baseline.

          5. Ability of the subject to understand the character and individual consequences of the
             clinical trial; signed and dated informed consent of the subject available before the
             start of any specific trial procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy (a negative serum or urine pregnancy test should be available for women of
             child-bearing potential before study inclusion) or lactation

             signing of informed consent

          6. Use of a fibrinolytic agent, surgical thrombectomy, interventional (catheter-directed)
             thrombus aspiration or lysis, or use of a cava filter to treat the index episode of PE

             enrolment

             antagonists or NOAC, for an indication other than the index PE episode, or for
             antiplatelet agents except acetylsalicylic acid at a dosage ≤100 mg/day;

          9. Active bleeding or known significant bleeding risk (e.g., gastrointestinal ulcer,
             malignant neoplasms, injuries or recent surgeries of the brain, spinal cord or eyes,
             recent intracranial bleedings, known or suspected esophagus varices, aneurysms or
             intraspinal or intracranial vascular abnormalities)

         10. Artificial heart valves requiring treatment with an anticoagulant

         11. Renal insufficiency with estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2

         12. Chronic liver disease with aminotransferase levels two times or more above the local
             upper limit of normal range

         13. Concomitant administration of strong inhibitors of P-glycoprotein like ketoconazole,
             cyclosporin, itraconazole or dronedarone

         14. Unwillingness or inability to adhere to treatment or to the follow-up visits

         15. Life expectancy less than 6 months
