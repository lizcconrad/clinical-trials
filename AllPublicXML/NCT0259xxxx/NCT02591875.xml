    <textblock>
      The &quot;LEONARDO&quot; study is a non-randomized, multicenter, prospective study in which consecutive
      patients indicated for Atrial Flutter isthmus-dependent (AFL) ablation will be enrolled.
      Patients can be treated with any market released catheter for ablation. The decision to
      perform the ablation of AFL will be made based on clinical evaluation of the investigators
      according to their clinical practice. The study does not require specific surgical
      techniques. Patient time commitment for the study is approximately 12 months.The study has
      been designed to describe the italian clinical practice in relation to the approach of AFL
      ablation. In particular, the investigators will describe the methods for the validation of
      ablation success, the techniques adopted, and the patient management approaches in the
      participating centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation of Atrial Flutter has become an accepted alternative to pharmacologic
      therapy.The current guidelines recommend the catheter ablation at the first episode of AFL
      (Class IIa) or in any case of recurrent episodes of AFL (Class I). Recent studies have
      already demonstrated a high degree of procedural efficacy (higher than 90%). However, there
      are still two main areas of investigation. First, what is the best method to obtain an
      effective lesion. Second, what is the most reliable method to validate the procedure
      success.The present study is aimed at investigating these aspects in the current Italian
      clinical practice.
