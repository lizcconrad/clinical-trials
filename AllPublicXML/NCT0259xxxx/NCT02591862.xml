      Coversin in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with resistance to
      Eculizumab due to complement C5 polymorphisms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coversin, a small protein complement C5 inhibitor which prevents the cleavage of C5 by C5
      convertase into C5a and C5b, will be used in an open label, non-comparative clinical trial in
      patients with PNH and proven resistance to eculizumab due to C5 polymorphisms. Patients will
      be treated with Coversin by daily subcutaneous injection for 6 months in order to determine
      the safety and efficacy of the drug in these circumstances. If satisfactory control of the
      PNH is achieved, and at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), patients will have
      the option of remaining on Coversin and being entered into the long term follow-up study.

    <description>This is an open label, non-comparator study.
Patient will be given a single ablating dose of 0.57mg/kg per subject followed by daily repeat maintenance doses. The initial repeat dose will be 25% of the ablating dose. If this is insufficient to maintain complement inhibition at ≤10% of baseline (pre-treatment) level after 5 days of treatment the daily dose will be increased by doubling until that level of inhibition is achieved. In the event of 100% inhibition being achieved the dose may be titrated downwards at the PI's discretion until a satisfactory clinical result is obtained. If at any point in treatment complement inhibition falls to less than 50% of baseline a further ablating dose of 0.57mg/kg should be given.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled in this protocol will initially be treated with an ablating dose of Coversin and daily repeat maintenance doses calculated according to body weight, the ablating dose to be 0.57mg/kg. Thereafter the daily repeat dose will be titrated according to clinical response and complement inhibition determined by CH50 ELISA. The initial repeat dose will be 25% of the ablating dose and this will be adjusted up or down if necessary once steady state is reached (5 days).</description>
