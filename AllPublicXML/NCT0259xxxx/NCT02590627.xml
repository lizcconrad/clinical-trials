  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug efficacy testing is one of the most important tasks that is routinely undertaken by the
      National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) in Tanzania and has been recommended by the World
      health Organisation to monitor the efficacy of artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT)
      and possibly detect evolution/emergency of tolerance/resistance to these drugs. Currently,
      Artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) is the only ACT recommended by the Ministry of Health and
      Social Welfare and therefore testing of new ACTs such as dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      (DHA-PQ) is important because alternative drugs are urgently required. Meanwhile, NMCP is
      revising the guidelines for treatment of malaria in Tanzania and DHA-PQ has been earmarked as
      an alternative ACT to be used together with ALu. However, efficacy and safety data of DHA-PQ
      is missing since no studies have been done in Tanzania. Thus, a study is proposed to assess
      the efficacy and safety of DHA-PQ Vs ALu and provide important data which will enable the
      NMCP to make informed decisions; and possibly recommend DHA-PQ in the new Malaria treatment
      guidelines as the second line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in the country.

          -  Patients aged between 6 months - 10 years, without severe malnutrition and with a
             slide-confirmed mono-infection of P. falciparum, and asexual parasitemia between 250 -

             criteria without which a patient will not be enrolled into the study.

          -  Patients shall not be excluded on the basis of reported prior treatment with other
             anti-malarial drugs other than DHA-PQ within the past 24 hours if they have fever
             (axillary temperature &gt; 37.50C) and parasitemia.

          -  Patients should have stable residence within the catchment area throughout the study
             period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria will include: presence of general danger signs or signs of
             severe falciparum malaria according to the definitions of WHO (Appendix 6), severe
             anaemia (Hb &lt; 5 g/dL) and mixed or mono-infection with species other the P.
             falciparum.

          -  Others will include severe malnutrition (defined as a child whose growth standard is
             below -3 z-score or symmetrical oedema involving at least one of the feet or a
             mid-upper arm circumference &lt; 110 mm.

          -  Patients with febrile conditions due to diseases other than malaria (e.g. measles,
             acute lower respiratory tract infection, severe diarrhoea with dehydration) or other
             known underlying chronic or severe diseases (e.g. cardiac, renal and hepatic diseases
             and HIV/AIDS) will be excluded.

          -  Furthermore, patients under regular medication, which may interfere with anti-malarial
             pharmacokinetics and those with a history of hypersensitivity reactions or
             contraindications to the artemisinin-based therapy, piperaquine or the alternative
             treatment, will not be included into the study
