      Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical technique that involves the insertion of needles
      at acupoints to treat diseases by Jingluo (the system of meridians, through which energy is
      thought to ﬂow through the body in Chinese medicine). It is usually applied to relieve pain.
      Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture on
      the consumption of intra-operative anaesthetics and on drug-related side-effects, with
      promising results. Compared with acupuncture or electroacupuncture, transcutaneous electric
      acupoint stimulation(TEAS) is a non-invasive technique and has some advantages, including no
      risk of infections or needle-induced contagious disease and reduced fear of stimulation. It
      can potentially be applied by any anaesthetist or pre-operative personnel with minimal
      training.Thus, investigators conducted this controlled, prospective, double-blinded clinical
      trial to investigate whether treating by transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation
      combined with general anesthetic during peri-operative could alleviate the dosage of
      anesthetic drugs compared with control and sham group.
