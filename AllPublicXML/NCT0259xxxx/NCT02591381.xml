  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized non-blinded comparison of standard vs. transcorporal
      approach for placement of an artificial urinary sphincter in male patients with stress
      urinary incontinence after radiation and radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. In the
      United States, the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS), manufactured by American Medical
      Systems, is the gold standard surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in
      men. The cuff, which is the portion of the device that encircles and occludes the urethra, is
      typically placed directly around the urethra (i.e., &quot;standard&quot; placement). The cuff can erode
      into the urethra. Transcorporal placement has been introduced as a method to reduce the risk
      of erosion. Transcorporal placement involves tunneling the cuff through the erectile bodies
      so as to protect the dorsal aspect of the urethra. This approach has never been compared to
      standard placement in a randomized fashion. In the randomized trial, no additional procedures
      beyond the normal care protocol will be required of the patients. The investigators will
      conduct the study through an established, IRB-approved multi-institutional network of
      surgeons. Success will be assessed via objective and subjective methods; complications will
      be tallied in a standardized fashion. Outcomes will be measured at two years.

      Procedure/ Methods:

      Patients will be identified in the urology clinic upon their standard of care visit for AUS
      placement. The procedures that determine whether a patient is a surgical candidate are as
      follows:

        -  Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7) and Urinary Incontinence Symptoms
           index (ISI) standardized questionnaires

        -  Physical examination

        -  Review of medical history that would preclude surgery

        -  Cystoscopy to evaluate and rule out stricture

        -  Uroflow/Post void residual to ensure adequate bladder capacity

      Pre surgery work up includes:

        -  Urine analysis and if indicated urine culture and treatment of urinary tract infection

        -  Flow, post-void residual if possible

        -  Cystoscopy to rule out bladder neck contracture or urethral stricture

        -  History and physical examination

        -  Treatment of men with 2 days of chlorhexidine wash to the perineum

        -  Incontinence sexual function questionaires

        -  Aminogllycoside and other abx prior to surgery

        -  24 hour pad weight

      Post-surgery follow up:

        -  Routine removal of catheter within 5 days post-op

        -  Treatment of antibiotics post-operatively to be limited to 1 week

        -  Activation of AUS at 4-8 weeks post-op

        -  Incontinence sexual function questionnaires

        -  24 hour pad weight

      Routine follow ups will be conducted at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
      post-operatively, and yearly thereafter (SOC). Patient characteristics that will be collected
      include:

        -  etiology of the incontinence.

        -  pre-operative pad usage

        -  prior anti-incontinence procedures

        -  adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer such as radiotherapy, or other history of pelvic
           radiation

        -  post-operative urodynamic studies

        -  cystoscopy findings

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Standard placement of an artificial urinary sphincter involves a small incision made in the patient's perineum or scrotum and a fluid-filled cuff is placed around the bulbar urethra (the portion of the urethra between the bladder neck and penis). Connected to the cuff with tubing, is a balloon filled with fluid that is placed behind the pubic bone or in the space between the peritoneum and abdominal muscles. A control pump is placed in the scrotum and allows the device to cycle, thus either exerting pressure to close off the urethra or releasing pressure to allow the urethra to open and the patient to void.</description>

    <arm_group_label>TRANSCORPORAL AUS Placement</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Transcorporal placement has been introduced as a way to reduce risk of erosion and involves tunneling the cuff through the erectile bodies. The same incision is made as for the standard approach, and then an incision is made in each corpus cavernosum (cylinders of tissue that allow for erection). This allows the cuff to be placed around both the urethra and through the lining of the corporal bodies, increasing the bulk of tissue behind the urethra to protect it from erosion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients undergoing an AUS procedure would potentially be candidates for the study

        Exclusion Criteria: There are several situations in which either a TC or ST procedure would
        be specifically indicated, and it would be unethical to randomize these patients to the
        other procedure.

          -  No men without erectile dysfunction

          -  No use of injectable agents into the corporal body

          -  No prior urethral surgery (Prior surgery defined as; urethroplasty, urethral sling,
             prior AUS placement or explantation, recto-urethral fistula closure)

          -  No current penile prosthesis

          -  No concomitant placement of penile prosthesis at the time of AUS placement
