      The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a shear reduction surface on
      shear, pressure, and comfort used in pre-hospital ground transport.

      This study enrolled healthy adult volunteers of any race or gender, stratified into 3 Body
      Mass Index (BMI) categories (≤20, 20.1-24.9, ≥25), who served as their own controls. The
      setting for this study was on a closed driving course utilized for training of emergency and
      law enforcement personnel, and the vehicle used was a standard ground ambulance affiliated
      with the Medical Transport of a tertiary medical center.

      Apparatus and/or instruments: A commercial full-length LiquiCell® anti-shear mattress overlay
      (ASMO) (Birchwood Laboratories, Eden Prairie MN) was placed on the standard ambulance
      stretcher mattress. Shear force and tissue interface pressure was measured during a full
      stop, acceleration, travelling at 30 mph, deceleration, and a full stop by a PREDIA device
      (Molten Corporation, Hiroshima Japan) through reusable sensors attached to the sacrum,
      ischial tuberosity, and heel.

      Procedures: Following written informed consent, subjects were weighed and measured with a
      calibrated scale to calculate a current BMI. Three PREDIA sensors were secured to three sites
      (sacrum, ischial tuberosity, and heel) with double-stick tape. Subjects wore standard
      hospital scrub bottoms, and were secured supine to the ambulance stretcher using standard
      procedure. Subjects were blinded to the presence of the LiquiCell® ASMO overlay by a sheet
      covering on the stretcher. The ASMO was placed according to a simple randomization table. The
      stretcher was initially be placed with 0 degree head-of-bed (HOB) elevation, followed by
      subsequent HOB elevations of 15 degrees and 30 degrees. HOB elevations were verified using a
      standard goniometer. The ambulance traveled over a closed course driven by ambulance staff
      members that had passed the mandatory Coaching the Emergency Vehicle Operator (CEVO) driving
      course. The course included at maximum speed of 30 mph and 5 complete stops at each of 3 HOB
      elevations (0, 15, and 30 degrees). Shear measurements (measured in Newtons) and pressure
      measurements (measured in mmHg) for each anatomical site were taken with the PREDIA sensors
      during a full stop, acceleration, travelling at 30 mph, deceleration, and a full stop for
      each &quot;run&quot;. At the beginning and completion of each set of 5 runs, subjects were asked to
      rate their discomfort on a scale of 0 (no discomfort) to 10 (worst discomfort imaginable).
      Following the first set of 15 runs, the course was repeated with or without the LiquiCell®
      ASMO according to the randomization table.

    <description>Subjects were secured on a standard ambulance stretcher, with a shear and pressure sensors attached to the body. Starting at 0 degrees head-of-bed (HOB) elevation, the ambulance traveled on a closed driver training course accelerating up to 30 mph and decelerating to a stop 5 times. Shear and pressure measurements were taken during the runs. The HOB was then elevated to 15 and 30 degrees respectively, and the procedure repeated. Subjects were asked to rate their comfort at each of the HOB elevations using a 0-10 scale. Following the first set of 15 runs, the course was repeated with the LiquiCell® ASMO.</description>

Starting at 0 degrees head-of-bed (HOB) elevation, the ambulance traveled on a closed driver training course accelerating up to 30 mph and decelerating to a stop 5 times. Shear and pressure measurements were taken throughout the runs. The HOB was then elevated to 15 and 30 degrees respectively, and the procedure repeated. Subjects were asked to rate their comfort at each of the HOB elevations using a 0-10 scale. Following the first set of 15 runs, the course was repeated without the LiquiCell ASMO.</description>
