  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the most common cause of childhood death worldwide. Millions of children survive,
      but are left with impaired health. Sepsis-related Acute Kidney Injury (sAKI) is increasingly
      recognized as a significant factor associated with long-term mortality among different
      patient populations. Renal dysfunction and subsequent chronic kidney disease is implicated in
      the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The investigators overall
      hypothesis is that, in the pediatric population, sepsis-related AKI will have unrecognized,
      long-term consequences with regard to kidney function, endothelial function, blood pressure
      control, and overall health.

      This will be a two-arm cross-sectional control-cohort outpatient evaluation. Subjects with
      sAKI and a random selection of non-sAKI subjects who agree to participate in another study of
      quality of life survey will be asked to participate in the outpatient study. Subjects will be
      asked to come in to the Clinical Research Center for 24-hour monitoring and participate in
      the outpatient study where urinary and serum studies to measure glomerular filtration rate,
      renal plasma flow followed by blood pressure monitoring, peripheral arterial and applanation
      tonometry.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Glomerular Function Rate (GFR) filtration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Magnevist Gadolinium (GD)-diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid-bis-oleate (0.07 to 0.14 mL/kg) will be used to determine GFR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Renal plasma flow (RPF) filtration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>An injection of non-radioactive iodohippurate (0.07 mL/kg) will be administered to determine renal plasma flow (RPF) filtration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proteinuria will be measured in the urine</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Proteinuria may be a sign of renal (kidney) damage. Since serum proteins are readily reabsorbed from urine, the presence of excess protein indicates either an insufficiency of absorption or impaired filtration. People with diabetes may have damaged nephrons and develop proteinuria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cystatin C will be measured in the blood</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Cystatin C can be measured in a random sample of serum (the fluid in blood from which the red blood cells and clotting factors have been removed) using immunoassays such as nephelometry or particle-enhanced turbidimetry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Microalbuminuria will be measured in the urine</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The level of albumin protein produced by microalbuminuria can be detected by special albumin-specific urine dipsticks. A microalbumin urine test determines the presence of the albumin in urine. In a properly functioning body, albumin is not normally present in urine because it is retained in the bloodstream by the kidneys.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>24 hour ambulatory Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring will be performed using a commercially available device (TIBA Ambulo 2400) for 24 hours with measurements every 30 minutes while awake and every hour during sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peripheral Arterial Tonometry</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) device measures changes in the cutaneous circulation that correlate with flow-mediated dilatation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulse Wave Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Carotid-femoral and carotid-radial pulse wave velocities (PWV), validated markers of individual cardiovascular risk, will be determined by applanation tonometry using SphygmoCorVx technology (AtCor Medical). PWV is an index of the overall stiffness of a vascular segment between measurement sites 59. Thus, while carotid-femoral PWV is an index of the overall stiffness of proximal (central) arteries, the overall stiffness of peripheral arteries contributes relatively more to carotid-radial PWV.</description>
