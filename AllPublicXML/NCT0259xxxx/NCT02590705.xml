  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is carried out in a prospectively randomly controlled way. In the context of
      acknowledgement and understanding from parents, by comparing with traditional process(no
      anesthesia), lidocaine surface anesthesia is randomly selected. All children will be
      evaluated by the FLACC (The face, legs, activity, cry, consolability behavioral tool) scale
      to quantitatively assess degree of pain during lumbar puncture. Time and success rate of the
      lumber puncture will be recorded and analyzed. A questionnaire about bad memory during lumbar
      puncture for all parents and children will be investigated in order to establish an optimized
      lumbar puncture management process.

      The purpose of this study is to establish an optimized lumbar puncture management process on
      the basis of fully understanding of parents and children. An improved process consisting of
      painless lumbar puncture (LP) and comfortable LP will be established upon completion of this
      study.
