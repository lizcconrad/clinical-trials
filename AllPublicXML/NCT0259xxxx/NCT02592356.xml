      Baseline Visit:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the following tests and procedures at
      a baseline visit within 10 days after starting either cabozantinib or lenvatinib:

        -  Your height, weight, waist, and hips will be measured.

        -  You will have basic tests of your physical strength and balance. Your hand grip strength
           will be measured, you will be asked to rise from a chair without using your arms to push
           off, and you will complete a 6-minute walk test.

        -  You will have a full-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to measure the
           amount of fat and muscle in your body. Images from a standard computed tomography (CT)
           scan will also be collected and reviewed for this purpose. If you are scheduled only for
           a chest CT scan as part of your regular care, your abdomen will also be scanned at the
           same time for research purposes.

        -  You will meet with a dietician to talk about your current and past eating habits.

        -  You will fill out questionnaires about any pain or other symptoms you may have had;
           about any gastrointestinal (GI) side effects you may be having before you start
           chemotherapy; about the amount of physical exercise and activity you get; and about your
           food intake over the last 24 hours. Together the questionnaires should take about 20-25
           minutes to complete.

      You will be receiving cabozantinib or lenvatinib as part of your standard of care.

      Study Visits:

      After the baseline visit, you will have study visits on the following schedule. Some of these
      visits will be at the same time as your scheduled clinic visits with your regular doctor.
      However, some assessments will be done in between clinic visits online or by phone.

      Month 1 and 2:

      One (1) time every 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) during Months 1 and 2, you will fill out 3
      questionnaires at home:

        -  You will be asked about any gastrointestinal (GI) and other side effects you may be
           having. This will be done by phone and should take about 5-10 minutes.

        -  You will fill out an online questionnaire at home about your eating habits over the last
           24 hours. If you do not have internet access, you will complete the questionnaire over
           the phone with a member of the study staff. This should take about 10 minutes.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about any symptoms you may be having online or by
           phone. This should take about 5-8 minutes.

      At Months 3, 6, and 12 (± 4 weeks) you will come to the clinic:

        -  Your height, weight, waist, and hips will be measured.

        -  You will have the same tests of your physical strength and balance that you had at the
           baseline visit.

        -  You will complete the same questionnaires you completed at the baseline visit. These
           will be done on paper or on a computer or tablet.

        -  You will have a DXA scan to measure the amount of fat and muscle in your body.

        -  If you are having certain GI side effects (such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mouth
           sores, and so on), the study doctor will talk with you about receiving standard drugs to
           help with those side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the
           drugs are given and their risks. You may also meet with a dietician, who may recommend
           ways to help improve some side effects.

      Between clinic visits:

      °Two (2) times per month (+/- 1 week) between Months 3 and 6, and once a month (+/- 1 week)
      between Months 6 and 12, you will complete 3 questionnaires at home about your food intake
      over the past 24 hours; any symptoms you may be having; and any GI or other side effects you
      may be having. The questionnaires may be completed online or by phone and together should
      take about 20 minutes.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your participation in this study will be over after the Month 12 visit.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 25 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
