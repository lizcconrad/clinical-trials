    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the program effectiveness of home fortification along with infant and
      young child feeding (IYCF) counseling as a strategy to address anemia and complementary
      feedings gaps in a program setting of the Integrated Family Health Initiative being
      implemented by CARE India (a non-profit organization) in partnership with the Government of
      Bihar. The study also seeks to assess the field level worker experience with counseling and
      dissemination of home fortification products.

      This study evaluates the program effectiveness of home fortification along with infant and
      young child feeding (IYCF) counseling as a strategy to address anemia and complementary
      feedings gaps in a program setting of the Integrated Family Health Initiative being
      implemented by CARE India (a non-profit organization) in partnership with the Government of
      Bihar.The key objectives of this study are to examine acceptability and utilization by target
      population, assess impact on infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, evaluate impact
      on child growth, evaluate impact on hemoglobin concentration, and assess front line worker
      experience and motivation to disseminate enhanced counseling and home fortification products.
