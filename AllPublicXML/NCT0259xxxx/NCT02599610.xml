  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital vaginal examination is the most common method for assessing progress of labor and
      delivery. Considering it is the most common intervention women receive during course of
      labor, evidence for psychological effects of digital vaginal examination on women is
      surprisingly sparse. Reducing the number of vaginal examination during labor has been
      proposed by many authors as benefit of more vaginal examination is unclear. However this is
      unlikely to happen until more research on the topic demonstrates clear detrimental effects of
      vaginal examination.

      Our study is aimed at investigating association of vaginal examination with psychological
      distress of women during labor. Anxiety during labor is associated with longer labor
      duration, increased perception of pain, problems with newborn attachment, and increased rates
      of postpartum depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In this study, women were
      assigned to either digital vaginal examination or transperineal ultrasound assessment groups
      were compared to each other in a randomised controlled setting.
