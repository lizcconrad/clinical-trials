      This is a Phase 1, open-label, sequential, multiple-dose, drug-drug interaction study of GK
      activator HMS5552 and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study
      is to assess the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between HMS5552 and metformin in
      subjects with T2DM. The study is also to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HMS5552 with
      simultaneous administration of metformin in subjects with T2DM.

    <time_frame>13 days</time_frame>
    <description>HMS5552 and metformin PK parameters: PK parameters (Cmax) will be computed for each subject per day with non-compartmental methods using the actual sampling times. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the PK parameters per day (Days 3, 8 and 13).
The effect of metformin on the exposure of HMS5552 will be determined by a PK comparison between the exposure of HMS5552 on Day 13 vs. on Day 8. The effect of HMS5552 on the exposure of metformin will be determined by a PK comparison between the exposure of metformin on Day 8 vs. on Day 3.</description>
