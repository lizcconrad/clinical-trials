      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of triapine when given with
      radiation therapy and cisplatin in treating patients with stage IB2-IVA cervical or vulvar
      cancer. Triapine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking an enzyme needed for cell
      growth. Cisplatin is a drug used in chemotherapy that kills cancer cells by damaging their
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding triapine to standard
      treatment with cisplatin and radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of oral
      triapine when used in combination with cisplatin plus radiation therapy.

      II. To determine the oral bioavailability of triapine. III. To determine whether the
      metabolic complete response (mCR) rate of oral triapine in combination with cisplatin
      chemoradiation using fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)
      computed tomography (CT) at post-therapy (30 month) is at least 70%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral and intravenous triapine.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the overexpression of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) in archival tumor
      tissue is correlated with the antitumor activity of triapine.

      II. To determine the effect of combined modality treatment on activation of ATM
      serine/threonine kinase (ATM) and H2A histone family, member X (H2AX) and possibly other
      markers in peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of triapine.

      Patients undergo pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or intensity modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days per week for 5 weeks (25 fractions) with a 3-day boost in
      week 6, and 1 or 3 applications of low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy in week 6 or 5 fractions
      of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy at week 4 or 5. Patients also receive triapine
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 11 and orally (PO) on days 2-5, 8-10, 12,
      15-19, 22-26, and 29-33 within 90 minutes after pelvic irradiation, and cisplatin IV over
      90-120 minutes once weekly for 5 weeks (days 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30). Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
