  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet rich fibrin is a second generation platelet concentration which contains various
      growth factors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and biochemical efficacy of
      PRF in subjects of chronic periodontitis in the operation of conventional periodontal flap.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRF was developed in 2001 by Choukroun in France, it was the second generation fibrin
      adhesive, and was used to accelerate the soft and hard tissue healing. Many studies have
      shown beneficial effects of PRF on osteoconductive filler material in sinus lift operations,
      treatment of periodontal sulcus defect and treatment of furcation defects. Also PRF contains
      many growth factors. PRF accelerates periodontal regeneration through the gradually excreted
      growth factors and contributes to the bone regeneration. In this study, the investigators
      evaluated the effect of PRF on growth factors and its contribution to periodontal
      regeneration in subjects with chronic periodontitis.
