  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to measure economic burden of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) from a
      new point of view that includes consequences of disability on Quality Of Life (QOL), social
      participation and capabilities of patients and caregivers. To the investigators' knowledge,
      there is currently no data including intangible costs related to caregivers and calculating
      the overall economic cost of Multiple Sclerosis, particularly, in France.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate prospectively the economic burden of Multiple Sclerosis
      (MS) in France by calculating direct costs (medical and non-medical) and indirect costs and
      by estimating consequences of MS on utility (QALY) of patients and caregivers in a societal
      perspective.
