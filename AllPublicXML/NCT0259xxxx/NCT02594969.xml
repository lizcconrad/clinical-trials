  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is this study is to investigate the effects of dilute bleach on the skin of subjects
      with atopic dermatitis and those with healthy skin. The second goal is to evaluate the
      effects of different moisturizers on the skin barrier of subjects with and without atopic
      dermatitis. The investigators hypothesize that the bleach bath will increase the skin pH,
      decrease the skin hydration, and increase skin water loss in all study subjects. Secondly,
      the investigators hypothesize that moisturizers with the lowest pH and the highest water to
      oil ratio will result in improved skin barrier function. Furthermore, the investigators
      believe there will be a greater improvement in patients with atopic dermatitis.

      The study has two main parts. Subjects in both groups will have one forearm in a dilute
      bleach bath and the other arm in a water bath for 10 minutes. The change in skin will be
      measured using different painless devices. The second part of the study involves application
      of 4 various moisturizers. The change in skin will be measured over a period of time using
      the non-invasive devices.
