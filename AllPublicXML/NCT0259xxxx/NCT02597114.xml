  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AGT-181 is a fusion protein containing alpha-L-Iduronidase that is intended to deliver the
      enzyme peripherally and to the brain, when administered intravenously. This study is an
      extension of a safety and dose ranging study to obtain long term safety and exposure data, as
      well as information on the biological activity of the investigational drug
