    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the IQ-MAPLE project is to improve the quality of care provided to
      patients with several heart, lung and blood conditions by facilitating more accurate and
      complete problem list documentation. In the first aim, the investigators will design and
      validate a series of problem inference algorithms, using rule-based techniques on structured
      data in the electronic health record (EHR) and natural language processing on unstructured
      data. Both of these techniques will yield candidate problems that the patient is likely to
      have, and the results will be integrated. In Aim 2, the investigators will design clinical
      decision support interventions in the EHRs of the four study sites to alert physicians when a
      candidate problem is detected that is missing from the patient's problem list - the clinician
      will then be able to accept the alert and add the problem, override the alert, or ignore it
      entirely. In Aim 3, the investigators will conduct a randomized trial and evaluate the effect
      of the problem list alert on three endpoints: alert acceptance, problem list addition rate
      and clinical quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical problem list is a cornerstone of the problem-oriented medical record. Problem
      lists are used in a variety of ways throughout the process of clinical care. In addition to
      its use by clinicians, the problem list is also critical for decision support and quality
      measurement.

      Patients with gaps in their problem list face significant risks. For example, if a
      hypothetical patient has diabetes properly documented, his clinician would receive
      appropriate alerts and reminders to guide care. Additionally, the patient might be included
      in special care management programs and the quality of care provided to him would be measured
      and tracked. Without diabetes on his problem list, he might receive none of these benefits.

      In this study, the investigators developed an clinical decision support intervention that
      will identify patients with problem lists gaps. The investigators will alert providers of
      these likely gaps and offer providers the opportunity to correct them.

      In the first aim, the investigators will design and validate a series of problem inference
      algorithms, using rule-based techniques on structured data in the electronic health record
      (EHR) and natural language processing on unstructured data. Both of these techniques will
      yield candidate problems that the patient is likely to have, and the results will be
      integrated. In Aim 2, the investigators will design clinical decision support interventions
      in the EHRs of the four study sites to alert physicians when a candidate problem is detected
      that is missing from the patient's problem list - the clinician will then be able to accept
      the alert and add the problem, override the alert, or ignore it entirely. In Aim 3, the
      investigators will conduct a randomized trial and evaluate the effect of the problem list
      alert on three endpoints: alert acceptance, problem list addition rate and clinical quality.

    <description>Acceptance of the alerts:
This first endpoint is descriptive: the acceptance rate for the alerts presented to providers. This will be calculated by taking the total number of acceptances for each alert and dividing it by the total number or unique presentations of the alert. We will conduct a stratified analysis to look at differences in acceptance rates by institution, specialty, disease and provider demographic characteristics, and will report the results in tabular form.</description>

    <description>Effect on the rate of problem list completion:
In this endpoint, we will compare the number of study-related problems added to patient problems lists in the electronic health record in the intervention and control groups.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determining the quality of care impact of adding suggested problems to the problem list based on 4 outcome measures from NCQA's HEDIS 2013 measure set</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, or up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Effect on quality of care:
Because a key goal of our study is improving clinical outcomes, we have selected four outcome measures to evaluate from NCQA's Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) 2013 measure set: LDL control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, LDL control in patients with coronary artery disease, blood pressure control in patients with coronary artery disease and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension. The details for the numerator and denominator for each measure are given in the HEDIS manuals, and our study team will employ NCQA's procedures for calculation of each measure, with modifications as needed given the clinical nature of our dataset.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluating process measures using key process measures for each study condition from CMS, NHLBI, and NQMC</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, or up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Improvements for process measures To complete the clinical endpoints in the third outcome, we will also evaluate process measures, specifically frequency of LDL testing, prescription of antihyperlipidemic agents, prescription of aspirin or other antiplatelet agents and prescription of antihypertensive agents. We will analyze the results using logistic regression with fixed effects for intervention group (versus control) and site and estimation of the regression parameters with generalized estimating equations (GEE), accounting for clustering between the patients in the same physician as well as patients with different physicians in the same matched pair. We will build separate regression models for each quality measure, and also conduct a pooled analysis with additional effects for quality measure and availability of CDS for the associated measure at the site, in order to estimate the extent to which IQ-MAPLE's effect on quality is mediated by CDS.</description>
