  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of curcumin when given
      together with piperine (piperine extract [standardized]) in reducing inflammation for
      ureteral stent-induced symptoms in patients with cancer. Curcumin is a spice similar to
      turmeric and works by decreasing the chemical moderators that produce inflammation in the
      body. Piperine is pepper and works by increasing the amount of curcumin available in the body
      when taken with curcumin. Giving curcumin together with piperine may reduce inflammation and
      discomfort from a ureteric stent in older patients with cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a dose-escalation study with curcumin and piperine to derive a safe, optimal
      biological dose of this combination in cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the grade 2+ toxicities associated with curcumin and piperine. II. To evaluate
      quality of life associated with this combination by means of the Mayo Modified Urinary Stent
      Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the change in urinary prostaglandin E2 concentrations that occur at
      baseline and then after one week of curcumin + piperine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of curcumin.

      Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or thrice daily (TID) and piperine
      extract (standardized) PO on days 1-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Examined in an exploratory and hypothesis-generating fashion. The number and severity of all adverse events (overall, by dose-level, and by tumor type) will be tabulated and summarized in this patient population. The grade 2+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar fashion.</description>

    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of curcumin in combination with piperine</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD of curcumin in combination with piperine is defined as the highest safely tolerated dose level where at most 1 out of 6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) with the next higher dose having at least 2 patients out of a maximum of 6 patients experiencing a DLT. DLT will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Examined in an exploratory and hypothesis-generating fashion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life (QOL) by means of the USSQ</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Reported descriptively. Graphical methods and descriptive statistics will be used to describe the QOL data at baseline and after treatment. Change in QOL from baseline will be assessed via the paired t-test or non-parametric equivalent (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test). The questions from the USSQ will be summarized descriptively via frequency tables.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in prostaglandin E2 concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Graphical methods and descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the prostaglandin E2 concentration data. This will be done overall and by dose level. Changes will be summarized by reporting the mean and median percent change from baseline to post-treatment. Percent and absolute change from baseline will also be assessed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Fisher's Exact test will be used for assessing the association between categorical variables and the t-test will be used for comparing prostaglandin E2 concentration data across different patient subgroups of interest.</description>
