      Evaluation of the endometrial cavity is an important step in the infertility work-up,
      particularly if assisted reproductive therapy is planned. The aim is to identify possible
      endometrial abnormalities that may impair implantation.Undiagnosed endometrial abnormalities
      are present in 11 to 45% of women scheduled for in vitro fertilization (IVF).Traditionally,
      two dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (2D TVUS) and hysterosalpingography (HSG) are the
      basic methods for assessment of the endometrial cavity. However, these imaging modalities
      have shown high false negative rates among infertile women, a finding that could confine
      their rule to initial screening rather than definite diagnosis.

      Office hysteroscopy (OH) is the gold standard for evaluation of the endometrial cavity.
      Although the endoscopic approach has been proven to increase pregnancy rate in women who
      experienced prior implantation failure, evidence on treatment of unsuspected
      hysteroscopically-diagnosed endometrial lesions, to improve IVF outcome, is still lacking.
      Nevertheless,clinicians tend to use OH routinely prior to IVF because the psychological and
      financial burden that infertile couples may experience as a consequence of failed IVF cycle
      is unjustifiable.Yet, costs and invasiveness of OH counteract its global implementation to
      all women prior to IVF.
