    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic iron administered
      intravenously in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis
      (CKD-5HD). It is an open-label, two-period sequential dosing study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, 2-period, single-dose study assessing the safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate, or FPC) administered via
      dialysate and IV to pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years of age) receiving chronic hemodialysis
      (CKD-5HD).

      Total participation in the study is approximately three weeks and is comprised of a screening
      visit, two dosing (PK) visits, and a follow-up visit.

      Each patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered IV into the venous blood
      return line over the duration of the dialysis. At the next scheduled dialysis session each
      patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered via dialysate during a single
      hemodialysis session.

      Blood samples will be obtained at various times to analyze for serum iron parameters and for
      safety.

             screened again 2 weeks post resolution of the acute illness).

          3. Patient is receiving intravenous or oral antibiotics or antifungals for any infectious
             process. Prophylactic antibiotics administered on a regular basis are allowed.

          4. Patient has evidence of an ongoing active inflammatory process (e.g., systemic lupus
             erythematosus, acute or chronic active hepatitis, etc.).

          5. Patient has participated in an investigational drug study within the 30 days prior to
