  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence is defined as the extent to which a patient takes his or her medication
      as prescribed by their healthcare provider. One third to one half of all patients in the
      United States do not take their medication as directed, resulting in nearly $100B in
      avoidable hospital costs per year. Recent efforts to improve medication adherence in patients
      with multiple comorbidities have turned to case management and disease management programs.
      Connected monitoring devices offer an alternative- or supplement- to frequent nurse visits
      and outreach. These devices enable frequent monitoring and intervention but can also generate
      large volumes of data that can be difficult for care teams to manage. The present study
      explores the use of one such device- a technology-enabled, connected pillbox. Given the
      continued emphasis on bending the cost curve in US healthcare, clinical validation of tools
      that may improve the management of costly chronic diseases, such as diabetes, is essential.

      Randomized Control Trial Patients in the research treatment group receive pre-filled, 3x7
      disposable trays that separate their medication by dose and time (e.g. morning, afternoon,
      evening). These pre-filled trays are inserted into a connected, weekly pillbox that detects
      when pills are removed from its wells. Using this information, TowerView Health system is
      able to send automated text messages or phone reminders to patients to take forgotten or
      ignored medication doses. Medication adherence data from deployed pillboxes populates a
      software platform, which a research coordinator can access.

      Patients who miss 3 consecutive doses or 5 doses out of 12 over a 4-day period trigger an
      alert for the study research coordinator who can contact the patient via phone call. The
      research coordinator follows a scripted motivational interview in his or her outreach to
      determine the etiology of non-adherence. Patients reporting worrisome symptoms will be
      instructed to contact their provider directly and/or go to the emergency room for immediate
      attention. The investigator acknowledges that the current study actually involves multiple
      interventions: 1. The pre-filled medication trays are provided by a pharmacist, which
      overcomes medication access issues as well as the inconvenience of manually organizing
      medications. 2. The electronic pillbox, which monitors adherence that triggers text message
      or phone reminders in instances where patients forget or ignore medication doses 3. Research
      coordinator alerts, which trigger outreach events that employ a motivational interview in
      order to improve patient adherence.

    <description>The primary outcome of interest in the present study is improvement in adherence. We will determine if a multi-modal intervention focused on improving medication adherence among adults who were previously non-adherent results in improved medication adherence over a 6-month interval averaged across months 1 to 6.</description>
