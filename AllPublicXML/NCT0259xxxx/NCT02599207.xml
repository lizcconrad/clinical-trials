    <textblock>
      This study is a single site, phase I, prospective study of the safety of intravenous sibling
      cord blood infusion in 15 children ages 1-6 years with Cerebral Palsy (CP). All subjects will
      be treated with sibling cord blood cells. The first six will receive cord blood cells from an
      HLA-matched sibling. The following nine subjects will receive cord blood cells from an
      HLA-mismatched (≥3/6 match) or matched sibling. The duration of study participation will be
      six months from the time of the cord blood infusion.

      This study is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of a
      single allogeneic sibling cord blood infusion in young children with cerebral palsy. Children
      ages one to six years with uncomplicated cerebral palsy and an available HLA matched or
      haploidentical, qualified, sibling cord blood unit will be eligible to participate. All
      participants will receive a single intravenous infusion of allogeneic sibling cord blood. All
      participants will have an initial clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of cerebral
      palsy and determine eligibility. The main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion
      reactions as well as incidence of infections and graft versus host disease will be assessed.
      Functional outcome measures, described below, will be assessed at baseline and six months
      post sibling cord blood infusion and described.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥12 months and ≤ 6 years at the time of CB infusion.

          2. Diagnosis: Cerebral palsy with diplegia, hemiplegia, or quadriplegia.

          3. Performance status:

               -  Bilateral cerebral palsy (diplegia or quadraplegia):

             Gross Motor Function Classification Score levels II - IV, or Gross Motor Function
             Classification Score level I, age ≥ 2 years

               -  Hemiplegia: Gross Motor Function Classification Score levels II - IV or minimal
                  functional capabilities in the affected upper extremity. A subject classified as
                  GMFCS level I with significant upper extremity impairment will be eligible if the
                  affected upper extremity is used as an assist only.

          4. Review of brain imaging (obtained as standard of care prior to study entry) does not
             suggest a genetic condition or brain malformation.

          5. Suitably matched sibling donor CB unit (see section 6.2 for matching details)

             dose of ≥ 2.5 x 107 cells/kilogram.

          6. Legal authorized representative consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Available qualified autologous cord blood unit

          8. Concurrent genetic or acquired disease or comorbidity(ies) that could require a future
             allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          9. Requires ventilatory support, including home ventilator, CPAP, BiPAP, or supplemental
             oxygen.

         10. Impaired renal or liver function as determined by serum creatinine &gt;1.5mg/dL and/or
             total bilirubin &gt;1.3mg/dL except in patients with known Gilbert's disease.

         11. Possible immunosuppression, defined as WBC &lt;3,000 cells/mL or absolute lymphocyte
             count (ALC) below normal for age with abnormal T-cell subsets.
