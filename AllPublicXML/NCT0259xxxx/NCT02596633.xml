    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the feasibility of running a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of
      a psychotherapy called &quot;Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)&quot;, delivered in a self-help
      format with additional telephone support from a therapist, for people with Multiple Sclerosis
      (MS) and low mood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) suffer from emotional problems,
      therefore a large percentage of people with MS would be eligible to take part in a study
      offering a psychotherapeutic component to address these issues.

      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been found to be effective for mood problems, and
      been successfully used in self-help format, but no study has thus-far examined potential for
      use as an effective intervention in this (MS) population.

      People will MS and low mood will be recruited from a neurology outpatient clinic. They will
      be randomized to either receive treatment as usual, or an ACT self-help book with 8
      supportive telephone calls from a trainee clinical psychologist. Measures of anxiety,
      depression, quality of life and physical health will be administered at baseline,
      post-intervention and six month follow up. A sub sample of 10 participants will be
      interviewed to find out their view on taking part in the study.
