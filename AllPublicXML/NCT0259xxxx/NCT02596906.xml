    <textblock>
      Individuals aged 55 and older may experience negative effects of cognitive decline. The
      proposed research seeks to evaluate the benefits of different types of interventions:
      reasoning training following transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and reasoning
      training following sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on frontal- lobe
      mediated cognitive measures of executive control in adults with memory complaints, in the
      absence of dementia.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of reasoning training on individuals with
      complaints of changes in memory or thinking in the absence of dementia, when combined with
      transcranial current stimulation (tDCS). The reasoning training being studied is a strategy
      based program where individuals are taught strategies designed to engage the frontal lobes.
      Participants will randomly be placed into one of two groups (1) reasoning training following
      transcranial current stimulation (tDCS) as compared to (2) reasoning training following sham
      tDCS. The study will be done with adults between the ages of 50 and 80 with consistent memory
      complaints or lower baseline performance on memory measures. The primary hypothesis is that
      individuals receiving tDCS prior to brain training will have a stronger response to brain
      training than those in the sham tDCS group. Response to training will be measured by improved
      cognitive function and neural changes as measured by neuropsychological testing, MRI, and
      EEG. MRI will be used to evaluate the impact of reasoning training on brain blood flow,
      structure and function, and to measure changes in brain energy metabolism and
      electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate intervention outcomes. The reasoning training program
      will be conducted in small groups at the Center for BrainHealth.

    <description>Prior to the reasoning training, participants will undergo tDCS. Participants will receive 20 minutes of tDCS using 2mA or less targeting the inferior frontal gyrus prior to each of their 8 reasoning training sessions for a total of 160 total combined minutes. This time does not include set up time which should take no more than 5 minutes. A brief engaging film is shown to participants during the 20 minute session.</description>

    <description>For the sham tDCS group, the device will be turned off after 30s. The only reported sensations from tDCS is an itching or a tingling when the device turns on but disappears quickly. Thus, those receiving sham tDCS will be unaware that the device has turned off, and will experience an initial tingling similar to that received in the tDCS group.</description>
