  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preliminary laboratory science studies, the investigators show that proton pump inhibitors
      (PPIs) effectively inhibit human fatty acid synthase (FASN) and breast cancer cell survival.
      A preliminary retrospective study shows that PPI usage in breast cancer patients during
      chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival. The impact was most striking in
      patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, PPIs may be repositioned as safe
      and effective breast cancer drugs to enhance the effect of chemotherapy.

      Many of the hurdles that slow progress from target, to lead compound, to investigational
      agent, to standard therapy are not barriers for the PPIs. The PPIs are FDA-approved,
      chronically used, and well tolerated so the investigators can move quickly from the
      laboratory to a proof of concept clinical trial. Incorporating the PPIs into standard care
      will require more than the investigators propose here, but the investigators have already
      plotted the additional steps needed to truly impact patient care. If successful, the data
      gathered in this proposal will lend support to and guide development of a definitive
      randomized trial.

      Primary Objective

      • Estimate the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with triple negative
      breast cancer and FASN expression treated with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in
      combination with high dose omeprazole.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Quantify the number of patients with newly diagnosed TNBC with tumors that express FASN.

        -  Estimate the rate of pCR in patients with triple negative breast cancer (irrespective of
           FASN status) treated with standard NAC in combination with high dose omeprazole.

        -  Describe the safety of incorporating high dose omeprazole with standard NAC.

        -  Estimate the biologic activity of high dose omeprazole in modulating FASN expression and
           activity.

      This is a single arm Phase II study. Patients should begin therapy within 7 working days of
      study entry. Patients will be treated with omeprazole 80 mg orally twice a day (BID)
      beginning 4-7 days prior to chemotherapy and continuing until surgery. After the brief period
      of omeprazole monotherapy, patients will begin standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
      doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel
      (80 mg/m2) weekly x 12. Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) may be administered on a
      classical every 3 week or dose dense every 2 week (with growth factor support) schedule at
      the treating physician's discretion. Routine incorporation of carboplatin is not recommended,
      however use of carboplatin (AUC 6 on week 1, 4, 7, and 10) with paclitaxel is allowed at the
      treating investigator's discretion. Chemotherapy will be adjusted based on toxicity according
      to standard treatment guidelines. Patients with overt disease progression during AC should
      move immediately to paclitaxel therapy. Patients with disease progression during paclitaxel
      should proceed immediately to surgery.
