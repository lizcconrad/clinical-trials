  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If the participant decides to take part in the study, the participant will need to do the
      following:

      Visit the study clinic up to 10 times and be available for a reasonable amount of follow up
      phone calls to see how the participant is doing.

      The participant will receive three doses of vaccine injected into the muscle of the upper
      arm. After each injection the participant will be asked to remain at the study site for at
      least 30 minutes after the participant receives the study vaccine.

      The results of all of the participants blood tests, just like all other laboratory test
      results, will be provided to the Investigators, Sponsor, and vaccine developer. Positive HIV
      and viral hepatitis test results will be reportable to local health authorities according to
      local laws.

      The participant will be asked to refrain from excessive physical activities and alcohol
      consumption within 2 days before each clinic visit to avoid possible confusing effects on
      laboratory tests.

      Up to 10 normal healthy adult female subjects 18 to 35 years of age will be enrolled in this
      trial. A total of 3 injections of the vaccine will be given at Days 0, 28 (+4 days), and 56
      (+4 days). There are follow-up visits 7 days after each vaccination, one follow-up visit 28
      days after the 3rd (last) vaccination, and a final visit 3 months later. Blood and urine
      samples will be collected at each vaccination and follow-up visit. The participant will be
      asked to complete a telephone call follow-up at 1 year after receiving the last vaccination.

      Participants will be required to complete subject diary cards throughout the study until the
      telephone call follow-up at approximately Day 420 (i.e., 12 months following the 3rd and
      final dose scheduled for Day 56). Diary cards will be reviewed with the study staff at each
      visit and during the Day 420 telephone call.
