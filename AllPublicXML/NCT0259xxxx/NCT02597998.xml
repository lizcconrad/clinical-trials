  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the mass balance recovery from excreta of carbon 14
      labelled BI409306 ([14C] BI 409306) in healthy, CYP2C19 genotyped subjects and to provide
      plasma, urine and faecal samples for metabolite profiling and structural identification.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Healthy male genotyped as CY2C19 poor metabolizer (PM) or extensive metabolizer (EM)
             according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete medical history
             including a physical examination, vital signs (BP - Blood Pressure, PR - Pulse Rate),
             12-lead ECG (Electrogardiogramm), and clinical laboratory tests. PM is defined as
             carrier of two non-functional alleles *2 and *3 of the CYP2C19 gene (diplotypes *2/*2;
             *2/*3; *3/*3). EM is defined as carrier of two functional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene
             (absence of *2, *3, *17; diplotype *1/*1).

          2. Age of 30 to 65 years (incl.).

          3. BMI (Body Mass Index) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.).

          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation.

          5. A history of regular bowel movements (averaging 1 or more bowel movements per day;
             subjects with regular bowel movements of &gt;3 per day will be excluded).

          6. Subjects who are sexually active must use, with their partner, 2 approved methods of
             highly effective contraception from the time of IMP administration until 90 days after
             the last dose of IMP.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including BP - Blood Pressure, PR - Pulse Rate
             or ECG - Electrocardiogramm) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically
             relevant by the investigator

          2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          4. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          5. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders. Any significant history of ocular or eye disease.

          6. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the trial
             medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia repair)

          7. Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders
