    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study challenges the current widespread paradigm of discontinuing loop
      diuretics when initiating chronic HD and/or maintaining the dialysate at a constant
      temperature of 37 °C for all patients.

      This pilot/feasibility RCT will recruit for 18 months and demonstrate the feasibility and
      safety of performing a large scale study of diuretic use and/or cool dialysate examining
      recruitment, retention, and key outcomes. This study will further assess whether the use of a
      diuretic compared to non-use of a diuretic and/or the use of cool dialysate (35.5 ºC)
      compared to 37 ºC for up to 6 months will improve residual renal function (RRF), improve
      health reported quality of life (HRQOL) and reduce hospitalizations by randomizing 20
      dialysis-naïve patients (started chronic HD in the last three months) from DCI centers in the
      greater Albuquerque area, to either bumetanide and cool dialysate randomized in a two-by-two
      factorial distribution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary speaking language is English.

             in-center HD have been performed prior to randomization)

          -  HD takes place at one of the participating Dialysis Clinic Inc. (DCI) sites during the
             data collection period.

          -  Daily urine output is over 500ml.

             hospitalizations)

          -  Post kidney transplantation

          -  Currently in an acute or chronic care hospital

             incompetence)

             medical decisions and to sign the informed consent.

          -  Children and adolescents constitute &lt;2% of the dialysis population, and our
             preliminary survey of the study sites found no children and adolescents were active
