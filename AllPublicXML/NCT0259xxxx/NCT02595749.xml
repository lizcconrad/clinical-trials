  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Socioemotional processing dysfunctions (i.e., disruptions in affective, cognitive, and neural
      processes that encode, interpret, and respond to socially and emotionally relevant stimuli)
      have been implicated in tobacco smoking and relapse, however this potential target for
      medication development has not been systematically examined. Evidence from animal and human
      laboratories indicate that administration of intranasal oxytocin enhances socioemotional
      processing and may be efficacious for the treatment of drug addiction, including nicotine
      dependence. In order to evaluate the potential efficacy of intranasal oxytocin for smoking
      cessation, this laboratory-based proposal will examine whether intranasal oxytocin attenuates
      smoking lapse, nicotine withdrawal, and socioemotional processing disruptions in regular
      smokers following overnight abstinence.

    <description>Two 20 IU doses of Pitocin (oxytocin, USP; concentration = 10 IU/1 mL; PAR Pharmaceuticals, NY, USA) will be administered to each participant. Doses will be separated by 2 hours. Each 20 IU dose transferred into two, 1 ml intranasal atomizers and will be administered in four sprays to each nostril over the course of 10 minutes.</description>

Each placebo dose transferred into two, 1 ml intranasal atomizers and will be administered in four sprays to each nostril over the course of 10 minutes.</description>
