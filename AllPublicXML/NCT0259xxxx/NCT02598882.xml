    <textblock>
      Assessment of energy expenditure and the quadriceps muscle fatigue of healthy seniors, after
      two physical activities, being one of an activity guided by interactive video game (Xbox) and
      another on the treadmill. The participants will perform the activities in two different days,
      the order will be obtained by randomization.
