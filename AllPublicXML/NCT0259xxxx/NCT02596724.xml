    <textblock>
      Prospective observational registry that links results of the genomic and other molecular
      testing to treatment response and survival measures in patients who have been diagnosed with
      breast cancer and who are targeted for neo-adjuvant therapy. Analysis includes how tests
      impact treatment decisions and outcomes.

      Physicians will order tests on patients as part of standard of care; they will report whether
      test results influenced: selection between standard therapies or a clinical trial; offered
      insight into mid therapy treatment changes; or helped physicians determine what therapy to
      offer patients who do not have a complete pathologic response. Patient demographics,
      diagnosis, type of treatment, surgery and pathologic results will be recorded. Patients will
      be followed for 5 years. Recurrence and survival data will be recorded.

      Participating sites will submit de-identified patient data via electronic case report forms
      (eCRFs) into a secure study website.

      All patients are required to sign an Informed Consent Form. All investigators and staff will
      have Human Subject Protection Training.
