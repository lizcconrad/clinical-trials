    <textblock>
      Placenta previa and placenta accrete carry significant maternal and fetal morbidity and
      mortality. Several techniques have been described in the literature for controlling massive
      bleeding associated with placenta previa cesarean sections. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of the use of the cervix as a natural tamponade in
      controlling postpartum hemorrhage caused by placenta previa and placenta previa accreta.

      Background: Placenta previa and placenta accrete carry significant maternal and fetal
      morbidity and mortality. The maternal mortality in women with placenta accreta may reach as
      high as 7-10%. Several techniques have been described in the literature for controlling
      massive bleeding associated with placenta previa cesarean sections, including uterine packing
      with gauze, balloon tamponades, the B-Lynch suture, insertion of parallel vertical
      compression sutures, a square suturing technique and embolization or ligation of the uterine
      and internal iliac arteries, but there is a wide variation in the success rate of these
      maneuvers. In a case report, Dawlatly et al. (2007) described a simple technique of suturing
      an inverted lip of the cervix over the bleeding placental bed that was successful in
      controlling the bleeding, saving the patient's life, and preserving her uterus.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of this
      Dawlatly stitch as a natural tamponade for controlling postpartum haemorrhage in cases of
      placenta previa and/ or placenta previa accreta.
