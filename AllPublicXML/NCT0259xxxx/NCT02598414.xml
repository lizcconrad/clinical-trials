  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In colorectal surgery, anastomotic leak and its septic consequences still remain as the most
      concerning complications resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. A common
      determining factor for assessing the viability of a bowel anastomosis is adequate arterial
      perfusion to ensure sufficient local tissue oxygenation. Intraoperative near-infrared
      fluorescence (INIF) imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) dye is a novel technique which
      allows the surgeon to choose the point of transection at an optimally perfused area before
      creating a bowel anastomosis. Recently, the INIF imaging system has been installed on the
      robotic systems and this helps identify intravascular NIF signals in real time.

      Although reports from several case series and retrospective cohorts have described the
      feasibility and safety of this imaging system during robotic colorectal surgery, to date, no
      studies have addressed more systematically the outcomes of this technique in robotic surgery.
      Considering the limitations of these reports, investigators aim to conduct a prospective
      randomized trial to compare robotic procedures with or without INIF imaging in patients
      undergoing colorectal surgery.

    <description>Patient will have their bowel anastomosis assessed intraoperatively by near-infrared technology after indocyanine green has been injected intravenously at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. This procedure will be repeated twice during surgery, the first time before and the second time after the anastomosis has been done. The microvascularization at the anastomosis site will be assessed using a robotic fluorescence imaging device (FireFly™).</description>
