  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify baseline and/or pharmacodynamic biomarkers of response to
      ruxolitinib, based upon association with quantitative change in tumor size following 14-21
      days of neoadjuvant ruxolitinib in patients with operable HNSCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, ruxolitinib will be administered for a short period of 2-3 weeks prior to
      planned surgical resection of HNSCC. The dose will be 20 mg twice daily, the FDA-approved
      dose in myelofibrosis. The brief treatment duration is within the expected window of time
      that elapses from initial patient evaluation by a surgeon to performance of surgery. In the
      phase 0 or window trial model, a paired specimen analysis permits ex vivo evaluation of
      target modulation and pharmacodynamic changes in downstream or parallel molecular pathways.32
      This study design is optimal in order to assess the biochemical and immunomodulatory effects
      of ruxolitinib on HNSCC. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers can be developed as related to a
      clinical endpoint or a biochemical, pharmacodynamic endpoint.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, primary or recurrent, head and neck
             squamous cell carcinoma, including variants. Patients must have at least one
             measureable lesion in accordance with RECIST 1.1 (tumor diameter ≥ 1 cm; short-axis
             lymph node diameter ≥ 1.5 cm) OR by caliper measurement (tumor diameter ≥ 1 cm). Any
             diagnostic pretreatment biopsy sample is acceptable including FNA.

          2. Primary tumors of any head and neck (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx)
             site will be included.

          3. Surgical resection of head and neck must be planned, either as primary treatment or
             salvage. Patients must undergo research biopsy prior to receiving drug.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. ECOG performance status 0-2 (See Appendix I).

          6. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (sensitivity ≤ 25IU HCG/L) within 4 weeks prior to registration and will be repeated
             within 72 hours prior to the start of study drug administration.

          7. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use and utilize an adequate method of
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 12 weeks after study drug is
             stopped. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of
             the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy.

             childbearing potential (WOCBP) must practice acceptable methods of birth control to
             prevent pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within 4 weeks prior
             to registration, and this must be repeated within 72 hours prior to first receiving
             ruxolitinib. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive
             ruxolitinib and must not be enrolled in the study.
