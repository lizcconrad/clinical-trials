  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic ring fractures in the elderly are associated with high morbidity during standard
      conservative treatment due to immobility. Furthermore the risk of long term dependence even
      after the fracture has united is high. In analogy to the treatment of hip fractures in a
      similar patient population, patients might benefit from surgical treatment due to a reduction
      in pain and early mobilization.

    <description>Patients are placed supine on the carbon table. Screw paths are planned on a spiral CT scan from the sacrum on transversal slices, two Kirschner-wires 2.5 mm in diameter are introduced into the iliac bone through a stab incision and advanced into the ilio-sacral joint, through the lateral part of sacrum into the first and second sacral body, through the contralateral lateral part of the sacrum and exiting the contralateral iliac bone through the sacra-iliac joint with aid of CT-guidance. Over the Kirschner-wires 7.0 mm cannulated screws are introduced and the Kirschner-wires withdrawn. Several low-dose computer tomography scans are performed to secure the correct position. Total radiation dose is 300 mille gray square centimetres (mGycm).</description>

    <description>Mobilization guided by our physiotherapists. Full weight bearing is allowed. Analgetic treatment with metamizol, ibuprofen or paracetamol to the attending physicians discretion under regular surveillance laboratory values and/ or morphine or methadone. Patients will be treated with an individually based approach, if necessary involving our anesthesiologic pain service. Thrombo-embolic prophylaxis with a low molecular weight heparin or rivaroxaban for 6 weeks unless there is an indication for oral anticoagulation. All patients will be followed up by the Geriatric Fracture Center considering osteoporosis, fall prophylaxis, malnutrition and delirium. For the duration of the study the patients will not receive Parathyroid Hormone Substitution or Phosphonates.</description>
