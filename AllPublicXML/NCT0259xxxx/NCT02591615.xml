  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized phase II to determine if the administration of standard
      platinum-based chemotherapy before MK-3475 in with Chemotherapy naive stage IV Non-small Cell
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC) will improve the overall response rate (ORR) compared to MK-3475
      administered before chemotherapy. Patients will be given Pembrolizumab as maintenance up to 2
      years: Carboplatin and paclitaxel or pemetrexed every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks x 4 cycles
      followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel or pemetrexed every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While a genotype-directed strategy has been established as effective in treatment selection
      for patients with advanced NSCLC, only a minority of patients at this time will have a
      readily identifiable actionable molecular target. Furthermore, genotype-directed therapy has
      not been validated for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Therefore, the
      majority of patients with advanced NSCLC will continue to rely on standard platinum-based
      doublet chemotherapy. Given the plateau in effectiveness of this approach, novel treatment
      strategies are clearly warranted.
