    <textblock>
      Vergenix™ Flowable Gel is an advanced wound care device primarily made of lyophilized Type I
      recombinant human Collagen (rhCollagen) . Vergenix Flowable Gel is supplied as a powder
      contained in a syringe that will be hydrated with saline, forming a gel. The Vergenix™
      Flowable Gel provides a scaffold for cellular invasion and capillary growth. A secondary
      dressing to cover and secure the primary Vergenix™ Flowable Gel wound site followed by a
      final dressing application that will wrap the wound and surrounding area

    <description>Wound inspection is a combination of measures that includes assessing the wound grade (according to Texas classification for Neuropathic ulcers only), wound's area and depth, presence of granulation tissue and the percentage of wound area covered with granulation, quality of the granulation tissue (granulometer scale), presence and location of epithelialization, presence of necrotic tissue and percentage of wound area covered with necrotic tissue, amount and quality of wound's secretions, presence of infection.</description>

        lower limb:

        2.1. Neuropathic lower limb ulcer

        2.2. Venous lower limb ulcer

        2.3. Post traumatic lower limb ulcer

        2.4. Post operative lower limb ulcer

        3. In case of Neuropathic foot grade according to University of Texas

        Classification 1A

        4. Wound area measurement ranging between 1-20cm2.

        5. Ulcer defined as grade ≥E on the granulometer scale.

        6. Willing to adhere to the proper off-loading device (off loading cast,

        healing shoe) according to investigator recommendation.

        7. Female patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test at

        screening and be willing and able to use a medically acceptable

        method of birth control or declare that they are abstaining from sexual

        intercourse, from the screening visit through the study termination

        visit or be surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral

        oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or post-menopausal. Postmenopausal

        women are defined as women with menstruation cessation for

        12 consecutive months prior to signing of the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute ulcer

          2. Multiple Ulcers on the lower limb.

          3. Clinical evidence of infection in the soft tissue, joint and/or bone

             (osteomyelitis) as presented in the physical examination.

          4. The wound is penetrating into deep structures and involves bone,

             tendon or joint.

          5. Wound has necrotic tissue.

             presented in adjacent to the target wound.

          9. Clinically significant arterial vascular disease with Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) index

             for at least 5 years, may be considered for study entry.

         12. Patients who present with significant metabolic co-morbidity that

             would preclude wound healing such as end stage renal failure, dialysis

         13. Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology and blood

             chemistry lab tests at screening that in the opinion of the investigator

             might interfere with the patient's safety or participation in the study.

         14. Known positive HIV.

         15. Known history of a significant medical disorder, which in the

             investigator's judgment contraindicates the patient's participation.

         16. Known hypersensitivity and/or allergy to collagen.

         17. Drug or alcohol abuse (by history).
