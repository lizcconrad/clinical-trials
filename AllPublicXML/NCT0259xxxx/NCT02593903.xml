  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics following
      distal or mid-shaft hypospadias repair in influencing the rate of postoperative urinary tract
      infection and complications.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for using prophylactic antibiotics after hypospadias surgery is to decrease the
      occurrence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and complications. However, even though
      prophylactic antibiotics are used by some pediatric urologists, to date there has been no
      evidence supporting the role of prophylactic antibiotics in decreasing UTIs or complications.
      This is a prospective, randomized trial involving children undergoing distal or mid-shaft
      hypospadias repair. Subjects randomized into a group taking prophylactic dosages of
      antibiotics and a group not receiving post-operative antibiotics.

    <description>Urinary tract infection (UTI) will be diagnosed based on urine culture positive at 50,000CFUs per mL with one or both of the following: fever &gt;38 Celsius, or significant fussiness and irritability with voiding per parent report. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is known and expected in this population; therefore culture positive results alone will not be sufficient to meet the definition of UTI.</description>
