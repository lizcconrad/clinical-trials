  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacologic approaches to increase levels or actions of the vasodilatory peptide
      angiotensin-(1-7) are currently in development for the treatment of hypertension based on
      findings from animal models. There are limited and contradictory clinical studies, however,
      and it is not clear if this peptide regulates blood pressure in humans. The purpose of this
      study is to better understand the cardiovascular effects angiotensin-(1-7) in human
      hypertension, and to examine interactions of this peptide with the autonomic nervous system.
      The investigators propose that the difficulties in showing angiotensin-(1-7) cardiovascular
      effects in previous clinical studies relates to the buffering capacity of the baroreceptor
      reflex to prevent changes in blood pressure. Autonomic failure provides the ideal patient
      population to test this hypothesis. These patients have loss of baroreflex buffering and have
      low levels of angiotensin-(1-7) in blood. The investigators will test if angiotensin-(1-7)
      infusion can lower blood pressure in patients with autonomic failure, and will determine the
      hemodynamic and hormonal mechanisms involved in this effect.

      This is an inpatient study that requires at least four days of admission to the Vanderbilt
      Clinical Research Center. Autonomic failure patients will be placed on a fixed diet during
      the admission and will have routine tests performed for screening and clinical
      characterization. Patients will then receive intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) or saline infusion
      on two separate study days, with each study day lasting approximately 3 hours. There will be
      at least one washout day between study days. Patients will be instrumented with two
      intravenous catheters (one for blood sampling and one for drug infusion), arm and finger
      blood pressure cuffs, and sticky patches to measure heart rate during the study. The
      investigators will take baseline measurements of blood pressure and heart rate and collect
      blood samples. The investigators will also perform a rebreathing test to measure the heart's
      pumping capacity. After baseline measurements, the investigators will infusion
      angiotensin-(1-7) or saline for 50 minutes. There will be five doses of angiotensin-(1-7).
      Each dose will be maintained for 10 minutes. The investigators will measure blood pressure
      and heart rate, repeat the rebreathing test, and collect blood samples at the end of each
      dosing period.
