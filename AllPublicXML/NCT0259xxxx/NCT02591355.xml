  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet rich plasma (PRP) therapy is a novel therapeutic modality that has seen broad
      applications for a number of medical indications including those in orthopedics, dentistry,
      and dermatology. In dermatology, its uses have included treatment of chronic wounds and
      facial rejuvenation. More recently, anecdotal reports have suggested some efficacy in the
      treatment of hair loss, but to the best of our knowledge, there has been only one published
      case series documenting its use for this indication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to better assess the efficacy of PRP in hair loss, we therefore
      propose to study interval intralesional PRP injections for patients with androgenetic
      alopecia (AGA). Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss world-wide.
      Although there are currently numerous treatment options for this indication including
      minoxidil, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and follicular unit transplant, many of the medical
      treatment options have undesirable side effects, particularly in women of child bearing age.
      These well-documented adverse reactions include impotency, hypertrichosis, and birth defects.
