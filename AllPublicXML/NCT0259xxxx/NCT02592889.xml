    <textblock>
      Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is a common finding in patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The presence of a
      relevant FMR (grade ≥2) is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality. Cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to be effective in patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy and reduced LVEF. In selected patients, CRT has been linked to clinical
      improvement and reduced mortality. Importantly, 38% of patients with clinical indication for
      CRT present moderate or severe (FMR). Although FMR might be reduced after CRT, the
      persistence of a relevant FMR (≥2) after CRT ranges between 40% and 50% and is an independent
      predictor of no clinical response. In these patients, surgical FMR correction is frequently
      turned down as a result of a high surgical risk. Percutaneous repair of the mitral valve with
      the MitraClip system has demonstrated promising results in patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy and reduced LVEF5. In a cohort of patients with no response to CRT and FMR ≥2,
      Auricchio et al showed significant clinical improvement with LVEF recovery and reduction in
      left ventricle (LV) volumes after MitraClip. The absence of randomization, the retrospective
      nature of the study and the subsequent selection biases were however major limitations that
      impeded solid conclusions. The objective of the present study is to assess the efficacy and
      safety of the MitraClip system in non-responders to CRT and FMR ≥2.

      STUDY HYPOTHESIS:

      In patients with no response to CRT and significant FMR (grade ≥2, 100%), the MitraClip
      system will be associated with improved functional class, LVEF recovery and reduced LV
      volumes. To our knowledge, no registered randomized studies with a similar design are being
      conducted.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE:

      To compare the efficacy and safety of optimal medical treatment and MitraClip versus optimal
      medical treatment alone (control) in non-responders to CRT and symptomatic FMR ≥2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. CRT implanted between 6 months and 5 years before inclusion.

          2. Absence of clinical response to CRT defined by baseline NYHA 3 or NYHA 2 with a
             hospital admission for HF within the last 12 months.

          3. Adequate CRT therapy (correct stimulation in &gt;98% heart beats).

          4. Correct position of the cardiac leads.

          5. Patients with atrial fibrillation will be included but balanced in both groups (the
             presence of AF is and independent factor of clinical response).

          6. Wide QRS (&gt;0.12) and LBBB pre-CRT.

          7. LVEF 15-40% (as a surgical risk criteria).

          8. Left ventricle end-diastolic diameters &lt;75 mm (as anatomical criteria for MitraClip
             feasibility).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe Renal Insufficiency (DFGe &lt;30).

          2. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year.

          3. Anatomical contraindication for MitraClip (in order to avoid selection biases, all
             patients must be Mitraclip candidates).

          4. Hemodynamic instability before inclusion defined by SBP &lt;70 mmHg or the need of
             inotropic treatment within the previous 3 months.

          5. Inadequate treatment compliance or difficult follow-up.
