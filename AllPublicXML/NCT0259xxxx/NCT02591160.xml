  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the
      ambulatory setting. PHPT may be cured with surgery and indications for intervention have been
      defined and include urinary calcium/creatinine clearance. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the
      most commonly prescribed medication for hypertension, reduces urinary calcium excretion and
      confounds urinary testing. As a result, it is universally recommended that thiazide diuretics
      be stopped in advance of urinary testing. To date, no studies are available to provide
      evidence-based guidance as to how long HCTZ must be held for urinary calcium excretion to
      return to steady state in PHPT. The objective of this study is to serially calculate urinary
      calcium/creatinine clearance ration in patients with suspected PHPT while holding HCTZ to
      determine the minimum duration of medication cessation necessary for urinary calcium
      clearance to reach steady state.

      In this study, adult patients will submit serum and 24 hour urine samples prior to HCTZ
      cessation and at the following intervals after cessation: 4-6 days, 14-16 days, 28-30 days,
      adn 90-92 days. To minimize confounding variable, patients will take supplemental Vitamin D
      and Calcium, monitor their daily calcium intake, and monitor blood pressure weekly.
      Alternative, non-diuretic, antihypertensive medication(s) may be prescribed at the discretion
      of the enrolling provider.
