    <textblock>
      Since May 2010 the Department of Trauma, Basel University Hospital has performed surgical
      stabilisation of the posterior pelvic ring on 55 patients. These patients have not received a
      structured follow up examination or evaluation of outcome after surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Elderly patients (age â‰¥55y ears) of any ethnic / sociodemographic background

          -  Pelvic ring fracture after low energy trauma affecting the posterior ring or both
             (posterior and anterior ring)

          -  Surgical stabilisation of the pelvic ring at Basel University Hospital between May
             2010 and December 2014

          -  Ambulatory before surgery

          -  Informed consent for study participation by the patient or legal representatives

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal of consent by the patient or legal representatives to participate in the study

          -  Fractures within the last 3 months before follow-up

          -  Suspicion of a pathological fracture in the context of known or unknown malignancy

          -  Symptomatic low back pain with morphological changes, i.e. intervertebral disc
             displacement, neoplasm metastasis in the axial skeleton, spinal stenosis, vertebral
             fracture, spondylarthropathy etc.

          -  Pre-trauma mobility status that precludes achieving a post-trauma mobility status
             enabling the patient to perform the timed up and go test (e.g. patient in a wheel
             chair)
