  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether an early precut strategy in cases of difficult biliary
      cannulation could reduce the incidence of PEP compared with that after prolonged cannulation
      attempts. Secondary aims are to compare the success of biliary cannulation and complications
      rates of the two techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial the investigators assign patients
      referred for therapeutic biliary ERCP and difficult biliary cannulation (unsuccessful
      cannulation after 5 minutes) to early precut (group A) or repeated papillary cannulation
      attempts followed, in case of failure, by late precut (group B). Group A patients undergo
      precut immediately after randomization (&quot;early precut&quot;), while for group B cannulation
      attempts are continued for another 10 minutes, after which a precut is done if these fail or
      there are three unintended additional passages of the guide-wire into the MPD (&quot;delayed
      precut&quot;).
