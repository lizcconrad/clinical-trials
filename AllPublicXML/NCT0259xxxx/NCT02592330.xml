      The main aim of the study is to determine the safety and feasibility of a cultivated
      autologous limbal epithelial cell (CALEC) transplantation in the treatment of limbal stem
      cell deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center study to assess safety, feasibility, and efficacy of
      Cultivated Autologous Limbal Epithelial Cell (CALEC) grafts in 24 patients with unilateral
      limbal stem cell deficiency. The first 3 participants enrolled will receive the study
      treatment, CALEC, to assess for safety and feasibility. Subjects 4-24 will be randomized to
      either the study treatment, CALEC, or to the standard treatment for LSCD, which is
      conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAU) in a 2:1 ratio.

      Participants receiving the study intervention will have a corneal biopsy in their
      non-diseased eye, which will provide cells for the creation of the CALEC graft. The CALEC
      will be made at the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Laboratory, Dana Farber Cancer
      Institute and transported to Mass. Eye and Ear Infirmary for application to the participant's
      diseased eye during their standard corneal reconstruction procedure. Subjects randomized to
      the standard treatment arm will undergo CLAU surgery, with the biopsy performed at the time
      of surgery. Investigators, study personnel, and subjects will be aware of the study
      assignment, given the different procedures required for each, during and after surgery.
      Subjects will be monitored up to month 24 to assess for any delayed adverse events of the
      product (CALEC) or procedure as well as assessment of the durability of the transplant.

    <description>Cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cell (CALEC) therapy utilizes a bio-engineered composite of ex vivo expanded autologous corneal epithelial cells and an FDA-approved amniotic membrane (AmnioGraft®, Bio-Tissue, Inc.) to reconstruct the ocular surface. A small biopsy (2-3 mm2) from the patient's contralateral eye serves as a source epithelial (stem) cells that are expanded on the amniotic membrane in culture and the resulting product is surgically transplanted onto the cornea after excision of the fibrovascular pannus.</description>
