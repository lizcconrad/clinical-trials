  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the first leading cause of death in China, and is responsible for almost 22.4% of
      deaths. In approximately 80% of cases stroke is ischaemic, i.e. caused by disruption of blood
      flow to part of the brain from an acute arterial occlusion. Survival of penumbral tissue
      distal to an arterial occlusion depends on collateral circulation via the Circle of Willis
      and leptomeningeal anastomises. Collateral flow is dynamic and failure is associated with
      infarct growth. The presence of adequate collaterals has been shown to be associated with
      age, history of statin use, and non-hypertension. Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), isolated from
      the seeds of celery, and found to exert protective effects against ischemic brain and
      increase leptomeningeal blood flow. This study investigate whether NBP injection prescribed
      during acute stroke will have a significant effect to improve collateral circulation in
      patients of anterior circulation occlusion.

    <description>We use regional leptomeningeal score(rLMC) score to measure collateral circulation.rLMC score is based on scoring pial and lenticulostriate arteries in 6 ASPECTS regions(M1-6) plus anterior cerebral artery region and basal ganglia. Pial arteries in the Sylvian sulcus are scored 0,2, or 4.</description>
