    <textblock>
      This trial develops a non invasive diagnostic approach of IDH1 mutated gliomas combining
      mutation detection from free plasmatic DNA, D-2HG dosage in urine samples, and D-2HG
      detection by Brain Spectro MRI.

      In group 1 (25 patients), patients with presumed grade II-III gliomas candidate to surgery
      will undergo spectro MRI, plasma, urine dosages. Results will then be confronted to tumor
      mutational status and D-2HG.

      In group 2 (15 patients), patients with known IDH1 mutation will undergo spectro MRI, plasma,
      urine dosages overtime in order to correlate results with the response to treatment.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to develop and validate a non invasive diagnostic approach of IDH1
      mutated gliomas. It will evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of D-2HG detection by Brain
      Spectro MRI. This approach will be coupled with mutation detection from free plasmatic DNA
      and D-2HG dosage in urine samples.

      The primary end-point is the quantification of D-2HG by spectro-MRI, and the correlation with
      the dosage of D-2HG in the tumor fragment, and the mutational status (group 1: 25 patients).

      The secondary endpoints include:

        1. longitudinal analysis Spectro-MRI overtime (12 months) correlation with radiological
           evolution and the response to treatment (group 2: 15 patients)

        2. Differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation induced changes

        3. Confrontation of Spectro-MRI, D-2HG dosages and IDH mutation detection from plasma DNA,
           and elaboration of a combined score of prediction
