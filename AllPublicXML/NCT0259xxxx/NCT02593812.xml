  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study determines whether standard medical care (dopamine) affects learning and retention
      of a postural stepping task in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and whether training on a
      postural stepping task generalises to performance on an untrained postural task. Half the
      participants will train on the stepping task after they have taken their first dose of
      dopamine for the day (i.e. &quot;on&quot; medication state) while the other half will train on the same
      stepping task before taking their first daily dose of dopamine (i.e. &quot;off&quot; medication state).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor learning is critical for acquiring new skills and adapting behaviour, therefore the
      success of rehabilitation depends on successful motor learning through practice. Motor
      learning involves the basal ganglia, including both the associative and sensorimotor
      striatum. Although people with PD are capable of motor learning, they are less efficient and
      do not achieve the same extent of skill acquisition and retention as people without
      neurological deficit.

      Reductions in endogenous dopamine and reduced dopamine binding associated with loss of
      dopaminergic receptors due to disease progression may impair motor learning in people with
      PD. Conflicting evidence suggests that impaired motor learning in PD is due on the one hand
      to the absence of dopamine but on the other hand to &quot;overdosing&quot; of the basal ganglia with
      dopamine replacement therapy which suppresses activation of the associative striatum during
      the early acquisition stages of motor learning.

      Understanding which factors improve or degrade motor learning of tasks will allow
      rehabilitation parameters to be adjusted around standard medical care in order to optimize
      learning and improve the efficacy of exercise interventions for people with PD. In
      particular, successful learning of postural tasks that challenge stability may in turn reduce
      falls.
