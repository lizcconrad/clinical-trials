  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-arm, open-labeled, single-center, descriptive and exploratory safety trial using
      ADSC-SVF-002. ADSC-SVF-002 is an autologous adipose derived stem cell (ADSC)-containing
      stromal vascular fraction (SVF) obtained from subcutaneous fat harvested by liposuction from
      a patient. As a cellular therapy product, ADSC-SVF-002 (fresh or cryopreserved) will be
      administered subcutaneously via injection, with or without unprocessed autologous fat (fresh
      or cryopreserved), into soft tissue defects and abnormally healing wounds. The primary
      objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety of ADSC-SVF-002 in a population of
      subjects with soft tissue defects or abnormal wound healing who are still symptomatic despite
      being managed by conventional therapies.

      Protocol Number: SJS-CT-001 Phase: Pilot study Methodology: Open label, single-arm Study
      Duration: Six months after accrual and treatment of the last patient Study Center(s):
      Single-center Objectives: To demonstrate the safety of subcutaneous administration of
      autologous ADSC-SVF-002 in a population of subjects with soft tissue defects or abnormal
      wound healing who are still symptomatic despite being managed by conventional therapies.

      Number of Subjects: 10 Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Subject has soft tissue
      deficiencies, soft tissue post traumatic malformations, scars, and/or abnormal wound healing.

      Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen: ADSC-SVF-002. 1.0x106 cells/mL defect (when administered
      without fat) to 1.2x106 cells/mL defect (when administered with fat). Subcutaneous injection.

      Duration of administration: Administration of the product takes approximately 30 minutes.
      Administered once.

      Reference therapy: N/A

      Statistical Methodology: Safety outcomes will be reported with descriptive statistics.
      Secondary (efficacy) outcomes will be assessed relative to baseline (screening) as follows:

        -  For outcomes assessed at multiple follow-up visits, one-way ANOVAs followed by the
           Tukey's test will be conducted

        -  For outcomes assessed at one follow-up visit, a Student's t-test will be conducted.

      Data will be reported as mean Â± SD and p&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.
