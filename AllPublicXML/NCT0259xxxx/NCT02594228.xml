    <textblock>
      A primary aim of the current proposal is to compare the effect of daily consumption of
      healthy lean protein as either whey protein (2 meals per day) or whole food (25% of total
      daily caloric intake) consumed as 6 small meals throughout the day, one of which is consumed
      immediately following exercise training (within 30 min) and another 2 hours prior to going to
      bed at night, over a 16 week period on muscle and fat mass, cardiovascular health, aerobic
      fitness, glucose, insulin, blood lipids, heart rate and muscle strength in overweight men and
      women.

      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effects of increased healthy protein
      intake (25% of daily caloric intake as protein; 25% as healthy fats and oils; 50% as complex,
      unrefined carbohydrates) consumed as 6 small meals during the day in combination with
      exercise training 4 times per week, over a 16 week period in 25 overweight, but healthy males
      and females (30-60 yrs old). A secondary purpose is to compare the effects of consuming two
      of the 6 small meals during the day comprised of whole food protein source servings
      20g/serving) with a matched group consuming whey protein for 2 daily protein servings
      (20g/serving). In the case of both groups, 1 serving will be consumed immediately following
      exercise [within 30 minutes] and 1 serving will be consumed 2 hours before going to bed. On
      non-exercise days, all participants will continue to consume 6 small meals per day in the
      same ratio of 25% lean protein, 25% healthy fats and oils, and 50% complex, unrefined
      carbohydrates but the groups will differ only in the composition of the last meal of the day
      consumed 2 hours before going to bed in which one group will consume protein (20g/serving) as
      whole food protein sources and the other group will consume a single serving of a whey
      protein supplement. The primary purpose of this study is to quantify changes in the following
      health outcomes at baseline and 16 weeks: total body muscle mass and fat mass (iDXA);
      abdominal fat mass (most highly related to cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk); blood
      sugar (glucose); blood lipids; insulin, aerobic fitness (assessed with a submaximal exercise
      test); and muscular strength (measured by 1 repetition maximum (RM) of the chest and leg
      press). The following additional measures will be assessed at baseline and 16 weeks: waist
      circumference; body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and hunger (Visual Analog Scales).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each participant was screened prior to participating in the study using the Health and
             Fitness History, Physical Activity, and Physical Activity Readiness questionnaires
             administered by the investigators.

          -  Medical clearance was secured from the participant's primary care physician to verify
             no cardiovascular,metabolic or orthopedic issues that would prohibit them from
             performing the exercises for the duration of the study period

          -  Depending on the outcome of the health history, fitness and activity questionnaires
             and the physician's clearance, participants were informed of eligibility to
             participate in the study. A group meeting was scheduled for all eligible and
             interested participants to review the entire study. This process took place prior to
             administering any tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants were excluded if they smoked, had a whey protein intolerance, or
             orthopedic conditions that prohibited them from engaging in strenuous exercise
