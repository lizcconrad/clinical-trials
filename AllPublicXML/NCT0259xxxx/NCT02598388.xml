  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      different vaccination schedules of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo administered intramuscularly
      (IM) as heterologous prime-boost regimens in healthy and in HIV-infected adults.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter,
      2-part, Phase 2 study Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo in healthy and HIV infected adults. In part
      1, prime vaccination with MVA-Bn-Filo will be followed by boost vaccination with Ad26 14 days
      later in the US. In part 2, two regimens will be investigated. The first regimen will be Ad26
      prime vaccination followed by MVA-BN-Filo boost 28 days later and the second regimen will be
      MVA-BN-Filo prime vaccination followed by MVA-BN-Filo boost 14 days later in Africa. The
      study consists of a Screening phase of up to 8 weeks (starting from the moment the
      participants signs the ICF), a Vaccination Phase, in which participants will be vaccinated at
      baseline (Day 1) followed by a boost vaccination on Day 15 or 29, and a post-boost follow-up
      phase of maximum 1 year post-boost vaccination. Upon completion of 6-month post boost visit
      those participants who received active vaccine will enter long-term follow-up until the 1
      year post boost vaccination visit to assess long-term safety and immunogenicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be healthy in the Investigator's clinical judgment on the basis of
             medical history, physical examination and vital signs performed at Screening

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests and
             electrocardiogram (ECG) (only in participants &gt;50 years) performed at Screening. If
             the results of the laboratory screening tests and ECG are outside the institutional
             normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the Investigator
             judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or
             to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative urine Î²-human chorionic
             gonadotropin [beta-hCG] pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine [beta-hCG]
             pregnancy test immediately prior to each study vaccine administration

          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must be willing to
             use condoms for sexual intercourse beginning prior to prime vaccination until at least
             3 months after the boost vaccination, unless a vasectomy was performed more than 1
             year prior to Screening

          -  Participant must pass the test of understanding (TOU)

          -  Additional Inclusion Criteria for HIV-infected participants a) participants must have
             a positive HIV-1 and/or -2 serology test within 6 months of screening, including the
             day of screening; b) participants must have a Screening CD4+ cell count &gt;200
             cells/microliter (mcL); c) in part 1, all participants must be on a stable highly
             active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen for 4 weeks prior to Screening, in part
             2 participants with screening CD4+ cell count &lt;350 cells/mcL must also be on a stable
             HAART regimen for 4 weeks prior to Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received any candidate Ebola vaccine

          -  Diagnosed with Ebola virus disease, or prior exposure to EBOV, including travel to
             epidemic Ebola areas less than 1 month prior to Screening

          -  Has received any experimental candidate Ad26- or MVA-based vaccine in the past or
             received any other investigational drug or investigational vaccine or used an invasive
             investigational medical device within 3 months prior to Screening

          -  Known allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines
             or vaccine products

          -  Presence of significant conditions (eg, history of seizure disorders, (auto)immune
             disease or deficiency, any spleen disease, active malignancy, ongoing tuberculosis
             treatment, other systemic infections) or clinically significant findings during
             screening of medical history, ECG (only in participants &gt;50 years), physical
             examination, vital signs or laboratory testing for which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the participants (eg,
             compromise the safety or well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the
             protocol-specified assessments
