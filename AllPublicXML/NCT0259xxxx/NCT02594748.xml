  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the study are as follows:

        -  To improve self-management intention and behavior of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2
           DM).

        -  To promote patients to make plans for their self-management and gradually integrate the
           self-management plan into their daily life.

        -  To improve resilience, well-being, fatigue and quality of life of patients with T2 DM

      In order to achieve the aims, we have set the following objectives:

        -  To develop and apply self-management education program based on the extended theory of
           planned behavior.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the educational program:

             1. Self-management education program delivered face to face (intervention group); (b)
                standard usual care (comparison group).

      This study employs a quasi-experimental study design with an intervention and comparison
      group and follow-up of 3 months; there will be two measuring points (baseline and 3 months
      after the intervention) , and 9 measures.
