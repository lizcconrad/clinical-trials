  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies targeted biopsies in determining response in patients with
      prostate cancer undergoing high-dose-rate brachytherapy (a type of radiation therapy in which
      radioactive material sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters is placed directly into or
      near a tumor). Studying tumor tissue obtained before and after treatment may help doctors
      understand changes in a pathway that looks at how deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is repaired
      after it is damaged and to see if there are differences in the prostate tissue prior to and
      after starting androgen deprivation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate feasibility of obtaining adequate tumor tissue from an intra-prostatic index
      lesion prior to the start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and again at the time of
      high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Use immunohistochemistry to stain cells pre-ADT and post 2 months of ADT for markers of
      non-homologous end joining and DNA double strand breaks using the following markers: Ku70,
      Ku80, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunits (PKCs), gamma-histone family, member X
      (H2AX).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo biopsy at baseline before start of ADT and during brachytherapy.
