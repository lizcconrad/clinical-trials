    <textblock>
      The TELEX trial will establish whether telmisartan alone improves walking performance in
      people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The TELEX trial will also determine whether
      telmisartan plus supervised exercise improves walking performance more than either therapy
      alone. TELEX is a randomized controlled clinical trial (2 x 2 factorial design) of 240
      participants with PAD randomized to one of four arms: Group A: telmisartan + supervised
      exercise therapy; Group B: telmisartan + a &quot;no exercise&quot; control group; Group C: placebo +
      supervised exercise therapy; and Group D: placebo + a &quot;no exercise&quot; control group.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants will have PAD. PAD will be defined as follows. First, an ABI &lt;= 0.90 at
        the baseline study visit is an inclusion criterion for PAD. Second, potential participants
        who have an ABI &gt; 0.90 but â‰¤ 1.00 and experience a 20% or higher drop in ABI after
        heel-rise exercise will be eligible. Third, potential participants with an ABI &gt; 0.90 who
        have vascular lab evidence of PAD or angiographic evidence of PAD will be eligible.
        Finally, potential participants with a history of lower extremity revascularization who do
        not meet the criterion above and have an ABI &gt; 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in ABI after
        heel-rise exercise will be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Above or below knee amputation, critical limb ischemia, wheelchair confinement,
             inability to walk without a walker, or current foot ulcer.

          2. Walking is limited by a condition other than PAD.

          3. &gt; Class II NYHA heart failure or angina, increase in angina, angina at rest, or
             abnormal baseline treadmill stress test. Potential participants may become eligible
             following an abnormal baseline treadmill stress test if they have evidence of an
             absence of coronary ischemia based on testing with their own physician.

          4. Currently taking an angiotensin receptor blocker or an ACE inhibitor or use of these
             medications in the past three months.

          5. Currently taking aliskiren (Tekturna).

          6. Blood pressure &lt; 110/55 at baseline or potassium &gt; 5.0 meq/L at baseline.

          7. Blood pressure &lt; 100/50 after run-in or potassium &gt;= 5.5 meq/L at the end of run-in.

          8. Severe hepatic impairment defined by two or more liver function enzyme values greater
             than 2.5 the upper limit of normal.

          9. Acute decline in renal function on telmisartan, defined as a 30% or greater decline in
             eGFR following the two-week run-in as compared to baseline.

         10. Allergy to ARBs.

         11. Failure to successfully complete the 2-week study run-in, defined as failing to attend
             the health education and treadmill exercise run-in sessions and/or failing to take the
             study medication daily for 10 or more days in the two-week period (i.e. one pill per
             day for &gt; 10 days out of the 14 day run-in period).

         12. Surgery including lower extremity revascularization, coronary revascularization with
             stenting, or orthopedic surgery during the past 3 months or anticipated in the next 6
             months or myocardial infarction or stroke in the past 3 months.

         13. Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease
             requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy
             less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE:
             potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage
             cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent. Participants who only use
             oxygen at night may still qualify.]

         14. MMSE score &lt; 23 or dementia.

         15. Currently walking regularly for exercise at a level similar to the study intervention.

         16. Participation in another clinical trial or cardiac rehabilitation or completion of a
             clinical trial or cardiac rehabilitation in the previous three months. [NOTE: after
             completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will become eligible
             after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy study so long
             as at least six months have passed since the final intervention administration. After
             completing an exercise intervention or a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem
             cell or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up
             visit as long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the
             trial.]

         17. Non-English speaking, a visual impairment that limits walking ability, or a hearing
             impairment that interferes with study participation.

         18. Heart failure with an ejection fraction &lt;40% at baseline.

         19. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.
