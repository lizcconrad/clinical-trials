      The purpose of this study is to determine whether two types of short-term trauma-focused
      therapies (individual Narrative Exposure Therapy and group-based Control-Focused Behavioural
      Treatment) are effective in the treatment of chronic PTSD in earthquake survivors of Nepal.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health disorder after
      natural disasters. Without treatment survivors of earthquake would continue suffering from
      PTSD for many years. There are not many short-term trauma-focused psychosocial therapies that
      have been examined after natural disasters in developing countries. This study investigates
      the effectiveness of a 4-session revised narrative exposure therapy (NET-R), and 2-session
      group-based control-focused behavioural treatment (CFBT-R) delivered by non-specialists with
      minimum supervision.

      Methods/Design: Participants would be identified and recruited through a door-to-door survey
      of families severely affected by the 2015 earthquake in Bhaktpur municipality of Nepal. PTSD
      Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) will be used to screen all adult survivors (aged 18 and above)
      for the possible presence of PTSD, and the CAPS-5 interview will be used for the diagnosis of
      current PTSD. Investigators aim to include 240 consenting participants in a single blind
      randomised controlled clinical trial. All participants will be randomly allocated to one of
      three treatment conditions (N = 80 each): 4-session revised narrative exposure therapy
      (NET-R), 2-session group-based control-focused behavioural treatment (CFBT-R) involving
      instructions to conduct self-exposure, or a 3-month waiting list. In both NET-R and CFBT-R
      interventions, treatment sessions will last 90 minutes; NET-R will be delivered within a week
      while CFBT-R will be done over 2 weeks. All participants will be subjected to blind
      assessments for PTSD symptom severity with CAPS-5 and Fear and Avoidance questionnaire at
      pre-treatment (T0) and 3-month post-treatment (T1).

      Discussion: The results from the post-treatment measurement would provide strong empirical
      reference of the safety and effectiveness of trauma-focused short-term therapies (NET-R and
      CFBT-R) for mass trauma survivors in developing countries like Nepal. It may also provide
      information on who may benefit most from which type of intervention.

    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al, 2013) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing up the scores for each of the 20 items. The VA National Centre for PTSD has suggested a cut off score of 38 to screen for PTSD.</description>

    <description>CFBT is an intervention to facilitate natural recovery process by restoring sense of control over anxiety, fear, or distress. For this study in Nepal, a monitoring session will be added to the one-session group CFBT used by Basoglu and Salcioglu (2011), and the revised CFBT would be delivered to groups of 20-30 survivors. Each treatment session would be delivered within 1- 2 hours (90 minutes on average), at the interval of two weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Narrative Exposure Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>In Narrative Exposure Therapy the patient constructs a narration of his or her life, focusing on the detailed context of the traumatic experiences as well as on the important elements of the emotional networks and how they go together. This process allows the majority of persons to recognise that the fear/trauma structure results from past experiences and that its activation is just a memory. They thus lose the emotional response to the recollection of the traumatic events, which consequently leads to a remission of PTSD symptoms. Thus, they gain access to 'lost' past memories and develop a sense of coherence, control, and integration. Revised Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET-R, Zang et al, 2013) is a 4-session treatment delivered within a week.</description>

    <description>The Control-focused Behavioural Treatment (CFBT, Başoğlu et al 2005) for earthquake survivors was designed after 1999 Turkey earthquake as an intervention to facilitate natural recovery processes by restoring sense of control over anxiety, fear, or distress. Its underlying principle is to reduce helplessness responses by encouraging behaviours that are likely to enhance sense of control over stressor events and life in general. Its primary aim is to reverse traumatic stress processes by increasing anxiety or distress tolerance. In earthquake survivors, CFBT involves a single session in most cases and an additional few sessions in cases that do not respond to the initial session.</description>
