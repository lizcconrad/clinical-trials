    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that the Biguard stent system will lead to
      fewer target lesion failure compared to regular stent system in patients with coronary
      bifurcation lesions at one year.

      The current study is designed as a multicenter, randomized and prospective study aiming to
      compare the effect of Biguard bifurcation stent system and regular stent system in patients
      with bifurcation lesions. Based on the previous studies, the rate of 1-year target lesion
      failure was around 12% after PCI with regular stent system. And the investigators previous
      data showed that this event at 12-month after Biguard bifurcation stent system was 4%.
      Considering the lost to follow-up, it is anticipated that up to 400 patients will be enrolled
      in the trial. All patients will have repeat angiography at 13 months, with clinical follow-up
      to 2 years.
