  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of mini-trampoline training on balance, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength and
      neuropsychological parameters in an overweight or obese population are unknown. The aim of
      this 2-arm randomized controlled trial is to compare the effects of a 12-week mini-trampoline
      training and a 12-week nordic walking training on balance, fitness and strength in
      overweight/obese individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of literature suggests, that obesity is not only associated with medical
      conditions such as diabetes, but also linked to altered gait, impaired balance and a greater
      likelihood of falls. Weight reduction has been shown to improve balance controle. Methods to
      increase physical activity are largely not accepted in this population and those which
      conserve the musculoskeletal system are rare. Physical activity has been shown to influence
      mood, quality of life and eating behavior. Mini-trampoline training has been shown to enhance
      stability and increase fitness.
