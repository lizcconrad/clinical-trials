    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the investigators will assess the safety of two high-dose regimens of
      oral vitamin D supplementation and measure the effects of vitamin D supplementation on
      markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the blood and brain of study participants
      before, during, and after taking vitamin D supplements.

      The goal of the study is to establish research measures (i.e. biomarkers) and an optimal dose
      for vitamin D supplementation in boys with the X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) genotype.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior research suggests that higher vitamin D levels in the blood are associated with reduced
      brain inflammation among individuals with multiple sclerosis, a disease that is similar to
      the cerebral demyelinating form of ALD. However, serious side effects (e.g. hypercalcemia,
      kidney stones) can occur if vitamin D levels get too high.

      The current study is designed to establish a safe dose of vitamin D for boys with ALD.
      Although the doses chosen for this study are expected to be safe, the investigators will
      monitor participants for early signs of vitamin D-related toxicity. The investigators will
      also examine whether or not vitamin D supplementation affects markers of oxidative stress and
      inflammation in the blood and brains of ALD boys.

      The study requires participants to agree to at least one year of participation. Participants
      will be asked to take a vitamin D supplement every day, submit blood for analysis every 3
      months in the first year, and visit their study center (Stanford University or the University
      of Minnesota) every 6 months throughout the period of study.

      Participants will take 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 daily for a 6 month
      period, followed by an increase to 4,000 IU daily for at least 6 months thereafter. The
      vitamin D supplements will be provided by the study. In keeping with the current standard of
      care for ALD boys aged 3-12 years, participants will need to visit the study site every six
      months in order to complete a clinic visit and MRI of the brain with gadolinium. As part of
      this study, however, participants' will need to submit blood work every 3 months during the
      first year in order for the study investigators to ensure that the participants' calcium and
      vitamin D levels are in a safe range and to study the effects of vitamin D on markers in the
      blood. The MRI protocol during the first year will also include one additional sequence
      (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in order to measure brain metabolites.

      The data generated from this study are intended, in part, to help design a future,
      large-scale clinical trial to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is capable of
      reducing the risk of developing the cerebral demyelinating form of ALD.

    <description>For participants developing gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI, the investigators will compare the most recent preceding 25-OH vitamin D level with the average 25-OH vitamin D level of participants in the study who did not develop gadolinium enhancing lesions.

However, our current study is not sufficiently powered to measure this effect.</description>
