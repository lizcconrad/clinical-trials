  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to study the feasibility and safety of implementing Fetoscopic Endoluminal
      Tracheal Occlusion (FETO) therapy in fetuses with severe left Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia
      (CDH). The pilot study will determine whether FETO therapy can be performed safely and
      whether it can increase survival and decrease morbidity when compared to standard prenatal
      care for the treatment of severe left CDH.

          4. Isolated Left CDH with liver up

          5. LHR &lt; 25% - Gestation age at enrollment prior to 29 wks plus 6 days; O/E LHR 25- &lt;30%
             - gestation age at time of enrollment prior to 31 wks plus 6 days

          6. SEVERE pulmonary hypoplasia with US O/E LHR &lt; 25% (measured at 18 weeks plus 0 days to
             29 weeks plus 5 days) at the time of surgery; O/E LHR 25- &lt;30% (measured at 30 weeks
             plus 0 days - 31 weeks plus 6 days) at time of surgery.

          7. Gestational age at FETO procedure with O/E LHR &lt; 25% at 27 weeks plus 0 days to 29
             weeks plus 6 days; O/E LHR 25- &lt;30% at FETO procedure at 30 weeks plus 0 days - 31
             weeks plus 6 days as determined by clinical information (LMP) and evaluation of first
             ultrasound.

          8. Patient meets psychosocial criteria

          9. Informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient &lt; 18 years of age

          2. Multi-fetal pregnancy

          3. History of natural rubber latex allergy

          4. Preterm labor, cervix shortened (&lt;15 mm at enrollment or within 24 hours of FETO
             balloon insertion procedure) or uterine anomaly strongly predisposing to preterm
             labor, placenta previa

          5. Psychosocial ineligibility, precluding consent:

               -  Inability to reside within 30 minutes of The Fetal Center at Children's Memorial
                  Hermann Hospital. and inability to comply with the travel for the follow-up
                  requirements of the trial

               -  Patient does not have a support person (e.g. spouse, partner, mother) available
                  to stay with the patient for the duration of the pregnancy at The Fetal Center at
                  Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital.

          6. Right sided CDH or bilateral CDH, isolated left sided with O/E LHR â‰¥25% (measured at
             18 weeks 0 days to 29 weeks 5 days) as determined by ultrasound[1]

          7. Additional fetal anomaly and chromosomal abnormalities by ultrasound, MRI, or
             echocardiogram at the fetal treatment center. No cases will be removed post hoc if
             abnormalities are discovered in the course of post-operative monitoring

          8. Maternal contraindication to fetoscopic surgery or severe maternal medical condition
             in pregnancy

          9. History of incompetent cervix with or without cerclage

         10. Placental abnormalities (previa, abruption, accrete) known at time of enrollment

         11. Maternal-fetal Rh isoimmunization, Kell sensitization or neonatal alloimmune
             thrombocytopenia affecting the current pregnancy

         12. Maternal HIV, Hepatitis-B, Hepatitis-C status positive because of the increased risk
             of transmission to the fetus during maternal-fetal surgery. If the patient's HIV or
             Hepatitis status is unknown, the patient must be tested and found to have negative
             results before enrollment

         13. Uterine anomaly such as large or multiple fibroids or mullerian duct abnormality

         14. There is no safe or technically feasible fetoscopic approach to balloon placement

         15. Participation in another intervention study that influences maternal and fetal
             morbidity and mortality or participation in this trial in a previous pregnancy
