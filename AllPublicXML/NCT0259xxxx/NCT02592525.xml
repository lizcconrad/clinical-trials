  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will train health providers in home care teams across Quebec in shared decision
      making about the decision to stay at home or move to another location. This decision is one
      of the toughest for older Canadians. Decisions that are informed, shared and supported
      produce better results. An interprofessional approach to shared decision making is when older
      persons and their caregivers are supported by not just one but by all the professionals
      involved in their care.The impact of the training program in interprofessional shared
      decision making (IPSDM) above that of the passive dissemination of a decision guide will be
      assessed by measuring to what extent older persons caregivers say they took active part in
      the decision-making process.

      Other outcome measures will be:

      i) what option they chose, whether they feel conflict or regret about their decision, and the
      burden of care they feel; ii) the quality of life of clients;

    <description>To assess the proportion of caregivers reporting an active role, a modified version of the Control Preferences Scale designed to assess the role assumed in the decision making process will be used. The scale consists of a single question and is the one most frequently used in studies assessing the implementation of SDM in clinical practice.</description>
