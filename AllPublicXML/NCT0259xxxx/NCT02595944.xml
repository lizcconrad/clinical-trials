    <textblock>
      This phase III ALCHEMIST trial studies how well nivolumab after surgery and chemotherapy work
      in treating patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as nivolumab, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and kill tumor cells
      remaining after surgery and standard of care chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether adjuvant therapy with nivolumab will result in improved overall
      survival (OS) and/or disease-free survival (DFS) over standard observation in patients with
      stage IB &gt;= 4 cm, II and IIIA, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical
      resection and standard adjuvant therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of nivolumab when given as an adjuvant therapy.

      II. To evaluate and compare disease free and overall survival in patients with tumors that
      express programmed cell death ligand (PD-L)1 in various patterns associated with nivolumab
      and standard observation.

      III. To evaluate and compare disease free and overall survival in patients with tumors that
      have high mutational load associated with nivolumab and standard observation.

      IV. To evaluate OS and DFS by stage. V. To evaluate OS and DFS by each stratification factor.
      VI. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 1 year, 2 years, and
      5 years (OS and DFS rate).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 2 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients are followed serially with imaging.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then every 12 months for 6 years.

    <description>OS distributions will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate the treatment hazard ratios. The primary comparisons of OS will use a logrank tests stratified on the randomization stratification factors with a one-sided type I error rate of 2.0% for OS. Other comparisons of groups will be made using the logrank test and Cox modeling. Point estimates of all endpoints will be accompanied by the corresponding confidence intervals adjusted for the type I error rates associated with the endpoint.
