    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to test the effectiveness of persuasive messages targeted
      at parents who have children who consume inadequate amounts of calcium. Specifically, the
      effectiveness of the intervention material on increase a) the purchase of calcium-rich
      products by parents, and b) the consumption of calcium-rich products in the parent and child
      will be examined in 400 families across Canada. Families will receive either the targeted
      intervention materials or standard of care generic nutrition materials retrieved from Health
      Canada's website. Materials will be delivered to parents during weeks 0, 8, 16, and 22 of the
      study. Monitoring of parents' calcium product purchases and consumption behaviour in both
      parents and children will occur at week 0,12, 24 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and at
      52 weeks (i.e., 6-month follow-up). Purchases will be verified by grocery receipts made
      during the aforementioned weeks. Parents will self-report on their dietary consumption as
      well as their child's using a food frequency questionnaire. The study hypotheses are as
      follows:

        1. Parents in the experimental condition will purchase more calcium-rich products as
           compared to parents in the control condition.

        2. Parents and children in the experimental condition will consume more calcium rich
           products as compared to parents and children in the control condition.

        3. Perceived outcome expectancies of consuming calcium-rich products will increase to a
           greater extent in parents in the experimental condition as compared to parents in the
           control condition.

        4. Self-regulatory efficacy to consume calcium-rich products will increase to a greater
           extent in parents in the experimental condition as compared to parents in the control
           condition.

        5. Perceived social support and role modelling behaviour will be highest in parents in the
           experimental condition as compared to parents in the control condition.

        6. Self-regulatory efficacy and outcome expectancies will mediate the changes in
           calcium-rich product purchases and consumption.

    <description>The purchase of calcium-rich products will be assessed objectively via grocery receipts over a 7-day period.Receipts will be mailed to UBC Okanagan. Information provided within receipts will be entered into the ESHA nutrition analyses software. Specifically, changes in mg of calcium purchased will be examined over the above time points.</description>

    <description>A total of 21 outcomes will be assessed in relation to expected outcomes of consuming adequate calcium for the parent and 8 outcomes in relation to expected outcomes of the parents child consuming adequate calcium.

    <description>Distinct components of self-regulatory efficacy include confidence in one's ability to schedule, goal set, and overcome barriers to purchasing and consuming calcium-rich products. A total of 11 items will be assessed and the items will be scored on a scale from 0% (Not at all confident) to 100% (Extremely confident).</description>

    <description>The degree to which parents perceive themselves as offering support to their child in regards to consumption of calcium-rich products will be assessed using an adapted version of the Social Support for Diet Survey (Sallis et al., 1987). Questions will be adapted to pertain to the child's specific consumption of calcium-rich products.</description>

    <description>The degree to which parents perceive themselves as role modelling consumption of calcium-rich products will be assessed using an adapted version of Cullen and colleagues (2001) family and peer influences on fruit, juice and vegetable consumption. This measure was adapted in a similar way to the current study by Draxten and colleagues (2014).</description>

    <description>The experimental condition (EXP) will receive the targeted intervention material developed and designed by the researchers using focus group discussions with parents. This information will include salient benefits of the consumption of calcium-rich products. In addition, self-regulatory strategies will be provided to encourage purchasing and consumption of calcium-rich products and address any potential barriers to purchase and consumption. Material will sent on four different occasions via mail. At time one (week 0) participants will be sent a 13-month calendar, at time 2 (week 8) participants will be sent a grocery pad and a recipe book. At time 3 and 4 (week 16 and 22 respectively) participants will be sent a newsletter.</description>
