    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Targeted
      Therapy Fatigue (CBT-TTF) with fatigued chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients on
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy
      relative to usual care only in a small-scale randomized controlled trial.

    <description>Baseline versus follow-up fatigue will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) v.4, a 13-item self-report measure yielding total score with demonstrated reliability, validity, sensitivity to change and an identified Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MID).</description>

    <description>Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Targeted Therapy-related Fatigue (CBT-TTF) group will receive cognitive behavior therapy to help manage fatigue via FaceTime on an iPad, which will be provided to participants. Participants will meet with a trained therapist who will outline their therapy plan and will be taught how to use the iPad for upcoming therapy sessions. The sessions will initially be held weekly, but the therapist may schedule sessions at 1-, 2-, or 3-week intervals during the 18 week study period. The final session will be conducted either in-person at Moffitt or via FaceTime.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to Wait-List Control Condition will continue to receive care under direction of their Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) physician. Physicians will be informed by email of patients' participation on the basis of elevated fatigue and their randomization to WLC. Chart review and a patient self-report form will be used at baseline and follow-up assessments to determine what, if any, services or interventions participants received in the preceding 18 weeks that might address fatigue.</description>
