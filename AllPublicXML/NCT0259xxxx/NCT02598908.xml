  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participation in EQA schemes, where available, is mandatory for the United Kingdom
      Accreditation Service (UKAS). No EQA scheme currently exists for TPMT and thiopurine
      metabolites, which is a potential shortcoming of these tests. A pilot of this project has
      been awarded funding by Clinical Pathology Accreditation (CPA).

      The purpose of this work is to collect samples for an EQA scheme for whole blood TPMT
      (activity and genotype) and thiopurine metabolites, which will be run in collaboration with
      UK NEQAS (United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service), and facilitate a
      comprehensive world-wide service that enables laboratories providing these tests to fulfil
      quality goals and ultimately provide optimal patient care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) enzyme is involved in the breakdown of thiopurine
      drugs (such as azathioprine), which are commonly used to treat inflammatory bowel disease and
      autoimmune diseases. Different individuals in the population have different, genetically
      determined, levels of TPMT. An individual with absent TPMT activity has a high risk of
      serious side effects from thiopurine drug treatment. In routine practice, TPMT activity in
      the blood is measured before starting patients on thiopurine drugs to determine an effective
      and safe starting dose.

      Thiopurine metabolites are the breakdown products of thiopurine drugs and are monitored in
      the blood of patients on thiopurine drugs to optimise their drug dose.

      These tests are performed by laboratories across Britain and around the world. It is
      important for patient care that the results are of high quality and consistent across
      different centres. One way of assessing this is through an EQA scheme. No EQA scheme
      currently exists for TPMT/thiopurine metabolites, which is a potential shortcoming of the
      tests.

      Venous blood collected from NHS staff volunteers and SWBH outpatients, who have had TPMT
      measured as part of their routine care, will be distributed to participating laboratories
      every two months. Where it is not possible to find suitable blood donors, pooled surplus
      blood samples from the laboratory will be used instead. The laboratories will test the
      samples and return results to UK NEQAS for comparison. A report will be compiled allowing
      them to compare themselves with other centres and make changes where necessary.

      Up to 60 mL of EDTA blood will be collected from each of the selected volunteers by trained
      phlebotomy staff at Sandwell or City hospitals and virology tested just prior to the sample
      distribution.

      Surplus blood from routine specimens analysed for 6TGN and 6MMPN will be selected on the
      basis of thiopurine metabolite concentrations of interest and volume of blood remaining.
