  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the effects repeated isometric exercises have on balance, blood pressure, heart
      rate and pulse ox. Another outcome measure will be a mental speed test (how quickly a subject
      can process information and make decisions based upon that information).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete a mental speed test and will undergo Computerized Dynamic
      Posturography (CDP) testing using the modified Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in
      Balance (mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects will be required to stand on a hard or compliant
      surface (a 4&quot; tall foam cushion of known mechanical properties) in a comfortable posture,
      feet shoulder width, with eyes open or closed, head straight and arms to the side and free to
      move, gazing forward, and breathing normally. Immediately prior to the CDP testing, subjects
      will have their heart rate, blood pressure and pulse Ox measured. These will constitute the
      baseline information.

      Subjects will then be divided into two groups: the isometric exercise group (they will be
      instructed to perform specific isometric exercises three times a week, for the next 8 weeks)
      and the control group (no exercises will be prescribe to them).

      The same testing procedure indicated above will be followed at the end of the 8 weeks. The
      mental speed test, CDP testing, heart rate, blood pressure and pulse Ox will constitute the
      follow-up information.

    <description>Changes in heart rate at rest will be assessed between baseline (at enrollment) and after the treatment period. It will be used to investigate if isometric exercises affect it and how much.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Stability Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stability Score is calculated as percentage ratio of the actual sway and the theoretical limit of stability.
Changes in Stability Score will be assessed between baseline (at enrollment) and after the treatment period. It will be used to investigate if isometric exercises affect it and how much.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Blood pressure (measured in standard conditions) will be assessed between baseline (at enrollment) and after the treatment period. It will be used to investigate if isometric exercises affect it and how much.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Changes in Mental Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will be presented a series of word/image pairs and/or simple mathematical equations or number sequences. If a pair matches, the subject has to click the &quot;Correct&quot; button, if the pair does not match, the &quot;Incorrect&quot; button . However, if the word &quot;Opposite&quot; appears at the top of the screen, the asnwer needs to be reversed. The subject has up to 5 minutes to complete the task.
The Accuracy of the answers expressed as percentage will be used as measure of mental speed. Changes in Accuracy will be assessed between baseline (at enrollment) and after the treatment period. It will be used to investigate if isometric exercises affect it and how much.</description>
