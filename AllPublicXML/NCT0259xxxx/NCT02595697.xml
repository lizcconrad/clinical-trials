  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct an efficacy trial to determine whether an early
      communication intervention which blends two evidence-based interventions, Enhanced Milieu
      Teaching (EMT) and Joint Attention, Symbolic Play and Regulation Intervention (JASPER),
      improves social communication in toddlers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the blended intervention (J-EMT) in a parent-plus-therapist-implementation
      model that has been demonstrated to be effective with other populations.

      The J-EMT communication intervention is tailored to the specific social communication
      characteristics of children with ASD and is delivered during a critical period in early
      communication development for these children.

      In this study, the investigators compare this blended intervention (J-EMT) to a business as
      usual (BAU) comparison group. Children assigned to the J-EMT group will receive a total of
      48, 1-hour direct intervention sessions over six months that will include teaching their
      parents to implement J-EMT procedures across daily activities.

      The investigators will examine social communication and child vocalizations, expressive and
      receptive language, symbolic play, and symbol-infused joint engagement to determine whether
      J-EMT changes both a primary functional outcome and the underlying specific skills that
      contribute to effective social communication in children with ASD.

      Results from this study will indicate the efficacy of this variation of
      parent-plus-therapist-implemented EMT (i.e., J-EMT) specifically tailored to the
      characteristics of young children with ASD.

    <description>The J-EMT intervention:(a) teach foundational social communicative behaviors, (b) teach related skills that predict long term language outcomes, (c) teach a range of communicative functions, (d) target specific spoken language skills as well as foundational skills, (e) incorporate instructional methods, contexts, and partners that increase social use of language in natural contexts, and (f) promote generalization and maintenance of newly learned skills to everyday activities and routines. In addition, because parents are essential partners for young children with ASD who are learning to communicate, studies are needed that (g) include parents and (h) specify the method and fidelity of parent instruction and fidelity and dosage with which parents use the trained strategies</description>
