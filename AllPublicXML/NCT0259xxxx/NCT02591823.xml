  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low dose methotrexate used in rheumatoid arthritis is considered very safe and has a side
      effect profile very different from that seen with high dose methotrexate used in oncology.
      Hair fall has been found to occur in high dose methotrexate but there is no data regarding
      the same when methotrexate is used in low dose.Thus this observational case control study is
      being undertaken to determine whether rheumatoid arthritis patients really need to be
      concerned about hair fall when on low dose methotrexate.
