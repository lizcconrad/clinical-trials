    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to show better postoperative quality of life including lower
      incidence of dumping syndrome and comparable survival after laparoscopic pylorus preserving
      gastrectomy (LPPG), compared to laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) in patients with
      middle-third early gastric cancer

      Participating Surgeons

      Prior to this clinical trial, only the surgeons who are considered to have the
      standardization by review committee participated.

      Patients Registration

      It is required to ensure that the patients meet the inclusion criteria for this clinical
      trial, are free from any items of exclusion criteria, are explained about the participation
      in the clinical trial along with the informed consent forms.

      After rechecking the patients with the registration check list by accessing the web-based
      randomized program provided from Seoul National University Hospital Medical Research
      Collaborating Center.

      Each group 128 patients, total 256 subjects will be enrolled.

      Randomization

      The registration randomization should be done with 1:1 ratio for each researcher.

      Baseline number (BN) should be provided to the subjects in the order of acquisition of
      informed consent form. Based on the subjects who are selected as the appropriate subjects in
      the end, the allocation number (AN) shall be provided in the order of randomized allocation
      table.

      Procedure

      Operations are performed according to the allocated group.
