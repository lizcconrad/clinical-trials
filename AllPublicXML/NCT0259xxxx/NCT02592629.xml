    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this prospective study is to determine whether local anesthetics prior to
      subacromial steroid injections reduce pain and consequently if they are cost-effective in the
      treatment for shoulder pathology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a common problem that can be estimated to be prevalent in up to 15 percent
      of the patient population registered to general practices and is second only to back pain in
      patients seeking treatment for musculoskeletal issues in the primary care setting. As a
      common source of distress, shoulder pain contributes significantly to health care costs.

      Rotator cuff disease due to impingement, tendonitis or bursitis is a frequent cause of
      shoulder pain and dysfunction. Initial treatment consists of a conservative approach of
      activity modification, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and supervised
      physical therapy. However, if the patients' symptoms persist, subacromial injections of a
      local anesthetic such as lidocaine, and a corticosteroid may be indicated as a sequential
      treatment option.

      The steroid injection itself can be a painful process, so administering a local anesthetic
      prior to the steroid injection is thought to mitigate pain or reduce possible discomfort
      during and immediately following the procedure. Though there is evidence advocating for the
      benefits of combining local anesthetics and corticosteroids for the treatment of subacromial
      pathologies, it is not conclusive whether local anesthesia significantly enhances the pain
      relieving effect of steroids. Should local anesthesia not have a significant impact on the
      patient's pain intensity, then the use of corticosteroids alone could potentially result in
      reduced costs in care.
