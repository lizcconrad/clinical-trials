  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I/IIa clinical trial is designed to assess the feasibility of delivery and safety
      of Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived RPE Cells on a parylene membrane (CPCB-RPE1) in patients
      with advanced, dry age-related macular degeneration.

      Primary Objective:

      • To test the safety and tolerability of CPCB-RPE1 during and after subretinal implantation
      in patients with geographic atrophy with evidence of involvement of the central fovea.

      Secondary Objective:

      • To assess visual acuity, visual field, and retinal function after CPCB-RPE1 implantation.
      Implanted and fellow eyes will be compared post-implantation to assess the ability of the
      implant to prevent disease progression.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      • To assess the feasibility of measuring the change in area of geographic atrophy over time
      using spectral domain optical coherence tomography or fundus autofluorescence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include two cohorts, each of 10 patients. For the first cohort, the study
      population will be patients with advanced, dry AMD with evidence of significant geographic
      atrophy involving the fovea. These patients will have significant central vision loss with
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the eye to be implanted of BCVA of 20/200 or worse.
      Each of these patients will have substantial RPE and photoreceptor loss. Patients will be
      screened for overall health status to minimize risks associated with retinal surgery and any
      subsequent immunosuppression.

      As the safety and tolerability of CPCB-RPE1 is demonstrated in the first cohort, patients
      with less advanced disease will be recruited into a second cohort in this Phase I/IIa
      clinical trial. In this second cohort patients will have significant central vision loss with
      BCVA of the eye to be implanted of 20/80 or worse, but better than or equal to 20/400 with
      comparably less damage to the RPE/photoreceptor complex than Cohort 1. These patients will be
      screened in the same manner for overall health status to minimize risks associated with
      retinal surgery and any subsequent immunosuppression. Assessments of visual function will be
      the same as in Cohort 1.

    <description>Patients will receive one CPCB-RPE1 implant of approximately 100,000 differentiated RPE cells attached to a small parylene membrane. The density of cells on the membrane represents the approximate density of RPE cells in the human eye. The membrane size was chosen to cover a substantial portion of the macular region of the retina.</description>
