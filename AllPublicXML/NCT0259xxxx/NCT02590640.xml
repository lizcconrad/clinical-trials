  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if a specific experimental brain stimulation technique
      can be used as a non-invasive way to reduce cigarette cravings in current smokers. This study
      plans to learn more about the way an experimental technique called &quot;transcranial magnetic
      stimulation&quot; (TMS) affects a specific part of the brain, called the insula. Some research
      suggests that this part of the brain plays an important role in craving. The investigators
      plan to study the effects of TMS using standard surveys and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      of subjects' brain.

      For interested participants, this study requires a single 3 hour appointment, which will
      include MRI of the brain as well as TMS.
