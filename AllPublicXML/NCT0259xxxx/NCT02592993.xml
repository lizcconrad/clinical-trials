      Open-label, prospective study. Up to 60 healthy adult volunteers seeking facial acne scars
      treatment, males or females of 18 to 75 years of age, from up to 3 investigational sites.

      Subjects in this study will receive up to six (6) treatments in 3-8 weeks interval, with the
      PicoWayTM device-fractional handpiece 532nm and/or 1064nm according to the study protocol.
      Subjects will be followed by phone 7 days post first treatment by study staff, and will
      return for two follow‐up (FU) visits at the clinic at: 6 weeks and 12 weeks following the
      last treatment.

      Methodology described in the protocol to evaluate efficacy and safety of treatments will be
      carried out at each visit at the clinic.
