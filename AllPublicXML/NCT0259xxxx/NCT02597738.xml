      The purpose of this study is to further advancements in biospecimens (blood cellular free
      component, e.g., plasma, serum, tissue), in order to develop precision medicine, for lung
      cancer management and lung cancer screening (synergy with imaging). A co-clinical trial
      approach, with integrative analyses leveraging data from the treatment of genetic mouse
      models of lung cancer along with clinical samples and data from lung cancer patients, will be
      used to elucidate genomic background metrics, identify cell free DNA mutations, and further
      refine the liquid biopsy approach.

      This is a feasibility study to collect tumor and peripheral blood of patients with advanced
      NSCLC who receive treatment. Blood will also be collected from subjects without lung cancer
      to assess non cancer profiles. To conduct this study, a total of 30 study-eligible subjects
      of all races and ethnicities, aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of Stage IV
      adenocarcinoma of the lung (Cohort A), will be enrolled and have their tumor collected once
      for molecular profiling and xenograft development and blood collected at prespecified time
      intervals until completion of treatment for liquid biopsy analysis (targeted sequencing,
      whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing). A total of 60 study-eligible subjects of
      all races and ethnicities ages 18 years or older will be enrolled in the non-lung cancer
      control subgroups chronic inflammatroy disorder (Cohort B), smokers at risk to develop lung
      cancer (Cohort C).
