  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady-state concentrations of
      JNJ-63623872 on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin in healthy participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label (identity of study drug will be known to participant and study
      staff), sequential study in healthy volunteers to investigate the potential Pharmacokinetics
      (PK) effects of JNJ-872 on pitavastatin. The study consists of Screening Phase (28 days),
      Treatment Phase (Day 1 - Day 12), Follow up (10-14 days and 30-35 days after last study drug
      intake or drop). The total duration of the study will be approximately 2 months. Participants
      will sequentially receive the following treatment: a single oral dose of pitavastatin 1
      milligram (mg) on Day 1; JNJ-63623872 600 mg twice daily on Days 4 through 12, with a single
      oral dose of pitavastatin 1 mg administered in the morning of Day 9. All study drug intakes
      will be taken orally, under fed conditions (within approximately 10 minutes after completion
      of a meal). Blood samples will be collected to assess pharmacokinetic parameters.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
