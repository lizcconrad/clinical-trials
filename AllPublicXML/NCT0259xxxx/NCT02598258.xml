      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety on sauna followed by cold water bath, a
      common practice in many countries, 30 healthy subjects aged 40 years and older will be at the
      Montreal Heart Institute Prevention and Cardiac Rehabilitation centre.

      To determine the safety on sauna followed by cold water bath, a common practice in many
      countries, 30 healthy subjects aged 40 years and older will be at the Montreal Heart
      Institute Prevention and Cardiac Rehabilitation centre. A recent complete evaluation will
      have excluded any cardiac condition. Subjects will first spend 10 minutes in a dry sauna at
      85 degrees celtius. Immediately after , subjects will be immersed in a cold water bath (ICool
      , Australia) at a temperature of 5 degrees celtius for approximately one minute. Blood
      pressure , ecg , gaz exchange and thoracic impedance will be measured during sauna and cold
      water bath.

      Principal goal of study: to determine the safety of this practice. Secondary goals of study:
      to measure the blood pressure response, heart rate, presence of arrythmyas, cardiac output
      and cerebral perfusion during both conditions.

      Primary endpoint: Change in systolic blood pressure from sauna (after 10 minutes ) to cold
      water (after one minute).

      Physiologic measurements: continuous ECG monitoring, BP measurements at every 3 minutes
      during sauna and at one minute in the cold bath, gaz exchange with a portable equipment
      (Cosmed K4), bioimpedance and cerebral perfusion with a single frontal NIRS electrode.
