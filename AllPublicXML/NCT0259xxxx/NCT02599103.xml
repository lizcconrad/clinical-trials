  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fats and oils play important roles in maintaining human nutrition and health through
      providing energy, essential fatty acids, and acting as modulators of many biological
      processes (signal transduction, immunity and inflammation). Due to differences in the fatty
      acid composition and content of antioxidants of individual cooking oils, the degree of
      oxidative and thermolytic reactions may vary oil by oil. It is lack of human feeding study to
      investigate the molecular mechanisms on how and which deep-fried oil exerts its adverse
      effects. The investigators are also lack of biomarkers for monitoring deep-fried oil
      exposure. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare how human body responds
      differently to several popular uncooked and deep-fried oils with varied fatty acid
      compositions with respect of oxylipin profile, inflammatory markers, non-targeted
      metabolomics, and transcriptomics. The investigators will recruit 20 volunteers, provided
      them once a week the milk shakes prepared from 60g of olive oil, soybean oil, palm oil,
      camellia oil, tallow (butter), and deep-fried oils of the last 4, respectively; in comparison
      with a no-fat milk shake control. The experiments lasted for 10 weeks.ã€‚Each time; serum,
      plasma, whole blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, after 2 hours, and after 4
      hours. The investigators anticipate to find biomarker(s) for deep-frying, and contribute to
      the understanding of molecular mechanisms on how deep-fried oils exert adverse effects toward
      health through integrative omics or so-called system biology approaches.

    <description>This is a metabolomics study. We measured retention time (min), mass and abundance of serum metabolites with LC-QTOF at 3 time points. Then, we compared the abundance of metabolites between different oil consumption time ( before and after ) and assessed the health effects of cooking oils.</description>
