  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted for regulatory submission of the GE Healthcare MAGnetic
      resonance Image Compilation (MAGiC), a point-of-care synthetic MR reconstruction software for
      GE 1.5T and 3.0T MR scanners.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, blinded, multi-center multi-reader (MCMR) clinical trial that is
      statistically powered for non-inferiority of diagnostic image quality of synthetic MR versus
      conventional MR and collection of supporting radiologic findings and morphology data from
      radiologists that reflect anticipated clinical usage of synthetic MR technology.

      The study consists of three parts:

        1. Clinical MR acquisition,

        2. synthetic MR post-processing at a GE facility, and

        3. blinded image evaluation (BIE) of conventional and synthetic images for each subject.

      The study will enroll eligible adult subjects with clinical indications for brain MRI that
      meet applicable site MR safety criteria and are not pregnant. The study consists of one
      visit, the subject's MRI scan, without additional follow-up. Results are expected to be
      representative of expected clinical usage of synthetic MAGiC MR technology in clinical
      practice.

          2. Have clinical indication for MRI of the brain according to the site standard of care;

          3. If female of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or post-menopausal), be
             determined non-pregnant by a medically qualified investigator or demonstrated
             non-pregnant by negative urine pregnancy test;

          4. Be able to hear and understand instructions without assistive devices;

          5. Have necessary mental capacity to understand instructions be able to comply with
             protocol requirements;

          6. Are able and willing to provide written informed consent by signing the informed
             consent form (ICF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded that:

          1. Were previously enrolled in this evaluation;

          2. Have metallic/conductive or electrically/magnetically active implants or attached
             medical devices (except for dental devices/fillings, surgical clips, and surgical
             staples) that could be unsafe for MRI;

          3. Have contraindication(s) to MRI scanning per the routine MR Safety Screening policy of
             the investigational site;

          4. Have severe trauma or pre-existing pathology that is expected to interfere with normal
             conduct of MR scanning or complete scanning of the brain;

          5. Have medical condition(s) such as those requiring urgent medical care that, in the
             opinion of a physician Investigator, would prevent safe participation in the study.

            <estimate_desc>Notably, no separate comparative statistical analysis was performed for the 1.5T and 3.0T subgroups, which were pooled for analysis. All patients underwent both synthetic MR and commercial conventional MR in a single arm.</estimate_desc>
            <other_analysis_desc>To mitigate possible bias, the hypothesis test was executed via pre-programmed SAS module, which does not show the data for individual synthetic and conventional group values. The data for these individual groups is thus not currently available as part of the study report held by the sponsor or submitted to FDA. Thus, this data cannot be presented without additional analysis (re-programming) of the original SAS used to perform the study. Data were only reported as the difference between synthetic - conventional to determine non-inferiority, and data for individual crossovers (synthetic vs. conventional) were not calculated.</other_analysis_desc>
