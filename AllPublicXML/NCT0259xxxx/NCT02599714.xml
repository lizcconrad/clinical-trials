  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This dose finding/extension study consists of three parts: Part A will identify the MTD of
      the AZD2014/palbociclib combination on a background of fulvestrant (referred to as the
      triplet) in postmenopausal women with locally advanced/metastatic estrogen receptor positive
      (ER+) breast cancer. Part B will further characterize safety, tolerability, PK, and
      preliminary efficacy in single-arm dose expansion groups. Part C will investigate the
      efficacy of the triplet combination in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified,
      parallel group extension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II international, multicenter study of the combination of AZD2014 and
      palbociclib on a background of 500 mg fulvestrant (referred to as the triplet) in
      postmenopausal women with locally advanced/metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast
      cancer. The study consists of three parts:

      Part A is a Phase I triplet-dose finding investigation in 3-6 patients per cohort to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the triplet.

      Part B is a single arm expansion in approximately 27 patients evaluable for response to
      define the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).

      Part C will investigate the efficacy of the triplet combination at the RP2D in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, parallel group extension. Part C will include
      ER+, locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed following
      prior non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) endocrine therapy. Patients in Part C will be
      randomized to receive either the triplet combination (AZD2014 + palbociclib + fulvestrant) or
      the doublet (matching AZD2014 placebo + palbociclib + fulvestrant). Patients will be
      stratified according to hormone sensitivity, presence of visceral metastases, and prior CDK
      inhibitor treatment. Part C will be conducted if indicated by the emerging data.
