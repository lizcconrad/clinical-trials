      The objective of this protocol is to investigate the microstructural alterations and
      monoaminergic function in Parkinson's disease patients with impulse control disorders and
      cognitive impairment by multimodal MRI and 18F-DTBZ PET imaging.

      Study duration is expected to be completed in a period of 4 year. This study will compare the
      microstructural integrity by multimodal MRI imaging and monoaminergic function by18F- DTBZ
      PET in 35 PD patients without dementia/ICD (PD group), 35 patients with mild cognitive
      impairment (PD-MCI), 35 PD patients with dementia (PDD group), and 35 patients with impulse
      control disorders (PD-ICD group).

    <description>The participants qualify for the study will return to the clinic at a later date and will have catheter(s) placed for i.v. administration of 18F- DTBZ for injection. The participants will receive a single i.v. bolus of 18F- DTBZ, followed by brain PET imaging of 10 minutes duration, approximately 80 minutes post-dose injection. Vital signs will be obtained prior to and immediately after the administration of 18F- DTBZ, and at the completion of the imaging session. Adverse events will be continuously monitored during the imaging session. The participants experience any adverse event will not be discharged until the event has resolved or stabilized.</description>

    <description>During this study, participants will receive a single i.v. administration of approximately 370MBq (10 mCi) 18F- DTBZ immediately prior to imaging. The dosage of DTBZ is 10 nmole. The effective dose in human body is about 5.6 mSV.
The proposed dose for this study is based on the investigators' phase I study. At the proposed human dose of 10 mCi, the whole body effective dose (ED) will be approximately 680 mrem. The estimated human ED is expected to be comparable to or below the range of other approved brain imaging agents, such as 18F-FDG (Lin 2010).</description>
