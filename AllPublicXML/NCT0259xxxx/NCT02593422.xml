    <textblock>
      This online study aims to understand whether writing about one's experiences with ovarian
      cancer may be beneficial for psychological and physical wellbeing in women with a history of
      ovarian cancer. Investigators are also interested in studying how certain individual
      characteristics may impact the effectiveness of writing. Participants will be asked to
      complete an initial survey (15 min), followed by writing about their experiences with ovarian
      cancer on four occasions (20 - 25 min each), over the course of two weeks. A final survey (10
      min) will be completed one month afterwards.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled experiment is to examine the effects of writing
      about experiences with ovarian cancer on psychological and physical outcomes in
      English-speaking women with a history of ovarian cancer. It will also examine how certain
      individual characteristics may impact the effectiveness of the writing interventions for
      different women. After completing an initial survey, women will be asked to write about their
      experiences with ovarian cancer on 4 separate occasions of 20-25 min each in the course of 2
      weeks. A final survey will be completed one month after the last writing session. The entire
      study will be conducted online.
