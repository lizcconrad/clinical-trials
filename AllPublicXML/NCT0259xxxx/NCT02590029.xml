    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized study is to determine the impact of three different types of
      psychosocial support delivered by social workers to patients reporting uncontrolled pain
      during a hospital stay. This study will examine the differential effects of brief mindfulness
      training, therapeutic suggestion, and psychoeducation for patients reporting uncontrolled
      pain.
