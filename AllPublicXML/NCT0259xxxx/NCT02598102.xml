  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double J (DJ) stents are placed following upper urinary tract surgeries. DJ stents are
      usually removed under local anesthesia using rigid cystoscope. Patients experience a lot of
      pain during this procedure and also continue to have discomfort during voiding for few days.
      The use of lignocaine jelly during this procedure is not very effective. Use of diclofenac
      suppository during flexible cystoscopy has been proven to be effective. This study was done
      to assess the effect of oral diclofenac in pain relief in patients undergoing DJ stent
      removal by rigid cystoscopy when compared to placebo and to assess its safety in these
      patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive consenting male patients undergoing DJ stent removal under local anesthesia
      during 2014-15 were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive 75 mg oral diclofenac or
      placebo 1 hour prior to procedure by double blind randomization. Intraurethral 2% lignocaine
      jelly (25 ml) was used in both groups. Pain during rigid cystoscopy, pain at first void and
      at 24 hours after cystoscopy was assessed using visual analogue scale [VAS] (0 to 100).
      Adverse reactions to diclofenac and episodes of acute urinary retention, if any, were
      assessed.
