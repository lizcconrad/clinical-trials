  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer is a special type of breast cancer with poor prgnosis and
      limited choices. Chemotherapy is the only choice of adjuvant systemic treatment options.
      Previous study suggested that zoledronic acid might have anti-tumor effect by eliminating the
      number of DTCs(Disseminated Tumor Cell )and had been proved to be effective as adjvant
      therapy in postmenopausal women whose breast cancer was Homonal receptor positive and who
      were receiving aromatase inhibitors. So it might be able to improve the survival of triple
      negative breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancer patients with high risk factor will be randomized to receive
      either zoledronic acid or observation after the completion of standard
      chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Recurrence status will be followed and Disease free survival will
      be compared. Overall survival is the secondary endpoint.
