    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of computed tomography angiography in the diagnostic
      and therapeutic cycle as the first-choice method of imaging in the diagnosis of patients with
      a high probability of stable coronary artery disease according to European Society of
      Cardiology recommendations.

    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized open-label, single center trial to evaluate superiority of angio-CT
      to a classic coronary angiography (concerning effectiveness and safety) in the diagnosis of
      stable coronary artery disease in patients with indications for invasive coronary
      angiography.
