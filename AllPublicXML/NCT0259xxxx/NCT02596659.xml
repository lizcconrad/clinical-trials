      Background:

      Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is the inflammatory status of insertion
      site of common extensor tendon to humerus. It is usually related to overuse of local muscle.
      Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) is a non-invasive physical treatment. It
      applies shockwave energy to the lesion site, enhancing the growth of microvascularity,
      inducing tissue repair, and thus relieving the symptom.

      The purpose of this study is to understand the therapeutic effect of rESWT to tennis elbow.

      Material and Methods

        -  Subjects: 30 patients will be recruited from outpatient department of physical medicine
           and rehabilitation department.

        -  Duration: 2013.09.01-2015.05.31

        -  Methods: The patients will be randomly divided into the experimental group and the
           control group through the draw, with 15 patients in each group. Patients in the
           experimental group receive rESWT plus routine rehabilitation program. Patients in the
           control group receive sham shockwave therapy plus routine rehabilitation program.

        -  Assessment: Before the therapy starts, patients who match the inclusion criteria will be
           evaluated using tools mentioned below:

        -  General data: age, sex, body height, body weight, affected side, medical history

        -  Assess upper extremity function and symptom with Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and
           Hand Questionnaire (DASH)

        -  Assess severity of pain with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)

        -  Assess grip strength with grip strength dynamometer

        -  Measure the size of tear (if any) of common extensor tendon through ultrasonography, and
           assess the texture of common extensor tendon through real-time sonoelastography (RTS)

      Patients will be followed up 6 weeks, 3months, and 6 months after therapy starts. They will
      be re-assessed of upper extremity function and symptom, severity of pain, grip strength, and
      presentation on ultrasonography and RTS.

    <description>Participants were asked to rate their present pain intensity, as caused by the tennis elbow, from 0-10 using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). If participants had bilateral tennis elbow, the side with the worse pain intensity was chosen for the assessment.</description>

    <measure>Changes in grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal grip strength of the involved arm was assessed using a grip strength dynamometer. Participants were asked to grip the dynamometer 3 times, at 15- second rest intervals, and the highest grip strength number was recorded.</description>

    <description>Upper extremity disability and symptoms were assessed using the Taiwan version Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in stiffness of common extensor tendon</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in stiffness of common extensor tendon were assessed with sonoelastography. The images of sonoelastography were interpreted with the modified RTS scoring system and analyzed with color histogram.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in size of tear within common extensor tendon</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On the 2-D image, the common extensor tendon was located. If there was tear within common extensor tendon, diameters in the 3-D dimension were measured and the size of the tear was calculated as a spheroid.</description>
