      This pilot study was done to assess the feasibility and possible efficacy of a video feedback
      intervention to improve the safety of cognitively impaired older drivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this pilot study were to demonstrate that 1) g-force technology can effectively
      detect unsafe driving events by older adults, and 2) cognitively impaired older adults can
      improve their driving safety with an in-car video feedback intervention. Unsafe driving
      events were triggered by g-forces leading to capture of a video record that was then
      transmitted wirelessly to a remote office where the events were analyzed and scored. During
      the baseline phase (3 months), there was no feedback. During the intervention phase (4-6
      months), participants received a weekly progress report in the mail along with DVD of
      recorded unsafe driving events with recommendations. The research team then contacted the
      participant and informant weekly to provide additional coaching, and verify that participants
      reviewed the information and videos. During the post-intervention monitoring phase (7-9
      months), there was no further feedback. The primary quantitative outcomes were total number
      of unsafe driving events/1,000 miles and total safety driving score/1,000 miles. Secondary
      qualitative outcomes included the types and severity of unsafe driving events that were
      recorded.
