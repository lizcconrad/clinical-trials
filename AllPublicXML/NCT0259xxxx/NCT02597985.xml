    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a treatment alternative among high-risk
      elderly with aortic stenosis, however, mortality remains high. Fifty percent of patients
      undergoing TAVR exhibit frailty, a syndrome associated with poor survival. It is unknown
      whether interventions to improve frailty before TAVR (prehabilitation) will improve outcomes
      after TAVR. This study plans to evaluate whether simple cardiac exercise interventions to
      improve physical performance before TAVR improves outcomes after TAVR.

    <description>Supervised exercise training intervention will include three sessions per week for four weeks at a Mayo Clinic system cardiac rehabilitation facility. The Rochester, Minnesota Cardiac Rehabilitation Program will provide guidance and oversight. Modes of aerobic exercise will include treadmill walking (the primary mode of training) supplemented with non-weight-bearing activities such as stationary cycling and combination arm/leg recumbent exercise (NuStep device), as needed. Intensity will be set using Borg Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE) ratings of 12-14 (somewhat hard), keeping patients below the threshold for more than mild angina.</description>
