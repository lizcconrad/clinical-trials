  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feticide is a legal and ethical obligation during a termination of pregnancy after 22
      weeks' gestation. This method raise concerns about the fetal pain, maternal complications and
      the fetopathologic analysis. There are few studies on the subject. Investigators want to
      evaluate a drug in order to facilitate this method technically and emotionally challenging.
      They want to achieve a quick fetal asystole, a fetal analgesia, a maternal security and a
      optimal fetopathologic analysis. A drug, remifentanil Ultiva®, seems could meet its
      properties, it is a powerful morphine. A phase 2 clinical trial has assessed the feasibility,
      efficacy and safety of Ultiva®. They had not been able to prove bradycardia or lethal effect
      of Ultiva injected alone but the feasibility and safety were good.

      Investigators want to set up a randomized clinical trial with 2 arms : Ultiva® and lidocaine
      versus sufentanil and lidocaine (standard protocol), it is a bicentric study. The primary
      outcome is the interval between the vascular injection of lidocaine and fetal asystole. The
      secondary outcomes are the success rate of method, the number of puncture of the umbilical
      cord, the maternal side effects and the quality of fetopathologic analysis.

      The previous observational study showed a median interval of 2,3 minutes and a success rate
      of 55% (lower interval to 2 minutes). From the results they calculate a necessary inclusions
      to 66 patients.

      They believe that the bradycardia property of Ultiva® allow a potentiation of the efficacy of
      lidocaine. If the results are satisfactory, the use of Ultiva® can be generalized to other
      fetal medicine team.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; = 18 years

          2. Patient having received an authorization of medical termination of pregnancy beyond 22
             weeks of amenorrhea by the Multidisciplinary Centers of Prenatal Diagnosis of
             Montpellier or Nimes

          3. Patient member or beneficiary of a national insurance scheme

          4. Patient capable of understanding the nature, the purpose and the methodology of the
             trial

          5. Patient having given an informed consent signed before the inclusion in the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient presenting a selective or total feticide in the cases of multiple pregnancies
             (the first preferential way in these cases is intracardiac, moreover the act risks to
             be complicated by the active movements of the other foetus)
