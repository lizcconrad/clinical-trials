  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional study of adult patients prescribed topical
      treatment with ingenol mebutate gel (Picato®) as part of provision of care for the treatment
      of Non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic Actinic Keratosis (AK). Patients with complete
      clearance at 8 weeks will be followed for one year or until retreatment of AK in the area
      initially treated, whatever comes first. For patients with incomplete clearance in the
      treated area at 8 weeks the treatment strategy for this area will be recorded but no further
      follow-up will take place. The effectiveness, tolerability, adherence, patient satisfaction
      and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) associated with Picato® treatment will be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actinic Keratosis (AK) is caused by exposure to UV radiation and has the potential to regress
      to normal skin or to progress to squamous cell carcinoma. Ingenol mebutate gel is a
      relatively new topical treatment option for AK in Greece.

      Taking into consideration the limited real-world evidence that is attributed to the recent
      advent of Picato in the Greek market, this non-interventional observational study aims
      primarily at assessing the characteristics of patients selected for this treatment, the
      effectiveness and tolerability of the treatment, patient satisfaction and the impact of the
      therapy on patients' HRQoL in standard clinical practice.The study will be carried out by
      approximately 30 physicians practicing in private or public hospitals and clinics in
      representative geographical regions of Greece.

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by respondents. It consists of two pages comprising the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.</description>
