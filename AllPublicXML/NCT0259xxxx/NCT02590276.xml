      The project focuses on C9orf72, the most frequent genetic form of frontotemporal dementias
      (FTD, or frontotemporal lobar degeneration, FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
      FTD is the second commonest cause of degenerative dementia in presenium after Alzheimer's
      disease. Behavioural and cognitive impairments progressively lead to dementia. ALS produces
      progressive muscle weakness leading to the death in 2 to 4 years. Since 2006, major
      discoveries have linked FTLD and ALS:

        1. TDP-43 aggregates in neurons and

        2. C9orf72 mutations is a major genetic cause in both disorders.

      Two major pathological subtypes are now defined in FTD, FTD-TDP and FTD-TAU. C9orf72
      mutations (associated to FTD-TDP) are the most frequent genetic causes of FTD (15%), FTD-ALS
      (65%) and ALS (40%).

      FTD is difficult at an early stage; and no clinical, biological or imaging features can
      predict the underlying pathology in living patients. Therapeutic perspectives emerged against
      tau aggregation, progranulin deficit and C9orf72 expansion (antisense). Presymptomatic
      carriers of genetic FTD would benefit, before onset of symptoms, from these therapeutic that
      would delay or prevent the disease. At this step, it becomes crucial to develop markers to
      know how many years before symptoms, does the pathological progress begin, to treat the
      patients at the most early stage of the disease. Markers are also needed to predict the
      pathology (FTD-TDP/FTD-tau) in patients that will be eligible for trials targeting specific
      pathological lesion.

      This study will investigate whether cognitive deficits, structural and functional changes can
      be detected before symptom onset in presymptomatic mutation carrier. The main objectives of
      the project are to identify novel cognitive, brain imaging markers and peripheral biomarkers
      for early diagnosis of FTLD, and to follow disease progression. Methodology

        1. Recruitment and evaluation of participants, neurological, behaviour and cognition
           evaluations. One hundred participants including 20 C9orf72 patients and 80 'a-risk'
           individuals will be recruited and evaluated by clinical partners of the project (Paris,
           Lille, Limoges, Rouen).. 'At-risk individuals' are the first degree relatives of C9ORF72
           patients, who have a high a risk (50%) to carry the mutation.

        2. Identifying brain structural markers. Brain structural changes will be evaluated by
           voxel-based morphometry (SPM12 software) to assess global brain atrophy and evaluation
           of atypical shape patterns such as cortical thickness (Freesurfer software) and study of
           the cortical sulci (BrainVISA/Morphologist software).

        3. Identifying brain metabolic markers by Fluoro Deoxy DGlucose-Positron Emission
           Tomography (FDG-PET). We will apply voxel-based methods using Statistical Parametric
           Mapping software (SPM8) to compare different groups or analyze correlations between
           brain metabolism and cognitive deficits.

        4. Identifying peripheral biomarkers of disease onset and disease progression. We propose
           to use RNA sequencing to study gene expression and RNA splicing alterations in
           lymphocytes of C9ORF72 patients and 'at risk individuals'.
