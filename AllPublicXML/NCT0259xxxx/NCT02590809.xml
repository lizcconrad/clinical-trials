    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most frequent genetic cardiac disease characterized
      by an asymmetric hypertrophic. In two third of patients, an obstruction to blood ejection is
      observed within the left ventricle which is named left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
      (LVOTO). This phenomenon can occur at rest or during exercise and is associated with symptoms
      such as dyspnea, dizziness or chest pain that can significantly limit day life adaptation. To
      now, medical or interventional treatments such as betablocacker, calcium blockers or septal
      alcoholisation or surgery present with a limited efficiency. Recent studies from
      investigators group revealed new concepts about the role of venous return to the LVOTO.
      Therefore the investigators hypothesis that BX1514M generating a venous vascular
      constriction, could improve symptoms of HCM patients by reducing LVOTO.
