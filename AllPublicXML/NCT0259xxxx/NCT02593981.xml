  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As many as 57% of older adults complain of major disruption of sleep, 29% struggle to fall
      asleep and 19% complain of early-morning awakening. The implications of this sleep
      deprivation are sobering, particularly among older individuals.

      The primary goal of this study is to determine whether a palatable foodstuff which contains a
      fruit/honey drink and which is taken every evening before bedtime leads to improved sleep in
      community-living individuals with sleep problems.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded pilot study to explore the use of a
      fruit/honey drink product for improving sleep in older adults. The purpose of this study is
      to estimate the effects of a fruit/honey drink using various assessment tools when used as
      short-term intervention.

      This trial proposes to enroll a total of 60 community based older adults. All study patients
      will be instructed to take the study product every day for 28 days. During which time, study
      subjects will return weekly to complete study visits for a total of 4 visits.
