  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital uterine anomalies are found in 8% of infertile women and 24.5% of infertile women
      with a history of recurrent miscarriage, with septate and sub-septate uterus being the most
      common anomalies in these women, Also, septate uterus is the commonest anomaly found in
      infertile women requiring assisted reproductive technology.

      Published data showed improved Cumulative pregnancy rate and live birth rate, and a
      significant reduction in Miscarriage rate in In Vitro Fertilization women after hysteroscopic
      metroplasty of both small and large septate compared to non-operated women.

      Investigators hypothesized that trans-vaginal three Dimensional Ultrasound will be superior
      to Hystro-salpingography for the differentiation between arcuate and septate uterus in
      infertile women scheduled for In Vitro Fertilization.

    <description>Infertile women with diagnosis of arcuate and septate uterus based on Hystro-salpingography were recruited. All women were examined by Three dimensional ultrasound on day 22 cycle to allow for better delineation of the uterine contour. The outer and inner fundal contours and the length of the fundal notch were examined by Three dimensional ultrasound in the mid-coronal view of the multi-planar and multi-slice display of the uterus. The final diagnosis of the anomalies was based on combined hysteroscopy/laparoscopy examination, the gold standard.</description>
