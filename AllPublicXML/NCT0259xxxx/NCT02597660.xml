  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellar tendinopathy is one of the most frequent causes of non-traumatic knee pain and
      reduced function in patients. Standard treatment options for patellar tendinopathies include
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, cryotherapy, manual therapy,
      eccentric exercises, and ultrasound. Unfortunately many patients fail to respond to these
      therapies and return to normal activity levels, and recurrence rates for those who do respond
      are unacceptably high. Many patients who fail to respond display persistent degenerative
      changes on imaging studies suggesting a failure to regenerate the pathological tissue.
      Developing new therapies that can directly promote the synthesis of new, healthy
      extracellular matrix tissue could therefore address an important therapeutic need and make a
      substantial improvement in our ability to effectively treat patellar tendinopathy and reduce
      recurrence rates. Somatropin (human growth hormone of recombinant DNA origin) has been shown
      to increase protein synthesis and matrix production when delivered directly into the tendon.
      This study will evaluate the ability of somatropin to improve clinical outcomes and tissue
      quality in patients with chronic tendinopathy.

    <description>Over a 12 week period beginning at the second study visit patients will perform a standard of care eccentric exercise training regime. Each session consists of three bilateral exercises: leg press, back squat, and hack squat. Subjects will complete four sets in each exercise with a 2-3 minute rest between sets. The repetitions/loads are: 15 repetition maximum (RM) week 1, 12RM weeks 2-3, 10RM weeks 4-5, 8RM weeks 6-8 and 6RM weeks 9-12. All exercises are performed from complete 0ยบ to 90ยบ of knee flexion and back again. Each of the eccentric and concentric phases will occur over a period of 3 seconds, respectively for a total of 6 seconds per contraction.</description>

    <description>Bilateral biopsies will be performed on an elective basis, although the investigators will aim to have 8 subjects in each group receive the biopsy. Biopsies will be obtained at the 26 week time point. The data obtained from the biopsy will help address the mechanism behind observed changes in outcome scores, physical measurements or imaging studies. The biopsy will be performed under ultrasound guidance and using sterile technique with a disposable 14G, 2cm biopsy instrument.</description>
