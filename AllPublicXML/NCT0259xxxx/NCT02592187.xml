  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a risk factor for dementia and represents a
      critical window of opportunity to intervene and alter the trajectory of both cognitive and
      functional decline. Emerging life-logging technologies has shown a tremendous potential to
      increase autobiographical memory.

      Objective: The main goal of the present study is to develop a Cognitive Training program (CT)
      for MCI based on life-logging captured by a Wearable Camera (WeC) recording specific
      autobiographical episodes for stimulating posteriorly episodic memory. The challenge is to
      create an application to manage this large collection of images, which can be easily
      retrieved as events by users in a therapeutic context as a multimodal cognitive stimulation.
      The investigators will conduct the first pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) evaluating
      the effectiveness of the life-logging re-experiencing program immediately and 3-month
      follow-up period.

      Methodology: The Design is a single blind RCT of CT based on life-logging tools. 30 adults
      with MCI, after completion of two weeks image collection by a WeC, will be randomly allocated
      (1:1) into experimental or control group. Once acquire episodic individual's videos, all
      participants will attend 1-hour individual training sessions 2 times per week for 14 weeks.
      Main outcomes measures will be cognitive, functional, emotional and quality of life measures,
      as well as biochemical measures (BDNF).

      Expected results: The investigators expect the outcomes to provide preliminary evidence that
      autobiographical experimentation CT programs can positively impact cognitive functioning and
      may represent an effective strategy to improve memory and functionality in those who begun to
      experience cognitive decline.
