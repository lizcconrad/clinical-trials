    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab in treating patients with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malignant neoplasms that have come back (relapsed), do not
      respond to treatment (refractory), or have distributed over a large area in the body
      (disseminated). Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block tumor or cancer
      growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It may also help the immune system kill
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in HIV-infected patients
      on effective antiretroviral therapy and with relapsed/refractory or disseminated acquired
      immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining or non-AIDS defining malignancy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary insights into clinical benefit (e.g., tumor shrinkage or
      stabilization &gt;= 24 weeks) across a variety of tumors in patients infected with HIV and on
      effective antiretroviral therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of pre-therapy tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and
      T-cell infiltration on clinical benefit.

      II. To assess the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating HIV and the HIV viral
      reservoir in patients on effective combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), as measured by
      plasma HIV single copy ribonucleic acid (RNA), cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ T-cell
      associated HIV unspliced RNA, CD4+ T-cell associated integrated HIV deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) provirus, ratio of HIV unspliced RNA/DNA, &quot;Tat/Rev induced limiting dilution assay&quot;
      (TILDA), and phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 molecular evolution.

      III. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on host gene expression in circulating
      blood cells.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell
      cytotoxicity against autologous HIV infected CD4+ T-cells in patients on effective
      antiretroviral therapy.

      V. To evaluate the effect of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) on circulating lymphocyte and monocyte
      numbers and phenotypes.

      VI. To assess by biopsy tumors from participants that progress by immunohistochemistry arrays
      and gene expression analysis to evaluate potential reasons for the lack of response to
      MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or progression such as a lack of T cells within or around tumor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients continue
      receiving their recommended combination antiretroviral therapy orally daily. Courses repeat
      every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

             within the washout period)

          -  On an effective combination cART regimen, generally a 3-drug regimen based on
             Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) treatment guidelines

                  not appear to correlate with lack of viral suppression in most studies; thus, an
                  HIV viral load of =&lt; 400 copies/mL for an occasional &quot;blip&quot; will be allowed, if
                  there is documentation of an HIV viral load &lt; 200 on the same regimen and no
                  significant treatment interruption

               -  Only after discussion with the principal investigator (PI)

                    -  Note: to remain on treatment, any abnormal lab values allowed by the PI must
                       remain stable or improve during treatment; similar off treatment rules will
                       be applied to all patients, except the grade of any abnormal laboratory
                       (lab) value allowed by the protocol P.I. at enrollment will be considered
                       the patient's baseline when off treatment criteria are applied for
