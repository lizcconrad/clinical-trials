      The main objective of the trial is to complete a double-blinded randomized controlled trial
      with crossover design of a lumbosacral plexus block with the Suprasacral Parallel Shift
      technique guided by ultrasound/magnetic resonance (MR) image fusion vs. Suprasacral Parallel
      Shift guided by ultrasound by estimating sensory block of the femoral nerve, the obturator
      nerve, the lumbosacral trunk, and spinal nerve L1 in healthy volunteers.

      The main objective of the trial is to complete a double-blinded randomized controlled trial
      with crossover design of a one-injection nerve block of the lower part of the lumbar plexus
      and the upper part of the sacral plexus (Suprasacral Parallel Shift, SSPS) to achieve
      analgesia of the femoral nerve, the obturator nerve, the lumbosacral trunk, and spinal nerve
      L1 with SSPS guided by ultrasound/MR image fusion vs. SSPS guided by ultrasound by estimating
      sensory block of in healthy volunteers by estimating the sensory block of dermatomes of the
      terminal nerves in healthy volunteers.

      The secondary objective is to estimate a) preparation and b) procedure time, c) injection
      site and d) depth, e) discomfort, f) change in MAP, g) plasma lidocaine pharmacokinetics, h)
      motor and i) sensory block, j) perineural and k) epidural spread of lidocaine-epinephrine
      added gadotorate meglumine on MRI, and l) cost-effectiveness of SSPS guided by ultrasound/MR
      image fusion vs. SSPS guided by ultrasound.

      The investigators hypothesize that block success is higher for SSPS guided by ultrasound/MR
      image fusion than for SSPS guided by ultrasound.
