  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well electrochemotherapy works at treating people
      with Stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Electrochemotherapy is a treatment that combines
      electroporation and chemotherapy administration. Electroporation uses an electric current to
      produce holes in pancreatic tumor, which causes the tumor cells to die or take up a higher
      concentration of administered chemotherapy agent. This study will test the safety and look at
      the effect of electrochemotherapy in the treatment of stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
      This study will also help to find the safest and most effective amount of electroporation
      voltage to apply to this type of tumor.

      This is a phase I dose escalation trial using a 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme to evaluate the
      maximum tolerated field strength dose of administered irreversible electroporation in
      combination with chemotherapy. During the first cycle of chemotherapy, patients will receive
      electroporation of the primary pancreatic tumor prior to administration of chemotherapy with
      FOLFIRINOX. The schedule of administration of FOLFIRINOX will be administered as per standard
      of care. The investigators will use non-invasive dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect and describe changes within the tumor. Safety will
      be determined by assessing the number of class three or higher toxicity events in cohorts of
      6 patients at progressively higher electroporation voltages. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      will be defined as one voltage level less than the voltage at which two or more patients out
      of six total patients have a class three or higher toxicity event.

    <description>A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is any Grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE 4.0) that is possibly related to the electrochemotherapy treatment. CTCAE 4.0 Grade 3 is a severe AE and Grade 4 is a life-threatening or disabling AE. DLTs are collected to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), which is defined as as one field strength level less than the field strength at which two or more patients out of six total patients experience a DLT.</description>
