  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain after laparoscopy is common and its probable mechanism is residual CO2 gas
      after surgery. The pulmonary recruitment maneuver can mechanically remove residual CO2 and
      reduce pain. In literature, there are two different recruitment maneuvers, which was manual
      inflation of the lungs with positive pressure ventilation of either 40cmH2O or 60cmH2O at the
      end of surgery. However, the higher positive pressure may be associated with more chance of
      barotrauma. Therefore, it is important to determine the lowest effective pressure for
      reducing postlaparoscopic shoulder pain. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of different recruitment maneuvers (40cmH2O or 60cmH2O) for reducing
      postlaparoscopic shoulder pain.
