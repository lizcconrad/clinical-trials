    <textblock>
      Objectives:

      Our specific aims are to:

      Aim 1: Examine the feasibility of a couple-based meditation program in 50 patients with
      metastatic lung cancer and their partners.

      Aim 2: Establish the initial efficacy of a couple-based meditation program in patients and
      their partners regarding physical, psychological, and spiritual quality of life outcomes.

      Exploratory Aim 1: Explore potential intervention mediators (i.e., mindfulness, compassion,
      holding back, and intimacy) and a moderator (i.e., baseline distress) of the intervention
      effects.

      Exploratory Aim 2: Explore natural language use to assess intervention effects on coping
      processes, posttraumatic growth and optimistic outlook.

      Partner Phase 1:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex,
      and race) will be recorded.

      Meditation and Discussion Program:

      You will take part in a meditation and discussion program. Two (2) times you will meet with a
      mediation trained instructor. You should attend each session together as a couple.

      During the sessions, you will do deep breathing and visualization exercises and then asked to
      review the exercises based on your experiences and what you prefer. You will also be asked
      for feedback about the instructions to make sure they were clear and easy to follow. You will
      also be asked to read written materials that are part of this program. You will be asked to
      complete a written review about the program in general and a questionnaire about your general
      health and well-being. Each session will last about 60-90 minutes.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your participation in this study will be over when you have completed the last session for
      Phase I.

      Partner Phase 2:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex,
      and race) will be recorded.

      Questionnaires:

      You will complete 12 questionnaires before your first meditation and discussion session. The
      questionnaires ask about your health, your mood, your level of fatigue, your sleeping habits,
      your relationship, and your quality of life. It should take about 45 minutes to complete
      these questionnaires.

      After completing the last session, about 4 to 6 weeks later, you will be asked to complete
      the same questionnaires again. Additionally, you will be asked to complete a program review
      asking you what you liked and did not like about the program.

      If you cannot complete the questionnaires in the clinic, you will be given a self-addressed
      postage-paid envelope so that you can mail the questionnaires back to the study staff. You
      should try to finish and mail back the questionnaires no more than 7 days after you begin
      filling them out.

      Meditation and Discussion Program:

      You will take part in a meditation and discussion program. As part of the program, you will
      have up to 4 meditation sessions over a course of a 4 to 6 week period with a trained
      meditation instructor. You should attend each session together as a couple. Session 1 will be
      face-to-face or online by videoconference if you are not available to complete the session in
      person. Sessions 2-4 will be done online. The online delivery will be either using a secure
      web conferencing system (called VIA3) or, if you have one, by iPhone using the Facetime/Zoom
      feature.

      During the meditation sessions, you will be asked to take part in relaxation training
      including deep breathing and visualization exercises. You will discuss your experiences and
      observations afterwards with your partner and instructor. Each session will last about 60
      minutes total.

      You will be asked to continue daily meditation practice and some other short exercises at
      home outside of the classes. You will receive a compact disc and printed materials to help
      with your home practice.

      The study staff will call you at least 1 time per week over the 4-6 week period to remind you
      to practice your meditation. You will also be asked about any problems you may be having
      completing your practice. Each call should last about 10-15 minutes.

      All meditation and discussion sessions will be audio recorded. This is so the researchers can
      keep track of the quality of the sessions. The audio files are digital and will be deleted
      after all the data are studied.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your participation in this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires
      within 1 week after your last session for Phase 2. Your total participation length is about
      4-6 weeks.

      Partner Phase 3:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age, sex,
      and race) will be recorded.

      You will complete 12 questionnaires at the beginning of this study. The questionnaires ask
      about your health, your mood, your level of fatigue, your sleeping habits, your relationship,
      and your quality of life. It should take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires.

      If you cannot complete the questionnaires in the clinic, you will be given a self-addressed
      postage-paid envelope so that you can mail the questionnaires back to the study staff. You
      should try to finish and mail back the questionnaires no more than 7 days after you begin
      filling them out.

      Study Groups:

      You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 3 groups. This is done
      because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take part in a couple-based meditation program.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will take part in a couple-based cancer-related discussion
           program.

        -  If you are in Group 3, you will not take part in the couple-based meditation or
           cancer-related discussion program but will complete the same questionnaires as Group 1
           and 2. You will be given the option to take part in the couple-based mediation and
           discussion program (off study) after the other groups finish their last questionnaire
           packet.

      The group assignment is based on other factors such as patient's age and gender.

      Meditation and Discussion Program for Group 1:

      If you are in Group 1, you will take part in a meditation and discussion program. As part of

      person. Sessions 2-4 will be done online. The online delivery will be either using a secure
      web conferencing system (called VIA3) or, if you have one, by iPhone using the Facetime/Zoom
      feature.

      During the meditation sessions, you will be asked to take part in relaxation training
      including deep breathing and visualization exercises and some other short exercises. You will
      discuss your experiences and observations afterwards. Each session will last about 60 minutes
      total.

      will receive a compact disc and printed materials to help with your home practice.

      period. These will be one-on-one sessions.
