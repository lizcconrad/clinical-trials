  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. The aim of this studio
      will be to evaluate the effectiveness of &quot;Hands/Eyes/mouth&quot; behavior management technique
      versus a conventional technique (covering the patient´s vision) during an inferior alveolar
      and lingual nerve block in preschool children referred for treatment at the School of
      Dentistry, Cardenal Herrera CEU University (Valencia, Spain). The sample will consist of 52
      children from 3 years old to 5 years 11 months old who need dental pulp treatment and/or
      tooth extraction of primary molars. Preschool children with no history of allergies to
      Lidocaine or systemic/neurological diseases and who did not take local anesthesia before the
      study will be include in this research.

      Children will be randomly allocated to treatment groups (n=26 for each group) according to
      the technique: 1)&quot;Hands/Eyes/mouth&quot; and 2) Conventional. Anxiety and pain will be evaluated
      by the Scale of facial Image (EIF) and Wong-Baker Pain Scale, respectively. The cooperation
      of the patient will be evaluated by behavioral Scale Frank

    <description>&quot;hand-eye-mouth&quot; (MOB) seeks to focus the patient in performing a sequence of movements in a fun way so that your attention is diverted from the puncture dental needle, also it seeks to the patient does not see the needle. The operator prior to infiltrate local anesthetic teaches the child a &quot;game&quot; to put &quot;the sleepy little water&quot;.After explain a first time, the sequence once or twice is repeated until the patient has mastered. We call this test. When we apply the anesthetic, the entire sequence must be repeated as in trials with the same tranquility and in the same tone of the game. The operator will use this technique during the inferior alveolar and lingual nerve block procedure</description>

    <description>The needle is inserted laterally to the pterygomandibular pit at its deepest point without noticing any resistance. In children the positioning of the syringe must be perpendicular, between the canine and the first molar on the opposite side and puncture is performed slightly below the occlusal plane. It was initially deposited 2/3 anesthetic carpule solution and then the needle is slightly recede depositing there the remaining third of anesthetic solution.
The application of anesthesia shall be in accordance with the following guidelines:
Topical Anesthetic: Benzocaine 20% (Hurricaine, Clarben Laboratories SA, Madrid, Spain).
Dental Needle: short needles (21mm/30g) (Octoplus, Clarben Laboratories SA, Madrid, Spain)
anesthetic: lidocaine hydrochloride 2% with epinephrine 1: 100,000 (2% XILOCAINE, Dentsply, Spain).
Syringe: carpule syringe-conventional harpoon with suction system.</description>
