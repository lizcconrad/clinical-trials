  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence against women and girls is increasingly recognized as a major global public health
      and development concern. However, evidence on what forms of intervention should be
      prioritised is severely lacking. A cluster randomized controlled trial (The Intervention with
      Microfinance for AIDS &amp; Gender Equity - IMAGE Project) in rural South Africa combined a
      group-based microfinance intervention with a participatory gender and HIV training curriculum
      for loan participants and showed that, over a two-year period, levels of physical and/or
      sexual partner violence experienced by participants in the past year were reduced by 55%.

      The overall goal of the current study is to design and implement a cluster randomized
      controlled trial to assess the impact on intimate partner violence of: 1) combining
      participatory gender training with microfinance for women in existing microfinance loan
      groups, and 2) a participatory gender training programme for women (not receiving
      microfinance) and their male partners.
