    <textblock>
      This registry aims to gather anesthetic medications administered to fetuses directly as well
      as those administered via the mother during fetal intervention procedures. The goal is to
      assesss short and medium term outcomes as well as long term outcomes of these babies whao
      have received medication in utero. The long term outcomes will include but are not limited to
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in technology have allowed for an increase in procedures performed on the fetus in
      utero; these procedures involve the administration of different anesthetics (sedative-
      hypnotic agents and or volatile agents) to the mother and sometimes directly to the fetus in
      order for succesful completion of the procedure. Very few instiututions in the world perform
      these procedures in any significant number. The establishment of this database will serve to
      consolidate information regarding anesthetic drugs administered for these procedures, thereby
      helping to establish best practice guidelines, determine medium and short term outcomes or
      complications and also facilitate long term neurodevelopmental assessment of children that
      have undergone these procedures in utero with 5 and 10 year neurodevelopmental assessment.
