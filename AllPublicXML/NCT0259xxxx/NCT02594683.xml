      A follow-up study of a randomised, controlled, study to investigate the effects of a new
      infant formula given in the first 12 months of life on growth and body composition up to 5
      years of age. Participants from Venus study will be invited to participate in this follow-up
      study.

      Hypothesis: Significant difference in body mass index (BMI) development for subjects who had
      received infant formula and follow on formula with scGOS/lcFOS/Nuturis® compared to the
      control product scGOS/lcFOS and standard formula. No significant difference in growth of
      subjects who had received infant formula and follow on formula with scGOS/lcFOS/Nuturis®
      compared to the breast-feeding reference group.
