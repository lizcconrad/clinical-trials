  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications of
      pregnancy. Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common and well described complication for infants born
      to mothers with GDM and diabetes mellitus (DM) and studies have linked intrapartum maternal
      glucose levels with neonatal hypoglycemia. While guidelines exist to guide practitioners in
      how to best manage intrapartum maternal glucose levels among Type I and and Type II DM, there
      is a paucity of data guiding practitioners in the intrapartum management of blood glucose
      levels for women with GDM, particularly those treated with insulin antepartum. The goal of
      this project is to compare two protocols of intrapartum glucose management in women with GDM
      and investigate the impact on neonatal blood glucose levels.

      Research objective- To compare &quot;Tight&quot; vs. &quot;Less Tight&quot; intrapartum glucose management

      Hypothesis: Neonates born to mothers managed via the &quot;Less Tight&quot; intrapartum glucose
      management protocol will have lower mean glucose levels in the first 24 hours of life when
      compared to mean glucose levels among infants born to mothers managed via the &quot;Tight&quot;
      intrapartum glucose management protocol.

      Study Design: Randomized trial

      Population: English or Spanish speaking women with a diagnosis of GDM managed at the Diabetes
      in Pregnancy Program at Women &amp; Infants Hospital, with a plan to deliver at Women &amp; Infants
      Hospital

      Once enrolled, patients will then be randomized to &quot;Tight&quot; or &quot;Less Tight&quot; intrapartum
      glucose control.

      Once admitted to the labor floor for intrapartum management the appropriate power plan for
      glucose control will be initiated. The specifics of labor management will be left to the
      discretion of the provider.
