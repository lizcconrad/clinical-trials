  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, or eczema, is a common skin disease that can
      affect males and females of all ages, but often starts in childhood. Recent studies show at
      least 4-7% of adults and 15-25% of children to be affected, with one third of patients having
      severe disease. It results in very itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin. Scratching worsens
      the symptoms and causes the skin to become thickened over time. Patients with atopic
      dermatitis have an increased risk of skin infections, and many also develop hay fever or
      asthma. Atopic dermatitis can cause significant distress to both patients and their families.

      In this study, the aim is to assess the effects of a new treatment called secukinumab in
      patients with atopic dermatitis. A total of 30 patients will be included in the study, which
      will run for a total of 52 weeks.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, pilot study of a total of 44 subjects with AD (22 with
      intrinsic and 22 with extrinsic AD) consisting of 2 phases. Subjects will be randomized (2:1)
      to either receive secukinumab 300 mg or placebo via subcutaneous injection using 2 prefilled
      syringes.
