  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bile duct tumours are rare. They are the 6th most common type of digestive cancer. Their
      therapeutic management is complex and must be multidisciplinary in nature. Most of the time,
      an endoscopic or radiological biliary drainage is necessary before any tumour treatment.

      Their prognosis is poor due to the fact that they are normally diagnosed late, which makes
      curative surgery impossible. A population study in the Côte d'Or region of France reported a
      survival rate at 5 years of approximately 10%.

      For the locally advanced or metastatic forms, treatment has not been properly codified. With
      respect to chemotherapy, prospective studies, most often phase II, are difficult to interpret
      due to a limited number of patients and due to the heterogeneity of this type of tumour (bile
      duct and pancreas tumours). Treatment with 5FU alone provides an objective response in
      approximately 10% of cases. In combination with mitomycin or carboplatin, the objective
      response rate is 20%, with a median survival period of 5 months. Interferon combined with 5FU
      has a better response rate (30%), but occurrences of different types of toxicity are more
      frequent.

      More recently, gemcitabine and the 5FU-cisplatin combinations demonstrated objective tumour
      control in 50% of patients with a median survival period of 10 months. Gemcitabine combined
      with oxiplatin or with cisplatin has shown the same response rate but a median survival
      period of approximately 12 months.

      The benefit of this combination has been confirmed in a phase III trial that compared the
      gemcitabine-cisplatin combination to gemcitabine alone, in 410 patients with locally advanced
      unresectable and/or metastatic bile duct cancer. The results were in favour of the combined
      treatment with a median survival period of 11.7 months (versus 8.1 months - HR 0.64 [0.52 -
      0.80]). This combination is currently the reference first-line treatment.

      At the same time as these results, triple therapies involving 5FU + oxiplatin + irinotecan
      have objectively shown a significant increase in overall survival of patients with metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to gemcitabine alone (median of 11.1 months versus 6.8
      months, HR = 0.57 [0.45 - 0.73] p &lt; 0.0001). The response rate and progression-free survival
      (PFS) have also been improved with these triple therapies; the response rates were 31.6%
      versus 9.4% p &lt; 0.001 and the median PFS 6.4 months versus 3.3 months p &lt; 0.001,
      respectively.

      The adverse events observed with the triple therapy occurred more frequently, for febrile
      neutropaenia (5.4%), with the need to treat with growth factors (G-CSF for 42.5% of
      patients). Haematological and digestive toxicity was also higher: grade 3-4 neutropaenia was
      observed for 45.7% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX arm and 18.7% of patients in the gemcitabine
      arm (p = 0.0001); vomiting was noted for 14.5% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX arm and 4.7% in
      the gemcitabine arm (p = 0.002). Quality of life was improved in the FOLFIRINOX arm.

      Due to the histological, therapeutic and prognostic similarities between pancreatic and bile
      duct cancer, it is interesting to assess this triple therapy compared to the current
      reference treatment in bile duct cancers: gemcitabine combined with cisplatin (GEMCIS). Due
      to the known higher levels of toxicity for this triple therapy (digestive and
      haematological), the investigators modified the conventional FOLFIRINOX regimen (mFOLFIRINOX)
      by removing the 5-FU bolus at D1 of each cycle. This modification to the regimen would appear
      not to decrease the efficacy of the treatment.

    <description>In phase II, the primary endpoint is the percentage of patients alive without radiological progression (assessed according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria) at 6 months (after randomisation).
Patients who are in radiological progression or who have died before the 6 months have elapsed will be considered a failure for the primary endpoint at 6 months (after randomisation).
A medical review will be conducted to decide on patients without radiological progression at 6 months; in the light of their entire medical file, they may be considered a failure (i.e. in progression) or they may be considered to be truly non-assessable (a 5% surplus of patients has been planned for this situation).</description>
