      Using Synaptive Medical's BrightMatter™ products to better visualize and plan epilepsy
      surgeries by considering white matter tracts, and considering whether the technology results
      in improved clinical outcomes.

    <textblock>
      A common goal of focal brain resection is the removal of a lesion while preserving healthy
      eloquent tissues of the brain. One such eloquent area that is commonly aimed to be preserved
      are the white matter nerve fiber tracts which is critical of brain communication and
      function. This study aims to investigate whether the use of Synaptive Medical's
      BrightMatterTM technology can help neurosurgeons to better visualize and plan surgeries by
      considering the white matter tracts, and whether it results in improved clinical outcomes.
      This study will investigate the preservation of the optic radiations in anterior temporal
      lobectomy epilepsy surgeries.

    <description>Control Group (involvement of BrightMatter™ Plan (BMP)): Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, who have been identified as candidates for anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) will be recruited. All epilepsy patients will have clinical MRI scans that include a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol. Surgery will be carried out according to usual standard of care, without the use of processing for DTI tractography. Additional clinical scanning with the same protocol will be carried out post-operatively at 6 months. Pre-operative and post-operative (6-month) visual field assessments (Estermann Perimetry and Humphrey Perimetry) will also be carried out . Primary outcomes will be assessed to identify the baseline incidence of visual of postoperative visual field deficits.</description>

    <description>Treatment group (involvement of all three products BrightMatter™ Plan (BMP), BrightMatter™ Bridge (BMB), and BrightMatter™ Guide(BMG): A treatment group (prospective enrollment) that uses the interventional technology will be recruited based on the same eligibility criteria as control cohort. All epilepsy patients will have clinical MRI scans that include a DTI protocol. For this treatment group of patients, the BrightMatter system (BMB,BMP, and BMG) will be employed pre-operatively and intra-operatively for planning before and guidance during anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR). Additional clinical scanning with the same protocol will be carried out post-operatively at 6 months. Pre-operative and post-operative (6-month) visual field assessments (Estermann Perimetry and Humphrey Perimetry) will also be carried out. Primary outcomes will be assessed to evaluate the effect of surgical planning and guidance with DTI tractography on outcomes, by comparison against the control cohort.</description>

    <description>BrightMatter™ Plan (BMP): BMP is a software that enables surgeons to plan their neurosurgery preoperatively. BMP automatically generates whole brain tractography and highly accurate fusion of anatomical MRI and DTI images.
BrightMatter™ Bridge (BMB):BMB involves offering SMI's MRI expertise to ensure a smooth workflow in neuroimaging including DTI to ensure optimized protocols are used to acquire the DTI images. Once the images are acquired, they are evaluated for their quality in real time using a quality control (QC) algorithm. The QC allows quality assessment of DTI images at the time-of-scan allowing for immediate correction while the patient is still there and reduces the need for patient re-scan.
BrightMatter™ Guide (BMG): BMG is a neuro-navigation system that utilizes the DTI information and the trajectory planned by the surgeon in BMP pre-operatively, but bringing it into the operating room intraoperatively.</description>
