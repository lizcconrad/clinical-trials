  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthopedic trauma is an unforeseen life-changing event. Nearly 2.8 million Americans sustain
      traumatic orthopedic injuries such as major fractures or amputation each year. Injury is
      treated in the hospital by physicians who medically stabilize and reconstruct the patient.
      Upon completion of their hospital stay, patients are discharged to begin their reintegration
      back into home and community activities. Despite high surgical success and survivorship
      rates, these injuries often result in poor quality of life (QOL)-related outcomes in
      otherwise healthy people. Fifty to ninety percent of patients develop severe psychological
      distress such as post-traumatic stress syndrome, depression or anxiety. Patients are often
      not provided the comprehensive support care and resources that are necessary to cope
      successfully with psychological stress and reintegrate into purposeful living. This is a
      major problem because high distress levels predict poor physical function, use of pain
      medications and low QOL. Survivors often cannot return to work, have persistent pain and
      experience social isolation. Distress worsens the self-perceptions of functional gain and
      efficacy and decreases personal fulfillment. Lingering psychological distress contributes to
      the development of other health problems and rebuilding of life is negatively impacted. The
      lack of psychosocial support contributes to injury re-occurrence, injury recidivism,
      re-hospitalizations and longer hospitalization stays, and higher personal and societal health
      care costs.

      There is currently a lack of comparative efficacy research to determine which delivery
      approach produces greater improvements in the outcomes that are most desired by patients,
      specifically, functional QOL and emotional well-being. The proposed research will directly
      compare these delivery-of-care approaches and measure the patient-reported outcomes that are
      considered important to patients.

  <detailed_description>

      The research study will determine whether the Usual Care or Integrated Care (which is Usual
      Care plus emotional support, and education/information during the hospital stay) helps
      patients feel better about their physical function and emotional well-being.

      Participants with serious musculoskeletal injury, being treated at to the University of
      Florida's (UF) Orthopaedic Trauma service at UF Health at Shands Hospital, will be randomized
      (like tossing a coin) between the two groups.

      Usual Care will follow all the highest standards for injury treatment.

      Integrated Care will include medical care and emotional support. Study Staff are trained to
      provide emotional support and teach patients the skills for goal setting, taking ownership of
      journey, establishing lifelines, mobilizing resources and reducing stressors.

      In addition, questionnaires and simple functional tests will be collected at the hospital and
      at normal follow-up visits at weeks 2, 6 and 12 and months 6 and 12.
