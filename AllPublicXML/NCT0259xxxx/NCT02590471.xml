      Comparison of two methods for revascularization of the superficial femoral artery: stenting
      of the superficial femoral artery vs. stenting of the superficial femoral artery supplemented
      with fasciotomy in Hunter canal in patients with steno-occlusive lesion of the
      femoro-popliteal segment of TASC C, D.

      Physiological flexions and extensions in hip and knee joints cause dramatic deformity in
      stented femoral and superficial femoral arteries, both axially and angularly. As a result,
      stents get broken, restenosed or thrombosed. Some researchers report a 20 to 46% two-year
      incidence of broke stents in the superficial femoral artery, while restenosis and occlusion
      incidence vary from 21.8% to 53.3% . In addition to axial and angular stress, contributing to
      this untoward effect is musculofascial sheath which houses the artery in distal thigh.

      Investigators suggest that standard stenting of an artery be augmented by incision of the
      anterior musculofascial sheath (septum intermuscular vastoadductoria) that will increase the
      mobility of distal part of the femoral artery, which will decrease frequency breakage of
      stents. Review of the world literature yielded no peer instances of such improvement of
      stenting outcomes in the said arteries.

    <description>A standard endovascular exposure is carried out under local anesthesia and a lesioned arterial segment is visualized. Stenosis or artery occlusion is passed by the hydrophilic guide. During the occlusion transluminal or subintimal artery recanalization (most frequently mixed) is conduced. Then balloon angioplasty of stenosis or occlusion are carried out. After the angiographic control if necessary stent of all the extension is mounted.</description>

Medical therapy includes aspirin (acid acetylsalicylic) prescription before the procedure (160 - 300 mg/d), beginning from minimum per day and heparin (heparin sodium) injection during the procedure (5000 U iv). After the procedure aspirin (acid acetylsalicylic) in dose 100 mg/d within long period should be prescribed in all the patients, and plavix (clopidogrel) in dose 75/d should be prescribed within 3 months.</description>
