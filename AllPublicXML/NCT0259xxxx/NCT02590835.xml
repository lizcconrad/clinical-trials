    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare conventional
      orthodontic treatment (control group) and piezocision-assisted orthodontic treatment (PS
      group). Twenty-four consecutive adult patients from the Orthodontics Department of Liege
      University Hospital, Belgium who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled from January to
      October of 2013.

    <description>Comparaison of the overall treatment time between the test group (piezocision group) and the control group will be performed. It will be evaluated by measuring the time (in days) between the placement and the debond of the orthodontic appliance. The hypothesis is that piezocision accelerate orthodontic tooth movement.</description>

    <description>A comparaison of orthodontic parameters (root resorption) between the test group and the control group before and after orthodontic treatment will be performed. The root resorption will be measured in intrabuccal radiographic (millimeters) on the day of the placement of this appliance and at the debond.</description>

    <description>Damon self-ligating systems (Ormco, Orange, Calif) were used for all patients. The patients were allowed to choose between clear or metal brackets. The bonding method was standardized and applied according to the manufacturer's instructions. After bracket bonding, 0.014-in copper-nickel-titanium Damon arch forms were placed. The subjects were recalled every two weeks, and the archwires were changed only when full bracket engagement was achieved. The sequence of archwires was as follows: 0.018-in, 0.014x0.025-in and 0.018x0.025-in copper nickel-titanium archwires for alignment; and 0.019x0.025-in stainless steel archwires for fine-tuning. Following the alignment steps, impressions were taken, and blinded orthodontic consultants validated appliance removal or provided advice regarding further adjustments. Alginate impressions were taken after the removal of the appliances, and both fixed and removable retainers were placed.</description>

    <description>The piezocisionTM surgery was performed one week after orthodontic appliance placement . The patients received local anesthesia in both arches, and vertical interproximal micro-incisions were created below each interdental papilla. In cases of root proximity (i.e., less than 2 mm of interdental bone), this procedure was not applied. These incisions were kept to a minimum (varying from 5 mm to 8 mm). Next, using a vertical piezoelectric device, 5-mm long and 3-mm deep corticotomies were made, and no subsequent sutures were required needed (figure 1). The patients were advised to take analgesics (paracetamol) only if necessary and to record their daily intakes for one week. Anti-inflammatories were prohibited to avoid interference with the RAP. Careful tooth brushing and the use of a mouthwash (chlorhexidine 0.2% Perio-Aid, Dentaid Benelux, Houten, Netherlands) were recommended for 7 days.</description>
