  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurements of Structured Light Plethysmography (SLP) using a chest wall movement based
      method will be compared to those obtained by spirometry using a flow based pneumotachograph
      method. This study will enable validation of SLP in children and adults by allowing direct
      comparison of simultaneous measurements of breathing sequences using the two measurement
      techniques.

      The investigators will also examine, in a group of normal adults, repeatability of the
      agreement between the two devices, and whether the agreement is affected by a change in tidal
      breathing parameters.

      Measurements using the Structured Light Plethysmography method will be compared to those
      obtained by spirometry using a flow based pneumotachograph.

      Spirometry is the gold standard for measuring lung function in both clinical support and
      research roles. Modern spirometers are high precision, reliable instruments enabling a large
      numbers of parameters relating to lung volumes and the rate of emptying the lungs during a
      forced expiration to be measured. The most common and accurate method to measure the
      patient's forced expiration is via pneumotachograph which measures the flow of air through a
      mouthpiece and integrates the signal to derive the volume expired.

      Structured Light Plethysmography (SLP) system that measures changes of the chest and
      abdominal wall movement during breathing by modelling the thorax and abdominal surface
      defined by a projected structured light pattern which enables a grid of virtual parts to be
      formed, the movement of which is recorded by digital cameras. SLP provides non-contact
      assessment to provide lung function data utilising structured light technologies and enhanced
      imaging processing.

      In this study direct comparison will be made of measurements recorded simultaneously using
      the two measuring devices in children and adults.

      To examine repeatability of the agreement between tidal breathing parameters measured by two
      techniques, repeated measurements will be performed in each of a group of normal adult
      subjects. The investigators will also examine whether the agreement is affected by a change
      in tidal breathing parameters. To obtain a change in tidal breathing parameters, measurements
      will be recorded during resting spontaneous breathing and after a period of exercise to
      elevate Respiratory Rate.
