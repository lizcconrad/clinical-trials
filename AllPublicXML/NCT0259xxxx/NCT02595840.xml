    <textblock>
      The aim of Trans-MARBLE is to identify and validate novel biomarkers of response and
      resistance to maintenance therapy with afatinib or pemetrexed in patients with EGFRmutated
      non-small-cell lung cancer who have progressed after first-line therapy with afatinib.

      Patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer who have progressed after first-line
      therapy with afatinib and participate in the AIO-TRK-0114 (MARBLE) study (EudraCT-No.
      2014-001983-36) are offered participation in Trans-MARBLE. If written informed consent is
      granted, archival surplus diagnostic tumor samples, blood samples and fresh tumor samples are
      acquired during medically indicated diagnostic procedures.

      All samples will be pseudonymized and shipped to the Coordinating Study Laboratory and
      Biobank (WBE) in Essen or to the Central ctDNA Sequencing Laboratory in Cologne. Biomaterials
      including DNA, RNA and proteins will be extracted and subjected to genomic, epigenetic and
      proteomic analyses. Assay results will be reported to the central study data base for
      scientific analyses. In addition, biomarker results obtained by NGS-based panel sequencing of
      tumor- and plasma-derived DNA will be reported back to the clinical investigators of the
      AIO-TRK-0114 (MARBLE) study, and can be shared with the study patients.
