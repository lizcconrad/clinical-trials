  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This IND-exempt Phase I trial will establish the recommended Phase II (RP2D) dose of eribulin
      in combination with fixed doses of oral irinotecan in adolescents and young adults with
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Eribulin will be administered intravenously on days 1
      and 8 of a 21-day cycle, while irinotecan will be administered orally on days 1-5.

      Patients will be assigned an eribulin dose level at the time of enrollment using a 3+3 Phase
      I design, and there will be no intrapatient dose escalation. Once the RP2D has been
      established, there will be up to 10 patients enrolled in a dose expansion cohort. In absence
      of disease progression or toxicity, subjects may receive up to 17 cycles of therapy.

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy at either
             original diagnosis or relapse for which no curative therapy exists, and which has
             either recurred or progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy. Patients with
             primary brain tumors, or those with brain metastases at time of potential enrollment,
             are excluded. Additionally, patients with GIST, alveolar soft part sarcoma, or

          -  Prior Therapy: No limit is placed on the number of prior therapies. Prior treatment
             with irinotecan or eribulin is allowed, although patients must not have received
             co-administration of eribulin and irinotecan and must not have had disease progression
             while receiving either eribulin or irinotecan.

                  completion of therapy with a biologic agent, whichever is longer. For agents that
                  have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this
                  period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are expected
                  to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with the PI of the
                  study.

               -  Immunotherapy: At least 6 weeks since the completion of any type of immunotherapy

             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation and for 4 months after the last dose of study chemotherapy.

                  (14 days if pegfilgrastim).

               -  Corticosteroids: Patients receiving corticosteroids who have not been on a stable
                  or decreasing dose of corticosteroid for the 7 days prior to enrollment are not
                  eligible.

               -  Medications that prolong the QTc:

          -  Infection: Patients who have an uncontrolled infection, or who are currently receiving
             treatment for C difficile infection.

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to eribulin or irinotecan.

             safety monitoring requirements of the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with eribulin and irinotecan. In
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.
