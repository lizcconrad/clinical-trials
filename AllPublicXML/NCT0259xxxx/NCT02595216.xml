      Prospective clinical study to evaluate the Profound efficiency Up to 60 healthy adult
      volunteers, male or females, 18 to 70 years old. All subjects in this study will receive a
      single treatment to the submental area with the profound device; subjects will return to four
      follow- up visits: 1 week post treatment, 1, 3 and 6 months post treatment.

      Prior to treatment, tissue will be treated with injected tumescence or local dermal
      infiltration solution according to the protocol.

      This study is a Prospective clinical study to evaluate the Profound device for submental
      laxity.

      Up to a total of 60 healthy candidates, seeking treatment for submental laxity. Subjects will
      receive one Profound treatment targeted to both dermal and subcutaneous layer of the skin.

      Before treatment (15-20 minutes) the tissue to be treated will be injected with tumescence
      solution.

      Each subject will be followed for additional four (4) post treatment visits
