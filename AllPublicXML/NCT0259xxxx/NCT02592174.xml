  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to measure the prevalence of according to the Frascati
      classification in a HIV-infected population aged between 55 and 70 years (exposed group) and
      to compare it with the prevalence of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) in
      unexposed subjects from the general population-based cohort CONSTANCES, matching subjects on
      age, gender, geographical origin and socioprofessional category.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To study factors associated with Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment (ANI) or Mild
           Neurocognitive Disorders (MND) by distinguishing the impact of traditional risk factors
           of neurocognitive impairment and those related to HIV infection,

        -  To compare in the exposed and unexposed population physical characteristics, complaints
           and comorbidities,

        -  To compare global neurocognitive scores in both populations after standardized normal
           reduction of each test.

      Methodology:

      HIV-infected subjects aged between 55 and 70 years will be recruited in centres that support
      people who living with HIV usually. The study will be proposed consecutively to all subjects
      aged between 55 and 70 year. A brief inquiry will collect motives on subjects that refuse to
      participate. A minimum of 70 subjects by 5 years age categories will be included. Unexposed
      subjects will be recruited in the same regions as their HIV-infected counterparts from the
      CONSTANCES database, a general population health cohort, after random selection matched on
      age, gender, geographical origin and socioprofessional category (2 HIV-unexposed subjects for
      1 exposed subject). Data collection will follow the same methods as in the CONSTANCES cohort,
      in particular the neurocognitive tests by trained neuropsychologists.

             loads during the 24 months period, and a last viral load within 6 months of
             inclusion). Blips, defined by a transitory elevation of viral load &lt; 200 copies/ml,

        Inclusion criteria for the subjects from the CONSTANCES cohort are an age between 55 and 70
        years. Non-inclusion criteria are the same as the HIV-infected subjects, as well as
