      The main objective of this study is to establish the postoperative &quot;pain pathways&quot; observed
      from D1 to D7 in the context of the current management after orthopedic, digestive,
      obstetrics and gynecology, urology, neurosurgery, vascular and thoracicn surgeries.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To assess the incidence of Post-Surgical Chronic Pain (PSCP) Chronic 3 months post
      intervention.

      B. To asses the incidence of neuropathic type pain (DN4 Questionnaire) at 3 months post
      intervention.

      C. To study the potential links between pain trajectories and the presence or absence of
      PSCP.

      D. To study the potential links between the presence or absence of PSCP and known risk
      factors for PSCP (patient-related data, data on the surgery, anesthesia data).
