      Diabetes is key risk factor for death following acute myocardial infarction. However, the
      long-term excess risk of death associated with diabetes following acute myocardial infarction
      not known. Investigators aimed to determine the long-term excess risk of death associated
      with diabetes among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI
      (NSTEMI) after adjustment for multimorbidity, risk factors and cardiac treatments.

        STEMI and NSTEMI were eligible for analysis if they have been hospitalised following AMI
        between the period of 2003-2013 and were aged at least 18 years. Only records of the first
        admission were considered for analyses.
