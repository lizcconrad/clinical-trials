      To compare refractive outcomes and patient's visual quality after bilateral cataract surgery
      when implanting multifocal intraocular lens, monofocal with monovision or hybrid monovision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results in randomized patients that receive
      bilateral multifocal IOLs, monofocal IOLs with monovision with emmetropia in one eye and 1.50
      D of myopia in the other eye, or monofocal IOL in the dominant eye and multifocal IOL in the
      non-dominant eye, then evaluate visual and refractive outcomes, as well as independence for
      glasses after bilateral surgery with 1 year of follow up.
