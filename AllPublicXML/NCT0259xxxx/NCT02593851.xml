  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, antiviral
      activity, and impact on the clinical course of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection
      after multiple oral doses of JNJ-53718678 at different doses and/or dosing regimens in
      infants (greater than [&gt;] 1 month to less than or equal to [&lt;=] 24 months of age) who are
      hospitalized with RSV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      partially double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned
      treatment), placebo-controlled, multicenter, multiple ascending dose study of JNJ 53718678 in
      infants (greater than [&gt;] 1 month to less than or equal to [&lt;=] 24 months of age) who are
      hospitalized with RSV infection. The duration of study will be approximately 4 weeks for each
      participant excluding screening period. In Part 1 of study, minimum total number of 42
      participants will be divided in 3 cohorts: Age group 1 (Cohorts 1a-1e) (greater than or equal
      to [&gt;=] 6 months and less than or equal to [&lt;=] 24 months of age), Age group 2 (Cohorts
      2a-2e)(&gt;=3 months and less than [&lt;] 6 months of age) and Age group 3 (Cohorts 3a-3e) (greater
      than [&gt;] 1 month and &lt;3 months of age). Each age group will consist of a minimum of 3 cohorts
      with the possibility to add 2 more per age group (Cohorts a through e) in which different
      doses and/or dosing regimens will be evaluated. Each cohort will consist of 5 participants (4
      participants receiving JNJ-53718678 and 1 participant receiving placebo for 7 days), except
      for the first cohort of each age group which will contain only 4 participants (4 participants
      receiving JNJ 53718678). In Part 2 of the study, all age groups will be included in a single
      cohort, Cohort f, in which the selected dose regimen determined during Part 1 of the study
      will be used for each of the 3 age groups. A minimum of approximately 18 (12 participants
      receiving JNJ 53718678 and 6 participants receiving placebo) and a maximum of 24 participants
      (16 participants receiving JNJ 53718678 and 8 participants receiving placebo) will be
      included in this part of the study. Pharmacokinetics and safety of JNJ-53718678 will be
      evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
