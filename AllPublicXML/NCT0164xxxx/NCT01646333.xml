  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the benefits of memory and problem solving
      training compared to supportive therapy in individuals with Parkinson's Disease with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and their support persons. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to receive memory and problem solving training or supportive therapy for 2-months. A 6-month
      follow up evaluation will establish if benefits remain over time. Impact of these therapies
      on thinking abilities, physical health, and patient and support person ratings of thinking
      skills, mood and quality of life will be evaluated. The memory and problem solving training
      is hypothesized to result in greater improvements and/or stability of function on
      neuropsychological tests of attention, working memory, learning, and memory skills compared
      to the supportive therapy condition. Both conditions are hypothesized to result in improved
      mood and quality of life ratings.

      Results from this study will determine whether memory and problem solving therapies and
      supportive therapy are easily used by and beneficial for individuals with Parkinson's Disease
      and Mild Cognitive Impairment. If positive benefit is observed, information from this study
      will be used to further optimize these therapies for larger trials designed to evaluate the
      value of the therapies for individuals with Parkinson's Disease and their support persons.

      The memory and problem solving training consists of a day calendar manual and note taking
      system and problem solving techniques. The supportive therapy offers patients and support
      persons the opportunity to discuss and reflect upon both Parkinson's Disease and
      non-Parkinson's Disease related problems.

    <description>The memory and problem solving training consists of a day calendar manual and note taking system and problem solving techniques. The neurocognitive memory intervention was adapted from a 6-week manualized day calendar and note taking system previously evaluated in an amnestic MCI sample and a brain tumor sample. The problem solving intervention was adapted from an originally 12-week intervention, which was later adapted into a 6-week brain tumor sample.</description>
