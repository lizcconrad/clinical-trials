    <measure>Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society / ASAS 20 response</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 20 response is a validated composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined timeframe at least 20% improvement in score in at least 3 of a conventional set of 4 clinical domains relevent to AS and no worsening in the fourth domain. ASAS 20 is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab against placebo.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ASAS 40 response</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 40 response is a validated composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined timeframe at least 40% improvement in score in at least 3 of a conventional set of 4 clinical domains relevent to AS and no worsening in the fourth domain. ASAS 40 is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab against placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum hsCRP</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRO), an acute phase reactant, are indicative of inflammation and of its severity, and can be used to monitor treatment response. A high sensitvity CRP (hsCRP) test is implemented in this study to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo in reducing AS elicited systemic inflammation over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ASAS 5/6 response</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 5/6 response is a validated composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined timeframe at least 20% improvement in score in at least 5 of a conventional set of 6 clinical domains relevent to AS and no worsening in the remaining domain. In this study, ASAS 5/6 is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab against placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index / BASDAI</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is a validated assessment tool using 0 through 10 scales (0 indicating &quot;no problem&quot; and 10 indicating &quot; worst problem&quot;), to characterize six clinical domains pertaining to five major symptoms of AS perceived by the patients. Computed composite scores of 4 or greater indicate suboptimal disease control. In this study, the BASDAI is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab verus placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function component of the short-form health survey / SF-36 PCS</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life across eight domains, which are both phyically and emotionally based. Two overall summary scores, the Phyical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. In this study, SF-36 PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire / ASQoL</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ASQoL is an 18 item questionnaire that assesses disease-specific quality of life (QoL), consisting of statements that are relevant to the physical and mental conditions for a participant with AS: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each statement is answered by the participant as a 'Yes' (scored as 1) or 'No' (scored as 0). All item scores are summed to give a total score. Total score can range from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL). In this study, ASQoL is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ASAS partial remission</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS partial remission is a composite assessment, reflecting the proportion of treated patients who achieve within a defined time frame a value not above 2 units in each of the 4 ASAS domains on a scale of 10. In this study ASAS partial remission is used to assess the efficacy of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall safety and tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>156 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>These assessments will be implemented in terms of physical examination and vital signs outcomes, clinical laboratory results, nature and frequency of the observed adverse events and serious adverse events, frequency and severity of any injection site reactions, ECG outcomes and the detection of immunogencity. During the first 16 weeks of the study, comparisons between the secukinumab treatment arms and the placebo treatment arm will also take place.</description>
