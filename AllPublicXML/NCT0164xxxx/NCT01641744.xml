  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines the effectiveness of parent-child Group Attachment Based Intervention
      (GABI) in reducing risk of maltreatment in infants and toddlers compared with parenting
      skills classes. GABI directly addresses the needs of isolated, marginalized families, with
      the goals of of enhancing parent coping and resilience, and improving parent-child attachment
      relationships.

      We hypothesize that compared to usual care, GABI will be associated with improved child,
      parent and parent-child outcomes.

      Child abuse and neglect (&quot;maltreatment&quot;) pose enormous short- and long-term risks to
      children. Yet despite the critical importance of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
      Services, Maternal and Child Health Bureau's goal &quot;to reduce fatal and non-fatal child
      maltreatment,&quot; non-empirically supported parenting skills classes remain child welfare
      agencies' standard approach to meeting this goal.

      The study examines the effectiveness of parent-child Group Attachment Based Intervention
      (GABI) in reducing risk of maltreatment in infants and toddlers compared with parenting
      skills classes. GABI directly addresses the needs of isolated, marginalized families, with
      the goals of of enhancing parent coping and resilience, and improving parent-child attachment
      relationships.

      One hundred families with children aged 2-36 months who are referred for parenting help will
      be randomly assigned to either GABI or &quot;treatment as usual&quot; that consists of parents-only
      parenting skills classes. Treatment will be offered for up to 6 months. Both groups will be
      assessed at baseline, end of treatment and at 6 months follow up.
