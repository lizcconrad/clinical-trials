  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One out of two adults in Canada is currently overweight and therefore at increased risk for a
      number of medical conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attacks and
      stroke. Obesity is less prevalent in populations consuming large amounts of dietary fibre,
      suggesting that fibre intake could play an important role in prevention and progression of
      obesity and diabetes and other conditions. Several studies have suggested that fibre has a
      positive effect on blood sugar and may help lower body weight.

      The purpose of this study is to help better understand the effect of adding fibre
      supplementation to a low calorie diet on blood sugar control and weight loss. The
      investigators hypothesize that blood sugar control will improve in participants in the fibre
      supplementation group.

      Men and women, with stable Type 2 Diabetes (e.g. no medication change in the last 3 months),
      between 18 - 75 years of age, and with a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 27 - 60 kg/m2 can
      participate in this study.
