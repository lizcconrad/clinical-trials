  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate if eating a high fat meal versus not eating
      any food affects how the study drug (Nikkomycin Z) is absorbed into the body. The second
      purpose is to gain further information about the safety of Nikkomycin Z in healthy adults.
