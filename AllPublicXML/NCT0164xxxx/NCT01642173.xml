  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's hypothesis is that local activation of the endogenous Lp-PLA2 plays an
      integral role in early atherosclerosis, and contributes to the mechanism of coronary
      endothelial dysfunction and to the structural and mechanical properties that characterize
      plaque vulnerability. Thus, the investigators study will characterize prospectively the
      correlation between the functional and structural vascular wall properties, and the activity
      of the Lp-PLA2 pathway.

      The present study was a substudy of our National Institute of Health (NIH) funded and
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved (08-008161) protocol &quot;Lp-PLA2 and Coronary
      Atherosclerosis in Humans&quot; and (10-000044) &quot;Lp-PLA2 and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Humans
      Aim III&quot; in which the investigators are examining the impact of long-term inhibition of
      Lp-PLA2, with a specific novel inhibitor, on Lp-PLA2 activity and improvement in coronary
      endothelial function.

      This substudy will use Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to quantify alternate features of
      plaque vulnerability including superficial microcalcification, fibrous cap thickness, and
      plaque macrophage content at baseline and again at 6 months following Lp-PLA2 inhibition.

      The study will provide insight into the role of the endogenous Lp-PLA2 in early coronary
      atherosclerosis, a potential therapeutic target for early coronary atherosclerosis in humans.
