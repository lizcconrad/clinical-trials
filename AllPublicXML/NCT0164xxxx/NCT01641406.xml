    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel neoadjuvant regimen for invasive breast
      carcinoma by using the MD Anderson residual cancer burden score.To prospectively evaluate the
      utility of the PET scan to guide the neoadjuvant treatment and the utility of the Oncotype
      test as a stratifier for treatment decisons in ER+/Her2- patients. To evaluate the clinical
      anti-tumor activity of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in ER+/Her2 negative patients. To
      evaluate the prognostic factors associated associated with pathological response as measured
      by the residual cancer burden tool.

      Treatment propose of TEC-NAX for the triple negatives and for the Her2+ cases. For the
      Er+/Her2- cases, we propose to use the PET scan to guide therapy after the first course of
      TEC. Those who drop in SUV≤5%, will have their treatment modified by using the Oncotype test.
      Those Her2 negative patients whose response to the first 4 courses of induction TEC is less
      than a complete remission, will have their tretment changed to a second line regimen,
      Navelbine-Avastin-Xeloda(NAX), with the intention of capturing a better response prior to
      surgery. Those who are Her2+ will initially also receive TEC but subsequent therapy will
      include Trastuzumab(Herceptin) whether thet respond wellor not to TEC.
