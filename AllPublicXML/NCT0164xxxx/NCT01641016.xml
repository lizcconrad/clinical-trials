  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the BREATHER trial is to evaluate the role of Short-Cycle Therapy (SCT) in
      the management of HIV-infected young people who have responded well to antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) and to determine whether young people with chronic HIV infection undergoing Short-Cycle
      Therapy of five days on ART and two days off maintain the same level of viral load
      suppression as those on continuous therapy, over 48 weeks.

      To assess the advantages and disadvantages of the strategy, the incidence of toxicities,
      immunological control, resistance mutations, acceptability, quality of life and adherence to
      the randomised strategy will also be compared.

      Importantly, because of insufficient data on short-term viral load rebound after stopping ART
      in this population, the trial will incorporate an initial pilot phase in selected centres, to
      assess the safety of the SCT strategy by evaluating detailed HIV-1 RNA profiles of
      participants on the SCT strategy.

    <description>This outcome measure only considers HIV-1 RNA measurements at these time points due to the difference in viral load monitoring in the pilot phase and the main trial. However if a young person enrolled in the pilot phase has HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/ml at weeks 1, 2 or 3 (reproducible on the same sample) or at week 8 (confirmed on the same sample within 1 week), they will be considered as reaching the primary outcome at week 4 and 12 respectively</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infected young people aged 8 to 24 years inclusive (Young people recruited
             between the ages of 16-21 must either be in regular physical contact with their
             clinician or be able to transfer to an adult physician at the same site for follow-up
             or to an affiliated adult site).

          -  Parents/carers and/or young people, where applicable, willing to provide informed
             consent.

          -  On a stable first-line ART treatment containing at least 2 NRTIs/NtRTIs and EFV for at
             least 12 months and willing to continue the regimen throughout the study period. Young
             people on regimens containing nevirapine (NVP) or a boosted protease inhibitor with
             undetectable viral load for over one year who wish to enrol should switch to EFV. Once
             they are stable on the EFV containing regimen for more than 12 weeks they may be
             enrolled (must have 2 subsequent HIV-1 RNA measurements &lt;50 c/ml over a minimum period
             of 12 weeks). Previous dual therapy and/or substitution of NRTIs is allowed providing
             any changes were not for disease progression, immunological or virological failure
             (where virological failure is defined as two successive HIV-1 RNA results&gt;1000 c/ml)
             subsequent to virological control having been achieved on ART.

          -  Viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/ml) for at least the prior 12 months (at least the
             last 3 measurements, including screening): young people who have experienced a single
             viral load &gt;50 but &lt;1000 copies/ml (preceded and followed by VL&lt;50 c/ml) in the last
             12 months can be enrolled.

          -  CD4 cell count ≥350 106/L at screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or risk of pregnancy in females of child bearing potential.

          -  Acute illness (young people may be enrolled after illness).

          -  Receiving concomitant therapy for an acute illness (young people may be enrolled after
             finishing therapy).

          -  A creatinine, AST or ALT of grade 3 or above at screening.

          -  On a regimen including nevirapine or a boosted PI (young people may switch to an EFV
             based regimen).

          -  Previous ART monotherapy (except for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission)
