  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, and life-threatening disease.
      In many patients, the course of PAH is a steady deterioration and reduced life expectancy.

      Sildenafil was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of PAH in pediatric
      patients in May 2011, making it the first agent to be approved for the treatment of children
      with PAH. The approval was based on the largest placebo-controlled study to be conducted in
      this population. The recommended dose in pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old is 10
      mg TID in patients ≤ 20 kg and 20 mg TID for patients &gt; 20 kg. Higher doses are not
      recommended in pediatrics patients.

      This study is an open-label, multi-center study to investigate safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of sildenafil citrate in Japanese pediatric patients with PAH.

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

        <title>Change From Baseline in World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class in Participants With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) at Week 28, 40 and 52</title>
        <description>WHO functional classification for PAH range from Class I (no limitation in physical activity, no dyspnea with normal activity), Class II (slight limitation of physical activity), Class III (marked limitation of physical activity) and Class IV (cannot perform a physical activity without any symptoms, dyspnea at rest). The change from baseline in WHO functional class was classified into “Improved”, “No change” and “Worsened”. Improvement = reduction in functional class, worsened = increase in functional class and no change = no change in functional class.</description>

Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
