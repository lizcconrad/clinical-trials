  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of chronic resveratrol supplementation have yet to be investigated in healthy
      humans. It is hypothesised that the effects will be different to those seen in acute
      supplementation. This study will look specifically at cognitive performance, cerebral blood
      flow, subjective sleep, mood and health, blood pressure and plasma levels of resveratrol. It
      is hypothesized that these measures will be affected differently by acute and chronic
      supplementation.

    <measure>Chronic Modulation of Cerebral Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>40- 80 minutes post- dose on day 28 of supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in the frontal cortex with Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Modulation was deemed to have taken place if levels differed significantly from day 1 to day 28.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Modulated Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective mood was assessed with the Profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire every 7 days during the 28- day period. Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of mood if their scores on week 1, week 2, week 3 and/or week 4 differed significantly from scores on the baseline questionnaire completed on day 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Modulated Cognitive Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance was assessed by a range of cognitively demanding tasks on day 28 of the supplementation period. Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of cognitive performance if their scores on these tasks were significantly different from scores taken on day 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Significant Modulation of Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective perception of sleep quality was assessed with the PSQI. Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of sleep if scores on Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 and/or Week 4 differed significantly from those on day 1 (baseline).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Significant Modulation of Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective perceptions of health were assessed with the General Health Questionnaire. Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of health if scores on Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 and/or Week 4 differed significantly from day 1 (baseline) completion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Significant Modulation of Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of blood pressure if their readings on day 28 differed significantly from that taken on day 1 (baseline).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Significant Modulation of CBF in MCA</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>CBF was assessed in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) with Trans-cranial doppler via a trans- temporal acoustic window. Participants were deemed to have significant modulation of CBF in the MCA if readings differed significantly from those obtained on day 1 (baseline).</description>
