  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a combination of
      weekly docetaxel, cisplatin, and S-1 (weekly TPS) as induction chemotherapy in patients with
      locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      Combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF) is the standard treatment for
      patients with locally advanced squamous cancer of the head and neck. CF chemotherapy has been
      reported to increase survival and disease free survival in patients with unresectable disease
      when given before definitive radiotherapy, showing overall response rate as 75-85% including
      of CR rate of 25-35%. To improvement of treatment, docetaxel was incorporated into CF as
      induction treatment and it showed the prolongation of progression free survival and overall
      survival in large scale of randomized phase III trials, therefore triple combination
      induction regimen would be standard treatment in advanced head and neck cancer. Recently, the
      introduction of oral fluoropyrimidine showed similar or enhanced response rate, also
      favorable safety and convenience than intravenous fluoropyrimidine in advanced gastric
      cancer. Of the oral fluoropyrimidines, S-1 showed promising preliminary result in combination
      chemotherapy with cisplatin in head and neck cancer. In patients with advanced gastric
      cancer, phase I study of S-1, docetaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy was reported
      and the recommended doses were 40mg/m2 bid, 60mg/m2 (D1) and 60mg/m2 (D1), respectively.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel,
      cisplatin and S-1 combination chemotherapy according to above dosage.

    <time_frame>Response rate was evaluated 1 months after completion of CCRT</time_frame>
    <description>After completion of CCRT, response rate was assessed. Patients underwent examination by an otolaryngologist, CT or MRI imaging of the primary tumor and neck. A biopsy of the primary site was recommended if possible. Tumor response was assessed according to the RECIST. For all patients with complete response (CR) on physical examination and CT or MRI scan, PET scan was performed for confirmation at 1 month after CT or MRI confirmation.</description>

    <description>Progression free survival means that the time from date of initiation of treatment until the date of first documented progression. Patients who completed treatment were followed by physician examination and CT or MRI scanning every 3 months for 1 year and then these checkup was done every 6 months for another one year.</description>

    <description>Cisplatin and 5-FU is the standard treatment for patients with head and neck cancer. Recently,docetaxel was used into CF, and it showed the prolongation of survival. Oral 5-FU showed similar or enhanced response rate, safety than intravenous 5-FU. S-1 showed promising preliminary result in combination with cisplatin in head and neck cancer. In patients with gastric cancer, phase I study of S-1, docetaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy was reported and the recommended doses were 40mg/m2 bid, 60mg/m2 (D1) and 60mg/m2 (D1), respectively. And weekly docetaxel can reduce adverse events compared to 3 week regimen. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 combination chemotherapy</description>

    <intervention_name>S-1</intervention_name>
    <description>S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, based on the concept of biochemical modulation. It consists in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1: tegafur, a prodrug that is slowly metabolized to 5-fluorouracil; gimeracil, which reversibly inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. In patients with advanced gastric cancer, phase I study of S-1, docetaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy was reported and the recommended doses were 40mg/m2 bid (D1-D14), 60mg/m2 (D1) and 60mg/m2 (D1), respectively.</description>

    <description>In patients with advanced gastric cancer, phase I study of S-1, docetaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy was reported and the recommended doses were 40mg/m2 bid (D1-D14), 60mg/m2 (D1) and 60mg/m2 (D1), respectively. Another phase II study of TPS as induction chemotherapy for locally advanced HNSCC was determined to be 70/70/60 mg∙m2/d every 3 weeks. However, the rate of grade 3-4 neutropenia was 75% at this recommended dose. To reduce the hematologic toxicities, we used the docetaxel weekly. Therefore following regimen was evaluated in this study; docetaxel 30 mg/m2 (D1, D8), cisplatin 60mg/m2 (D1), S-1 70mg/m2 (D1-D14) every 3 weeks.</description>
