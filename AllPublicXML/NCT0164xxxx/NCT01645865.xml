  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although gains have been made in achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals
      (MDG), much is still needed in countries affected by high levels of HIV/AIDS. Prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is a cornerstone strategy in reducing infant mortality
      from HIV. The study will employ a cluster randomized control trial (cRCT) with 26 health
      facilities randomized to two arms (intervention or control) to determine the effect of mobile
      phone technology on completion of key PMTCT milestones from antenatal to six weeks
      postpartum. The study will examine the acceptability, effectiveness, and cost of implementing
      a PMTCT-focused mHealth strategy among HIV-infected pregnant women, health workers, and male
      partners.
