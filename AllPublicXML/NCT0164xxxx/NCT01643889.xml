  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of single and multiple doses of
      domperidone on the QTc interval duration in healthy adult volunteers at domperidone doses of
      10 mg four times a day (q.i.d.) and 20 mg q.i.d.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), placebo- and
      positive-controlled, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that
      the participant receives), single-dose and multiple-dose, 4-way crossover (method used to
      switch participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical trial) study. A placebo
      control will be used to evaluate the effect of domperidone on QTc intervals in comparison
      with placebo. QTc is a measure of time in the heart electrical cycle. Placebo is an inactive
      substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a
      clinical trial. Moxifloxacin, which is known to prolong QTc intervals, will be used as
      positive control to establish assay sensitivity. The participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 4 treatment sequence groups (ADBC, BACD, CBDA, and DCAB) based on a
      computer-generated randomization schedule and will receive the following 4 treatments in the
      order specified by the randomization: Treatment A (10 mg domperidone); Treatment B (20 mg
      domperidone); Treatment C (placebo); Treatment D (moxifloxacin). The study has 3 phases: a
      screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase (that corresponds to 4 treatment periods),
      and an assessment period. Each treatment period will last 4 days and will be separated with a
      washout period (ie, period when receiving no treatment) of 4 to 9 days. The participants will
      be confined to the clinical testing facility for approximately 5 days in each period. All
      treatments (A, B, C and D) will be given orally with water. The maximum study duration for a
      participant will be 74 days.
