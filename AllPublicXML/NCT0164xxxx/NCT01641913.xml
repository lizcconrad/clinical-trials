      Do patient's with eosinophilic esophagitis have increased small intestinal permeability and
      if this changes in response to topically administered esophageal steroids?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis is an allergy mediated disease in which antigens exposed to the
      gastrointestinal tract trigger a combined immediate hypersensitivity.

      The investigators anticipate that patients with active eosinophilic esophagitis will have
      increased intestinal permeability on urine collection of sugars. The investigators are not
      sure whether these findings will be found in patients who have been successfully treated with
      topical esophageal steroids. Improvement in intestinal permeability would be perceived as
      indicating that esophageal disease drives the intestinal permeability. Lack of improvement
      would indicate that eosinophilic esophagitis is a more systemic disease in which increased
      small bowel permeability is a marker or perhaps important driver of the disease.
