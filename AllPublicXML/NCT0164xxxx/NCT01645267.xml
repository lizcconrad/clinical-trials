    <textblock>
      In this foot deformity (plano valgus) surgery may be indicated. The deformity is corrected
      with an osteotomy at the heelbone. In most cases bone graft material has to be obtained from
      the iliac crest to support the osteotomy. In the planned study a group of children will be
      operated with an artificial bone graft material and thus avoiding the need harvesting of bone
      graft at the iliac crest.

    <textblock>
      Planovalgus or flatfoot deformity is observed in children with different neuromuscular
      disorders and is associated with pain and gait disorders due to non-reducible talonavicular
      joint subluxation. Surgical treatment is aimed at correcting foot malalignement and achieving
      sufficient plantar flexion in the ankle joint. With a calcaneal lengthening osteotomy
      procedure the planovalgus deformity can be corrected but it requires the use of graft
      material to be inserted as a bone wedge at the osteotomy site. In this way the talonavicular
      joint is indirectly reduced. Obtaining autograft material from the iliac crest in growing
      children carries a risk of growth arrest and iliac wing deformity which has led to widespread
      use of allograft bone when performing the operation.

      New materials are being developed as substitutes for bone graft material with biphasic
      calcium phosphate ceramic (BCP) being the most commonly used. BCP is a mixture of porous
      hydroxyapatite (HA) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β -TCP). Calcium phosphate ceramics have
      excellent biocompatibility and are thought to be able to facilitate and guide new bone
      growth. This has been demonstrated in experimental studies. In retrospective clinical studies
      on patients having filled large bone defects with hydroxyapatite graft material radiological
      healing is seen at follow ups after average 7.9 years. It has also previously been
      demonstrated that BCP can be used as artificial bone graft in osteotomies with a good result
      and complete healing of the osteotomi.
