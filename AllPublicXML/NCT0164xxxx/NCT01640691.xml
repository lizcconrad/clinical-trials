  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this single arm study are to evaluate the immune response and safety
      profiles of two injections of an inactivated whole-virion vaccine containing aluminum
      hydroxide adjuvant, AdimFlu-W (H5N1), against influenza A (H5N1) in healthy adults.

    <measure>Immunogenicity Endpoint: hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer and microneutralization (MN) titer</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 43 (21 days after the second dose).</time_frame>
    <description>The primary immune response endpoint is to evaluate the seroconversion rate (SCR) in terms of HAI assays at Day 43 (21 days after the second dose).The secondary HAI endpoints are defined as following:
SCR for the first vaccination, at Day 22.
Seroprotection rates (SPR) for each vaccination, at Day 22 and 43.
The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) for each vaccination, at Day 22 and 43.
The supportive immunogenicity endpoints of MN antibodies are SCRs, SPRs and GMFRs at Day 22 and 43.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles including the presence or absence of the pre-specified reactogenicity events and other serious/non-serious adverse events after vaccination.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 weeks after two doses of study vaccine, 4 weeks apart. Reactogenicity will be recorded for 7 days after each vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety data will consist of reactogenicity, serious and non-serious adverse events. Reactogenicity events are pre-specified adverse events systematically recorded for 7 days after each vaccination.The events included fever (≥38.0°C), runny nose or nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, vomiting, nausea and malaise. Furthermore, the local (injection site) reactions were also evaluated, including soreness/pain, swelling, redness, ecchymosis and limitation of arm motion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or non-pregnant female (as indicated by a negative urine pregnancy test
             immediately on the day prior to first vaccine administration) between 20 to 60 years
             of age at the time of the first vaccination. Women of childbearing potential agree to
             practice highly effective birth control throughout the study (from Screening to Month
             3).

          -  Subjects are free of obvious health problems as judged by investigator (established by
             medical history and physical examination) before entering the study.

          -  Subject is physically and mentally capable of participating in the study and willing
             to adhere to study procedures to complete all elements of the study diary.

          -  Subjects provide signed informed consent after receiving a detailed explanation of the
             study protocol prior to any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history of physician-confirmed infection with an H5N1 virus or a history of
             vaccination with an H5N1 influenza vaccine.

          -  Subject is at high risk of contracting H5N1 influenza infection (e.g. poultry
             workers).

          -  Has received any other licensed vaccines within 2 weeks for inactivated vaccines or 4
             weeks for live vaccines prior to enrollment in this study.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the
             study period.

          -  Subject has used oral or parenteral steroids, high-dose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day
             of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic
             drugs within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine.

          -  Subject has received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 90 days prior to
             first dose of study vaccine, or planned administration of any blood products during
             the study period.

          -  Subject has a known allergy to eggs or other components of the study vaccine.

          -  Subject has a history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis.

          -  Subject has a history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome.

          -  Subject has an acute illness or temperature greater than 38.0 degrees Celsius by any
             method within 3 days prior to each vaccination.

          -  Subject has confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition
             including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Subject has a rash, dermatologic condition or tattoos which may interfere with
             injection site reaction rating.

          -  Evidence of substance (alcohol or drug) abuse or of neurological or psychiatric
             diagnoses which, even if clinically stable, are deemed by the investigator to render
             the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.

          -  Subjects with abnormal laboratory results at screening:(1) ALT or AST &gt; or = 1 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN). (2) Creatinine &gt; or = 1 x ULN. (3) Any significant laboratory
             abnormality as judged by the investigator
