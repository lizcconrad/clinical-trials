    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal Feasibility Study of a novel non-invasive device in assessing
      radiation dose exposure in humans. All patients receiving whole body irradiation therapy and
      meeting all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive ocular flare meter measurements
      and slit-lamp examinations on up to eleven occasions starting prior to the first fractional
      dose of irradiation.
