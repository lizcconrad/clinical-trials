    <textblock>
      Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) suffer from breathlessness, poor quality
      of life and inability to function, despite medical therapy Current consensus states that
      combination therapy with different classes of PAH-specific therapy is likely to bring
      additional benefit to PAH patients. In this study we plan to study how exercise performance
      changes when the phosphodiesterase inhibitor vardenafil is added to patients who remain
      symptomatic from PAH when treated with inhaled iloprost.

      Following baseline assessment, all Patients will start vardenafil 10 mg bid. If the drug is
      tolerated by the patients, after a two week period, up titration to 20 mg bid will be
      permitted, at the discretion of the investigators.

      According to treatment protocol up titration will be done carefully and whenever side effects
      will be reported up titration will be stopped or dosage will be decreased or stopped
      according to the investigator judgment.

      Systemic BP will be measured at baseline assessment. The patient will attend the clinic for
      the first dose monitoring (10 mg) and after up titration of the study drug to 20 mg.

      Systemic BP will be measured at baseline assessment. The patient will attend the clinic for
      the first dose monitoring (10 mg) and after up titration of the study drug to 20 mg. A fall
      in SBP of&gt;30 mmHg will be considered significant or any smaller value at the discretion of
      the investigator. BP will be measured according to the following protocol.

      Pre-dose Immediately before administration of vardenafil. This will be timed approximately
      one hour prior to the next planned dose of iloprost.

      Pre-inhalation One hour post vardenafil dose, immediately prior to iloprost inhalation.

      Post-inhalation Immediately following completion of iloprost inhalation and every fifteen
      minutes for one hour.

      Prior to discharge Two hours following the iloprost.

      Later monitoring At all follow-up visits, BP will be measured.

      This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding higher doses of
      vardenafil to inhaled iloprost over 3 months.
