  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus about the optimal treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with
      cirrhotic portal hypertension, While this group of patients are classified as hepatectomy
      contraindication according to guidelines from National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
      and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). With improvement of
      surgical technique, preoperative evaluation, and perioperative management,especially the
      Precise Hepatectomy Technique, more and more studies confirmed the safety of surgical
      intervention to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with cirrhotic portal
      hypertension.However, most of the previous studies were either retrospective or with small
      samples.

      The investigators project is a prospective randomized controlled trial, planning to compare
      the safety, efficacy and quality of life between precise hepatectomy and combined
      interventional treatment on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cirrhotic portal
      hypertension, to make a further understanding of optimal strategy.
