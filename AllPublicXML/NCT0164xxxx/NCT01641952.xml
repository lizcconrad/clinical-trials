    <textblock>
      This observational, prospective, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      MabThera/Rituxan in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response
      or intolerance to one anti-TNF therapy. Participants who receive MabThera/Rituxan according
      to the current standard and in line with the summary of product characteristics at a dose of
      1000 milligram (mg) intravenously on Days 1 and 15 will be followed for 20 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participant With Good or Moderate Response According to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity. It is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity], and ESR. DAS28 total scores range from 0 to 10. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 indicates low disease activity, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 indicates moderate to high disease activity. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. The DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of change from baseline (CFB) and the level of disease activity reached. Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &gt;1.2. Moderate response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2 or &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2. No response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &lt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 or &lt;=0.6.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in DAS28-ESR at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using an assessment of 28 joints, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (milliliter per hour [ml/hr]), and Patient's Global Assessment (PGH) of disease activity [measured on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity]. DAS28 was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PGH of disease activity. Total score range: 0-10, with a higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity, DAS &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ is a self-completed patient questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities. Each domain has at least 2 component questions. There are 4 possible responses for each component 0=without any difficulty 1=with some difficulty 2=with much difficulty 3=unable to do. Calculate HAQ the patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains. The HAQ is the sum of the scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score (in range 6-8) for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participant With Good or Moderate Response According to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response Criteria</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity. It is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity], and ESR. DAS28 total scores range from 0 to 10. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 indicates low disease activity, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 indicates moderate to high disease activity. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. The DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of change from baseline (CFB) and the level of disease activity reached. Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &gt;1.2. Moderate response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2 or &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2. No response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &lt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 or &lt;=0.6.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DAS28-ESR at Week 20</title>
        <description>DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using an assessment of 28 joints, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (milliliter per hour [ml/hr]), and Patient's Global Assessment (PGH) of disease activity [measured on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity]. DAS28 was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PGH of disease activity. Total score range: 0-10, with a higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity, DAS &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity. It is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity], and ESR. DAS28 total scores range from 0 to 10. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 indicates low disease activity, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 indicates moderate to high disease activity. A negative CFB indicates improvement. The DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of CFB and the level of disease activity reached. Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &gt;1.2. Moderate response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2 or &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2. No response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &lt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 or &lt;=0.6.</description>

          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity. It is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity], and ESR. DAS28 total scores range from 0 to 10. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 indicates low disease activity, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 indicates moderate to high disease activity. A negative CFB indicates improvement. The DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of CFB and the level of disease activity reached. Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &gt;1.2. Moderate response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2 or &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2. No response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &lt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 or &lt;=0.6.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Remission (DAS28 &lt;2.6) and Low Disease Activity Following Each Treatment Course</title>
        <description>DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using an assessment of 28 joints, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (milliliter per hour [ml/hr]), and Patient's Global Assessment (PGH) of disease activity (measured on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity). DAS28 was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PGH of disease activity. Total score range: 0-10, with a higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity, DAS &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

DAS28 &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity, DAS &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Remission (DAS28 &lt;2.6) and Low Disease Activity Following Each Treatment Course for Subgroup of Participants Who Had Been Treated With Etanercept or Adalimumab or Infliximab Before Rituximab</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity. It is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity], and ESR. DAS28 total scores range from 0 to 10. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 indicates low disease activity, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 indicates moderate to high disease activity. A negative change from Baseline (CFB) indicates improvement. The DAS28-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as none, good, and moderate, depending on the extent of CFB and the level of disease activity reached. Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &gt;1.2. Moderate response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2 or &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;1.2. No response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and CFB &gt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 and CFB &lt;=0.6, DAS28 &gt;5.1 and CFB &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 or &lt;=0.6.</description>

        <description>HAQ is a self-completed patient questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities. Each domain has at least 2 component questions. There are 4 possible responses for each component 0=without any difficulty 1=with some difficulty 2=with much difficulty 3=unable to do. Calculate HAQ the patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains. The HAQ is the sum of the scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score (in range 6-8) for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>
