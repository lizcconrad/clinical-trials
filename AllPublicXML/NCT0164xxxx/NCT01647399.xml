  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma has become considerably more prevalent and severe in the U.S. during the last 40
      years, particularly affecting youth in urban areas, yet the reasons for this are not clear.
      There is increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency contributes to more severe asthma
      through increased risk of respiratory infections and decreased sensitivity to
      glucocorticoids. Indeed, low vitamin D levels are linked with the need for exogenous
      glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities,
      we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African
      American (AA) youth. Importantly, AA youth in ours and other studies had lower vitamin D
      levels than non-AA participants.

      Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other
      racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency
      department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy
      People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of
      asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic
      control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this study is to provide critical
      epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and
      impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with
      regard to urban AA youth with asthma. We hypothesize that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      [25(OH)D] levels are associated with poor chronic asthma control, worse acute asthma
      severity, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. The knowledge generated by the experiments in
      this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible, and
      thereby potentially disparity-reducing prospective therapy for asthma.
