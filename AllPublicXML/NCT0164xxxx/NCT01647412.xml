  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the estimated one million Americans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), approximately
      20-30% develop this condition during childhood or adolescence, most of whom have Crohn's
      disease (CD). It appears that some individuals are genetically susceptible to certain
      nutrients, causing inflammation and disturbance of their immune system, as well as disruption
      of the intestinal barrier. This leads to malnutrition and inhibited growth, with many
      patients experiencing intense abdominal pain and diarrhea.

      Most physicians treat the disease with drugs that suppress the immune system and decrease the
      inflammatory process. Although these drugs frequently induce remission, most patients
      experience a subsequent return of symptoms and fail to catch up on their growth.
      Additionally, serious side effects are associated with these drugs.

      Individuals genetically prone to CD are believed to have a leaky gut that allows substances
      to pass through the intestinal wall and react with the underlying immune system. Furthermore,
      those nutrients that are toxic to these individuals pass through the decreased intestinal
      barrier triggering an extreme immune response. Nutrients that have been implicated include
      grains, except rice, dairy products, and any food containing carrageenan. Excluding these
      nutrients from the diet has been shown to beneficial for CD patients. Certain nutraceuticals,
      such as curcumin and omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to provide anti-inflammatory
      effects in IBD patients. In addition, the administration growth hormone (GH), has been shown
      to alleviate symptoms, by enhancing the repair of the intestinal epithelium, preventing toxic
      antigens from reaching the underlying lamina propria.

      Previous studies and case reports provide incomplete evidence that exclusion diet with
      nutraceuticals (DNT) and GH lead to sustained long term remission in juvenile CD,
      discontinuation of other CD drugs, and catch up growth. This study is designed to test this
      hypothesis. Patients in the treatment group will be treated with DNT and GH, while continuing
      to receive medications from their physician while the control group will receive DNT, placebo
      injections instead of GH. We predict that the treatment group will show greater improvement
      than the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most widely held hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) is that overly aggressive acquired immune responses to a subset of commensal enteric
      bacteria develop in genetically susceptible hosts. In an attempt to avoid disease
      progression, patients are treated with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and monoclonal
      antibody drugs, which frequently produce remissions. However, these drugs usually fail to
      achieve long-term, sustained remission or reversal of growth failure, and are associated with
      serious side effects. Recently, intestinal barrier dysfunction has been implicated in an
      alternative 3-step model of IBD pathogenesis.

      The investigators hypothesize that the exclusion diet and nutraceutical therapy (DNT) will
      decrease the production of toxic antigens in the gut and that reactive human growth hormone
      (rhGH) will reduce the passage of the remaining toxic antigens to the underlying mucosal
      immune system by promoting the maintenance of the intestinal barrier and accelerating the
      restitution of the intestinal epithelial lining.

      The following study will test whether the the 3-step model is accurate, and whether rhGH and
      DNT will induce sustained remission in juvenile CD patients.
