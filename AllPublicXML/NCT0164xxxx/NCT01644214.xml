      Objectives: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition for which pessaries are
      commonly used in conservative treatment. Despite their prevalence, there is no literature to
      guide the management of pessaries. Our objective is to determine whether patients managed
      with a pessary for POP are more satisfied with follow-up at 3 or 6 month intervals and if
      there is any difference in complications rates between the two groups.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that there will be higher patient satisfaction in
      the group randomized to 6 month follow-up intervals and that there will be no difference in
      complication rates between the two follow-up groups.

      Method: The investigators will conduct a prospective randomized control trial comparing
      patient satisfaction and complication rates between patients with pessaries randomized to
      either 3 or 6 month follow-up intervals over 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females with POP who have opted for conservative management with a pessary

          -  Able to read and write English

          -  First time pessary users

          -  Successful fitting with a covered ring or Gellhorn pessary, as determined at the usual
             early follow-up visit 2-4 weeks after initial fitting (successful defined as: no
             expulsion on movement, squatting or valsalva, no urinary retention, no discomfort, and
             still retained pessary after 2 weeks)

          -  Patients agree to use vaginal estrogen (either tablet or cream twice weekly) during
             the study period; patients may not use a vaginal estrogen ring since this requires
             changing every 3 months, and will interfere with the study follow-up schedule

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Current presence of vaginal bleeding, vaginal abrasions or ulcers, or vaginal
             infection

          -  Significant cognitive impairment

          -  Pessary used for indication other than POP (ie. urinary incontinence)

          -  Use of a pessary that is not a covered ring or Gellhorn (i.e exclude cube, donut,
             etc.)

          -  Contraindications to vaginal estrogen

          -  Unsuccessful pessary fitting (successful defined as: no expulsion on movement,
             squatting or valsalva, no urinary retention, no discomfort, and still retained pessary
             after 2 weeks)
