  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this diagnostic study is to evaluate the efficacy of ARFI imaging (a specific type
      of ultrasound) in assessing the pressure of the portal vein (the major vein passing through
      the liver) and the amount of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease.

      DESIGN The study is designed as a prospective, cross-sectional, diagnostic study in which the
      investigators will evaluate the use of ARFI to diagnose clinically significant portal
      hypertension (CSPH defined as hepatic veous pressure gradient (HVPG)greater than 10 mmHg),
      taking HVPG measurements as gold standard.

      METHODOLOGY

        -  The study will be performed at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System-West Haven and Yale.

        -  Study population will be recruited among patients from the VA/Yale Liver Clinics or
           outside hospitals that are referred to VA/Yale for a transjugular liver biopsy and
           hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement as part of their routine care.
