      This study assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LCZ696 in severe hypertensive
      Japanese patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Summaries for treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and death were
      provided by the following actual treatment regimen (actual treatment patients received) in
      addition to all patients: LCZ696 200mg, 400mg, 400mg+other hypertensive medications.

      Summaries for others than above were provided by the following treatment regimen (determined
      by the maximal treatment patients received) in addition to all patients: LCZ696 200mg, 400mg,
      400mg+other hypertensive medications.

    <description>Sitting BP measurements were performed at screening through the end of study at every visit. Four separate sitting BP measurements were obtained with a full two-minute interval between measurements. The 4 measurements were summed and averaged, and then the baseline BP value was subtracted from the average value to get the change from baseline value.</description>
