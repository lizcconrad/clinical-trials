  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional (psychogenic or somatoform) symptoms are commonly observed in neurology clinics.
      There is no known empirically validated treatment approach to functional symptoms. Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be effective, but there are major obstacles to its provision.
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that adding a CBT-based guided self-help (GSH) as
      compared to treatment as usual (TAU) improves patient outcomes.
