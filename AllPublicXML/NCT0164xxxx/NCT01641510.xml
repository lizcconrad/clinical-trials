      The investigators hypothesize that reduced loading dose of prasugrel followed by reduced
      maintenance dose of prasugrel in acute coronary syndrome patients with CYP2C19 polymorphism
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention might exhibit lower platelet reactivity 24
      hours and 30 days later which is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiplatelet treatment is recommended worldwide for the secondary prevention and clopidogrel
      is an essential drug. But clopidogrel has limited value because of its pharmacodynamic
      interpatient variability and delayed onset time.

      It is well known that patients who carry a common reduced-function CYP2C19 allele have a
      lower level of active metabolite of clopidogrel, diminished platelet inhibition, and
      furthermore, higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events than noncarriers.

      To achieve maximum plateau more rapidly and reduce the rate of high on-treatment platelet
      reactivity, higher loading dose of clopidogrel, up to 600 mg, is recommended. Although,
      however, the higher loading dose of clopidogrel, many patients still remain as non-responder.

      Incidence of patients with clopidogrel resistance, especially CYP2C19*2 and *3, which
      encounter loss function, is higher in Eastern Asian peoples than Western peoples. Some
      studies report incidence rate of clopidogrel resistance in Eastern Asian peoples up to 99%.

      However, the metabolism is not influenced by the presence of CYP2C19 genetic variation and
      prasugrel shows potent platelet inhibition. Although prasugrel exhibit potent platelet
      inhibition, recent reports describe the possible over inhibition of platelet especially in
      the East Asian people.

      The investigators are going to compare the efficacy and safety of loading dose of prasugrel
      30 mg which is lower than conventional loading dose followed by 5 mg/day which is also lower
      than conventional maintenance dose for 30 days and loading dose of clopidogrel 600 mg
      followed by 75 mg/day for 30 days.
