      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Transoral Incisionless
      Fundoplication (TIF) performed with EsophyX as compared to proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
      therapy for the treatment of chronic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) patients with
      refractory symptoms on Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs).

      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of TIF performed with
      EsophyX as compared to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for the treatment of chronic GERD
      patients with medically refractory GERD symptoms other than heartburn.

      Primary hypothesis: TIF will be superior to PPIs in eliminating or significantly improving
      daily bothersome GERD symptoms and/or troublesome regurgitation, if present, at 6-month
      follow-up. Secondary hypotheses: TIF will be superior to PPIs in eliminating or significantly
      improving daily bothersome GERD symptoms and/or troublesome regurgitation, if present, at
      12-, 24-, 36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up. The majority of surgical patients will have
      normalized or 50% improved esophageal acid exposure compared to baseline at 6-month
      follow-up. The majority of surgical patients will be completely off PPIs at 6-, 12-, 24-,
      36-, 48- and 60-month follow-up compared to baseline. The majority of crossover patients will
      be completely off PPIs at 6-, 18-, 30-, 42- and 54-month follow-up compared to baseline. A
      statistically greater proportion of crossover patients treated with TIF will be free of daily
      bothersome symptom(s) or will experience clinically significant improvement at 6-, 18-, 30-,
      42- and 54-month follow-up.
