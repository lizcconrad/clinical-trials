      An Open-label, Single-center, Randomized, 4-way Crossover Study to Assess the Bioequivalence
      of R406 in Healthy Volunteers when 100 and 150mg of Fostamatinib are Administered as the 13%
      Drug-loaded Tablet Versus the 38% Drug-loaded Tablet.

      Treatment sequences will be determined using two 2-2 crossover designs in sequence, 1 for
      treatments A and B, and 1 for treatments C and D. The order of the designs containing AB/BA
      and CD/DC within the overall design, as well as the order of treatments within each design,
      will be randomized. This gives a total of 8 possible treatment sequences as follows: ABCD,
      ABDC, BACD, BADC, CDAB, CDBA, DCAB, DCBA.

             not tubal ligation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder, including GI, hepatic or
             renal disease, or any other condition known to interfere with absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs

          -  Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
             antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody

          -  Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judge by the investigator

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities on 12-lead ECG as judged by the Investigator

          -  Current smokers, or those who have smoked, used nicotine-containing products, or used
             smoking cessation treatments within the previous 1 month prior to enrollment
