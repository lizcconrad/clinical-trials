    <textblock>
      The investigators will attempt to improve the patient experience before colonoscopy. The
      investigators will provide an in-office ipad video series and an electronic web guide to help
      patients learn all the best ways to prepare for colonoscopy. The investigators will then
      follow the patients who receive this eGuide to colonoscopy and observe whether or not they
      enjoyed the additional access to information from their providers, and will monitor whether
      or not they were better prepared for their colonoscopy.

      This study would assess the ability of an e-intervention in patient education and
      instructions during peri-procedure and procedural day visits to improve the experience of
      gastroenterology procedures. This study would seek to show that through this alternative
      educational measure, there would be an increased show rate to colonoscopy appointments, an
      increased preparation quality, and an increase in patient understanding and satisfaction with
      the colonoscopy procedure. The investigators will attempt to track procedure completion rate
      and polyp detection rate for individual providers.

      The e-intervention would be multimodal. In the pre-procedure setting, ipad would be able to
      provide a viewpoint for the video education, a template for the patients (or caregivers) to
      send themselves links to appropriate instructions to remind them of their obligations by
      secure email. This e-intervention would supplement traditional printed and website accessible
      instructions.
