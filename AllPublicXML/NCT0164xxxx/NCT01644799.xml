    <textblock>
      Biologic therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways
      and stop cancer cells from growing. Idelalisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This phase I trial studies the side
      effects and the best dose of lenalidomide when giving together with idelalisib in treating
      patients with recurrent follicular lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and idelalisib twice daily (BID) on
      days 1-28. Treatment with lenalidomide and idelalisib repeats every 28 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary and
      secondary objectives of the study include the following:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when combined with
           idelalisib in patients with recurrent follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of lenalidomide and idelalisib therapy in patients
           with recurrent follicular NHL

        -  To estimate the efficacy (overall response rate [ORR], complete response rate [CRR], and
           progression-free survival [PFS]) of lenalidomide and idelalisib in patients with
           recurrent follicular NHL in a preliminary fashion (using a small extension cohort)

        -  To assess whether the therapeutic effects of the lenalidomide and idelalisib combination
           are sufficiently promising to warrant evaluation in a subsequent (phase II/III)
           randomized trial

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24
      months and then annually. Patients are followed once every year for a maximum of 10 years
      from study entry.

    <description>Lenalidomide:
Lenalidomide will be administered orally on days 1-21 followed by 7 days of rest, every 28 days. A treatment cycle will be considered 28 days in length. In the absence of intolerable toxicity or disease progression, lenalidomide will be given for a total of 12 cycles.
Idelalisib:
Dosing is fixed in all cohorts receiving idelalisib at 150 mg orally (twice daily) for 12 cycles, with the exception of dose modifications for toxicity.</description>
