  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim is to investigate the effects of a 12-week structured aerobic exercise on fasting and
      2 h glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations in sedentary overweight subjects in whom
      impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance was observed for the first time.

      Study type: Interventional

      Study design: Randomized

      Endpoint classification: Changes in fasting and 2 h glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations

      Intervention model: Parallel assignment

      Masking: Open label

      Primary purpose: Prevention and dose response assessment of exercise on glucose and lipid
      metabolism

      Condition: Prediabetes

      Intervention: Supervised exercise - The training sessions of the intervention group are
      carried out indoors 3 times a week for 3 months and supervised by an exercise instructor and
      physician. Each session last for 60 min and include a 5-min warm-up and stretching, a 20-min
      walking at speeds 2-4 km/h depending of the participant's physical condition, a 5-min
      stretching and balance training, a 20-min walking, and a 10-min stretching and balance
      training. After 1.5 months the 5-min stretching and balance training between the two 20-min
      walkings is excluded, and the walking time become 45 min.

      No intervention: control group; couseling at baseline. Participants of the control group are
      advised to continue their usual physical and dietary habits.

      Experimental: 1 -supervised exercise intervention. No intervention: 2 - standard counseling
      at baseline.
