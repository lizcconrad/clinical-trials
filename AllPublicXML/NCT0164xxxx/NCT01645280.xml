      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab and CNTO 1959 in
      reducing the signs and symptoms of disease in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      despite concomitant methotrexate (MTX) therapy and to evaluate the safety of ustekinumab and
      CNTO 1959 in this population.

      This is a randomized (patients assigned to treatment by chance), double-blind (study
      personnel and patients will not know what treatment is being assigned to patients),
      multicenter, placebo-controlled (a placebo is a treatment identical in appearance to the
      study agent, but containing no active ingredient), dose-ranging study. Approximately 250
      patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups. The maximum length of study
      participation is 54 weeks, including a 6-week screening period. The end of the study will be
      the last follow-up visit of the last patient. Study visits and evaluations will occur, and
      patient safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR 20) Response at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR 20 responders are participants with at least 20 percent (%) improvement from Baseline for tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures: 1) patient's assessment of arthritis pain-visual analog scale, 2) patient's global assessment of disease activity-visual analog scale, 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity-visual analog scale, 4) patient's assessment of physical function as measured by health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-Di), 5) C-reactive protein (CRP).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Index Score 28 (DAS28; Using C-reactive Protein [CRP]) Score at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 calculated from the number of swollen joints (SJC) and painful joints (PJC) using the 28 joints count, CRP (mG/L) and patient's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment with transformed scores ranging 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). DAS28 &lt;=3.2 = low disease activity, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR 20) Response at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR 20 responders are participants with at least 20 percent (%) improvement from Baseline for tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures: 1) Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale, 2) Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale, 3) Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale, 4) Patient's Assessment of Physical Function as measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 5) C-reactive Protein (CRP).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI): participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

          -  Has a history of lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphoma, or signs suggestive

             location, or clinically significant splenomegaly

          -  Has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to ustekinumab or CNTO 1959 or
