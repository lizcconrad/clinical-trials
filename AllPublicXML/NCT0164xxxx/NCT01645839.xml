    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the neurological progression free survival with the
      use of an intrathecal chemotherapy with liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte®) in leptomeningeal
      metastasis of breast cancer (versus no intrathecal treatment).

      Patients eligible for the trial and having signed their consent to participate will be
      randomized to arm A or B.

        -  Arm A: Standard systemic treatment without Depocyte®

        -  Arm B: Standard systemic treatment with Depocyte®

      Patients randomized to arm B will receive an intrathecal injection of Depocyte® every 14 ± 2
      days for a total of 5 cycles and then every 28 days until progression. The treatment should
      begin in the days following the randomization (maximum 10 days).

      The nature of the standard systemic treatment (chemotherapy, hormone therapy or targeted
      therapy) will be left to the discretion of the investigator according to the subtype of the
      breast cancer and according to the treatments already received. It will be determined prior
      to randomization. It can be amended at any time upon notice of the patient's referent
      oncologist. A focal radiotherapy on symptomatic sites can also be performed if necessary.

      Patients will have :

        -  a clinical assessment within 3 days prior to the start of the study treatment, every 2
           weeks for 2 months, then once a month until progression, and at the end of the study ;

        -  a paraclinical assessment within 14 days prior to the start of the study treatment,
           every 2 months, and at the end of the study ;

        -  and a biologic assessment within 7 days prior to the start of the study treatment, once
           a month until progression, and at the end of the study.

      They will likewise undergo a lumbar puncture prior to the start of treatment, once a month
      for patients in arm A, every 2 weeks for 2 months, then once a month until progression for
      patients in arm B and finally at the end of the study.

      They will also address questionnaires within 3 days prior to the start of the study
      treatment, every 2 weeks for 2 months, then once a month until progression and at the end of
      the study.
