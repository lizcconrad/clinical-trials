      Aims and Objectives

      The study aims to develop, design and pilot a mHealth intervention to strengthen CF
      components of the ICDS programme. Specific objectives seek to:

      1.1. Exploring caregivers, AWWs and other relevant ICDS personnel's views on the feasibility,
      acceptability and best means of using mobile phones to facilitate the process of delivering
      CF counselling within the ICDS programme.

      1.2. Designing a context-specific, relevant and sustainable mHealth intervention to
      strengthen CF components of the ICDS programme based on existing evidence and views of
      caregivers, AWWs and other relevant ICDS personnel.

      1.3. Pilot testing and refining the mHealth intervention.

      Study design

      It is anticipated that a mHealth intervention might potentially strengthen CF components of
      the ICDS programme. Accordingly, qualitative and quantitative strategies will be used to
      develop, design and pilot a mHealth intervention that endeavours to address the following
      three barriers within the ICDS programme: (i) inadequate feeding practices, (ii) not
      targeting children under 3 years of age, and (iii) poor AWW supervision and unmanageable
      workload.

      Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) will be conducted in the study
      site with AWWs, other relevant ICDS personnel and mothers/caregivers of children aged 9-11
      months to assess the feasibility, acceptability and best means of using mobile phones to
      facilitate the process of delivering CF counselling and improving AWW supervision and
      workload. Any changes in infant diet will be also be assessed using 24-hour dietary recalls.
      This infant age group has been selected since 9-11 month old infants will likely demonstrate
      greater nutritional benefit when compared to older children, and they have more established
      CF intakes than a younger age group (e.g. 6-8 months) that is more likely to be transitioning
      to eating complementary foods.

      Socio-demographic questionnaires will also be administered to AWWs, ICDS personnel and
      mothers/caregivers for descriptive data. Findings will be presented in an intervention design
      workshop to develop the mHealth intervention, which will then be pilot tested and refined.

      Mixed-methods research is recommended for exploring complex interventions. Accordingly,
      quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to address the study objectives. The study
      will use a wide range of respondents to gain a broader understanding of current behaviours,
      identify key influencers and understand the facilitators and barriers to behaviour change
      from different perspectives. Sample size will be determined by saturation sampling, that is,
      continuing investigating until no new information is uncovered.

      Sampling strategy

      AWWs, relevant ICDS personnel and mothers/caregivers of children aged 9-11 months will be
      purposively selected from the study area. Criterion for selection is that the participants
      are involved in nutrition counselling within the ICDS programme. Sampling will be purposive
      as the research team is aiming for inclusiveness, not representativeness. The number of FGDs
      and IDIs will depend on the number required to reach data saturation i.e., repeated and new
      material or themes do not emerge. The characteristics of AWWs and other relevant ICDS
      personnel in the FGDs and IDIs will reflect the diversity and breadth of potential AWWs and
      other relevant ICDS personnel involved in the promotion of nutrition messages. The
      characteristics of mothers/caregivers in the FGDs and IDIs will also reflect the diversity
      and breadth of potential mothers/caregivers receiving nutrition messages.

      Methods

      Objective 1.1: Assessing the feasibility, acceptability and best means of using mobile phones
      for CF counselling

      FGD 1.1.1 and FGD 1.1.2 will take place with a trained facilitator and a person for
      transcription with fluency in local language(s). AWWs, relevant ICDS personnel and
      mothers/caregivers will answer questions on the feasibility, acceptability and best ways of
      using mobile phones to facilitate the process of delivering CF counselling within the ICDS
      programme. Open-ended questions will be asked, and then followed up by specific prompts which
      relate to the research question. FGDs will be recorded with digital recorders.

      QQ 1.1.1, QQ 1.2.2 and QQ 1.2.3 will be translated into local languages as needed.
      Mothers/caregivers will answer an interviewer-administered questionnaire on socio-demographic
      information. Questions about mobile phones will also be asked by trained interviewers with
      fluency in local language(s) to inform Study 2. AWWs and other relevant ICDS personnel will
      answer self-administered questionnaires on mobile phone use, professional experience and
      socio-demographic information.

      Objective 1.2: Designing a mHealth intervention to strengthen CF components of the ICDS
      programme

      Data about potential usage of mobile phones within the ICDS system will be presented at an
      intervention development workshop where stakeholders and relevant experts will review the
      findings of the formative research and make decisions about the mHealth intervention's
      content and structure. Outputs will include:

        -  Behaviour change strategies

        -  mHealth intervention strategy and components, including who should be targeted and how

        -  Conceptual framework of the intervention

      Intervention materials including manuals, protocols and creative briefs will be written as
      needed after the intervention design workshop. Relevant intervention components will also be
      tried out prior to the pilot intervention.

      It should be noted that the outcome of this workshop is entirely evidence-driven; that is, no
      further details can be provided on the potential design of the mHealth intervention until
      data from FGDs with AWWs, other relevant ICDS personnel and mothers/caregivers have been
      collected and analysed.

      Objective 1.3: Pilot testing and refining the mHealth intervention

      The mHealth intervention will be pilot tested and refined with relevant ICDS personnel and
      mothers/caregivers in order to test all operational elements that were selected and developed
      in the intervention design workshop. This pilot study will purposively select participants -
      mothers/caregivers, AWWs and/or other relevant ICDS personnel depending on the intervention
      design - from the study site to pilot test the intervention.

      AWWs will be trained on counselling messages prior to implementing the pilot test with mobile
      phones. The pilot test take place over 6 weeks with approximately 72 purposively selected
      participants. Any changes in infant diet will be measured by administering to
      mothers/caregivers in the pilot study before and after the pilot study. Process evaluation
      tools will also be used to measure context, fidelity to protocol, dose, and facilitators and
      barriers to implementation.

      At the end of the pilot testing period, IDIs will be used with study participants to collect
      data on the following indicators:

        -  Feasibility (including frequency and timing of messages and/or phone calls)

        -  Acceptability

        -  Comprehensibility

        -  Tone of messages

        -  Barriers

        -  Facilitating factors

        -  Modifications

      The number of IDIs will depend on the number required to reach data saturation i.e., repeated
      and new material or themes do not emerge. Participant characteristics in the IDIs will
      reflect the diversity and breadth of study participants recruited to test mobile phones in
      the pilot study.

      QQs will also be used with study participants to collect socio-demographic information.
      Interviewer-administered QQs will be used with mothers/caregivers if they are part of the
      study due to low literacy rates in both the proposed study sites.

      These data will be collected with the aim of describing the successes and challenges of
      implementing a mHealth intervention in this setting, and how it may potentially be used
      within the ICDS programme and other settings to deliver complementary feeding counselling.
      They will be used to further refine the mHealth intervention.

      Detailed protocols including sampling strategies, QQs and forms to collect data will be
      finalised once a context-specific mHealth intervention has been developed in the intervention
      design workshop.

      Data Analysis

      Quantitative data analysis

      Quantitative data collection methods in this study include QQs and 24-hour recalls. All
      quantitative data will be double-entered and data entry errors will be identified using range
      and consistency checks. After the data are cleaned, they will be transferred to STATA 11
      software for analysis. Dietary data will be analysed in a specific diet program that has been
      developed using Microsoft Excel. Categories will be generated for continuous variables as
      needed. Data will be analysed and represented using numerical, graphical and tabular methods.
      In order to estimate any changes in infant diet when FBRs are tested with mothers/caregivers
      (Objective 1.3), paired t-tests will be used to identify differences in means with 95% CIs
      for all dietary outcomes. Differences will be considered significant at P&lt; 0.05. Statistics
      will be used for descriptive purposes, i.e. the study population will be represented as
      proportions, means, etc. and dietary data from the pilot test will be represented in means
      and standard deviations.

      Qualitative data analysis

      The study will rely heavily on FGDs, IDIs and structured observations at various stages for
      insights into how to develop, implement, and evaluate the mHealth intervention. Qualitative
      analysis will be iterative, thus evolve alongside data collection. NVivo 8 software will be
      used to store and code all the FGD and IDI transcripts after they have been translated into
      English. Contents of FGD and IDI transcripts will identify the range of ICDS personnel and
      mothers/caregivers' reactions to FBRs and using mobile phones for nutrition counselling. A
      thematic approach will be used to code FDGs and IDIs, starting with initial free coding with
      an ultimate aim of categorizing themes into categories. In part, these codes will be based on
      predetermined themes emerging from the literature review about nutrition counselling
      interventions and the current state of the ICDS programme in India. This process will not use
      a grounded theory approach, in which coding is entirely inductive.11 However, all qualitative
      data will be coded allowing for emergence of new unanticipated themes which will influence
      the pre-conceptualised framework.

      Triangulation of data is important to establish reliability of data. 12 Accordingly, data
      from all the FGDs and IDIs will be compared and checked against each other for
      inconsistencies and completeness. Doing so will help the student ascertain the most &quot;correct&quot;
      interpretation of data. All conclusions will be presented to key study staff for accuracy to
      further improve reliability.
