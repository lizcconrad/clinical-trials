  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All existing medical literatue regarding axial length (AL) changes after scleral buckling
      surgery for retinal detachment, descibes changes after solid silicone buckling. In this
      hospital, the investigators use only silicone sponge buckling, which has different properties
      and a different buckle profile. there are no studies in the literature describing tha AL
      changes after sponge buckling, or whether the AL change is less or more than with solid
      silicone buckles. The investigators wish to determine whether the AL change profile with
      their silicone sponge is significantly different, and if so, whether this is clinically
      important in determining the better choice of buckle material to be preferred.
