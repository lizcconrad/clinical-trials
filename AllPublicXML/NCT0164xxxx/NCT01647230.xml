  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to observe how the hemodynamic changes induced by spinal blockade
      affect cerebral oxygenation. Elderly patients are very frail. Hypotension is very frequent
      during spinal anaesthesia. Bradycardia is other side effect of regional anaesthesia affecting
      cardiac output and cerebral blood flow. These complications of spinal anaesthesia could
      decline cognitive function. In this way a non invasive monitoring technique as cerebral
      oximetry is useful for the safety of anesthetic procedure.

      Patients aged 70 years old with hip fracture presenting for surgical repair under intrathecal
      anaesthesia performed with bupivacaine or L bupivacaine (dose 7 - 9 mg). Preoperative
      haemoglobin and drugs consumption are registered. All patients receive supplemental oxygen
      during surgery. Cerebral oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen arterial saturation
      are measured. Level and duration of sensory and motor block are registered. The study
      observes if there is any correlation between cerebral oximetry and these hemodynamic
      parameters.

      The investigators also observe if there is any correlation between cerebral oximetry and
      cognitive function evaluated pre and postoperatively by SPMSQ test.

      Postoperative SPMSQ test will be performed on the 5th postoperative day and the complications
      registered.Patients will be followed for the duration of acute hospital stay.
