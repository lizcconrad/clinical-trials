  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol was designed to evaluate the safety, clinical tolerability and immunogenicity
      of the Trivalent Influenza Virus Vaccine (TIVf, purified surface antigen, inactivated, egg
      derived), Northern Hemisphere formulation 2012/2013. The principal aim was to provide safety
      and immunogenicity data, in compliance to current EU Guidelines, with the intent of obtaining
      marketing approval of the vaccine formulation intended for use prior to the next influenza
      season in the Northern Hemisphere.

      The antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen, was measured by hemagglutination
      inhibition (HI) and single radial hemolysis (SRH) at approximately 21 days postimmunization
      in adult and elderly subjects. The safety and immunogenicity of a single intramuscular (IM)
      injection of the vaccine was evaluated in compliance with the requirements of the current EU
      recommendations for clinical trials related to yearly licensing of influenza vaccines
      (CPMP/BWP/214/96).

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in HI Titer Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIVf</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer, against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using HI antigen assay.
As per the European (CHMP) criteria seroconversion or significant increase in titer was defined as the percentage of subjects with a prevaccination HI titer &lt;10 to a postvaccination HI titer ≥40; or in subjects with a prevaccination HI titer ≥10, a ≥4-fold increase in postvaccination HI antibody titer.
This criterion was met according to CHMP guideline if percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI titer is &gt;40% (≥18 years to ≤60 years) or &gt;30% (≥61 years).</description>

    <description>Geometric mean ratio (GMR) of subjects was calculated as the ratio of postvaccination to prevaccination HI geometric mean titers (GMTs), directed against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22).
The CHMP criterion was met if the geometric mean increase (GMR, day 22/day 1) in HI antibody titer was &gt;2.5 (≥18 years to ≤60 years) or &gt;2.0 (≥61 years).</description>

    <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects achieving HI titer ≥40 against each of three vaccine strains at baseline (day 1) and three weeks after TIVf vaccination (day 22).
This criterion was met according to CHMP guideline if percentage of subjects achieving HI titer ≥40 is &gt;70% (≥18 years to ≤60) or &gt;60% (≥61 years).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in HI Titer Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIVf</title>
        <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer, against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using HI antigen assay.
As per the European (CHMP) criteria seroconversion or significant increase in titer was defined as the percentage of subjects with a prevaccination HI titer &lt;10 to a postvaccination HI titer ≥40; or in subjects with a prevaccination HI titer ≥10, a ≥4-fold increase in postvaccination HI antibody titer.
This criterion was met according to CHMP guideline if percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI titer is &gt;40% (≥18 years to ≤60 years) or &gt;30% (≥61 years).</description>
        <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was done on the per-protocol (PP) set, i.e. the subjects who received the vaccine correctly; provided evaluable serum samples at the relevant time points; and had no major protocol violations as defined prior to analysis.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in HI Titer Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIVf</title>
          <description>Immunogenicity was measured as the percentage of subjects who achieved seroconversion or significant increase in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer, against each of three vaccine strains, three weeks after vaccination (day 22), evaluated using HI antigen assay.
As per the European (CHMP) criteria seroconversion or significant increase in titer was defined as the percentage of subjects with a prevaccination HI titer &lt;10 to a postvaccination HI titer ≥40; or in subjects with a prevaccination HI titer ≥10, a ≥4-fold increase in postvaccination HI antibody titer.
This criterion was met according to CHMP guideline if percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI titer is &gt;40% (≥18 years to ≤60 years) or &gt;30% (≥61 years).</description>
          <population>Analysis was done on the per-protocol (PP) set, i.e. the subjects who received the vaccine correctly; provided evaluable serum samples at the relevant time points; and had no major protocol violations as defined prior to analysis.</population>
