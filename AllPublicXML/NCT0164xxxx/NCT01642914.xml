  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linaclotide compared with
      placebo in patients with chronic constipation (CC) and prominent abdominal bloating. This
      study includes an up to 3-week screening period and a 2-3 week pretreatment period. Patients
      who are eligible will be randomized to one of two doses of linaclotide or placebo for 12
      weeks. This 12-week study will assess the effects of linaclotide on bowel movement frequency,
      as well as other abdominal and bowel symptoms of CC.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 12-Week Abdominal Bloating</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal Bloating was measured daily using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) where a value of 0 represents no abdominal bloating and a value of 10 represents very severe abdominal bloating. The abdominal bloating score from Baseline is derived from the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) daily diary data collected in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization (Visit 3, Day 1). The change from baseline in 12-Week Abdominal Bloating score is the difference between the average nonmissing daily patient assessments of abdominal bloating scores during the 14 day Baseline period, and the average of the nonmissing daily patient assessments of abdominal bloating scores reported during the 12 week Treatment Period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 12-Week Abdominal Bloating</title>
        <description>Abdominal Bloating was measured daily using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) where a value of 0 represents no abdominal bloating and a value of 10 represents very severe abdominal bloating. The abdominal bloating score from Baseline is derived from the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) daily diary data collected in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization up to the time of randomization (Visit 3, Day 1). The change from baseline in 12-Week Abdominal Bloating score is the difference between the average nonmissing daily patient assessments of abdominal bloating scores during the 14 day Baseline period, and the average of the nonmissing daily patient assessments of abdominal bloating scores reported during the 12 week Treatment Period.</description>

        <description>A patient’s 12-week CSBM frequency rate from Baseline is derived from the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) daily diary data collected in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization, up to the time of randomization (Visit 3, Day 1). A patient’s 12-week CSBM frequency rate was the CSBM rate (CSBMs/week) calculated over the 12 weeks of the treatment period.
Only the Placebo versus Linaclotide 145 micrograms arm comparison is a secondary measure type for this outcome measure. The additional data for the Linaclotide 290 micrograms arm (a pre-specified additional outcome measure) is presented here for ease of comparison.</description>

        <description>A patient’s Baseline SBM frequency rate is derived from the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) daily diary data collected in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization, up to the time of randomization (Visit 3, Day 1). A patient’s 12-week SBM frequency rate was the SBM rate (SBMs/week) calculated over the 12 weeks of the treatment period.
Only the Placebo versus Linaclotide 145 micrograms arm comparison is a secondary measure type for this outcome measure. The additional data for the Linaclotide 290 micrograms arm (a pre-specified additional outcome measure) is presented here for ease of comparison.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Number of Days With a Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM)</title>
        <description>A patient's baseline number of days with a Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) was calculated as the number of days with at least 1 Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM), derived from the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) daily diary data collected in the Pretreatment Period, specifically the period of time from 14 days before randomization, up to the time of randomization (Visit 3, Day 1). A patient's number of days with a SBM during the Treatment Period was calculated as the number of days with at least 1 Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM), divided by treatment duration (in days), and multiplied by 7.

        <title>Change From Baseline in 12-week Stool Consistency</title>
        <description>Stool consistency was measured using the 7-point Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS):
= separate hard lumps like nuts [difficult to pass]
= sausage shaped but lumpy
= like a sausage but with cracks on surface
= like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
= soft blobs with clear-cut edges [passed easily]
= fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
= watery, no solid pieces [entirely liquid]
A patient’s BSFS score for the baseline period (14 days before randomization, up to the time of randomization) and for the 12-week treatment period, was the average of the nonmissing BSFS scores from the SBMs reported by the patient during the respective baseline and treatment periods.

          <title>Change From Baseline in 12-week Stool Consistency</title>
          <description>Stool consistency was measured using the 7-point Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS):
= separate hard lumps like nuts [difficult to pass]
= sausage shaped but lumpy
= like a sausage but with cracks on surface
= like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
= soft blobs with clear-cut edges [passed easily]
= fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
= watery, no solid pieces [entirely liquid]
A patient’s BSFS score for the baseline period (14 days before randomization, up to the time of randomization) and for the 12-week treatment period, was the average of the nonmissing BSFS scores from the SBMs reported by the patient during the respective baseline and treatment periods.

        <description>A 9/12 Week CSBM 3+1 Responder is a patient who is a CSBM 3+1 Weekly Responder for at least 9 out of the 12 weeks of the Treatment Period. A CSBM 3+1 Weekly Responder is a patient who had a CSBM Weekly Frequency Rate that was 3 or greater and increased by 1 or more from baseline.</description>
