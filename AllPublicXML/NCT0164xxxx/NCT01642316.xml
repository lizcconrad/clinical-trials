  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testing and teaching are completely interrelated in education process; using various kinds of
      tests teachers are able to anticipate about the strong and weak points of learning in
      students, their progress and their accomplishment. The influence a test on teaching and
      learning is commonly referred to as washback. Testing washback is a twisted concept that
      becomes even more complex under a various interpretations of the washback phenomenon on
      teaching and learning. This study aimed to describe washback behaviors of students, in the
      low stakes testing in an ESP environment in two-fold. First, the study investigated the
      effects of different formative tests on Iranian medical students' English reading
      comprehension achievement. Secondly, the study explores the effects of washback on the
      students' attitudes toward English reading comprehension. The pre- and post-tests and one
      questionnaire were used to collect the data from Iranian medical students. Data were analyzed
      by paired t-test, t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test.
