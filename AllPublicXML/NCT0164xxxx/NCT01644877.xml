             consent when applicable

          -  Currently on invasive mechanical ventilation or noninvasive positive pressure
             ventilation (CPAP or bilevel positive airway pressure) or requiring &gt; 2LPM
             supplemental oxygen therapy to maintain O2 saturation &gt; 90% due to hypoxemia

          -  Immunocompromised, as defined by one of the following: Autologous or Allogeneic
             hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT); Lung or lung-heart transplantation;
             Subjects treated with chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies; Subjects treated with
             chemotherapy for solid tumor malignancies

          -  Confirmed parainfluenza at screening by one of the following methods using any sample
             type: Respiratory Virus Panel, Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA),
             Qualitative/quantitative RT-PCR test for parainfluenza virus performed at the local
             laboratory (a confirmatory PCR test will be done at the central lab but is not
             required to start the patient on study).

          -  Confirmed PIV lower tract disease for subjects on mechanical ventilation will be
             defined as PIV detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or biopsy within last 7 days
             of screening

          -  Confirmed PIV lower tract disease for subjects on non-invasive positive pressure
             ventilation or supplemental oxygen will be defined as all of the following within the
             last 7 days of screening: New pulmonary infiltrate on chest imaging and at least one
             PIV sign and/or symptom as defined in section 10.3.6

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential who are capable of conception must be
             post-menopausal (one year or greater without menses), surgically incapable of
             childbearing, or practicing two effective methods of birth control. Acceptable methods
             include abstinence, intrauterine device, spermicide, barrier, male partner surgical
             sterilization and hormonal contraception. A female subject ≥18 years of age and of
             child bearing potential must agree to practice two acceptable methods of birth control
             during the study period. All reproductive female subjects must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test during the screening visit.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use medically accepted form of contraception during the
             study period. Abstinence is an acceptable method of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychiatric or cognitive illness or recreational drug/alcohol use that, in the opinion
             of the principal investigator, would affect patient safety and/or compliance.

          -  Any significant finding in the patient's medical history or physical examination that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would affect patient safety or compliance with the
             dosing schedule.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, subjects with a low chance of survival during the
             first 5 days of treatment.

          -  Subjects treated with oral, aerosolized or intravenous (IV) ribavirin for the
             treatment of PIV. A forty-eight hour (48 hr) wash out period prior to randomization is
             allowed.

          -  Subjects with a history of RSV or MPV

          -  Subjects taking any other investigational drug used to research or treat PIV.

          -  Subjects with a history of allergic reactions to lactose.

          -  Subjects with a history of documented Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia confirmed
             radiographically and by culture from BAL.
