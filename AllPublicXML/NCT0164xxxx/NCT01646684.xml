  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After failure of initial ADT, addition of an anti-androgen is established to treat castration
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Substitution of the first anti-androgen and anti-androgen
      withdrawal results in treatment responses in 25-40% of patients for 4-6 months. A more
      effective second line treatment after failure of first ADT could prolong the time until the
      state of symptomatic HRPC, which is currently treated with docetaxel and accompanied by
      significant side effects. Since the importance of the IGF-signaling in PC is not only
      indicated by preclinical results but also by clinical efficacy of somatostatin analogs,
      further clinical research with the new somatostatin analog pasireotide is warranted.

      This study is designed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pasireotide LAR in
      patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). It also aims for a preliminary
      efficacy evaluation of pasireotide within the dose expansion part at the MTD. Preliminary
      efficacy will be assessed by evaluation of different measures of prostate cancer e.g. changes
      in PSA, disease control rate (RECIST 1.1), symptoms and changes of biomarkers linked to the
      mode of action of pasireotide LAR. The study will also explore characteristics of patients
      who might benefit most from this treatment approach

             treatment.

               1. Dose escalation part only: prior treatment with an anti-androgen and GnRH agonist
                  or antagonist is allowed.

               2. Dose expansion part only: prior concomitant treatment with an anti-androgen and
                  GnRH agonist or GnRH antagonist for ≤6 weeks is allowed (in order to control
                  flare up).

          6. Serum testosterone within castration level (&lt;50 ng/dl or &lt; 1,7 nM)

          7. Disease progression demonstrated by a rising PSA with or without metastases. PSA ≥2
             ng/mL at study entry. Rising PSA is defined as two consecutive rises over a nadir

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Dose expansion part only: Secondary hormonal manipulation of prostate cancer (other
             than GnRH agonist or antagonist) for more than 6 weeks, including concomitant
             anti-androgens.

          2. Prior cytotoxic therapy e.g. with docetaxel, mitoxantrone.

          3. Patients who have received radiotherapy of target lesions. Patients who have received
             local radiotherapy of non-target lesions for local symptom control within the last 4
             weeks must have recovered from any adverse effects of radiotherapy before recording
             baseline symptoms. Lesions treated with locoregional therapies within the last 3
             months before study inclusion do not qualify as target lesions.

        Additional protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.
