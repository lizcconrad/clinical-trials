  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early childhood (up to age 5 yrs) is a period of dramatic change in the cognitive, emotional,
      social, and behavioral domains; children continuously progress by observing and interacting
      with the world around them. In the face of economic instability and nutritional, medical and
      educational deprivation, HIV-affected very young children are the most vulnerable HIV
      subgroup globally because their families are often the most vulnerable, with little margin
      for sustaining a favorable developmental milieu for the child. Through strategic caregiver
      interventions during this sensitive period of child neurodevelopment, our study findings have
      the potential for positively re-directing the developmental trajectories of tens of millions
      of HIV-affected children globally.

      Background. Children up to the age of 5 years affected by HIV are the most vulnerable
      subgroup of HIV populations globally, especially in low-resource areas. This is because of
      the strategic, volatile, and vulnerable nature of this highly sensitive period of child
      development. Mediational intervention for sensitizing caregivers (MISC) has a structured
      training program to enable caregivers to improve their children's cognitive and social
      development during everyday casual interactions in the home. In our preliminary NIMH R34
      findings, Ugandan HIV children of caregivers receiving MISC training biweekly for a year
      showed significantly greater gains on the Mullen Early Learning Scales Composite of g fluid
      intelligence, when compared to children whose caregivers received a standard health/nutrition
      education intervention (treatment as usual or TAU). The MISC caregivers were also
      significantly less depressed, and their child mortality that year was significantly lower.
      Intervention Method. One hundred Ugandan HIV-positive preschool and 200 HIV orphan
      caregiver/child dyads will be enlisted from Kayunga and Pallisa Districts. These dyads will
      be randomly assigned by village clusters to either biweekly MISC or health/nutrition
      education TAU intervention for one year. Child Outcomes are the child development gains on
      the Mullen, the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention, and the Color-Object
      Association Test (COAT) of memory, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning -
      Preschool (BRIEF-P), and the caregiver administered version of the Achenbach CBCL. Caregiver
      Outcomes include an array of emotional wellbeing (EWB) and daily functioning measures
      validated during the initial qualitative study phase. Study Aim 1 will evaluate if MISC
      significantly enhances child outcomes when compared to controls for both HIV-positive and
      orphan children when assessed from baseline to 6, 12, and 18 months. Study Aim 2 will
      evaluate if MISC significantly enhances caregiver EWB and daily functioning outcomes. To
      better understand the mechanisms of MISC-enhanced child development, a Secondary Aim is to
      evaluate the mediating effect of improved caregiver EWB outcomes on corresponding child
      development gains, and the modifying effects of caregiver HIV illness and functioning on
      child outcomes. The Overall Impact comes from establishing the feasibility, acceptability,
      and effectiveness of MISC for HIV orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and their caregivers
      in low resource settings; the sustainability of MISC in low resource settings since it is not
      dependent on published materials or outside resources; the complementary dual impact of
      significant psychotherapeutic benefit for the caregiver, especially mothers struggling with
      HIV disease. MISC will also reduce HIV child mortality because in our initial R34 findings,
      MISC heightened maternal bonding, sensitivity to serious illness, and the prompter seeking of
      medical care. It also can improve treatment adherence. Finally, our evidence-based MISC
      caregiver training interventions can be readily

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Child age 1 through 5 years of age. If more than one child in a household qualifies,
             they will all be included.

          -  HIV-infected or HIV-affected child who is an orphan (loss of one or both biological
             parents to HIV). In either case, child must have been born to a confirmed HIV-positive
             mother.

          -  Principal caregiver of the eligible study child is able and willing to participate in
             a regular treatment program. The minimum agreed to participation requirement is
             biweekly for entire year alternating between home and office, including regular visits
             at 6-month intervals to the study clinic to complete lab and developmental assessments
             for the study child.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child illness or injury-based CNS insults which are likely to overshadow the
             neurocognitive benefits of sensitive-period caregiver interventions.

          -  Medical history of serious birth complications, severe malnutrition, bacterial
             meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral malaria, or other known brain injury or disorder
             requiring hospitalization or continued evidence of seizure or other neurological
             disability.

          -  Current enrollment or plans for enrollment in P1 (1st grade) level of school during
             the first 8 months of the yearlong intervention period. Having the study child in
             school all day precludes necessary caregiver access to child for adequate opportunity
             to implement MISC training with that child. We do not expect this criterion to be
             problematic given that age 6 is generally the age for P1.

          -  Primary caregiver cannot respond to MISC or TAU intervention because of mental illness
             or disability.
