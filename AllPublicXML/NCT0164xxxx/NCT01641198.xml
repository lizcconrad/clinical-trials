  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 1992 and 1996, 58 subjects were enrolled in a randomised, short and long term
      superiority single centre prospective clinical trial. Each subject was randomly assigned to
      receive 5 mandibular endosseous implants of 3 types (B, SW, SC). All subjects were aged
      between 25 and 56 years, were in excellent physical and mental health, non smokers, not
      taking any prescribed medication, not suffering from TMJ or facial pain abnormalities and
      were treated with complete removable dental prostheses of both jaws for at least one year.
      All subjects were skeletal class I intermaxillary relationship and had at least 1 cm of bone
      height between the superior and inferior cortical tables as well as at least 6 mm. of
      buccal-lingual bone width in the anterior mandibular region between the mental foramina. All
      subjects had type 2 and/or type 3 mandibular bone quality in this area and specifically
      requested a fixed complete dental prosthesis over the mandibular implants accompanied by a
      conventional complete removable maxillary prosthesis. Standardized radiographs of the osseous
      healing around the abutment-implant interface were taken at 12 months after prostheses
      insertion and are to be taken presently and in future at 15 years or more after prostheses
      insertion using the same standardized protocol and equipment. The 3 implant types, B, SW and
      SC, are approved and commercially available in North America. They are paralleled, screw
      endosseous and are composed of commercially pure titanium. Two of the implant types are
      almost identical in design except that one of the implant types (SW) has an acid etched
      microtextured surface versus the smooth, machined non acid etched surface of the other (B).
      The third implant type (SC) possess a very similar design to the others but its
      smooth-surfaced collar is narrower and longer than the smooth surfaced collars of the B and
      SW implant types which are identical. The SC implant type also has an acid etched
      microtextured surface identical to that of the SW implant.

    <textblock>
      For each subject, each of the 3 implant types (B, SW, SC) were placed by the same surgeon at
      each of 5 mandibular surgical sites so that each site received a different implant. A
      computer generated randomised protocol known to the surgeon only at implant placement assured
      that each subject received the 3 implant types at 3 different surgical sites at first,
      followed by cyclical insertion of 2 of the 3 implant types at the remaining 2 surgical sites.
      Therefore, as much as possible, an equal number of the 3 implant types was to be randomly
      placed at each of the 5 different mandibular surgical sites. As well, this assured that 29
      subjects would receive 3 implants in the left parasymphyseal area and the remaining 29
      subjects would receive 3 implants in the right parasymphyseal area. In all, 58 subjects, 29
      females received 290 mandibular implants.

      As closely as possible to the 6 month follow up date, as per accepted surgical protocol at
      the time, the implants were exposed. Healing abutments and plastic caps were placed along
      with a non resorbable surgical dressing. Subjects were then treated with a complete fixed
      dental prosthesis over the mandibular implants as well as a complete removable conventional
      dental prosthesis of the maxilla under the responsibility and supervision of a
      prosthodontist.

      Standardized periapical radiographs allowed quantitative measurements of the alveolar bone
      healing on the left and right sides of each abutment-implant junction at 12 months following
      prostheses insertion. Original measurements at 12 months of function were retaken on a sample
      number of subjects and inter evaluator and intra evaluator statistical analyses were
      performed. Results after 12 months of function are to be submitted. Following this, the
      present clinical study is undertaken to measure quantitative alveolar bone healing on the
      left and right sides of each abutment-implant junction at 15 years or more after prostheses
      insertion. Original standardized radiographic techniques and measurement protocols used at
      the 12 month evaluation period are and will be used to re examine as many of the original
      subjects as possible using present day ethical consent protocols.

      Hypothesis: The purpose of this prospective superiority trial is to test the hypothesis that
      an acid etched microtextured implant's surface at 1-3µm has a more favorable influence on
      quantitative osseous healing around functioning implants when compared with smoother machined
      implants of very similar design.

    <description>Standardized periapical radiological equipment and technique protocols at the time had been used to evaluate the amount of bone change on the left and right sides of the abutment implant junction for each jaw implant at 12 months following implant loading with insertion of fixed complete prostheses on the implants. These same radiological techniques and measurement protocols will be used to quantitatively evaluate the bone changes at 15 years or more of implant function. Inter and intra evaluator statistical comparisons will be utilized for the repeat 12 month measurements and intra evaluator statistical comparisons will be utilized for the newly acquired 15 year or more measurements.</description>
