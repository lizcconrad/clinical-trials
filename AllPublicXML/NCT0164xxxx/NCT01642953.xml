      Study preparation

        -  To progress this prospective study, the investigators analyzed the retrospective data of
           426 patients who had been managed with conventional critical pathway after gastric
           cancer surgery during last 1 year.

        -  Through this retrospective analysis, we decided the inclusion criteria which showed
           significantly the lower complication rate and shorter hospital stay.

      Method for Prospective study

        -  Patients who enroll in this prospective study are administered and are supplied a liquid
           diet one day before surgery without bowel preparation.

        -  After gastric cancer surgery, they start sips of water on postoperative first day, and
           they are discharged once they exhibit at least three times soft diet without specific
           complaint and had normal clinical status and physical examination.

      Enrollment of patients

        -  Before the patients are enrolled in this study, they give us informed consents.

        -  A liquid diet is supplied beginning from the morning of the day prior to operation to
           the midnight.

      Operation and postoperative management

        -  All procedures are approached by laparoscopic surgery, and partial gastrectomy with
           lymph node dissection are performed.

        -  The patients who are considered to be difficult to progress early oral feeding in
           surgical field are excluded from the study.

        -  Nasogastric tube is not applied to patients.

        -  Postoperative pain is managed by non-opioid pain killer.

        -  The patients are started on sips of water on the first postoperative day.

        -  If they are tolerable, a liquid diet is started on the second postoperative day, and a
           soft diet on a third postoperative day for them.

        -  We have a plan to discharge the patients on the fourth postoperative day if they exhibit
           at least three times soft diet without specific complaint and had normal clinical status
           and physical examination.

      Evaluation of patients

      - The patients are followed up to 30 days after discharge from hospital, and we check whether
      they are tolerable without any compliant and are readmitted.
