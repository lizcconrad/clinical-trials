  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with multiple innumerable liver metastases will probably never come to
      resection, however, for all others, including patients with numerous multiple metastases or
      large metastases, resection should be considered after limited chemotherapy.

      There is consensus for a backbone chemotherapy consisting of fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin.
      FOLFOX was used in the previous EORTC study and is again recommended.

      The addition of targeted agents to standard chemotherapy in the perioperative strategy for
      mCRC might increase the ORR and R0 resectability, without significant increase in toxicity,
      therefore translating to a better outcome.

      BOS2 (EORTC 40091) was designed to test this hypothesis in patients with a KRAS wold-type
      profile.

      It was decided in parallel to design an open label, randomized, multi-center, 2-arm phase
      II-III study this time aimed at enrolling KRAS mutated patients.
