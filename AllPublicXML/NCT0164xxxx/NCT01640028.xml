      The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between sebum excretion rate and the
      following factors:

        -  Hormone levels (testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate)

        -  Expression of 5-α-reductase type 1 (a protein in sebaceous glands that transforms a
           hormone (testosterone) into another one that strongly stimulates sebum production)

        -  Diet

        -  Sun and ultraviolet light exposure.

        -  Facial washing routine

        -  Sleep patterns (time when you start sleeping and total sleep time)

      This study will analyze the relationship between sebum excretion rate and the various factors
      that may influence it in approximately 40 subjects. It will be conducted in one center
      located in Montreal. All devices are known and have already been used in the past.

    <textblock>
      A total of 40 subjects with a sebum excretion rate of at least 4 will be included. Subjects
      will be seen at Day 0 and Day 7. Casual sebum measurements will be performed at least 2 hours
      after washing the face in the morning with a Sebumeter® following a 30-second application of
      a Sebumeter® Measurement Cartridge to the forehead. Sebum excretion rates will be measured
      with Sebutape® applied to the right and left forehead at each visit. Each Sebutape® will be
      scanned and the area covered by sebum, seen as gray-black dots on the scanned Sebutape®, will
      be measured by an image analysis software. Circulating levels of free testosterone and DHEAS
      will be measured at each visit. A skin biopsy behind an ear will be performed at Day 0 and
      Day 7 to measure gene expression of the 5-α-reductase type 1. On Day 0 and Day 7, subjects
      will be required to take a 24-hour recall questionnaire. On Day 0 and Day 7, subjects will be
      questioned about the time of sleep induction, their total sleep time for the night preceding
      the visit, facial washing routine and the number of hours of direct and indirect UV exposure
      in the past 24 hours. On Day 0 and Day 7, subject's forehead skin temperature will be
      measured.

        Approximately 40 subjects, male or female, aged 18 years or older with a sebum excretion
        rate (SER) of at least 4 at Day 0 on both sides of the forehead as measured with Sebutape,
        will be included in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a sebum excretion rate of at least 4 at Day 0 on both sides of the
             forehead as measured with Sebutape.

          2. Subject is 18 years of age or older at time of consent and is in generally good
             health.

          3. Female subject is willing to use effective contraceptive method for at least 30 days
             before Day 0 and until the end of the study. Effective contraceptive methods are:
