    <textblock>
      Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain.

      The primary aim of this study is to describe the soft tissue and bony structural ultrasound
      (US) findings identified in the lateral hip and iliotibial band (ITB) in patients presenting
      with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) in an outpatient rheumatology clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GTPS, widely known as trochanteric bursitis, encompasses a spectrum of disorders (gluteal
      tendinopathy, tears, bursitis, and ITB syndrome) that are difficult to distinguish by
      clinical exam alone. Better understanding of US imaging characteristics in relation to
      clinical symptoms may be helpful in identifying those patients who would most benefit from
      corticosteroid injections and other non-operative treatment options.

      Point-of-care musculoskeletal US use has been shown to reduce repeated hospital appointments,
      improve accuracy of diagnosis, and provide expedited treatment, thus improving quality of
      care in an outpatient musculoskeletal clinic. US assessment is not routinely included in the
      management of GTPS patients and ideal imaging modalities are not established.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Lateral hip pain thought to be due to GTPS as evidenced by tenderness to palpation of
             the lateral hip over the greater trochanter

          -  Lateral hip pain for at least 1 week

          -  For participants with bilateral GTPS, the most symptomatic hip will be considered the
             study hip
