  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators would like to investigate the emotion regulation
      (ER) strategies children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) demonstrate, and the influence
      parents have on their children's ER. More specifically, the investigators would like to
      examine what are the ER mechanisms that parents use, what mechanisms of self regulation
      children with autism internalize, and how parents support and improve the ER capabilities of
      their child with ASD. These will be studied in a behavioral level, using micro-analysis of
      parent-child interaction, and in a physiological level, using indexes of stress control and
      affiliation. In addition, in order for parental ER support to be effective, it is important
      to consider more innate neuro-developmental difficulties children with ASD demonstrate that
      strongly affect their ability to regulate themselves. These include sensory regulation
      difficulties, temperament, attention disorders and poor executive functioning.

      Hypotheses:

        1. ER strategies used by children with ASD will be more poorly developed and less
           effective, compared to those of children in the control groups.

        2. Difficult temperament and sensory regulation difficulties will hamper ER in children
           with ASD.

        3. ER strategies of parents of children with ASD will be more poorly developed and less
           effective than those of parents in the control groups.

        4. Good parental self-ER and parental attunement to the child will be predictive of
           improved ER in children with ASD, and in parent-child synchrony, both in the behavioral
           and in the physiological levels.
