      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Zataria multiflora Boiss and Sumac on
      the thermic effect of food, activity of sympathetic - parasympathetic system: comparison
      between warm and cold temperament people.

      Human body needs to energy in order to preserve life.There are three forms of energy
      consumption at body, consumption at baseline or resting, consumption at energy expenditure
      for Thermic effect of food and energy is spent in physical activity.Also from the perspective
      of traditional medicine, cold and warm natured people are determined based on certain mental
      and physical protests.

      There are different temperament not only in Traditional Iranian Medicine, but in traditional
      Chinese medicine, Indian, Greek, Arabic, Romanian, and there are European.As various factors
      on the basal metabolism and thermic effect of food , also are several factors such as age,
      sex, physical condition of the environment that have an impact on individual temperament.

      Since the protests seem warm and cool temperament and factors affecting on their basal
      metabolic rate and thermogenesis so that food may explain the relationship between warm and
      cold temperament to mind is the basal metabolism; It seems those are hot temperament, their
      basal metabolic rate is higher BMR than normal and those who are cold temperament, have a
      lower BMR.

      On the other hand seems that thermic effect of food in people who have hot temperament is
      higher than thermic effect of food in people who have cold temperament.

      So that we need to use of two nutrient foods, in this way we consided the multiple criteria
      and then were selected sumac and thyme.

      On the other hand, in order to study possible mechanisms affecting basal metabolism,
      thermogenesis of food, according to previous studies and also matches that there are between
      sympathetic - parasympathetic and thyroid function, with symptoms of cold and warm
      temperament there, checking of activity of these organs seems necessary.

      Because to maintain basal metabolic rate is essential for human life, so that each factor in
      order to better understand these is helpful to human life.And the need for such study makes
      clear;Through this step help toward improving public health
