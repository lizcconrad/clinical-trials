  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      intradermal administration of RXI-109 at small surgical incisions in the abdominal skin that
      will later be removed during an elective abdominoplasty. The effect of RXI-109 versus placebo
      on scarring at these incision sites will be evaluated visually and histologically.
