  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with mobility limitations, especially those who are older and have more
      severe impairments, use a combination of assistive devices and personal assistance to meet
      their needs. Assistive technology (AT), which includes devices such as wheelchairs, walkers,
      bathroom grab bars, and dressing aids, helps facilitate day-to-day activities and social
      participation (basic and instrumental activities of daily living) among these individuals and
      may decrease their dependence on human assistance. Although some research has reported
      beneficial outcomes of AT use, few studies have used controlled experimental designs.
      Furthermore, the results are often difficult to interpret because the AT interventions are
      only vaguely described. Another concern is that many individuals receive help from others,
      but scant attention has been paid to the impact of AT on caregivers. This neglect produces an
      incomplete portrayal of the effect of AT interventions. The proposed study addresses these
      deficiencies by evaluating the effects of a formalized dyadic AT intervention on individuals
      with mobility limitations and on their caregivers. The Assistive Technology Provision,
      Updating and Training (ATPUT)intervention involves a detailed in-home assessment of
      participants' current AT; the negotiation and implementation of a personal AT plan with the
      participants and their caregivers; and the provision of AT devices, non-structural home
      modifications, and device training.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the efficacy of the Assistive Technology Provision, Updating and Training
           intervention for assistance users and for their caregivers.

        2. To explore how the intervention is experienced by these individuals and to help explain
           the study findings.

      General Hypotheses:

      The investigators anticipate this intervention will increase the daily activities and social
      participation of individuals with mobility limitations; decrease the psychological and
      physical demands on caregivers; and reduce the amount of caregiving required.

      Methodologies:

      This research will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The
      quantitative portion will be an experimental, single-blinded study in which the investigators
      randomly assign participants to either the ATPUT or a customary care group.
