  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation
      valganciclovir treatment for up to 54 children (up to 4 years of age) with
      virologically-confirmed congenital CMV infection and hearing loss. Subject participation will
      be over a six-month period and study subjects will be stratified according to age. The
      primary objective is to assess whether a six-week course of oral valganciclovir can stabilize
      the hearing of children with congenital CMV infection who present with hearing loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most frequent known viral cause of mental
      retardation, and is the leading non-genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss in many
      countries including the United States. This is a Phase II international, multi-center,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of 6 weeks of oral valganciclovir treatment or 6
      weeks of placebo for fifty-four male and female infants/toddlers 1 month through 3 years of
      age (up to 4 years of age) with virologically-confirmed congenital CMV infection and hearing
      loss. Patient who are between 1 month and 4 years of age and who have SNHL (Sensorineural
      Hearing Loss) and are eligible for enrollment. The expected study duration is 3.5 years from
      enrollment of first study subject. The primary objective is to assess whether a six week
      course of oral valganciclovir can stabilize the hearing of children with congenital CMV
      infection who present with hearing loss. The secondary objective is to define the following
      responses as a function of systemic exposure to ganciclovir (active metabolite of
      valganciclovir): CMV viral load in blood; CMV viral load in urine; and CMV viral load in
      saliva. Also, to define the safety and tolerability of valganciclovir in enrolled subjects.
      The tertiary objective is to define the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir (metabolite)
      following administration of valganciclovir (prodrug) in enrolled subjects.
