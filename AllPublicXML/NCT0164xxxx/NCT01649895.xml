      Trial Objectives:

      Primary aim is to investigate whether D-Cycloserine gives incremental effects to ICBT in
      terms of reduced OCD symptoms. Secondary aims are to a) replicate previous findings in that
      DCS fastens the effects of CBT, b) correlate the fastened effect to overall treatment
      adherence and c) investigate gene variation and therapeutic factors as predictors of symptom
      severity, symptom type and treatment response.

      Trial Design: Double blinded randomized controlled trial

      Dose/Duration: 5 capsules of 50 mg D-Cycloserine or placebo. 1 pcs per week for 5 weeks. All
      participants also receive Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy for 12 weeks.

      Primary Endpoint: Change from W0-W13 and 3-months follow-up.

      Efficacy Parameters: Y-BOCS clinician rated.

      Safety Parameters: Adverse Events assessed weekly via the internet and also at post-treatment
      and at 3-months follow-up using face-to-face clinician assessments.

      Description of Trial Subjects: Fulfilling diagnostic criteria of OCD not associated with
      hoarding.

      Number of Subjects: 128
