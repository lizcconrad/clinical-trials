    <textblock>
      The study will use a comprehensive behavioral intervention adapted for pregnant women to
      change dietary intake, eating behavior and physical activity. The central hypothesis of this
      study is that the intervention will reduce excess gestational weight gain and achieve
      clinical and metabolic benefits in obese and overweight pregnant women and their infants over
      the first year of life.
