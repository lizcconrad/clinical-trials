  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of CADS by primary care
      providers (PCPs) for their patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) changes the quality of care
      relative to a &quot;usual care&quot; group in terms of objective outcome measures of glycemic control
      (e.g., A1c, mean blood glucose, frequency of hypoglycemic episodes) and in terms of
      subjective ratings by patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CADS software integrates the patient's home blood glucose data with appropriate
      laboratory data (e.g. A1c, liver function, kidney function), demographic data (age, gender),
      current and previous medications, and active/inactive medical diagnoses. The software makes a
      recommendation about what medication changes are appropriate with potential alternates.
      Providers with their patients are block randomized into CADS or &quot;Usual Care&quot; for 1 year.

    <description>The CADS software makes a recommendation about what medication changes are appropriate with potential alternates. CADS providers will either &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;reject&quot; the recommendation by the software.Providers with their patients are block randomized into CADS or &quot;Usual Care&quot; for 1 year. Patients associated with a CADS provider will upload their blood glucose data weekly and perform a 7-point glucose profile once per month. They will report major hypoglycemic events and hospitalizations at the time of their quarterly visit. Those getting &quot;usual care&quot; will be seen quarterly and will do self-monitoring of blood glucose and have A1c tests as determined by the provider but no less than twice a year.</description>
