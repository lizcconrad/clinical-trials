  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate release (IR) formulation of retigabine has been shown to be superior to placebo
      as adjunctive therapy in 3 adequate and well-controlled studies in subjects with
      drug-resistant partial-onset seizures (POS) who had previously failed to respond to two or
      more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and were still having seizures despite current treatment with
      1, 2, or 3 AEDs. However, of 1244 subjects randomly assigned to treatment in these 3 clinical
      studies, only 10 were Asian subjects and only 5 of these Asian subjects were randomly
      assigned to treatment with retigabine. Therefore, this Phase III study is being conducted to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and health outcomes of retigabine, at doses
      of 900 mg/day and 600 mg/day, compared with placebo in adult Asian subjects with
      drug-resistant POS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and health
      outcomes of 2 doses of retigabine immediate release (IR) (GW582892) compared with placebo in
      adult Asian subjects with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures (POS) who are already taking
      1, 2, or 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study will compare retigabine IR at doses of 900 mg/day and 600 mg/day taken
      in equally divided doses three times a day with placebo.

      The study design includes an 8-week Screening/Baseline Phase, a 16-week Treatment Phase
      (4-week Titration Phase and 12-week Maintenance Phase), and a 4-week Transition or
      Taper/Follow-up Phase. Approximately 500 subjects will be screened and enrolled with
      approximately 354 subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1:1
      (retigabine 900 mg/day, retigabine 600 mg/day, or placebo). The total duration of the study
      for each subject will be approximately 28 weeks. At the end of the Maintenance Phase,
      eligible subjects will be given the opportunity to enrol in an open-label extension study.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders, defined as subjects with
      &gt;/=50% reduction in 28 day total POS frequency, from the Baseline Phase to the Maintenance
      Phase, in subjects randomly assigned to retigabine 900 mg/day compared with placebo. The key
      secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders, defined as subjects with &gt;/=50%
      reduction in 28 day total POS frequency, from the Baseline Phase to the Maintenance Phase, in
      subjects randomly assigned to retigabine 600 mg/day compared with placebo.

      The safety and tolerability endpoints are incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs);
      proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation; change from Baseline in vital
      sign measurements and weight; change from Baseline in electrocardiogram parameters; change
      from Baseline in haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters; changes from Baseline in
      American Urological Association Symptom Index and post-void residual bladder ultrasound
      volumes; and summary of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale.

    <description>A responder is defined as a par. with &gt;=50% reduction in the 28 day total partial on-set seizure (POS) frequency from the Baseline Phase (BP) to the MP, randomly assigned to retigabine 900 mg/day compared with placebo. The total 28-day POS rate was defined as: (total number of POS over the evaluable period (MP) / number of days of seizure (sz) data in the evaluable period) *28 days. In the event of one or more innumerable seizures (IS) occurring on a day, these were to be counted as an additional 10 seizures for that day, regardless of the number of occurrences of IS on that day. The number of applicable days in a phase for seizure data is calculated as: the end date of MP minus start date of the MP minus days on which seizures were recorded as &quot;Not done&quot; + 1). Each occurrence of status epilepticus (SE) was counted as 1 seizure (whether partial or not).</description>

             non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is postmenopausal); Premenopausal females with a documented
             (medical report verification) hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy when reproductive status has been confirmed by hormone level assessment;
             Postmenopausal females defined as being amenorrheic for greater than 1 year with an
             appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms).
             However, if indicated, this should be confirmed by estradiol and follicle-stimulating
             hormone levels consistent with menopause (according to local laboratory ranges). Women
             who have not been confirmed as postmenopausal should be advised to use contraception
             as listed in the protocol: b. Of childbearing potential, has a negative serum
             pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine and serum pregnancy test at
             randomisation, and agrees to satisfy one of the requirements listed in the protocol:
             c. Not pregnant or lactating (breastfeeding) or planning to become pregnant during the
             study.

          -  Liver function tests: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) &lt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
             bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 × ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study:

          -  Have generalised epilepsy (such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, juvenile myoclonic
             epilepsy, absence epilepsy, etc.), innumerable seizures within the 12-month period
             prior to study entry where the individual seizures cannot be counted, or nonepileptic
             seizures.

          -  Have had status epilepticus (other than simple partial status epilepticus) within the
             12 months prior to Screening.

          -  Have had previous exposure to retigabine.

          -  Have impaired renal function as judged by a creatinine clearance of &lt;50 mL/min.

          -  Have a history of substance abuse (alcohol or drugs) or substance dependence within 12
             months prior to Screening.

          -  Have taken an investigational drug, or used an investigational device, within the 30
             days prior to Screening or plans to take another investigational drug at any time
             during the study.

          -  Are currently following or planning to follow a ketogenic diet.

          -  Have been treated with felbamate or vigabatrin within the 6 months prior to Screening.
             If a subject has been previously treated with vigabatrin &gt;6 months prior to Screening,
             a visual perimetry test performed within 6 months prior to Screening must show normal
             visual fields or no worsening of recognised visual field abnormalities as compared
             with prior to vigabatrin treatment.

          -  Are using central nervous system (CNS)-active medication (other than concomitant AED
             therapy), unless the subject has been stabilised on such medication for more than 1
             month prior to Screening; or currently taking medications known to lower seizure
             threshold (e.g., antipsychotics) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.

          -  Are using herbal treatments with CNS activity within 1 month prior to Screening.

          -  Are planning surgery during the study to control seizures.

          -  Are suffering from acute or progressive neurological disease, severe psychiatric
             disease, or severe mental abnormalities that are likely to interfere with the
             objectives of the study.

          -  Have a history of urinary retention or risk factors for urinary retention that in the
             investigator's judgment could potentially affect subject safety.

          -  Have any medical condition that, in the investigator's judgment, is considered to be
             clinically significant and could potentially affect subject safety or study outcome,
             including but not limited to: clinically significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic
             conditions; or a condition that affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs.

          -  Have an average corrected QT interval (QTc; either QTcB Bazett's correction or QTcF
             Fridericia's correction) ≥450 msec or ≥480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block
             at the time of Screening.

          -  Have active suicidal plan/intent or have had active suicidal thoughts in the past 6
             months. Have a history of suicide attempt in the last 2 years or more than 1 lifetime
             suicide attempt.

          -  Have a history of malignancy within the past 2 years, with the exception of basal cell
             carcinoma.

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to any components of the study medication.

        Randomisation Criteria:

        Subjects must also meet the following criteria at the end of the Baseline Phase (Visit 3)
        and before randomisation and administration of the first dose of study medication:

          -  Have a documented 28-day total POS frequency rate of ≥4 POS over an 8 week Baseline
             Phase. Note: In subjects with simple partial seizures, although all seizures occurring
             during the Baseline Phase will be collected, only seizures with motor signs will be
             counted toward qualification for meeting the randomisation criteria.

          -  Have not had a seizure-free period of ≥21 consecutive days during the Baseline Phase.

          -  Have not had innumerable seizures (defined as an episode of seizure activity lasting
             &lt;30 minutes during which several seizures occur with such frequency that the
             initiation and termination of each individual seizure cannot be distinguished) during
             the 8 week Baseline Phase.

          -  Have not had an episode of status epilepticus (other than simple partial status
             epilepticus) during the 8 week Baseline Phase

          -  Have not required dose adjustments of concurrent AEDs, addition of new AEDs,
             discontinuation of existing AEDs, changes to VNS settings, or acute use of
             benzodiazepines for the treatment of seizures during the Baseline Phase.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures (POS) who were taking 1, 2, or 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with or without vagus nerve stimulator (VNS); had a 28-day total POS frequency rate &gt;=4 seizures; and did not have a period of &gt;=21 consecutive days without a POS over the 8-week Baseline Phase were enrolled in this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>76 participants (par.) were randomized to study treatment; 75 par. comprised the Intent-to-Treat Population (par. who were randomly assigned to treatment, received &gt;=1 dose/any portion of a dose of study medication, had Baseline [BL] seizure data, and had &gt;=1 post-BL seizure record between the Titration Phase and the end of the Maintenance Phase).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants entered a 16-week Treatment Phase (TrP) consisting of a 4-week Titration Phase (TiP) and a 12-week Maintenance Phase (MP). In the TiP, participants received matching placebo in increasing doses. Participants that could not tolerate the titration or withdrew were discontinued from the study and entered the Taper/Follow-up Phase (TaP/FUP). Participants who tolerated titration entered the MP and continued to receive the same dose regimen for 12 weeks. After completing the MP, participants who opted to enroll in the open-label extension (OLE) study entered the 4-week Transition Phase (TnP). In the TnP, participants received active retigabine in increasing doses starting at 300 milligrams per day (mg/day), 450 mg/day, 600 mg/day, and 750 mg/day, respectively, in each of 4 weeks. Participants that did not enroll in the OLE study completed a 3-week TaP and 1 week of FUP.</description>

          <description>Participants entered a 16-week TrP consisting of a 4-week TiP and a 12-week MP. In the TiP, participants received a starting dose of retigabine (RTG) 300 mg/day that increased by 150 mg/day per week until a target dose of 600 mg/day was reached. Participants that could not tolerate the titration or withdrew were discontinued from the study and entered the TaP/FUP. Participants who tolerated titration entered the MP and continued to receive 600 mg/day for 12 weeks. After completing the MP, participants who opted to enroll in the OLE study entered the 4-week TnP. In the TnP, participants received RTG 600 mg/day for 3 weeks and RTG 750 mg/day in the last week. Participants that did not enroll in the OLE study completed a 3-week TaP and 1 week of FUP.</description>

Participants that could not tolerate the titration or withdrew were discontinued from the study and entered the TaP/FUP. Participants who tolerated titration entered the MP and continued to receive 600 mg/day for 12 weeks. After completing the MP, participants who opted to enroll in the OLE study entered the 4-week TnP. In the TnP, participants received RTG 600 mg/day for 3 weeks and RTG 750 mg/day in the last week. Participants that did not enroll in the OLE study completed a 3-week TaP and 1 week of FUP.</description>

        <description>A responder is defined as a par. with &gt;=50% reduction in the 28 day total partial on-set seizure (POS) frequency from the Baseline Phase (BP) to the MP, randomly assigned to retigabine 900 mg/day compared with placebo. The total 28-day POS rate was defined as: (total number of POS over the evaluable period (MP) / number of days of seizure (sz) data in the evaluable period) *28 days. In the event of one or more innumerable seizures (IS) occurring on a day, these were to be counted as an additional 10 seizures for that day, regardless of the number of occurrences of IS on that day. The number of applicable days in a phase for seizure data is calculated as: the end date of MP minus start date of the MP minus days on which seizures were recorded as “Not done” + 1). Each occurrence of status epilepticus (SE) was counted as 1 seizure (whether partial or not).</description>

        <description>A “responder” is defined as a participant experiencing a &gt;=50% reduction in the 28-day total POS frequency from the BP to the TrP (TiP plus MP). The 28-day total POS frequency was calculated as: (total number of PS over the time period of interest [TrP] / number of applicable days in that period) * 28. In a case of one or more occurrences of IS on a day, these seizures were to be counted as an additional 10 seizures for that day, regardless of whether the IS were PS or not, and regardless of the number of occurrences of IS on that day. The number of applicable days in a phase for seizure data is calculated as: the end date of the TrP minus the start date of the TrP minus days on which seizures were recorded as “Not Done” during the TrP plus 1). Each occurrence of SE was counted as 1 seizure (whether partial status or not).</description>

A participant was considered to be seizure free during the MP if he/she had no record of countable seizures of any type, no IS, and no SE during the MP. Participants who had one or more days on which they recorded seizures as &quot;Not Done&quot; on the seizure calendar were not disqualified from being considered as seizure free for that day. Participants who did not complete the study or experienced any seizures in the MP were not considered to be seizure free. A participant who completed the study AND had no seizures during the maintenance phase were counted to be seizure free. Also, a completer who only had seizures during the TiP is considered seizure free.</description>

In the TiP, participants received a starting dose of RTG 300 mg/day that increased by 150 mg/day per week until a target dose of 900 mg/day was reached. Participants that could not tolerate the titration or withdrew were discontinued from the study and entered the TaP/FUP. Participants who tolerated titration entered the MP and continued to receive 900 mg/day for 12 weeks. After completing the MP, participants who opted to enroll in the OLE study entered the 4-week TnP. In the TnP, participants received RTG 900 mg/day for 4 weeks. Participants that did not enroll in the OLE study completed a 3-week TaP and 1 week of FUP.</description>

          <description>A seizure free-day is defined as a day with non-missing seizure data but without any seizures. A participant was considered to be seizure free during the MP if he/she had no record of countable seizures of any type, no IS, and no SE during the MP. Participants who had one or more days on which they recorded seizures as &quot;Not Done&quot; on the seizure calendar were not disqualified from being considered as seizure free for that day. Participants who did not complete the study or experienced any seizures in the MP were not considered to be seizure free. A participant who completed the study AND had no seizures during the maintenance phase were counted to be seizure free. Also, a completer who only had seizures during the TiP is considered seizure free.</description>

        <description>A participant was considered to have new seizure types during the TrP if they experienced a new seizure types (such as SE, myoclonic, absence, secondary generalization) and had no prior history of these seizure types. At Screening, a history of previous seizure types was collected, with “Yes,” “No,” “IS,” “SE,” or “Unknown” being recorded for each of the seizures types. The history of seizure types was updated during the 8-week BP as pre-treatment status. New types of seizures during the TrP were recorded as A1=simple PS with motor signs; AX=simple PS without motor signs; B=complex PS; C=PS evolving to secondary generalized seizures; D1=absence of seizures; D2=myoclonic seizures; D3=clonic seizures; D4=tonic seizures; D5=tonic-clonic seizures; D6=atonic seizures; E=unclassified seizures; and SE=status epilepticus.</description>

            <description>Participants entered a 16-week TrP consisting of a 4-week TiP and a 12-week MP. In the TiP, participants received a starting dose of RTG 300 mg/day that increased by 150 mg/day per week until a target dose of 900 mg/day was reached. Participants that could not tolerate the titration or withdrew were discontinued from the study and entered the TaP/FUP. Participants who tolerated titration entered the MP and continued to receive 900 mg/day for 12 weeks. After completing the MP, participants who opted to enroll in the OLE study entered the 4-week TnP. In the TnP, participants received RTG 900 mg/day for 4 weeks. Participants that did not enroll in the OLE study completed a 3-week TaP and 1 week of FUP.</description>

          <title>Incidence of New Seizure Types During the TrP in Participants Without a History of the Indicated Seizure Types at Baseline</title>
          <description>A participant was considered to have new seizure types during the TrP if they experienced a new seizure types (such as SE, myoclonic, absence, secondary generalization) and had no prior history of these seizure types. At Screening, a history of previous seizure types was collected, with “Yes,” “No,” “IS,” “SE,” or “Unknown” being recorded for each of the seizures types. The history of seizure types was updated during the 8-week BP as pre-treatment status. New types of seizures during the TrP were recorded as A1=simple PS with motor signs; AX=simple PS without motor signs; B=complex PS; C=PS evolving to secondary generalized seizures; D1=absence of seizures; D2=myoclonic seizures; D3=clonic seizures; D4=tonic seizures; D5=tonic-clonic seizures; D6=atonic seizures; E=unclassified seizures; and SE=status epilepticus.</description>
