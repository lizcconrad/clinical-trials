  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will employ clinical assessment tools to examine the effects of
      modified constraint-induced therapy (mCIT) on the more affected upper extremity of children
      with cerebral palsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included threefold: (1) It will employ kinematic analysis, along with clinical
      assessment tools to examine the effects of mCIT on the more affected upper extremity of
      children with cerebral palsy with asymmetric motor impairments after treatment immediately
      and 1 year following. The clinical tools will include Motor Activity Log (MAL),
      Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP),Peabody-Developmental Motor Scales
      (PDMS-II), and Wee-FIM. (2) This study looked at the intervention impact on bimanual
      coordination and the less affected upper extremity. (3) It investigated the effects of forms
      (group vs. individual intervention) on upper extremity performance.

    <description>An analysis program coded by LabVIEW (National Instruments, Inc., Austin, TX) language was used to process the kinematic data. The variables of reaction time (sec), normalized movement time (sec/mm), normalized total displacement (unit), joint ranges recruitment (normalized shoulder flexion angle, normalized elbow flexion; degree/mm) angle, and normalized maximum shoulder abduction angle), and maximum shoulder and elbow cross correlation were collected.</description>
