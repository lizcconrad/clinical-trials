  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is a rare esophageal motility disorder, which is characterized clinically by
      symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation, weight loss and chest pain. These symptoms are
      primarily caused by incomplete relaxation of a frequently hypertensive lower esophageal
      sphincter (LES) and to some extent by a lack of peristalsis in the tubular esophagus.
      Unfortunately, no therapy returns normal esophageal function. Treatment is therefore directed
      at lowering the LES pressure, with the aim of reducing the functional obstruction to bolus
      transit at this site. Current treatments can be endoscopic or surgical. Peroral endoscopic
      myotomy (POEM) has recently been described as a new minimally invasive endoscopic myotomy
      technique intending a permanent cure from primary achalasia in some centers. The
      investigators purpose was to further evaluate the efficacy and the feasibility of POEM for
      patients with achalasia in a prospective larger study.

      1. Patients were eligible for enrollment in the study if they had an Eckardt symptom score
           ≥ 4. The diagnosis of achalasia was made on the basis of the absence of peristalsis and
           on impaired relaxation of the LES on established methods (barium swallow, manometry,
           esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)). Exclusion criteria were severe cardiopulmonary
           disease or other serious disease leading to unacceptable surgical risk, pseudoachalasia,
           and megaesophagus (diameter of &gt; 7 cm).

        2. All patients were scheduled for a follow-up visit at 1 month after POEM for EGD and
           manometry. Symptoms were assessed 1 month after treatment in the clinic and every 3
           months thereafter via telephone questionnaires.

        3. The primary outcome of the study was therapeutic success (a reduction in the Eckardt
           score to ≤3) at the follow-up assessment. The secondary outcomes included
           procedure-related adverse events, LES pressure on manometry pre- and post POEM, reflux
           symptoms and medication use before and after POEM, and procedure-related parameters such
           as procedure time, hospital stay, and myotomy length.
