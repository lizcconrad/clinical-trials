  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to investigate another way of evaluating margin status after
      pancreatectomy by using cytopathology (slide interpretation) as compared to the traditional
      method of surgical pathology
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare margin status on final pathology with margin status from cytopathologic
      evaluation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cytopathologic sample collection during pancreatic resection during which
      slides are gently pressed against the cut edge of the pancreas, the surgical bed, and along
      the superior mesenteric artery, and finally against the tumor itself.
