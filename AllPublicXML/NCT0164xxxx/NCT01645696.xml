    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy and performance of a new
      subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor (BD-CGM, Becton Dickinson) in hyperglycemic (high
      blood sugar) and hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) &quot;clamp&quot; conditions and during meal excursions
      over the course of 72 hours as compared to a commercially available monitor.

      This is a single site, non-randomized study. The study consists of a Screening Visit (Visit
      1) during which the subject will be consented and the inclusion exclusion criteria confirmed.
      An interventional visit (Visit 2)which consists of a 72 hour in-clinic stay and a Follow-up
      Visit (Visit 3). Subjects eligible for the study will be admitted to the clinic for the Study
      Visit 2 in the afternoon on the day before the first Clamp is performed. An IV line for blood
      sampling will be established. One blood sample will be obtained for glucose determination and
      a second blood sample will be collected for immunoassay development before any sensors are
      inserted. Two BD-Glucose Binding Protein-Continuous Glucose Monitor Sensors(BD-GBP-CGM), with
      and without outer layer, and one commercial CGM sensor will be inserted in the subcutaneous
      tissue in the abdomen shortly thereafter. Blood sampling intervals will be adjusted over the
      3 study days as determined by the study event (i.e. clamp period, meal excursion, nighttime).
      During the hyper- /hypo-glycemic clamps periods on Day 1 and Day 3 blood samples will be
      taken more frequently, every 5-10 minutes. During the breakfast meal on Day 2 sampling will
      occur at 10-15 minute intervals for 4 hours to capture the meal excursion. Sampling will be
      less frequent during the evening meal and at night during sleep hours.
