      The purpose of this study is to find the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of two
      drugs. The two drugs are Sorafenib and Capecitabine. The drug Sorafenib is an approved drug
      which is used to treat certain cancers. The drug Capecitabine is approved to treat patients
      with advanced breast cancer as well as early stage colon cancer.

      This is a pilot study of Sorafenib combined with Capecitabine in patients with histologically
      confirmed unresectable or metastatic breast and GI tumors. One cycle will consist of 4 weeks
      of treatment. The dose of Sorafenib will be 600 mg administered orally daily in divided
      doses. Capecitabine will be given at a fixed dose of 2000 mg orally BID x 7 days every 14
      days
