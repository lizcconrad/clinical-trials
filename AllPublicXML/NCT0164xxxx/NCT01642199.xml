    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether reduced intensity behavioral weight
      loss treatment (rBWL) + Peer Health Coaches yields significantly greater weight loss than
      rBWL + Mentor Health Coaches and rBWL alone.

Mean scores on this measure will be reported.</description>
