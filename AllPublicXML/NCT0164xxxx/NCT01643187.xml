      The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of a fortified food on the nutritional and
      micronutrient status of malnourished children, compared with milk. The changes to be
      evaluated include the indicators weight for height, height for age, weight for age, mid-arm
      circumferance for age; and levels of hemoglobin, serum zinc, serum ferritin, serum folic
      acid, erythrocyte folic acid, serum vitamin B12, and urinary iodine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic malnutrition evidenced by short height for age is a common nutritional problem in
      underdeveloped countries which is generally accompanied by iron deficiency anemia and zinc
      deficiency. It has many consequences on the adult including limited capacity to work and
      higher risk of obesity and chronic disease. The present study will offer a fortified food,
      culturally accepted and locally produced. The effectiveness of this fortified food compared
      to lactose-free milk, in a controlled dose and with no risk to the health of the study
      participants, will be determined. Both will be distributed for free to be consumed as an
      atole or in liquid form, respectively, at a community level in an environment controlled as
      much as possible. This will allow to determine adherence, acceptability, consumption and
      distribution within the family.
