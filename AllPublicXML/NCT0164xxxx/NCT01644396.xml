  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of adalimumab
      in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis after 24 weeks of treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the treatment period, participants will receive an initial adalimumab 80 milligram
      (mg) subcutaneous (sc) dose, followed by adalimumab 40 mg sc every other week starting one
      week after initial dose. Safety and effectiveness assessments will be completed at Baseline,
      Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and Week 24. Participants may discontinue adalimumab
      treatment at any time during study participation. Participants that end study participation
      early will have a Premature Discontinuation visit. All participants who do not initiate
      commercial Humira® will have a follow-up phone call 70 days after the last administration of
      study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing Adverse Events (AEs). The 70-day
      follow-up phone call will not be required for any participant that initiates adalimumab
      therapy not supplied in the context of the clinical trial after the end of study
      participation.

    <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Post-baseline value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>NAPSI grades nails for both nail matrix psoriasis and nail bed psoriasis. The most affected fingernail was determined at Baseline and used for the analysis.
Nail matrix psoriasis consists of any of the following: pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, or nail plate crumbling. Nail bed psoriasis is the presence or absence of onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop (salman patch) discoloration or nail bed hyperkeratosis. Scoring for each is based on the following scale:
0 = none;
1 = present in 1/4 nail quadrants;
2 = present in 2/4 nail quadrants;
3 = present in 3/4 nail quadrants;
4 = present in 4/4 nail quadrants.
The sum of these two scores is the total score for the nail, and ranges from 0 (no nail psoriasis) to 8 (psoriasis in 4/4 nail quadrants). Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value, calculated as: Week 24 value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment.
The investigator rated the severity of each AE as either:
Mild: The AE is transient and easily tolerated; Moderate: The AE causes the participant discomfort and interrupts usual activities.
Severe: The AE causes considerable interference with usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life-threatening, results in or prolongs hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, spontaneous or elective abortion, or requires intervention to prevent a serious outcome.
Drug-related AEs are those assessed by the investigator as either probably or possibly related.
Other malignancy excludes lymphoma, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), leukemia, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and melanoma.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with a ≥ 75% reduction (improvement) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from Baseline. PASI is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from no symptoms (0), slight (1), moderate (2), marked (3) or very marked (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Physician’s Global Assessment of Clear</title>
        <description>The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the qualified investigator's evaluation of the participant. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0: No evidence of scaling, erythema, or plaque elevation, overall score of cleared;
1: Occasional fine scale over &lt;5% of lesions, faint erythema, minimal plaque elevation, overall score of minimal;
2: Fine scale dominates, light red coloration, mild plaque elevation, overall score of mild;
3: Course scale dominates, moderate red coloration, moderate plaque elevation, overall score of moderate;
4: Thick non-tenacious scale dominates, bright red coloration, marked plaque elevation, overall score of marked;
5: Very thick tenacious scale predominates, dusky to deep red coloration, severe plaque elevation, overall score of severe.
The percentage of participants achieving a PGA score of clear (0) is reported.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Physician’s Global Assessment of Clear</title>
          <description>The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the qualified investigator's evaluation of the participant. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0: No evidence of scaling, erythema, or plaque elevation, overall score of cleared;
1: Occasional fine scale over &lt;5% of lesions, faint erythema, minimal plaque elevation, overall score of minimal;
2: Fine scale dominates, light red coloration, mild plaque elevation, overall score of mild;
3: Course scale dominates, moderate red coloration, moderate plaque elevation, overall score of moderate;
4: Thick non-tenacious scale dominates, bright red coloration, marked plaque elevation, overall score of marked;
5: Very thick tenacious scale predominates, dusky to deep red coloration, severe plaque elevation, overall score of severe.
The percentage of participants achieving a PGA score of clear (0) is reported.</description>

PASI is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from no symptoms (0), slight (1), moderate (2), marked (3) or very marked (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with a ≥ 75% reduction (improvement) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from Baseline. PASI is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from no symptoms (0), slight (1), moderate (2), marked (3) or very marked (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Score</title>
        <description>PASI is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from no symptoms (0), slight (1), moderate (2), marked (3) or very marked (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.
Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Post-baseline value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Post-baseline value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</title>
        <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Post-baseline value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)</title>
        <description>NAPSI grades nails for both nail matrix psoriasis and nail bed psoriasis. The most affected fingernail was determined at Baseline and used for the analysis.
Nail matrix psoriasis consists of any of the following: pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, or nail plate crumbling. Nail bed psoriasis is the presence or absence of onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop (salman patch) discoloration or nail bed hyperkeratosis. Scoring for each is based on the following scale:
0 = none;
1 = present in 1/4 nail quadrants;
2 = present in 2/4 nail quadrants;
3 = present in 3/4 nail quadrants;
4 = present in 4/4 nail quadrants.
The sum of these two scores is the total score for the nail, and ranges from 0 (no nail psoriasis) to 8 (psoriasis in 4/4 nail quadrants). Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value, calculated as: Week 24 value - Baseline value / Baseline value * 100. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment.
The investigator rated the severity of each AE as either:
Mild: The AE is transient and easily tolerated; Moderate: The AE causes the participant discomfort and interrupts usual activities.
Severe: The AE causes considerable interference with usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life-threatening, results in or prolongs hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, spontaneous or elective abortion, or requires intervention to prevent a serious outcome.
Drug-related AEs are those assessed by the investigator as either probably or possibly related.
Other malignancy excludes lymphoma, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), leukemia, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and melanoma.</description>
