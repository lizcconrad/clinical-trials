  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if immunization with a chimeric E. coli protein,
      dsc14CfaE-sCT2/LTB5, is safe and immunogenic when administered by vaccination under the skin.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of dsc14cfaEsCTA2/LTB5
      (Chimera) and dscCfaE administered with and without LTR192G by intradermal (ID) immunization
      and to gather additional data on the administration of dsCfaE and LTR192G via transcutaneous
      immunization (TCI) route. If vaccines are found to be safe and adequately immunogenic in
      humans, a down-selection would occur and a phase 2b vaccination/challenge study would be
      undertaken to further evaluate vaccine safety and allow a preliminary assessment of efficacy
      of one of these candidates by the ID or TCI route. With favorable evidence for safety,
      immunogenicity, efficacy, complemented by advances in standard methodology to combine
      multiple adhesins with an appropriate LT enterotoxoid form, a multivalent vaccine would be
      constructed and evaluated for further clinical development.

          -  History of microbiologically confirmed ETEC or cholera infection.

          -  Travel to countries where ETEC or V. cholera or other enteric infections are endemic
             (most of the developing world) within two years prior to dosing clinician judgment).

          -  Received previous experimental ETEC or V. cholera vaccine or live ETEC or V. cholera
             challenge.
