  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial to
      determine the MTD (Maximal Tolerated Dose) of Pazopanib in a population of frail elderly
      patients, selected according to the International Society of Geriatric Oncology
      (SIOG)classification (Group 2).

      It is expected that a total number of 30 patients maximum will be enrolled in the study on 30
      months : 18 months accrual - 12 months follow up.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled into a standard 3+3 design with a starting dose of
      Pazopanib administered orally at 400 mg per day, in 28-day cycles. Then, further dose levels
      will be explored.

      Toxicity of the schedule will be assessed during the first cycle. Patients will receive study
      medication until disease progression. After treatment discontinuation, patients will be
      followed during one year.
