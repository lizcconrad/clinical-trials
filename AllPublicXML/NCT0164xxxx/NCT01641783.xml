  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer remains one of the major causes of cancer deaths around the world,especially
      in Asia. For advanced gastric cancer,even if treated with chemotherapy,the prognosis is still
      poor, so the investigators urgently need an effective strategy to treat advanced gastric
      cancer, however, there was no recommended First-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric
      cancer. Taxane is promising in gastric cancer. Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound (Nab) Paclitaxel
      (Abraxane，ABI-007) with high effectiveness and low toxicity had been approved in breast
      cancer as first-line chemotherapy in many countries. The investigator then initiated a
      prospective phase II clinical trial with Nab-Paclitaxel plus Capecitabine as the first-line
      treatment in advanced gastric cancer to observe the efficacy and safety.

      A single arm,open,phase II study of Nab-Paclitaxel plus Capecitabine as the first-line
      treatment in advanced gastric cancer.

      Nab-Paclitaxel should be given intravenously on days 1 and 8 at a dose as follows. Treatment
      should be repeated every 3 weeks:Nab-Paclitaxel:125 mg/m2; Capecitabine should be given
      orally twice a day as follows for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 1-week rest. Treatment
      should be repeated every 3 weeks. Capecitabine:1000mg/m2,twice daily (bid).

      If applicable,the value of response and prognosis predictive factors are expected to be
      identified.
