  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock of intra-abdominal origin is likely due to Gram-negative bacteria or mixed
      pathogens and associated with high levels of endotoxin. The injury to the endothelium results
      in an increase of endothelial permeability, interstitial edema and release of nitric oxide
      (NO) that is a very potent vasodilatator. [6] Polymyxins obtained from the Gram-positive
      bacterium Bacillus polymyxa are antibiotics known for their ability to bind LPS in the outer
      membrane of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall as well as free endotoxins with high
      affinity. Polymyxin-B has been shown to block the activation of cells by a wide variety of
      LPS. Studies converged to show an improvement in the treatment of septic shock by removing
      circulating endotoxin.Starting Polymyxin-B hemoperfusion during the operative time is to
      block the initiation of various deleterious biological cascades induced by endotoxemia such
      as systemic inflammation, disseminated coagulation disorders, and shock, leading to organ
      dysfunction and death.

    <description>In the HEMOPERFUSION group, a veno-venous dialysis catheter type GamCath 12 F, 3 lumen will be inserted instead of a regular double or triple-lumen central venous catheter, and connected to the Toraymyxin® (PMX-20-R) device for endotoxin adsorption by hemoperfusion with the DECAPSMART pump. The length of the hemoperfusion will be a minimum of 120 min and started just before the beginning of the surgical intervention in the OR and stopped at the end of surgery.</description>

    <description>In the CONTROL group, the administration of fluids (250 to 500ml crystalloids) and cardiovascular supportive drugs will be guided to maintain standard pressure-related parameters within a normal range: MAP &gt; 65mmHg, HR &lt; 90/min, CVP between &gt; 8 and 12 &lt; mmHg, urinary output &gt; 0.5 ml/kg/h. In line with the conventional approach, other physiological parameters will also be targeted: T° &gt; 35.5°C, Sp02 &gt; 95%, lactate &lt; 2.5 mMol/L, normalisation of the BE.
At the discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist with the FMH level, a PiCCO monitoring, a transoesophageal echography, or a pulmonary artery catheter, will be inserted to complement the standard hemodynamic monitoring if deemed necessary.</description>
