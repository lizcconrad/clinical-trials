  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fluoropyrimidines 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and capecitabine (Cp) are among the most commonly
      used anticancer drugs. Still, there is much controversy about the correct dosing, and the
      fact that a minority of patients experience severe, sometimes even lethal toxicity following
      treatment. One important factor predisposing patients to severe toxicity is deficiency in the
      5FU-catabolic enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Our group identified 4 DPD risk
      alleles in over 300 Swiss cancer patients, that resulted in a 8-times increased risk of
      experiencing severe toxicity from 5FU or Cp. In patients receiving 5FU as a continuous
      infusion, there are accumulating data that keeping the AUC of 5FU between 20-30 mg*h/L is
      beneficial in terms of treatment toxicity and activity. In this study, patients carrying at
      least 1/4 DPD risk alleles will receive a 50% dose reduction of either 5FU or Cp, with the
      potential of later dose increases in the abscence of severe toxicity. Additionally, patients
      receiving i.v. 5FU will undergo therapeutic drug monitoring at the end of the 2-day
      continuous infusion, with subsequent dose adaptations to target a 5FU AUC of 20-30 mg*h/L.
      The primary study objective is to reduce the incidence of severe treatment-related toxicity
      from 13% (in historical controls) to 5% in study patients.

    <description>Multiplex amplification of each sample is performed in an individual well of a 24-well plate using a Mastercycler platform. Template and Platinum Taq Polymerase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) are added to an analyte-specific amplification mix (AutoGenomics Inc., Carlsbad, California). After amplification, the plate is transferred into the Infinity analyzer (AutoGenomics Inc.), followed by primer extension and hybridization of detection primers to individual oligonucleotides arrayed on the Bio-FilmChip. After hybridization, the BioFilmChips are washed and scanned in the Infiniti optics module. The Autogenomics DPYD assay is used to detect the presence of the four risk alleles (IVS14+G&gt;A, c.1679T&gt;G, HapB3/c.1129-5923C&gt;G and c.2846A&gt;T).</description>

    <description>Repeated PK plasma sampling is done in all patients receiving 5FU. Blood is taken from venipuncture into one 5 ml heparin tube and into one 3 ml EDTA tube for the analysis of 5FU steady-state plasma concentrations in every (2-weekly) treatment cycle. Special attention has to be paid not to take PK blood from the site of drug infusion. For 5FU, PK sampling is done two hours before the calculated end of the 5FU pump on day 3 of every treatment cycle. The quantitative 5FU exposure expressed as the area-under-the concentration-time curve in mg•h/L is calculated from the measured steady-state plasma concentrations of 5FU and the duration of 5FU infusion. In all patients, 5FU doses for the second and subsequent administrations are adjusted to target a 5FU AUC between 20 and 30 mg•h/L</description>
