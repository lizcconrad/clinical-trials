      Recently, US investigators have observed that HIV-infected (HIV+) children on highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have a much greater cumulative incidence of asthma.Regulatory
      T cells may mitigate the pathogenicity of asthma through the suppression of Th2 responses.
      Since asthma is predominantly a TH2 mediated condition, we propose that new onset of asthma
      after HAART in HIV- infected children may be secondary to dysregulated immune reconstitution.
      The restoration of CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity in HIV+ patients treated with HAART may lead
      to airway inflammation, narrowing, hyperresponsiveness, and possibly remodeling.

      The increased incidence of asthma in HIV-infected children treated with HAART is likely
      secondary to multiple factors that may include hypersensitivity to certain aeroallergens,
      dysregulation of effector and regulatory T cell response, as well as the imbalance of TH1 vs.
      TH2 cytokines. Therefore this study will identify the immunopathogenesis of increased airway
      hyperresponsiveness in HIV-positive patients.
