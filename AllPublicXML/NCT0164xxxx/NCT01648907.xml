      This large national multicenter, longitudinal, prospective follow-up of patients presenting
      with early inflammatory back pain in order to set up a database to facilitate several
      investigations on diagnosis, prognosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis and medico-economics in
      the field of early inflammatory back pain and spondyloarthritis.

      The Patients were recruited if they had inflammatory back pain of more than 3months and less
      than 3years. Patients will be followed every 6months during the first 2years then every year
      during at least 5years. Apart from information collected on a Case Report Form (demographics,
      disease activity, severity, co-morbidities, socio-economics, treatments, radiological and MRI
      evaluation of the spine and the pelvis according to the local investigators, and for some
      centers bone densitometry and ultrasonography of entheses), the digital X-rays and MRI of the
      spine and pelvis are stored using a specific software (Carestream) and the biological samples
      (DNA, RNA, sera, urines) are centralized at the Biological Resources Center (Bichat
      Hospital).

      This large cohort should facilitate the conduct of researches in different areas (clinical,
      medico-economics, translational) in order to improve our knowledge on the pathogenesis and
      natural history of axial spondyloarthritis

    <description>Radiological examinations:
Standard x-ray: they include an x-ray of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine (side-on), of the lumbar spine from the front and an x-ray of the pelvis from the front
MRI scan: are taken of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints.
Bone densitometry: evaluation of bone densitometry of the lumbar spine and femoral neck.
Enthesis ultrasound: bilateral evaluation of entheseal insertions for the Achilles tendon, patella tendons and epicondyle tendons.
Biological tests :
Genetic test : DNA will be collected at the first visit from all centers. RNA will be collected at the inclusion visit in AP-HP centres only.
Serum will be collected by all centres at the initial visit, then in M6, M12 and M24 for the first two years of the study, then in M60.
Urine will be collected by all centres at the initial visit, then in M24 for the first two years of the study, then in M60.</description>
