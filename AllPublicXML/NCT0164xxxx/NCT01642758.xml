  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta thalassemia intermedia syndromes are genetic anemias caused by mutations which reduce
      production of beta globin, a major component of adult hemoglobin A, the protein which
      delivers oxygen throughout the body. Patients suffer from poor growth, fatigue, heart
      failure, endocrine deficiencies, and eventually, many require chronic blood transfusions.
      There is no approved therapeutic for the deficiency of beta globin chains in beta
      thalassemia.

      This trial will study an oral therapeutic which stimulates production of fetal globin, an
      alternate type which is produced by all humans, but is normally switched off in infancy. This
      type of globin can compensate for the missing protein in beta thalassemia.

    <textblock>
      This is a trial of an experimental oral medicine which stimulates production of fetal
      hemoglobin, an innate type of hemoglobin which is normally made but is suppressed in infancy.
      Fetal globin (HbF) can perform the function of the missing beta globin and reduce anemia in
      beta thalassemia, when it is produced in higher amounts than normal.

      In this trial, 10 patients with beta thalassemia intermedia in Lebanon will all receive the
      study drug for 6 months at a dose which has been previously shown to be safe in normal
      volunteers and in beta thalassemia and sickle cell patients and to stimulate fetal globin
      production in many, when given for brief periods. The purpose of this trial is the following:

        1. To determine if total hemoglobin levels increase above baseline in some subjects when
           the study drug is taken for 26 weeks.

        2. To determine if fetal globin is increased above baseline levels in a proportion of
           subjects when the study drug is taken for 26 weeks.

        3. To determine the number of adverse events which occur with 26 weeks of administration of
           the study drug in beta thalassemia intermedia subjects.

      After a screening period, the subjects will take the study drug at home once a day. They will
      be seen once every 4 weeks for examinations and laboratory tests during the dosing period and
      for 4 weeks afterwards.

      This trial will provide an important step in evaluating a potential treatment for patients
      with beta thalassemia intermedia, that can be used around the world, if it is effective and
      safe.

    <description>Levels of HbF will be averaged from a screening visit and day 1 of the study, prior to any drug treatment. HbF levels will then be measured every 4 weeks during treatment and for 4 weeks after the treatment, and compared to each subject's baseline value. The number of subjects in which an increase in HbF develops above individuals' average baseline value will be obtained.</description>
