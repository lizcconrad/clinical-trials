  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of plasticity-based, adaptive
      cognitive remediation on the cognitive abilities, functional status and quality of life of
      soldiers and veterans diagnosed with persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) following a
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, also referred to as a concussion, or blast exposure), as
      compared to a computer-based control.

      This study is a multi-site, prospective, parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of plasticity-based, adaptive, computerized
      cognitive remediation treatment versus a computer-based control. Both the study and the
      cognitive remediation treatments meet the criteria of Non-Significant Risk.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be 18 - 50 years of age at the time of consent

          2. Subjects must have a diagnosis of mTBI

          3. Subjects must have persistent cognitive dysfunction confirmed by an objective measure
             (as recommended by the ICD-10 definition for post-concussion syndrome) or a subjective
             measure (as recommended by the DSV-IV definition of post-concussional disorder).

          4. Subjects must be at least three months out from their most recent TBI, concussion,
             and/or blast exposure to minimize the effects of spontaneous recovery, as verified
             through participant interview.

          5. Subjects must be fluent English speakers.

          6. Subjects must have adequate sensorimotor capacity to perform the program in the
             judgment of the consenting clinician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must not have a history of penetrating head wounds or a diagnosis of moderate
             or severe TBI.

          2. Subjects must not be in-patients.

          3. Subjects must not have a diagnosis of an illness or condition with known cognitive
             consequences (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, cancer, multiple sclerosis).

          4. Subjects must not show suicidal ideation as measured by the Columbia-Suicide Severity
             Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

          5. Subjects must now show signs of intoxication due to current substance abuse (including
             alcohol and/or illegal drugs) during any in person visit.

          6. Subjects must not have clinically significant visual field deficits noted by the
             consenting staff member by direct observation or by medical history.

          7. Subjects must not be judged to be lacking effort.

          8. Subjects must not have problems performing assessments or comprehending or following
             spoken instructions.

          9. Subjects must not be enrolled in a concurrent clinical trial involving an
             investigational pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, medical device, or behavioral treatment
             for TBI that could affect the outcome of this study.
