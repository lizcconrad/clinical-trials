    <textblock>
      Zynex's blood volume monitor (BVM) is a non-invasive monitoring device to monitor blood
      volume and blood loss of a patient during surgery, post operatively and/or in recovery. This
      monitoring device will identify baseline blood volume and relative changes in blood volume
      using a specific algorithm to compare and review data already monitored during surgery,
      displaying blood volume and blood loss in real-time.
