    <description>This is a noninterventional, observational, retrospective study to collect data on pediatric patients with MoCD who have received E. coli derived cPMP by intravenous only administration. The study will neither provide treatment with cPMP nor alter any ongoing treatment schedules; rather, its objective is to retrospectively collect data on MoCD history and previous treatment with intravenous E. coli derived cPMP, which is documented in the medical records of patients who have received treatment according to a named patient treatment plan.</description>

             medical record. In the case of a deceased patient for whom the parents or legal
             guardians could not be located, the appropriate ethical review committee may assign
