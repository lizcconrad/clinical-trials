    <textblock>
      This project will investigate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an intensive
      and focused working memory training program for patients in the early stages of PD receiving
      dopaminergic therapy. The investigators hypothesize that working memory training will be an
      effective method of improving working memory and related cognitive and behavioural functions
      in PD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is not an exclusively motor disease; more than half of individuals
      with PD experience cognitive impairment even in the early stages of the disease and many
      develop dementia as the disease progresses. As a result, attention, memory, planning and
      organizational skills can be affected, interfering with everyday functioning (e.g. shopping,
      managing finances, job skills). Thus, interventions to improve cognitive abilities are needed
      to enhance psychosocial function and overall quality of life.

      Some cognitive deficits, such as problems with working memory, are apparent even in the early
      stages of the disease. Working memory (WM) is the ability to actively maintain and manipulate
      information in one's mind and is needed for many complex tasks such as learning,
      communication and problem-solving . Individuals with PD often show deficits in both WM
      maintenance (e.g., holding a phone number in mind to make a call) and manipulation
      (e.g.,mental calculation at the grocery store checkout) skills, depending upon the stage of
      the disease and progression of damage to frontal-subcortical circuits. Attempts to identify
      pharmacological agents that ameliorate cognitive dysfunction have been largely unsuccessful
      or associated with undesirable side effects (e.g. Vale, 2009).

      The investigators propose that specific cognitive training to improve WM could provide direct
      benefit to psychosocial function of PD patients; it could potentially enhance any positive
      benefits or reduce the negative effects of pharmacological treatment without an added risk of
      side effects as well. Promising interventions focused on intensive and direct WM training are
      emerging and have been shown to generalize to other cognitive domains, such as fluid
      intelligence.

      Cognitive training has been successful in patients with traumatic brain injury, who also show
      WM deficits as a result of damage to frontal-subcortical circuits. In addition, successful WM
      training is associated with changes in dopamine receptor density as well as changes in
      patterns of neural activity in task-relevant areas of the brain. To date, a limited number of
      small group studies provide preliminary evidence that some aspects of cognitive function can
      be enhanced by training in PD patients also receiving dopaminergic therapy, although few use
      control groups to account for potential repeated testing practice effects.

    <description>Working memory will be measured using the operation span task, the symmetry span task and the Sternberg memory scanning tasks.
Operation span - This is a dual-task in which participants complete mathematical reasoning (e.g. solving a mathematical equation) while using short-term verbal memory to remember words.
Symmetry span: This is a dual task in which participants discriminate about the symmetry of visual stimuli while using short-term spatial memory to remember the locations of stimuli.

    <description>The early training group will consist of 10 randomly assigned participants who will begin the adaptive working memory training task immediately after baseline assessment. They will continue training on the adaptive working memory training task for 5 weeks, after which they will continue for 5 weeks using a non-adaptive working memory task (active control task).</description>

    <description>The late training group will consist of 10 randomly assigned participants who will engage in a non-adaptive working memory training task (i.e. an active control task) immediately after baseline assessment for 5 weeks. After the initial 5 weeks of the active control task they will then switch to the adaptive working memory task (the intervention) for 5 weeks. This is a randomized controlled cross-over design.</description>

    <description>The no training group will engage in no training over the course of the pilot study, but will still participate in baseline, 5 week, 10 . This will allow us to determine if changes in the outcome and assessment variables are due to the working memory training or progression in the disease itself.</description>
