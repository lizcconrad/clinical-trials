    <textblock>
      Malfunction of mechanical heart valves due to clot formation is a potentially devastating
      complication. It often results in heart failure, death or stroke. This condition occurs
      frequently in patients with mechanical valves in developing countries because they are unable
      to monitor and adjust the dose of blood thinning medications. The best treatment modality for
      the treatment of patients with this condition is not known. There is no reliable data from
      clinical trials to guide treatment and there are no firm guidelines. Treatment with
      clot-busting drugs is most commonly used because these drugs (e.g., streptokinase) are
      readily available, cheap, and easy to use. However, this treatment is associated with high
      rates of treatment-related side-effects (death, life-threatening bleeding and stroke).
      Moreover, some recent studies suggest that clot-busting drugs may not be as efficacious in
      restoring valve function, as previously believed. Emergency surgery is less often used
      because it is more expensive and the required facilities and manpower are not available at
      all times at all places. But there is evidence to suggest that surgery results in better
      success rates with a lower risk of bleeding and stroke. Well-designed prospective randomised
      trials (the &quot;gold-standard&quot; for reliable evidence) comparing the efficacy, safety and
      cost-effectiveness of the two modalities, are needed to help doctors in developing countries
      make informed decisions when treating patients with clotted mechanical heart valves. The
      investigators propose to perform a randomised controlled trial comparing emergency surgery
      with treatment with clot-busting agents in patients with clotted mechanical valves. The study
      will be conducted over 4 years at a single, university hospital in a developing country. This
      study will determine how often patients who are treated with surgery will be discharged from
      hospital, with completely restored valve function, without having suffered a stroke or
      life-threatening bleeding, when compared to those who received clot-busting drugs. The
      investigators will also find out which of the treatments is safe and cost-effective.

      Left-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) is a potentially devastating complication which
      can affect patients with mechanical heart valves. It occurs frequently in developing
      countries because of poor anticoagulation quality. The best modality for treating this
      condition is not known. Most of the available data is from retrospective studies and case
      series, and current guidelines are based largely on expert opinion. Therefore recommendations
      for treatment vary widely. Fibrinolytic therapy (FT) is the most commonly used treatment
      because fibrinolytic agents such as streptokinase are readily available, cheap, and easy to
      use. However, FT is associated with high rates of treatment-related adverse effects (death,
      major bleeding and stroke). Moreover, recent studies suggest that FT may not be as
      efficacious in restoring valve function, as previously believed. Emergency surgery is less
      often used because it is more expensive and the required facilities and manpower are not
      available at all times at all places. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available
      literature that the investigators performed, suggests that surgery may result in better
      success rates with a lower risk of major bleeding, stroke and non-CNS systemic embolism.
      Evidence from well designed randomised controlled trials is needed to determine the optimal
      treatment of left-sided PVT. The investigators propose to do a single-centre, open-label,
      randomised controlled trial comparing emergency surgery with FT for the treatment of
      symptomatic patients with left-sided PVT. The primary outcome is the occurrence of a complete
      clinical response, defined as discharge from hospital with completely restored valve
      function, in the absence of stroke, major bleeding or non-CNS systemic embolism. The
      investigators will compare the safety of the two interventions and quality of life at
      discharge and at 1 year. The investigators will also assess the cost-effectiveness of surgery
      compared to FT from a societal perspective in the context of the Indian healthcare system
