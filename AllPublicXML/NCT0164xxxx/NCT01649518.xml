  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is the most common affection of joints worldwide. Multiple international
      guidelines on the approach and treatment of knee osteoarthritis are available. Nevertheless
      there seems to be a gap between usual care and the preferred one.

      A vigorous set of evidence-based quality indicators on osteoarthritis diagnosis and therapy
      was developed by a multidisciplinary expert team. This project aims to map usual care and to
      explore the gaps between usual care and international guidelines in a second stage. This will
      enable us to develop a tightly targeted quality improvement intervention later on.

        General Practice: Based on the electronic patient files of general practiotioners of the
        MEDIDOC users-group (an electronic software package) a list will be generated of patients
        diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. A random sample of these patients will be addressed to
        take part into the study by a questionnaire.

        Orthopedic Surgery: Patients, consulting orthopedic surgeons for knee osteoarthritis will
        receive a patient questionnaire.

        Physiotherapy: Patients, recruited by general practitioners and orthopedic surgeons will be
        asked about the care they received by their physiotherapist. Moreover physiotherapists will
        be recruited by the national association of physiotherapists to complete a questionnaire
        about the care they usually deliver.
