    <textblock>
      Dislocation of the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder is a common orthopedic clinical
      problem. The majority of the dislocations are anterior (about 95%) while the rest are
      posterior and inferior. After reduction of the initial dislocation, the treatment's goal is
      to prevent recurrent dislocations. In spite of treatment, the recurrence rate is 80-90% in
      the population aged 18-29. There is an age-related decrease in the recurrence rate, with the
      only 2-3% for ages 60-70. It has been calculated that 1 in 200 soldiers in the Israeli Army
      between the ages of 17 and 33 suffers from recurrent shoulder dislocations [1].

      The traditional treatment for primary (first-time) shoulder anterior dislocation has been
      immobilization of the shoulder in internal rotation in a soft dressing called universal
      shoulder immobilizer (USI) for 3-6 weeks. However, there is a lack of evidence-based
      information to demonstrate the effectiveness of this treatment. Posterior dislocations are
      immobilized in external rotation. Work presented previously in the Orthopaedic Research
      Society and more recently at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons suggests that
      immobilization of the shoulder after reduction of anterior dislocation is best in external
      rotation and not in internal rotation. MRI studies have shown that the labral tear, which is
      the hallmark of most traumatic anterior dislocations, is best reduced to its anatomical
      position when the shoulder is immobilized in external and not in internal rotation.
      Preliminary data indicates that immobilization in external rotation of the primary traumatic
      shoulder dislocations may lower the incidence of reoccurrence.

      The traditional shoulder immobilizer is a generic bandage produced by several companies. In
      the current study, the investigators will use a USI distributed by Uriel® company (Uriel
      #87), which can be modified to hold the shoulder in external rotation.
