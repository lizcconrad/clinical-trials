  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, balanced, 3 way crossover study (3 periods)
      in healthy adult subjects. During each period, subjects will receive a single dose of
      GSK1265744 oral formulation in the fasted state and serial PK sampling for up to 168 hours (8
      days) and safety assessments will be performed. Each period will be separated by a washout
      period of at least 14 days and a follow-up visit will occur 10 to 14 days after the last dose
      of study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin =&lt; 1.5x upper limit
             of normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality or laboratory
             parameter outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included
             only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is
             unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential

             salpingo-oophorectomy or hysterectomy; postmenopausal defined in the protocol; or
             child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in
             the protocol.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first
             dose of study medication until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg) for men and &gt;= 45 kg for women and body mass index
             (BMI) within the range 18.5 to 31.0 kg/ (meters squared) m^2 (inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new investigational chemical entities within 12 months
             prior to the first dosing day.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including
             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140 millimeters of
             mercury (mmHg), or diastolic blood pressure is outside the range of 45 to 90 mmHg.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease.
