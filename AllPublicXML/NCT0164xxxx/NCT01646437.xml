      The randomized 2x2x2 factorial design placebo controlled trial will enroll 5000 participants
      (women 60 years or older and men 55 years or older) without known heart disease or prior
      stroke and without a clear indication or contraindication to any of the study medications.
      Eligible and consenting individuals will be randomized to receive either the active study
      medications or placebo (dummy pills) and will be monitored for an average of 5 years. The
      study will include people from at 10 countries, will be conducted by an international group
      of scientists and physicians and will be coordinated by the Population Health Research
      Institute at Hamilton Health Sciences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancers and osteoporosis collectively make up the largest
      disease burden globally. CVD is the major cause of death and disability and affects about
      half of the population over their lifetimes. Cancers are a leading cause of death and it
      accounts for 13.0% of all deaths. The commonest forms include lung, breast, prostate,
      colorectum, stomach and liver cancer. It is estimated that over 200 hundred million people
      worldwide are living with osteoporosis. This is the underlying pathologic predisposition to
      fractures of the hip, vertebral body, and distal forearm. CVD, cancers and osteoporotic
      fractures increase with age and so their burden is expected to substantially increase over
      the next few decades. Simple, safe and effective preventive strategies which can reduce the
      incidence and prevalence of these 3 diseases are therefore urgently needed

      It is suggested that this polypill could be given to all individuals with a CVD event as well
      as to anyone over 55 years (primary prevention) without the need for any measurement of risk
      factors. The polypill contains 3 blood pressure lowing medications and a statin in a single
      tablet. This includes hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg), atenolol (100 mg), ramipril (10 mg) and
      simvastatin (40 mg). In addition, to the polypill (Polycap), participants will be randomized
      to receive aspirin (75mg) and vitamin D (60,000 IU monthly). This factorial design on 3
      distinct treatment arms which could reduce CVD, fractures and cancers could have large
      implications for the prevention of several of the important chronic diseases in middle and
      old age, using safe and inexpensive medications/supplements.
