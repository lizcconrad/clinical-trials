      Hypothesis : Vitamin D serum concentration is decreased in the first trimester in pregnant
      women who will develop preeclampsia in the second or third trimester compare to a control
      group Primary purpose : To determine the vitamin D status in the first trimester in a large
      population of french pregnant women in order to evaluate the importance of the vitamin D
      deficiency in France and correlate this deficiency with preeclampsia

      Primary purpose : To compare the vitamin D (25OHD) status, in the first trimester, in a group
      of patients with preeclampsia and a group of pregnant women without preeclampsia.

      Secondary purpose : (i)To compare the vitamin D status in the third trimester in a group of
      patients with preeclampsia and a group of pregnant women without preeclampsia. (ii) To
      evaluate the deficit un vitamin D in a population of pregnant women in the parisian area.
      (iii) To evaluate the calcemia of the newborns after maternal systematic oral intake of
      vitamin D 100000U at 28 weeks Methodology : Multicenter (6 centers), Cohort, Nested
      case-control study Protocol : 4500 patients will be recruited. A blood sample will be
      performed : in the first trimester (11-14 weeks), in the third trimester (28-40 weeks), and
      cord blood. For each patient with preeclampsia, 4 controls will be taken from the cohort and
      matched by parity, race/ethnicity, maternal age, season, BMI. The serum concentration of
      25OHD will be measured in all samples.A dosage of 25OHD will be performed in 1000 women from
      the initial cohort in order to calculate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.
