      The primary objectives of the study are:

        1. To compare the proportion of patients who achieve a successful response to treatment
           (reduction in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) of &gt;15%) between patients treated with laser
           surgery (including argon laser trabeculectomy, and selective laser trabeculoplasty) with
           patients receiving additional medications, at 1-year post-treatment initiation.

        2. To compare the proportion of patients who achieve a successful response to treatment
           (reduction in IOP of &gt;15%) between patients treated with other procedures (including
           incisional surgery, drainage device procedures, and other glaucoma procedures) with
           patients receiving additional medications, at 1-year-post-treatment initiation.

      The study is a prospective, observational cohort study and will not provide or recommend any
      treatment. Patients who have failed initial medical therapy with two glaucoma medications
      will be identified and enrolled at the time of scheduling of a laser surgery procedure or
      other procedure such as incisional surgery or drainage device, or initiation of an additional
      course of therapy with medication as determined by their physician. This inception cohort of
      new initiators of laser surgical treatment, other procedures, or additional medical therapy
      will be followed for 12 months. All decisions regarding treatment are solely at the
      discretion of the physician in accordance with their usual practice. Enrollment is expected
      to begin in February 2011 and continue through 12 months of follow-up after enrollment
      targets have been reached.

        In the United States, the prevalence of open-angle glaucoma for all adults 40 years old and
        older is estimated to be 1.86%. Open-angle glaucoma affects an estimated 2.22 million
        people, and that will rise to 3.3 million in 2020 as the population ages in the United
        States. Worldwide, it is estimated that 66.8 million people have glaucoma. Glaucoma of all
        types is one of the leading causes of legal blindness in the country.
