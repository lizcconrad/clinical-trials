    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Mitochondria are the parts of cells that help produce energy. Metabolism is the process
           by which the body uses energy to help cells grow and reproduce. Metabolic and
           mitochondrial disorders affect the body s ability to produce and store energy. These
           disorders can cause a wide variety of problems, but most often they affect the muscles
           and the brain, where energy requirements are high. Treatment is difficult because the
           exact source of the problem is hard to detect.

        -  EPI-743 is a new drug that is based on vitamin E. Tests have shown that it can help
           improve the function of cells with mitochondrial problems. It may be able to treat
           people with genetic disorders that affect metabolism and mitochondria.

      Objectives:

      - To see if EPI-743 can improve energy production and use in people with mitochondrial or
      metabolic disorders.

      Eligibility:

      - Children between 2 and 11 years of age who have metabolic or mitochondrial problems.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  The study will last about 13 months. Participants will have seven 3- to 5-day inpatient
           study visits about 3 months apart.

        -  Participants will take either EPI-743 or a placebo for the first 6 months of the study.
           After 6 months, there will be a 1-month rest period. Then, those who received EPI-743 in
           the first 6 months will take the placebo for the next 6 months. Those who had the
           placebo will take EPI-743.

        -  During each inpatient study visit, participants will have a physical exam. A 24-hour
           urine collection will be obtained. Blood samples will also be taken. Imaging studies and
           other tests may be performed as directed by the study researchers.

      The clinical manifestations of disorders of energy metabolism and defects in
      oxidation/reduction are similar because the basic defect involves the inability to transfer
      electrons. The same is true for many mitochondrial diseases. Affected patients exhibit a wide
      variety of signs and symptoms, but the most frequent and earliest dysfunctions occur in the
      muscle and brain, where energy requirements are high. The diagnosis of this type of defect is
      problematic because of the nonspecific and protean clinical manifestations of these
      disorders. Treatment is equally challenging, since the exact locus of the primary defect
      generally remains enigmatic. As a consequence, physicians rely upon generic cocktails of
      vitamin co-factors or endogenous intermediates intended to enhance mitochondrial electron
      transport, diminish the damage of reactive oxygen species, and promote energy production. The
      field is such a morass that, in general, it calls for trial-and-error treatment based upon
      empiric data. Edison Pharmaceuticals, Inc, has developed an in vitro assay that utilizes
      patient fibroblasts to model the innate susceptibility to oxidative stress caused by the
      disorders of energy metabolism and oxidation/reduction. The assay system also determines if
      the cells respond with increased viability to an IND drug called EPI-743. We propose a
      clinical trial that enrolls 20 children who meet three criteria. First, they must have a
      disorder that, based upon studies performed in a clinical protocol such as 76-HG-0238
      (&quot;Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Other Genetic
      Disorders&quot;), is consistent with a defect in energy metabolism or oxidation/reduction. Second,
      their cultured fibroblasts must exhibit a defect in the ability to withstand oxidant stress.
      Third, their fibroblasts must respond to EPI-743 in vitro by showing improved viability under
      conditions of oxidative stress. This protocol is a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
      study with 6-month periods of treatment and a two-month washout period. Patients are admitted
      to the NIH Clinical Center for 2-5 days every 3 months. The primary outcome measure is
      quality of life based upon the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) for
      ages 2-11 years; parts I-III are evaluated separately from part IV. Secondary outcome
      measures are tailored to each patient s laboratory, imaging, and clinical abnormalities.
      Results while receiving EPI-743 will be compared to results while receiving placebo; both
      repeated measures analyses and Student s t test will be employed. To date, 20 patients have
      been enrolled, 19 have completed the two blinded arms of the study, one has died, and 5
      patients have withdrawn. This study now includes an extension arm, through which all patients
      are offered open label EPI-743 after completing the crossover trial. Eight patients are
      currently enrolled in this Extension arm.
