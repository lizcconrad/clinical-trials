      Translating a Heart Disease Lifestyle Intervention in the Community study will evaluate the
      feasibility and initial effectiveness of a community-based, culturally-targeted, lifestyle
      intervention to improve the cardiovascular health of underserved South Asian (Indian,
      Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Nepali, and Sri Lankan) Americans. Participants in this study will be
      randomly assigned to either a group to receive heart disease prevention classes or to another
      group where they will receive written materials about heart disease prevention.
