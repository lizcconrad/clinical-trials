      The aim of the study is to investigate the quality of prehospital emergency care in acute
      respiratory emergencies, when paramedics are supported telemedically by an EMS physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six ambulances from five different Emergency Medical Service (EMS) districts are equipped
      with a portable telemedicine system. In cases of acute obstructive, respiratory emergencies
      the paramedics can use this system to contact a so called &quot;tele-EMS physician&quot; after consent
      of the patient was obtained. The tele-EMS physician has an audio-connection to the EMS team
      and receives vital parameters (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure) in
      real-time. The transmission of still pictures (taken with a smartphone), 12-lead-ECGs and
      video streaming from the inside of the ambulance can also be carried out, if indicated. The
      tele-EMS physician supports the EMS team in obtaining all relevant medical history, diagnosis
      and can delegate the application of medications. This can be carried out to bridge the time
      to the arrival of an EMS physician or in less severe cases without an EMS physician on-scene.
      The quality of prehospital care and the possible influences on the initial inhospital phase
      should be investigated and compared with regular EMS.
