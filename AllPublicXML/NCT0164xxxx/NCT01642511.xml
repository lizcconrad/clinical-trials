    <textblock>
      In addition to the axillary lymph node, the internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) chain is also
      the first-echelon nodal drainage site for metastasis and provides important prognostic
      information in breast cancer patients. The internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy
      (IM-SLNB) provides a less invasive method of assessing the IMLN than surgical dissection. But
      the low visualization rate of IMSLN has been a restriction of IM-SLNB. This clinical trial is
      carried out to improve the visualization rate of IMSLN with modified techniques: (1) The
      radiotracer is injected intraparenchymally into 2~4 quadrants of breast. (2) The radiotracer
      is injected in a high volume. (3) The radiotracer should be injected under ultrasonographic
      guidance.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the visualization rate of internal mammary sentinel lymph node in breast cancer
           patients with different injection technologies.

        -  Evaluate the metastasis rate of internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes in patients with
           clinically axillary node -negative in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the risk factors for internal mammary sentinel lymph node metastasis

        -  Evaluate the success rate and the safety of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy.

        -  Draw the learning curve of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy.

      OUTLINE:

      3~18 hours before surgery, 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid was injected under ultrasonographic
      guidance in different patterns and injection methods were classified according to the number
      of injection quadrants. Subsequently, lymphoscintigraphy was performed 0.5~1.0 hour before
      surgery. During surgery, the sentinel lymph nodes (axillary or internal mammary) were
      identified by combining the use of intraoperative gamma detector and blue dye. The sentinel
      lymph nodes (axillary or internal mammary) were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and
      immunohistochemistry for future therapy planning.

    <description>conventional technique: 99mTc-labeled Sulfur Colloid was injected into the tumor quadrant 3-24 hours before surgery, lymphoscintigraphy was performed 30min before surgery. Four milliliters of methylthioninium was injected subcutaneously above the primary tumor or around the biopsy cavity 10 min before surgery. Axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy and Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed during surgery. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed if ASLN was positive.</description>
