  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single dose evaluation using an open label dose escalating design. Cohort1
      will consist of 3 healthy male volunteers. Each volunteer will receive a slow IV infusion
      over 6 hours consisting of saline for 30 minutes (run in period), 8 mcg/h GW328267X for 1.5
      hours (total dose of 12mcg) and 10 mcg/h GW328267X for 4 hours (total dose of 40 mcg).
      Subjects will have continuous cardiac monitoring throughout the dosing period and up to 2
      hours after cessation of the intravenous infusion. PK measurements and measurement of
      erythropoietin and platelet activation will also be done. Samples for PK will be taken at 30
      minute intervals during the infusion of GW328267X up to and including 1 hour after cessation
      of the intravenous infusion. Samples for erythropoietin and platelet aggregation will be
      done.

      Cohort 2 is optional and may be carried out in the event that the dose of GW328267X given in
      Cohort 1 is both well tolerated and subjects do not meet the stopping criteria. The decision
      to proceed to Cohort 2 and the dose level will be made by the GSK Study Team and the
      Investigator based on safety, tolerability and preliminary PK/PD data obtained in Cohort 1.
      It is planned that the maximum total dose given to any subject will not exceed 150mcg. Cohort
      2 will consist of 3 healthy male volunteers and the study procedures for this additional
      Cohort will be the same as that described for Cohort 1.

          -  Have history of any pre-existing cardiac arrhythmias (including sinus tachycardia,
             atrial fibrillation or flutter) or finding on baseline examination that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may place the subject at an unacceptable risk as a
             participant in this trial or may interfere with interpretation of cardiovascular
             safety results during the conduct of the trial.

          -  Current or history of asthma (with the exception of a history of asthma in childhood
             only).

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or a history of regular use of tobacco
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an
             average weekly intake of greater than 21 units. One unit is equivalent to 8 g of

             medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
