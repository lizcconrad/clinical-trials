  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Correct positioning of the endotracheal tube (ETT) is crucial to ensure safe ventilation. To
      date, no test that can verify this right after intubation at the bedside exists. Indirect
      tests have false negative and positive results leading to complications or at least
      difficulties in performing effective ventilation of patients.

      Bedside ultrasound could fill this need. Although bedside ultrasound may not be possible or
      useful in routine intubations, it may prove useful in difficult or questionable cases, where
      current clinical exams/techniques may not offer a reliable indication of endotracheal tube
      depth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is able to visualize some parts of the trachea and the ETT therein and although
      the actual structures of interest (ETT tip and carina) are difficult or impossible to
      visualize reliably (due to their air contents reflecting ultrasound beams) one can use
      surrogates:

      The cuff of the ETT can be visualized as it is in- or deflated or it can be filled with an
      air-fluid(saline) mixture to delineate it inside the trachea.

      For the same reason (air reflecting ultrasound beams) the carina is difficult to visualize
      and one can use the aortic arch which is positioned just anterior to it instead.

      This study apart from determining feasibility of the method may produce enough data from
      ultrasound exams to develop/derive a more pre-cise algorithm than available today aiding in
      positioning the endotracheal tube in regards to anatomic-al landmarks (teeth, gums, lips)
      even without the use of ultrasound.
