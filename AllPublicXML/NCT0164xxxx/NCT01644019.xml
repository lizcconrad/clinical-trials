      The aim of the study is to investigate the quality of prehospital emergency care in acute
      stroke, when paramedics are supported telemedically by an EMS physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six ambulances from five different Emergency Medical Service (EMS) districts are equipped
      with a portable telemedicine system. In cases of suspected acute stroke (including
      intracranial hemorrhage), the paramedics can use this system to contact a so called &quot;tele-EMS
      physician&quot; after consent of the patient is obtained. The tele-EMS physician has an
      audio-connection to the EMS team and receives vital parameters (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry,
      non-invasive blood pressure) in real-time. The transmission of still pictures (taken with a
      smartphone), 12-lead-ECGs and video streaming from the inside of the ambulance can also be
      carried out, if indicated. The tele-EMS physician supports the EMS team in obtaining all
      relevant medical history, neurological diagnosis, general diagnosis and can delegate the
      application of medications. This can be carried out to bridge the time to the arrival of an
      EMS physician or in less severe cases without an EMS physician on-scene. The quality of
      prehospital care and the possible influences on the initial inhospital phase should be
      investigated and compared with regular EMS.
