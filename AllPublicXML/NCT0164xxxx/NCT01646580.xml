  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ciclopirox olamine (CiclochemÂ®) is a pyridone broad spectrum antifungal drug which has shown
      activity on dermatophytes, yeasts, moulds, actinomycetes and some bacteria. Its mechanism of
      action is based on a fungicidal activity by inhibiting the cellular captation of essential
      substances needed for the metabolism and growth of the fungi. On the other hand, this drug
      binds irreversibly with cell structures as mitochondria, ribosomes, microsomes and cell wall.
      After dermal application, Ciclopirox olamine undergoes skin penetration, being only absorbed
      a 1,5% of the applied dose. Clinical efficacy has been studied in patients above 10 years
      with superficial dermatomycoses (dermatophytoses, candidiasis and pityriasis versicolor) and
      the percentage of clinical healing ranged from 77% to 91% after 2-4 weeks of twice a day
      topical application. In all the studies, the safety profile has been very good, showing only
      a very low rate of adverse events of mild to moderate intensity. There are very few previous
      available data on the application of this compound in children under 10 years of age. A
      single study had been performed with a solution formulation in patients from 6 to 29 months
      with diaper candidiasis, showing good efficacy and tolerability in these patients. The
      present study aims to show the safety and tolerability of ciclopirox olamine in a cream
      formulation in patients from 3 months to 10 years with dermatomycoses.

      A multicenter, open, prospective, Phase IV study of Ciclopirox olamine on patients from 3
      months to 10 years with all kinds of dermatomycoses. All body areas were treatable except
      scalp and nails (no tinea on the scalp nor onychomycoses) . Cream applied BID between 6.00
      and 10.00am and 7.00 and 10.00pm daily for 4 weeks.Control visit after 4 more weeks without
      treatment was performed in order to evaluate the relapse rate.
