  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The opportunity of a home, self-collected sample, opens the chance to remove some of the
      barriers that may discourage women from participating to screening programmes or performing
      HPV (Human Papilloma Virus)-test. Self-sampling is less time consuming and invasive as
      compared with tests performed at a clinic. It allows for privacy, reduces discomfort and
      women know nobody would have to handle their body.

      Study hypothesis: The use of a self-sampler may increase the recovery of non-responders women
      at cervical cancer screening.

  <detailed_description>

      In a previous trial (ISRCTN96071600) the investigators tested on 2400 women, compliance with
      self sampler device (PantaRhei Devices, Zeist, the Netherlands).

      With this study the investigators analyze the response to two channels of transmission of the
      device (a model of device easier, and less expensive than the previous), such as screening
      for colon cancer.

      The shipment of the device at home and taking on a local pharmacy. Involving 15000 women
      non-responders to previous calls in five different screening programs in Italy (Rome,
      Bologna, Abruzzo region, Molise region, Veneto region).
