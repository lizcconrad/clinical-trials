  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the effect of serelaxin
      (RLX030) infusion on the hepatic and renal circulation in patients with compensated cirrhosis
      and portal hypertension. Measurements were acquired non-invasively using magnetic resonance
      angiography (MRA) (study part A) and more directly via cannulation of the hepatic portal vein
      during a routine transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) check procedure (study
      part B), to determine the acute haemodynamic response to serelaxin (RLX030).

    <measure>Change From Baseline of the Blood Flow for the Total Renal Arteries (Study Part A (Serelaxin Treatment Group Only))</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 120 min post serelaxin infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The flow is the average flow over the cardiac cycle. Total renal artery flow = left renal artery flow + right renal artery flow. These measurements were collected through magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scans. Baseline blood flow for total renal artery is measured at pre-dose (Day 1, 0 min post-treatment)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 120 min post-infusion start</time_frame>
    <description>Direct venous pressure was measured by portal pressure gradient (PPG). PPG = portal vein pressure (PVP) - inferior vena cava pressure (IVCP).
Baseline blood flow for PPG was measured at pre-dose (Day 1, 0 min post-treatment). PVP was measured at 15 min intervals (i.e. prior to and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 min of serelaxin infusion).</description>
