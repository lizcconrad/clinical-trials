  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with decreased atrial contractility which is
      associated with stroke. Decreased contractility becomes apparent after cardioversion of
      atrial fibrillation, a short period (weeks) during which stroke risk is increased. Improved
      contractility immediately after cardioversion may prevent arrhythmia progression. In
      addition, it may reduce the stroke risk. Vernakalant is a new antiarrhythmic drug able to
      convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and at the same time increase atrial
      contractility. The latter has not yet been shown in humans and is subject of the present
      investigation. Our hypothesis is that in humans the contractility of the atria is higher
      after administration of vernakalant compared to flecainide. If indeed vernakalant improves
      atrial contractility after cardioversion further studies into the effect on long-term
      arrhythmia progression and stroke prevention may follow.

    <time_frame>After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm (this can be during infusion of medication or during the first hour after infusion) an echocardiography will be performed within one hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Echocardiography will be performed when the patient has sinus rhythm. Transmitral flow will be measured by pulsed Doppler from an apical four chamber view. Peak velocities of the early filling (E) wave and atrial filling (A) will be determined. We will also determine the E/A ratio and the atrial volumes and the total atrial conduction time (PA-TVI).</description>
