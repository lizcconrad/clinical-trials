  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This extension study will evaluate the safety (including immunogenicity) of treatment with
      rituximab-Pfizer, as well as the safety and immunogenicity after transitioning from
      rituximab-US or rituximab-EU to rituximab-Pfizer. This study will provide continued treatment
      access to subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis who have participated for at least 16
      weeks in other studies in the rituximab Pfizer program.

    <description>Serum samples were collected to determine the presence of ADA using two validated assays, one specific for PF-05280586 and one specific for the licensed drug products. For participants assigned to PF-05280586 in Study B3281001, blood samples were screened for ADA using the assay specific to PF-05280586; if the blood samples were confirmed to be positive (+ve) for ADA against PF-05280586, the samples were also analyzed using the assay specific for the licensed drug products to assess cross-reactivity of the ADA. For participants assigned to the licensed products in Study B3281001, blood samples were screened for ADA using both assays in order to assess any product-specific ADA and/or cross-reactivity for the transition from the licensed products to PF-05280586.</description>

    <description>Sixty-eight joints were assessed by a blinded joint assessor to determine the number of joints that were considered tender or painful. For consistency, a single assessor was preferred to perform all evaluations across the study for an individual participant. The response to pressure/motion on each joint was assessed using the following scale: Present/Absent/Not Done/Not Applicable (to be used for artificial or missing joints). Artificial joints were not be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Initial Study Baseline in Individual Components of the ACR Response: Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) - by the End of Course 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, 13, and 25 (Course 1).</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty participants experienced in 8 daily living activity domains during a week: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. Each question's difficulty was scored from 0-3 (0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, 3=unable to do). Activities requiring assistance (from people or assistive devices) were adjusted to ≥2 to denote more limited functional status. The questionnaire was to be completed by the participant prior to any procedures during the visit, if possible.
Overall HAQ-DI score was computed as the sum of domain scores divided by the number of domains answered, providing a score from 0-3. Low scores denoted improvement of disability/lower degree of domain difficulty.
Primary outcomes reported post baseline mean percent (%) changes in HAQ-DI score. Post baseline values are reported on the % change from initial study Baseline scale.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was an extension study for participants with active rheumatoid arthritis who had participated for at least 16 weeks in a prior rituximab-Pfizer protocol (B3281001) and had not received intervening treatment with investigational agents or other biologics (including Rituxan and MabThera).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants given PF-05280586 in Study B3281001 received PF-05280586. Participants given licensed product in Study B3281001 received the same licensed product or PF-05280586 in Course 1. All participants received PF-05280586 in later courses. 185 participants were randomized to Study B3281004, 183 participants received study treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Serum samples were collected to determine the presence of ADA using two validated assays, one specific for PF-05280586 and one specific for the licensed drug products. For participants assigned to PF-05280586 in Study B3281001, blood samples were screened for ADA using the assay specific to PF-05280586; if the blood samples were confirmed to be positive (+ve) for ADA against PF-05280586, the samples were also analyzed using the assay specific for the licensed drug products to assess cross-reactivity of the ADA. For participants assigned to the licensed products in Study B3281001, blood samples were screened for ADA using both assays in order to assess any product-specific ADA and/or cross-reactivity for the transition from the licensed products to PF-05280586.</description>

            <description>This group received IV rituximab (PF-05280586) infusion 1000 mg/500 mL (preceded by 100 mg IV methylprednisolone or its equivalent, an antipyretic, and an antihistamine) on Study Days 1 and 15 of up to 3 24­week (±8 week) courses. Participants continued to receive a stable background regimen of methotrexate 10 to 25 mg/week (7.5 mg/week in the event of prior poor tolerance). Folate supplementation was encouraged according to local standard of care. Participants in this treatment arm received Rituximab-US in the B3281001 study.</description>

          <description>Serum samples were collected to determine the presence of ADA using two validated assays, one specific for PF-05280586 and one specific for the licensed drug products. For participants assigned to PF-05280586 in Study B3281001, blood samples were screened for ADA using the assay specific to PF-05280586; if the blood samples were confirmed to be positive for ADA against PF-05280586, the samples were also analyzed using the assay specific for the licensed drug products to assess cross-reactivity of the ADA. For participants assigned to the licensed products in Study B3281001, blood samples were screened for ADA using both assays in order to assess any product-specific ADA and/or cross-reactivity for the transition from the licensed products to PF-05280586.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Initial Study Baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-C-Reactive Protein (CRP) - by the End of Course 1</title>
        <description>The disease activity score (DAS) assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to the following 4 components: tender/painful joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), CRP and patient’s global assessment of arthritis Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The formula for calculation of DAS28-CRP from these 4 components is DAS28-CRP equals (=) 0.56 square root (sqrt) (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 natural log [ln] (CRP [milligrams per liter, mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (global assessment of health [GH]) + 0.96. Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Initial Study Baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-C-Reactive Protein (CRP) - by the End of Course 3</title>
        <description>The disease activity score (DAS) assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to the following 4 components: tender/painful joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), CRP and patient’s global assessment of arthritis Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The formula for calculation of DAS28-CRP from these 4 components is DAS28-CRP equals (=) 0.56 square root (sqrt) (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 natural log [ln] (CRP [milligrams per liter, mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (global assessment of health [GH]) + 0.96. Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity.</description>

        <description>The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to the following 4 components: tender/painful joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), CRP and patient’s global assessment of arthritis VAS. The formula for calculation of DAS28-CRP from these 4 components is DAS28-CRP = 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 (ln CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (GH) + 0.96. Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-CRP ≤3.2 implied low disease activity.</description>

          <description>The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to the following 4 components: tender/painful joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), CRP and patient’s global assessment of arthritis VAS. The formula for calculation of DAS28-CRP from these 4 components is DAS28-CRP = 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 (ln CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (GH) + 0.96. Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-CRP ≤3.2 implied low disease activity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With DAS Remission (DAS28-CRP Less Than [&lt;] 2.6) - by the End of Course 1</title>
        <description>The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to the following 4 components: tender/painful joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), CRP and patient’s global assessment of arthritis VAS. The formula for calculation of DAS28-CRP from these 4 components is DAS28-CRP = 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 (ln CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (GH) + 0.96. Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-CRP &lt;2.6 implied remission.</description>

          <description>The DAS assessment is a continuous composite measure derived using differential weighting given to the following 4 components: tender/painful joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), CRP and patient’s global assessment of arthritis VAS. The formula for calculation of DAS28-CRP from these 4 components is DAS28-CRP = 0.56 sqrt (DAS 28 tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (DAS 28 swollen joint count) + 0.36 (ln CRP [mg/L] +1) + 0.014 (GH) + 0.96. Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-CRP &lt;2.6 implied remission.</description>

        <description>Sixty-eight joints were assessed by a blinded joint assessor to determine the number of joints that were considered tender or painful. For consistency, a single assessor was preferred to perform all evaluations across the study for an individual participant. The response to pressure/motion on each joint was assessed using the following scale: Present/Absent/Not Done/Not Applicable (to be used for artificial or missing joints). Artificial joints were not be assessed.</description>

          <description>Sixty-eight joints were assessed by a blinded joint assessor to determine the number of joints that were considered tender or painful. For consistency, a single assessor was preferred to perform all evaluations across the study for an individual participant. The response to pressure/motion on each joint was assessed using the following scale: Present/Absent/Not Done/Not Applicable (to be used for artificial or missing joints).

        <title>Percent Change From Initial Study Baseline in Individual Components of the ACR Response: Physician’s Global Assessment of Arthritis - by the End of Course 1</title>
        <description>The investigator assessed how the participant’s overall arthritis appeared at the time of the visit. This evaluation was based on the participant’s disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the Patient’s Global Assessment of Arthritis. The investigator’s response was recorded using a 100 mm VAS by placing a mark on the scale between 0 (very good) and 100 (very poor).</description>

        <description>The investigator assessed how the participant’s overall arthritis appeared at the time of the visit. This evaluation was based on the participant’s disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and was independent of the Patient’s Global Assessment of Arthritis. The investigator’s response was recorded using a 100 mm VAS by placing a mark on the scale between 0 (very good) and 100 (very poor).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Initial Study Baseline in Individual Components of the ACR Response: Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI) - by the End of Course 1</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty participants experienced in 8 daily living activity domains during a week: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. Each question’s difficulty was scored from 0-3 (0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, 3=unable to do). Activities requiring assistance (from people or assistive devices) were adjusted to ≥2 to denote more limited functional status. The questionnaire was to be completed by the participant prior to any procedures during the visit, if possible.
Overall HAQ-DI score was computed as the sum of domain scores divided by the number of domains answered, providing a score from 0-3. Low scores denoted improvement of disability/lower degree of domain difficulty.
Primary outcomes reported post baseline mean percent (%) changes in HAQ-DI score. Post baseline values are reported on the % change from initial study Baseline scale.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Initial Study Baseline in Individual Components of the ACR Response: Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI) - by the End of Course 3</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty participants experienced in 8 daily living activity domains during a week: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. Each question’s difficulty was scored from 0-3 (0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, 3=unable to do). Activities requiring assistance (from people or assistive devices) were adjusted to ≥2 to denote more limited functional status. The questionnaire was to be completed by the participant prior to any procedures during the visit, if possible.
Overall HAQ-DI score was computed as the sum of domain scores divided by the number of domains answered, providing a score from 0-3. Low scores denoted improvement of disability/lower degree of domain difficulty.
Primary outcomes reported post baseline mean percent (%) changes in HAQ-DI score. Post baseline values are reported on the % change from initial study Baseline scale.</description>

        <title>Outcome Measure Using HAQ-DI - by the End of Course 1</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty participants experienced in 8 daily living activity domains during a week: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. Each question’s difficulty was scored from 0-3 (0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, 3=unable to do). Activities requiring assistance (from people or assistive devices) were adjusted to ≥2 to denote more limited functional status. The questionnaire was to be completed by the participant prior to any procedures during the visit, if possible.
Overall HAQ-DI score was computed as the sum of domain scores divided by the number of domains answered, providing a score from 0-3. Low scores denoted improvement of disability/lower degree of domain difficulty.
Primary outcome reported in the table is mean HAQ-DI score at each time point, and it is on the scale of HAQ-DI score with the range from 0 to 3.</description>

          <title>Outcome Measure Using HAQ-DI - by the End of Course 2</title>
          <description>HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty participants experienced in 8 daily living activity domains during a week: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. Each question’s difficulty was scored from 0-3 (0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, 3=unable to do). Activities requiring assistance (from people or assistive devices) were adjusted to ≥2 to denote more limited functional status. The questionnaire was to be completed by the participant prior to any procedures during the visit, if possible.
Overall HAQ-DI score was computed as the sum of domain scores divided by the number of domains answered, providing a score from 0-3. Low scores denoted improvement of disability/lower degree of domain difficulty.
Primary outcome reported in the table is mean HAQ-DI score at each time point, and it is on the scale of HAQ-DI score with the range from 0 to 3.</description>

Participants continued to receive a stable background regimen of methotrexate 10 to 25 mg/week (7.5 mg/week in the event of prior poor tolerance) for up to 25 weeks. Folate supplementation was encouraged according to local standard of care.</description>
