    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the important change in the Short Physical
      Performance Battery (SPPB) when used in patients with lung disease. The SPPB is a simple
      physical test that measures balance and the functioning of the legs. It has been widely used
      in healthy elderly populations and predicts hospital admission and the onset of disability.
      The SPPB has not previously been used in patients with lung disease, and it is not clear what
      change in this test is considered meaningful and worthwhile by patients or doctors (the
      minimal clinically important difference: MID). Knowing what the MID for the SPPB will allow
      researchers and doctors to evaluate the effectiveness of current and new treatments, and to
      detect improvement or deterioration in the condition of patients.
