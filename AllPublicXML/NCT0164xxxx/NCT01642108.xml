  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results from early phase insulin secretory defect and insulin
      resistance. Studies have shown that most of the populations in which insulin resistance is
      considered to be the primary pathogenetic cause of diabetes, have a higher degree of obesity
      than those of primary insulin defect. Meanwhile, defective early insulin secretion plays a
      predominant role in the non-obese subtype of T2DM which includes majority of Japanese
      patients.

      Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV) inhibitor as indicated for the treatment of
      T2DM. Sitagliptin increases plasma concentrations of active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
      and active glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) two- to three-fold in patients with
      T2DM. The effect of sitagliptin on GLP-1 results in lower fasting and postprandial glucose
      concentrations through increases in glucose dependent insulin release and suppression of
      inappropriate glucagon secretion. Namely, several mechanistic studies using standardized meal
      showed that sitagliptin improved glucose control with decreased glucagon levels and increased
      insulin concentration in obese or overweight T2DM patients with BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2. However, how
      sitagliptin affects islet function, including glucagon secretion in non-obese patients with
      low insulin secretion are not known. Therefore, the investigators will examine the effect of
      sitagliptin on glycemic control and the mechanism involved using a standardized test meal in
      non-obese Japanese patients with T2DM whose BMI levels are &lt; 25 kg/m2.
