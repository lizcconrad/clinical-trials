  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No consensus guidelines exist for management of post-transplant glucocorticoid induced
      hyperglycemia, but most published reviews recommend insulin as first line therapy. A variety
      of insulin regimens have been proposed, including mealtime short-acting regular or analog
      insulin, once daily neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin, pre-mixed insulin, or basal
      insulin alone such as glargine or detemir. However, no randomized trial has ever examined
      different insulin regimens to determine which most effectively controls post-transplant
      steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Consequently, the proposed study intends to examine three
      commonly used insulin regimens used for managing post-transplant once-daily
      glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia to determine which is most effective:

        -  Group 1: Intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin at breakfast

        -  Group 2: Short-acting insulin (regular or aspart) before meals

        -  Group 3: Insulin glargine at breakfast

      Question/Hypothesis:

      Among three commonly used insulin regimens, which is most effective for managing
      post-transplant once-daily glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia?
