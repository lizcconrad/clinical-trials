  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is divided into Part A and Part B. The primary objective of Part A is to establish
      the Maximal Tolerated Dose of intermittent high dose afatinib. The primary objective of Part
      B is to assess the response rate of patients with non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR T790M
      mutations to a dose of intermittent afatinib established in Part A.

      The secondary objective is to explore tumor response and tumor-derived biological markers of
      response to afatinib, as well as pharmacokinetic parameters of afatinib.

This endpoint was originally planned to be analysed in part B of the study, however as no participants were treated in part B the analysis was performed on the part A participants.</description>
