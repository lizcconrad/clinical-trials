  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if use of a device called the Jaw Dynasplint® System can
      be used during and immediately after cancer treatment. The Dynasplint® is a stretching device
      that is used to treat joint stiffness and limited range of motion in the jaw. The device is
      currently approved for treatment of trismus once it has developed. This study will
      investigate the use of the device during and immediately after cancer treatment to prevent
      trismus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data suggest that early intervention with mechanical stretching devices for head and neck
      cancer patients undergoing curative therapy maximizes their effectiveness in the treatment of
      trismus. That being said, treatment for trismus typically begins after head and neck cancer
      patients are found to have moderate to severe reduction in jaw range of motion. Typically,
      clinicians will begin therapy when the IID is 3.0 cm or less. A subset of head and neck
      cancer patients will develop severe or rapidly progressive trismus that will fail to respond
      to treatment. In this cohort, trismus may lead to permanent, severe morbidity. It may be
      hypothesized that preventative strategies that encourage routine stretching during and
      immediately after the completion of cancer therapy may prevent or minimize trismus. No
      studies have examined the prophylactic use of the Jaw Dynasplint® System during cancer
      treatment.

      Furthermore, it is not known whether patients can tolerate wearing a mechanical stretching
      device during treatment. The investigators would like to test the hypothesis that: 1)
      preventive use of a mechanical stretching device during cancer treatment and early recovery
      is feasible, and 2) preventive use of a mechanical stretching device will result in a marked
      decrease in the incidence and severity of trismus in patients undergoing primary or adjuvant
      radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

    <description>Interincisoral distance (IID) will be the primary measure of efficacy. Any patient who develops IID of 30 mm or less will be considered to have clinically significant trismus. The incidence of trismus will be compared between the intervention arm (Arm 1) and the standard of care arm (Arm 2).</description>

    <measure>Symptom Burden of Patients with Trismus</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome data will be collected via questionnaires including, the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey plus General Symptom Survey version 2.0 (VHNSS v2.0 plus GSS), and the Mandibular Function Impairment Questionnaire (MFIQ). This patient reported outcome data will be collected in order to identify correlations between trismus and symptom burden.</description>
