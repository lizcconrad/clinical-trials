  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study about the relationship between lung cancer and environmental risk
      factors. The purpose of this study is to try to understand the effects of trace elements such
      as arsenic and chromium, as well as radon on the development of lung cancer. To do this, the
      investigators will collect information and environmental and biologic specimens from people
      who live in Appalachian Kentucky who a) have lung cancer or b) don't have lung cancer and
      will serve as control subjects. The investigators will create a specimen repository of from
      these people and their residences to compare differences in many risks factors for cancer. By
      doing this study, the investigators hope to learn why there are more lung cancers in
      Kentucky's fifth Congressional District than anywhere else in the nation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appalachian Kentucky has one of the highest incidence rates of lung cancer in the United
      States. The disproportionately high incidence is not explained by tobacco alone. Preliminary
      analysis of trace element content in toenail samples reveals higher levels of arsenic,
      chromium and nickel in Appalachian Kentucky residents than elsewhere in Kentucky. Trace
      elements are known to promote carcinogenesis by increased oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA
      damage, and reduced DNA repair efficiency. These findings justify further investigation of
      the role that trace elements play in the development of lung cancer in this region.
      Hypothesis: The unexpectedly high rate of lung cancer in Appalachian Kentucky is associated
      with exposure to environmental carcinogens that increase oxidative stress and DNA damage.

      Specific Aims Aim 1: Conduct a case-control study of lung cancer and matched controls in the
      5th Congressional District of Kentucky to compare rates of moderate to high arsenic in lung
      cancer cases and controls.

      Aim 2: Create a specimen repository of biologic and environmental samples from these subjects
      and their residences for analysis of DNA repair markers and, in the future, markers of
      oxidative stress and inflammation.

      Aim 3: Fund four pilot projects which will utilize collected data from Aim 1 to develop
      investigators focused on lung cancer research in this study population and to generate
      preliminary data that will lead to independent funding.

      Study Design: This is a population-based, case-control study encompassing the 5th
      Congressional District of Kentucky.

      Relevance: This translational research and repository will fundamentally improve our
      understanding of the causes of the disproportionately high incidence of lung cancer in
      Appalachian Kentucky, foster collaboration among scientists dedicated to the study of lung
      cancer and provide a permanent resource to be used for future research.

        This case-control study will be performed in Appalachian Kentucky, specifically the 5th
        Congressional District of Kentucky and will include male and female subjects from the
        subset of all histologically or cytologically confirmed primary carcinoma of the lung
        (International Classification of Diseases-9, 162.2-162.9) over the age of 17 years old that
        occur in the 5th District between October 17, 20011 and November 14, 2013.
