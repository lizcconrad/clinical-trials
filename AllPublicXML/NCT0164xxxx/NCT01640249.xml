    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe LY3006072 (study drug) is and whether it
      causes any side effects. The study will also measure how much of the study drug gets into the
      blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of the study drug. The study drug will
      be given in the morning or evening with or without a meal.

      This is the first time that this study drug is being given to humans. This study is for
      research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.

      This study has two parts:

      Part A - single ascending dose of LY3006072 administered to healthy participants in 3 of 4
      study periods (placebo in 1 of 4 periods).

      Part B - morning and evening doses of LY3006072 given to healthy participants in fed and
      fasted states in 2 or 3 of 3 study periods (placebo in 1 of 3 periods for some participants).
