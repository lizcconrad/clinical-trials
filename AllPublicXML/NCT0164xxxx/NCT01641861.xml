      Dental caries in children continues to affect a significant portion of the world population,
      especially in developing countries. There are many techniques used for dental caries
      treatment. The conventional method is to remove caries and prepare the cavity using dental
      burs. Disadvantages of this method; however, include the patients' repulsion of drilling, and
      possible thermal changes on tooth surface that may have an effect on the dental pulp tissues.
      In addition, the drilling technique frequently requires local anesthesia injections and
      sometimes results in the removal of sound tooth tissues. To overcome these problems and
      preserve the healthy dental tissues, the chemo-mechanical caries removal method was
      developed. The advantage by chemomechanical caries removal include less traumatic, less need
      local anesthesia, reduced chance of dental pulp exposure. And also it could be benefit to
      medical compromised patients.

      Papacarie® is a new chemo-mechanical technique for caries removal with few published research
      and case reports. A randomized controlled trial is therefore needed to determine the efficacy
      of its use in general population. The aims of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of a
      chemo-mechanical system (Papacarie®) for caries removal in comparison to the conventional
      drilling method.

    <description>The dental restorations were evaluated at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after treatment. Evaluation criteria included the condition of the filling material and presence of secondary caries at the margin of the restorations.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Caries Removal</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of caries removal was evaluated by the visual and tactile criteria. The completeness of caries removal was judged on the basis of clinical criteria involving the inspection of the tooth surfaces using a good light source, dental mirror and explorer. A blunt explorer was used to detect surface roughness by gently stroking across the dentine surfaces and to evaluate the dentine hardness. Complete caries removal was achieved if as remove soft and infected dentine until felt hard and leathery consistency of the dentine surfaces. The tactile criteria include the smooth passage of the blunt explorer and absence of a catch or a &quot;tug-back&quot; sensation.</description>

    <measure>Levels of Pain and Discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were assessed for the levels of pain and discomfort using the facial visual analogue scale (VAS). The score was recorded in ruler scale from 0-100 millimeters, 0 = no pain and 100 = extreme pain) before treatment with the child sitting on the dental chair and after treatment (completion of carious tissue removal). The difference in the VAS scores before and after treatment was calculated and compared between the two comparison groups.</description>

        <description>The efficacy of caries removal was evaluated by the visual and tactile criteria. The completeness of caries removal was judged on the basis of clinical criteria involving the inspection of the tooth surfaces using a good light source, dental mirror and explorer. A blunt explorer was used to detect surface roughness by gently stroking across the dentine surfaces and to evaluate the dentine hardness. Complete caries removal was achieved if as remove soft and infected dentine until felt hard and leathery consistency of the dentine surfaces. The tactile criteria include the smooth passage of the blunt explorer and absence of a catch or a “tug-back” sensation.</description>
