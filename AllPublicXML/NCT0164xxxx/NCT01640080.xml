  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of esketamine compared with placebo in
      improving symptoms of depression in patients with treatment resistant depression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient
      receives), double-randomization (the study drug is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled
      (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a
      real effect in a clinical trial), multiple dose titration study in adult patients with
      treatment resistant depression (TRD). The study will assess the efficacy of esketamine at 24
      hours after dosing on Day 1, administered as a 0.40 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg intravenous (i.v.)
      infusion, compared with placebo in improving symptoms of depression in patients with TRD,
      using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The study will consist of 3
      phases: a screening phase of up to 2 weeks, a 7-day double-blind treatment phase (Day 1 to
      Day 7), and a 4-week posttreatment (follow up) phase. The interval between the first and last
      dose of study medication is 3 days. The total study duration for each patient will be a
      maximum of 7 weeks.

    <description>The QIDS-SR14, s a version of the QIDS-SR16 with a shorter, 24-hour recall period that has been developed for this trial. The total score ranges from 0 to 27. Using a scale of severity of depression of none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, corresponding QIDS-SR16 total scores are none 1-5, mild 6-10, moderate 11-15, severe 16-20 and very severe 21-27.</description>

    <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a patient reported measure designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 27. Using a scale of severity of depression of none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, corresponding QIDS-SR16 total scores are none 1-5, mild 6-10, moderate 11-15, severe 16-20 and very severe 21-27.</description>

    <description>The CGI-S is a physician-rated scale that is designed to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis and improvement with treatment. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating according to: 0= not assessed; 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (baseline), Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 0= not assessed; 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse.</description>

    <description>The PGI-S is a 4-point scale that requires the patient to rate the severity of their illness at the time of assessment, relative to the patient's past experience. Considering their total experience, the patient assesses the severity of their depression illness at the time of rating as none, mild, moderate or severe.</description>

    <description>The PGI-C is a 7-point scale that requires the patient to assess how much their illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. The response options are: very much improved; much improved; improved (just enough to make a difference); no change; worse (just enough to make a difference); much worse; or very much worse.</description>
