    <textblock>
      This laboratory study is looking into biomarkers in samples from younger patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia. Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer

      Study Subtype: Observational Observational Study Model: Case-control Time Perspective:
      Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Cryopreserved
      bone marrow samples Study Population Description: Patient samples with the AML1-ETO
      translocation and cytologically normal AML samples for controls Sampling Method:
      Non-Probability Sample

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To address whether the mutation-specific cell-surface markers observed in murine system
      will allow the prospective isolation of leukemia stem cells (LSC) from human bone marrow
      samples that have the same cytogenetic abnormalities.

      II. To compare the incidence of leukemia in NSG mice that have received CD34+CD38 marker+
      cells to NSG mice that receive what are hypothesized to be normal cells (CD34+CD38
      marker-subset) from the same patient.

      OUTLINE:

      Samples and controls are sorted and re-sorted for CD34, CD38, and CD55 subsets by single-cell
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, flow cytometry, and reverse-transcriptase PCR.
      Sorted cell subsets are then transplanted into NSG mice. Beginning 6 weeks after
      transplantation, peripheral blood samples are collected and analyzed for human lymphoid- and
      myeloid-lineage cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
