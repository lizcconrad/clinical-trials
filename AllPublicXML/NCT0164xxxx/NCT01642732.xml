      The purposes of this study are to:

        -  Determine the safest and highest dose of the study drug RAD001 (Everolimus) that can be
           taken in combination with hormonal and radiation therapy in men with high risk prostate
           cancer.

        -  Evaluate changes in patient reported quality of life

        -  Evaluate biomarkers from prostate tumor samples. Biomarkers are various traits which can
           be used to identify the progress of a disease or condition, which can help researchers
           determine the effect the study treatment has on the tumor. Biomarkers can also help
           determine areas for further research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is very prevalent with an estimated &gt; 200,000 new cases and &gt; 25,000 deaths
      attributable to prostate cancer in the United States in 2010. Radiation treatment represents
      a commonly utilized method to treat prostate cancer with an excellent chance of controlling
      disease with biochemical control at 5-years in excess of 75% in men with locally confined but
      intermediate to high-risk disease. However, despite impressive biochemical control, local
      control remains a problem.

      Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:

        -  Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation

        -  Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity.

      Given the prevalence of PTEN deletion in high-risk prostate cancers as well as the evidence
      that tumor hypoxia leads to increased risks of failure after treatment with hormonal therapy
      and radiation, we hypothesis that inhibition of mTOR signaling in both tumor and vascular
      cells using everolimus concurrent with hormonal and radiation therapy will enhance the
      efficacy of radiation therapy without an unacceptable risk of toxicity in men with high-risk
      prostate cancer.

      Everolimus has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of prostate cancer by itself or
      in combination with radiation and hormonal therapy. It is not known if this combination is
      safe and effective in prostate cancer. The FDA has allowed their combined use in this
      clinical trial.

    <description>Everolimus - there are five dose levels (2.5mg. every 48 hrs.,2.5mg./day, 5mg./day, 7.5mg./day, and 10mg./day) based on the initial expectations of toxicity and the incidence of toxicity of subjects already treated. Subjects will be on one dose level throughout the study. Subjects will receive everolimus starting on study day 1.
Radiation therapy will start on day 60-70 (44 treatments, at 5 treatments a week for a little longer than 8 weeks).
Bicalutamide (50 mg. tablets daily) will begin on study day 10-14, approximately 2 months prior to Radiation Therapy.
Lupron injections will begin on study day 10 to 25, approximately 2 months prior to Radiation Therapy. The typical dose schedule is either one injection (22.5 mg. dose)every 3 months for a total of 8 injections or one injection (30 mg. dose) every 4 months for a total of 6 injections.
Radiation, bicalutamide, and everolimus will end between study day 120-130. Lupron will end at 24 months on study.</description>

            <title>Everolimus With Combined Hormonal and Radiation Therapy</title>
            <description>Everolimus - there are five dose levels (2.5mg. every 48 hrs.,2.5mg./day, 5mg./day, 7.5mg./day, and 10mg./day) based on the initial expectations of toxicity and the incidence of toxicity of subjects already treated. Subjects will be on one dose level throughout the study. Subjects will receive everolimus starting on study day 1.
Radiation therapy will start on day 60-70 (44 treatments, at 5 treatments a week for a little longer than 8 weeks).
Bicalutamide (50 mg. tablets daily) will begin on study day 10-14, approximately 2 months prior to Radiation Therapy.
Lupron injections will begin on study day 10 to 25, approximately 2 months prior to Radiation Therapy. The typical dose schedule is either one injection (22.5 mg. dose)every 3 months for a total of 8 injections or one injection (30 mg. dose) every 4 months for a total of 6 injections.
Radiation, bicalutamide, and everolimus will end between study day 120-130. Lupron will end at 24 months on study.</description>
