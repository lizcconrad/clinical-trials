      The purpose of the study is to determine the permanency of PV isolation with the Arctic Front
      Advance cryoablation system in paroxysmal AF patients. It will also provide data on acute
      procedural outcomes and measures as well as clinical AF recurrence in these patients
      approximately 3 months post-ablation.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. It
      is estimated that more than 7 million people worldwide have the disease. Over the past
      decade, catheter ablation has become an accepted treatment for patients with AF. Ablation
      strategies that target the pulmonary vein are considered the cornerstone for treatment. The
      innovative Arctic Front cryoballoon is used for the treatment of drug refractory recurrent
      symptomatic paroxysmal AF (PAF). The system was designed to overcome many of the challenges
      of point-by-point catheter ablation by providing an anatomical approach for pulmonary vein
      isolation (PVI), creating long contiguous circumferential lesions surrounding the pulmonary
      vein. The cryoballoon system has a low risk of complications and proven efficacy in treating
      PAF.

      AF recurrence rates have been reported up to 30% after initial ablation with PVI technologies
      including point-by-point RF catheter ablation. Arrhythmia recurrence can be caused by
      non-contiguous ablation lines that allow conduction gaps. Arctic Front Advance™ Cardiac
      CryoAblation Catheter (Arctic Front Advance), the second-generation cryoballoon which has
      recently been introduced following clearance by regulatory agencies in both the US and EU, is
      positioned to address this challenge with PVI technologies. The new catheter features the
      EvenCool™ Cryo Technology, which optimizes how the refrigerant is distributed inside the
      balloon, providing more uniform, distal cooling around the circumference of the balloon. The
      purpose of this study is to examine the rate of electrical PV isolation with the next
      generation system .
