  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of Staph in/on a patient who will undergo total joint replacement is a risk in
      that the patient could go on to develop infection at the surgery site after surgery. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate if it is beneficial to to administer a questionnaire and
      obtain cultures from various body sites from patients prior to surgery and also to determine
      which body site(s) provide the best source of possible staph presence. If the pre operative
      cultures indicate staph is present, an Infectious Disease specialist will be consulted for
      standard of medical care consultation and treatment management. All patients scheduled to
      have total joint arthroplasty are eligible to participate. The research team will follow the
      study patients for 2 years after they undergo prosthetic joint implantation to monitor for
      development of prosthetic joint infection.

    <description>We hope to determine which anatomical site(s) are best utilized for swab cultures to detect S aureus colonization in patients undergoing prosthetic joint replacement. We will collect data on infection development for up to 2 years post operatively.</description>
