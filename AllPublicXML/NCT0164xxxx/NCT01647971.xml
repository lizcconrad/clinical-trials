      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ublituximab is safe and effective in
      patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma who were previously treated with
      rituximab.

    <description>Phase I:
4 cohorts with IV ublituximab starting with 450 mg followed by 600 mg, 900 mg or 1200 mg in each cohort (3 - 6 patients per cohort). Infusions will be on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle 1 followed by a planned maintenance with a single infusion monthly starting cycle 3. Patients with CLL or SLL will have infusions on Days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 &amp; 2 followed by a planned maintenance with a single infusion monthly starting cycle 3. Expansion of patient enrollment in select cohorts will apply.</description>
