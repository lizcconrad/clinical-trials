  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystocia is the most common indication for primary cesarean section. The most common cause of
      dystocia is uterine dysfunction. In all cephalopelvic disproportion studies, more attention
      is usually paid on fetus and pelvic rather than on the role of uterine contraction in
      delivery. So we decided to determine the relationship between dystocia and uterine
      contraction patterns.
