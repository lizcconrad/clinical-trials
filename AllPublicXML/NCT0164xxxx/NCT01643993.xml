  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Techniques to improve pregnancy and delivery rates in IVF cycles have focused not only on the
      embryos transferred, but also the conditions in the uterus at the time of transfer and
      implantation. Prior studies have shown that embryos secrete human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG) prior to implantation. However, in IVF cycles, the embryos have limited time to secrete
      hCG before implantation must occur because embryos are placed into the uterus rather than
      traveling there from the fallopian tubes. Recent studies have shown that the introduction of
      hCG into the uterus prior to embryo transfer may make the uterus more receptive to
      implantation. These studies involved day 3 embryos and the investigators are seeking to
      evaluate the potential benefits of hCG on implantation rates of blastocysts (day 5 or day 6
      embryos).

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether infusion of human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG) into the uterus immediately prior to embryo transfer results in increased implantation
      rates.

      The entire IVF cycle, fresh or frozen, will be conducted per routine. All laboratory culture
      conditions will be per routine. In fresh and frozen IVF cycles, an embryo transfer will be
      performed per routine.

      At the time of embryo transfer, participants will be randomly assigned to either the control
      group or the hCG group. Patients in the hCG group will have a mock embryo transfer with 20µL
      of transfer media including 500IU of hCG. Patients in the control group will have a mock
      embryo transfer with 20µL of transfer media.

      All post-transfer care and pregnancy monitoring will be identical and per routine protocol.
