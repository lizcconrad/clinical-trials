  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with AMD who are being or have been treated with eye injections of drugs known as
      anti-VEGF agents with either good or poor response will have DNA collected with check swabs
      for analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a single-center, observational case control evaluation to compare
      the genetic profiles of two groups of patients categorized according to anti-VEGF treatment
      response as either &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;suboptimal&quot; responders following treatment with either
      bevacizumab or ranibizumab anti-VEGF agents. Positive and suboptimal responders will be
      compared to determine if genetic variant distribution or total genetic load is associated
      with anti-VEGF treatment response.

          -  Subject satisfies one of the following:

               1. Has received at least one injection of anti-VEGF therapy (bevacizumab or
                  ranibizumab) with no evidence of residual subretinal or intra-retinal fluid
                  present on SDOCT one month (+/- 1 week) following most recent injection; or

               2. Has received three or more injections in last six months with residual subretinal
                  or intra-retinal fluid present on SDOCT one month (+/- 1 week) following most
                  recent injection, has not shown complete resolution of fluid following any
                  injection in last 6 months, and shows leakage on FA or ICG imaging at some time
                  during last 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous sample donation under this protocol

          -  Presence of retinal disease involving the photoreceptors and/or outer retinal layers

             retinopathy, vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy and uveitis or similar outer retinal
             diseases which have been present prior to the age of 50.

          -  Opacities of the ocular media, limitations of pupillary dilation or other problems
             sufficient to preclude adequate imaging of the posterior segment.
