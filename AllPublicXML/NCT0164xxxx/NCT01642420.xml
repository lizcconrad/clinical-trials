  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common course of cognitive decline and thereby the course
      of more than half of all cases of dementia. A proper AD diagnosis is rested on a number of
      examinations and tests, which combined can make AD diagnosis likely. But no single test or
      examination can unambiguous determine whether the patient has AD or not. Comparatively no
      examination or test can with accuracy predict whether a healthy person or a person with only
      mild cognitive (MCI)impairment in time will evolve AD.

      Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, linear CT
      analyses and Timed Up and Go - Dual Task (TUG-DT) are relatively inexpensive and and widely
      available diagnostic methods, which have the potential to diagnose AD at an early stage in a
      reliable accurate way. But they also have the potential to predict which patients diagnosed
      with MCI have particular risk of developing dementia.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the relations between qEEG, CSF biomarkers, CT
      analyses and TUG-DT outcome and clinical features in healthy persons as well as patients with
      MCI and AD Furthermore to investigate whether qEEG or CSF biomarkers can predict which
      patients with MCI will in time evolve AD.
