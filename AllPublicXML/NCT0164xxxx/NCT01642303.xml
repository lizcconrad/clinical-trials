      Improvement of the internet and its tremendous growth has caused significant progress in
      transformation of information. Nowadays in any place of the world and in any time of the day
      by accessing through internet every student can use different kinds of information in World
      Wide Web which let him to make the best decision what, how and when to study. One of these
      educational technologies which are beneficial to learners is vodcast or video recording which
      are accessible through the internet.This paper is going to examine the listening
      comprehension in EFL learners and whether it may be improved by using vodcasts. So106
      language learners of four different classes of Iranian higher intermediate in an English
      institute were chosen for this study. These learners were pre-tested by IELTS Listening
      Comprehension. Two classes were chosen as subject group which consisted of 54 learners. The
      remaining two classes were chosen as control group which consisted of 52 learners. Both
      groups were taught Listening Impact book, but students in subject group were provided some
      vodcasts based on the topic of their lessons. After 12 weeks of teaching both groups were
      post-tested.listening comprehension will be compared using independent t-test and paired
      t-test.
