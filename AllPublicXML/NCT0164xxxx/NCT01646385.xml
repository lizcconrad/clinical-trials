  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the rates of serious adverse events and death in adult rheumatoid
      arthritis patients treated with etanercept over the long-term in real-life clinical practice.
      It will also assess whether there is any difference in the rate of serious adverse events in
      patients trated with etanercept in comparision to patients treated with conventional
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The study will in addition quantify the
      efficacy of etanercept in this population by assessing the rates of important clinical
      outcomes such as changes in disease activity and disability/functioning.

    <description>Participant-Year estimated by calculating all of the years that participants in a study were followed (number of evaluable participants multiplied by mean follow-up in years). Crude (unadjusted) incidence rate calculated as number of malignancy events divided by Participant-Year, multiplied by 1000.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to last follow-up, assessed every 6 month for first 3 years and thereafter annually up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-Year estimated by calculating all of years that participants in a study were followed (number of evaluable participants multiplied by mean follow-up in years). Crude (unadjusted) incidence rate calculated as number of LMs divided by Participant-Year, multiplied by 1000. Lymphoproliferative: medical condition characterized by the dysfunction of the immune system often resulting in excessive production of lymphocytes. LMs included lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia. Adverse outcome was defined as 'lymphoproliferative malignancy' in the field [lymphopro] labeled by BSRBR.</description>

    <description>Participant-Year estimated by calculating all of the years that participants in a study were followed (number of evaluable participants multiplied by total follow-up in years). Crude (unadjusted) incidence rate calculated as number of other serious adverse events divided by Participant-Year, multiplied by 1000. Other serious adverse events were based on classifications assigned by the BSRBR and included cardiac serious adverse events (SAEs), central nervous system SAEs, and nonmalignant hematological SAEs.</description>

    <description>Participant-Year estimated by calculating all of the years that participants in a study were followed (number of evaluable participants multiplied by total follow-up in years). Crude (unadjusted) incidence rate calculated as number of deaths divided by Participant-Year, multiplied by 1000. Death was recorded in the adverse outcomes table and in the consultant follow-up table. Where multiple events described death for the same participant, date of death was taken as per the earliest record.</description>

          <title>Etanercept</title>
          <description>Participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who received etanercept (ETN, as their first biological drug) in doses as per approved product label or summary of product characteristics (SmPC) were observed using the data in British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register (BSRBR) for a maximum of 10 years. Doses of ETN and any concomitant medication could be adjusted according to medical and therapeutic necessity. Participants were eligible to receive any other therapy instead of ETN, as per investigator’s discretion and the doses of these were not controlled in the follow-up.</description>
