  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inter- and intra-variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters of different formulations
      and doses of simvastatin in healthy subjects and in subjects with celiac disease in remission
      will be evaluated. Additionally, baseline values of pharmacokinetic parameters of simvastatin
      for both study groups will be determined.
