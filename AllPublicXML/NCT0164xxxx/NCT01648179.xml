      This study is an open-label, randomized, single dose, four period, balanced crossover study
      to assess in eligible healthy male or female subjects:

        -  The relative bioavailability of the wet milled GSK1322322 tablet formulation with and
           without food compared to an oral mesylate salt solution.

        -  The effect of body weight on the pharmacokinetics of GSK1322322 when given either orally
           or IV.

        -  The absolute bioavailability of the wet milled tablet and the oral mesylate salt
           solution compared to the IV formulation.

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female (of non childbearing potential) between 18 and 65 years of age
             inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

             determination): Males Females Heart rate &lt;45 and &gt;100 bpm &lt;50 and &gt;100 bpm PR Interval

                  tachycardia (≥3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats) or any significant
                  arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK medical
                  monitor, will interfere with the safety of the individual subject.
