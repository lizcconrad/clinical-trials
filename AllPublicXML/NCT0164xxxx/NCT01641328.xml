  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes an initial phase of cognitive decline, usually
      among older adults, in which a person notices a decline in attention or memory, and performs
      worse than normal on cognitive tests of such. People with MCI are more likely to develop
      Alzheimer's disease or related dementia than others their same age, and so MCI is thought of
      as an early warning sign of progressive cognitive decline.

      While some forms of MCI may be brought about by purely genetic causes, other cases may be due
      to a withdrawal of cognitive engagement with the world. In these cases, a rigorous program of
      cognitive training may be beneficial, halting or reversing symptom progression.

      The current study will evaluate a multifaceted cognitive activation program on older adults
      with MCI. This group program is intensive, running for 10 weeks, 3 times per week, for a
      total of 100 hours of training. Training consists of meditation exercises for broad attention
      activation, Tai Chi exercises to integrate cognition with body awareness, and cognitive
      training through computerized attention, memory, and problem solving exercise.

      Subjective impressions and objective measures of cognitive ability will be measured before
      and after the intervention. The investigators will also examine effects on mood and levels of
      daily function. Results will be compared to a waitlisted control group. The control group
      will subsequently be entered into a home-based version of the program for 10 weeks, with
      assessment before and after training, to look at the importance of the group meeting dynamic
      in promoting cognitive change.
