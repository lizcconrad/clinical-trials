    <textblock>
      This study will assess the initial safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of MK-8655, after single and multiple daily oral administrations to
      participants with Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). The study will assess the reduction in fasting
      plasma glucose concentrations from baseline after multiple daily administrations of MK-8655.
