  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No one really knows what causes overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). Urinary tract infection
      (UTI)causes similar symptoms to OAB with the difference being the presence of bacteria, as
      evidenced by routine microbiology cultures. Recent work by the group on the genitourinary
      microbiome (GUM) has shown that female urine, even in the absence of culture evidence of
      bacteria does have evidence of bacterial DNA. Bacterial 16S rRNA can be isolated from urine
      and sequenced to identify bacterial species present in urine. From this the investigators can
      hypothesize that urinary bacteria contribute to urinary symptoms and that there is a
      difference in the bacterial communities in the urine of women who respond to Solifenacin, a
      drug used to treat OAB, versus those that do not.

      This is a prospective study with two groups: Women who have accepted a clinical
      recommendation for OAB treatment with solifenacin and a comparator (control) group of women
      unaffected by OAB. All women will have a baseline urine assessment with bacterial genome
      sequencing. Solifenacin treated patients will also have urine assessments with bacterial
      genomic sequencing at 4 and 12 weeks on treatment.

    <measure>Assessment of Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) was developed to assess symptom bother and the impact of overactive bladder (OAB) on health-related quality of life (HRQL). The instrument comprises 33 items. Response options for the symptom frequency and HRQL items are presented as 6-point Likert scales ranging from 'none of the time' to 'all of the time' for symptom frequency (and 'not at all' to 'a very great deal' for symptom bother). From these 33 items, six sub-scales are assessed separately: (1) OAB symptom severity, (2) Coping with OAB symptoms, (3) Concern for OAB symptoms, (4) Sleep as a function of OAB symptoms, (5) Social functioning as a consequence of OAB symptoms, and (6) Health related quality of life (HRQL) as a function of OAB symptoms. Each sub-scale score ranges from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate more severe OAB symptoms and lower scores indicate minimal symptom severity).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Pelvic Floor Disease Inventory (PFDI) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PFDI comprises 46 items on a 4-point symptom severity scale ranging from 1 = &quot;Not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;Quite a bit&quot;. From these items, 13 separate sub-scales are reported: (1) Obstructive discomfort, (2) Irritation, (3) Stress resulting from urinal distress, (4) A general sub-scale for pelvic organ prolapse distress, (5) An anterior sub-scale for pelvic organ prolapse distress, (6) A posterior sub-scale for pelvic organ prolapse distress, (7) An obstructive sub-scale for colorectal anal distress, (8) Incontinence, (9) Pain, and (10) A rectal prolapse sub-scale for colorectal anal distress. For each of these sub-scales, scores from from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate greater symptom severity). There are three additional sub-scales: (11) The urinary distress inventory, (12) The pelvic organ distress inventory, and (13) The colorectal distress inventory. Each of these ranges from 0 to 400 (with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Controls: Women without bother from urinary symptoms will be screened for potential study

      <pre_assignment_details>This was a 12-week open label study with no randomization scheme. Following diagnosis, patients were administered 5 mg daily solifenacin. At the 4-week visit, if a participant’s symptoms were adequately controlled (response), she continued at dose for the study duration. If a participant reported no improvement, the dose was increased to 10 mg.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Assessment of Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OABQ)</title>
        <description>The Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) was developed to assess symptom bother and the impact of overactive bladder (OAB) on health-related quality of life (HRQL). The instrument comprises 33 items. Response options for the symptom frequency and HRQL items are presented as 6-point Likert scales ranging from 'none of the time' to 'all of the time' for symptom frequency (and 'not at all' to 'a very great deal' for symptom bother). From these 33 items, six sub-scales are assessed separately: (1) OAB symptom severity, (2) Coping with OAB symptoms, (3) Concern for OAB symptoms, (4) Sleep as a function of OAB symptoms, (5) Social functioning as a consequence of OAB symptoms, and (6) Health related quality of life (HRQL) as a function of OAB symptoms. Each sub-scale score ranges from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate more severe OAB symptoms and lower scores indicate minimal symptom severity).</description>

        <description>The PFDI comprises 46 items on a 4-point symptom severity scale ranging from 1 = &quot;Not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;Quite a bit&quot;. From these items, 13 separate sub-scales are reported: (1) Obstructive discomfort, (2) Irritation, (3) Stress resulting from urinal distress, (4) A general sub-scale for pelvic organ prolapse distress, (5) An anterior sub-scale for pelvic organ prolapse distress, (6) A posterior sub-scale for pelvic organ prolapse distress, (7) An obstructive sub-scale for colorectal anal distress, (8) Incontinence, (9) Pain, and (10) A rectal prolapse sub-scale for colorectal anal distress. For each of these sub-scales, scores from from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate greater symptom severity). There are three additional sub-scales: (11) The urinary distress inventory, (12) The pelvic organ distress inventory, and (13) The colorectal distress inventory. Each of these ranges from 0 to 400 (with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity).</description>
