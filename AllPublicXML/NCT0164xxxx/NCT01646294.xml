  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate how quickly and to what extent YM178 is absorbed
      and eliminated from the body, and how well it is tolerated, when given in three different
      tablet formulations (sustained release) once a day with and without food, and to compare the
      results with the profile of the YM178 immediate release formulation taken twice daily without
      food.

      Subjects reside in the clinical research unit for 3 periods of 11 days each, with a washout
      period of at least 7 days between treatment periods. . Each subject is treated with multiple
      oral doses of the IR formulation (b.i.d.) under fasted conditions and, OCAS-F, OCAS-M or
      OCAS-S formulation (q.d.) under fasted and fed conditions (high fat breakfast).

      The study is completed with a post-study visit between 7 and 14 days after discharge of
      period 3.
