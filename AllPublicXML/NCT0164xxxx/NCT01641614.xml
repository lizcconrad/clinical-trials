    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immediately clinic and ultramicroscopic
      myocardial cellular ischemia and reperfusion to replace of the mitral valve using arrested
      heart versus on-pump empty beating heart surgical techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During open-heart surgery prevention of ischemia and reperfusion following cardioplegic
      arrest are essential for myocardial protection. Beating heart surgery on normothermic bypass
      simulates physiologic cardiac status and is good method for myocardial protection. A
      comparison of both available techniques for valve replacement arrested heart versus on-pump
      empty beating heart of the clinical and ultramicroscopic myocardial alterations will allowed
      to better understand myocardial protection because eliminated the use of cardioplegia and the
      corollary risk of ischemic reperfusion injury.

    <description>Mitral valve replacement (MVR) was performed using a metallic or bioprostheses substitution by interrupted suture. For the beating heart the prostheses was functionally tested before removal of the retrograde perfusion catheter and for the arrested heart the prosthesis was artificially tested by pumping saline into the left ventricle. The tricuspid valve repair was done following De Vegas' technique in both groups with the beating heart also in the group B.</description>

    <description>Group A (Beating heart) surgery was performed under normal temperature (36⁰ C) ,once CPB was established, the patient was placed in Trendelenburg position and a retrograde perfusion catheter was inserted into the coronary sinus and ligated by a simple suture line. Aorta cross clamping was immediately established and blood was oxygenated and delivered continuously through a catheter Mitral valve was exposed using the left atrial retractor. Mitral valve replacement (MVR) was performed using a metallic or bioprostheses substitution by interrupted suture De Vegas' technique.</description>

    <description>Group B (arrested heart) surgery was performed under moderate hypothermia (32⁰C) as technique requirement (3). After cardiac arrest, during the period of cross clamping, the aortic root was perfused through the cardioplegias's cannula with oxygenated blood at a rate between 200 mL/min to 300 mL/min for 2 minutes with 15 minutes intervals.Mitral valve replacement (MVR) was performed using a metallic or bioprostheses substitution by interrupted suture De Vegas' technique.</description>
