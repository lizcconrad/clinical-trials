      Purpose of the study:

      The specific aims of this study are to evaluate overall efficacy and safety of the
      pre-transplant IVIG treatment in our transplant center since 2007 and to identify factors
      affecting treatment outcomes in order to improve patient selection and treatment protocols
      for future patients.

      Background:

      Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion is one of several novel approaches to decrease
      antibody levels for highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates [1, 2]. This approach can
      potentially give a chance of kidney transplantation to end-stage renal failure patients who
      could never receive transplantation because of high levels of antibodies and persistent
      positive crossmatches to all potential kidney donors. Many transplant centers have used this
      strategy in order to increase transplant rates of highly sensitized patients with various
      levels of anti-HLA antibodies. However, the responses to the treatment seem to be different
      in each patient and factors affecting treatment outcome have yet to be determined.

          -  Subject has an uncontrolled concomitant infection or any other unstable medical
             condition (e.g., uncontrolled cardiovascular disease) that could interfere with the

             to be contraindicated to kidney transplantation.

          -  Subject has a psychiatric illness that, in the judgment of caring physicians, may
             interfere with study participation.
