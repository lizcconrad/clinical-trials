  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the MyLife MyStyle Evaluation Project is to determine whether the MyLife
      MyStyle group-level intervention reduces HIV sexual-risk behaviors among 18- to 29-year-old
      African American men who have sex with men (MSM). Specifically, the project will test whether
      participants of the MyLife MyStyle program will report at least a 15% absolute decrease in
      frequency of unprotected anal sex with male partners at three and six months
      post-intervention compared with the wait-list control participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Los Angeles County, as well as nationally, the primary mode of HIV transmission for
      African American men is sexual contact with another man. According to national data from 45
      states with name-based HIV surveillance in 2006, the majority of all new HIV infections among
      African American males were associated with sex with other men. The disproportionate impact
      of HIV in AAMSM in Los Angeles County is also observed in provisional HIV surveillance data.
      Between 2002 and 2004, AAMSM composed 16.3% of the new HIV diagnoses among males in Los
      Angeles County, with an average annual HIV diagnosis rate 2.0 and 2.5 times greater than the
      rates of new HIV diagnosis for White and Latino MSM, respectively. In addition to
      demonstrating the highest HIV prevalence and incidence estimates, AAMSM also had the highest
      proportion of previously unrecognized HIV infection (67%) compared with all other
      racial/ethnic groups. Given significant and continuing disparities in HIV infection among
      African Americans in the United States, and specifically among AAMSM, more intervention
      programs must be planned, implemented, and tested in order to reduce the heavy toll of
      HIV/AIDS in this population. Components of these intervention programs must be culturally
      competent and should include promotion of HIV counseling and testing to reduce the high
      prevalence of unrecognized HIV infection in AAMSM. Interventions should also take into
      consideration the many co-factors that may hinder AAMSM from addressing their HIV risk such
      as racism, poverty, stigma, and homophobia. The MyLife MyStyle Evaluation Project aims to
      implement and evaluate the efficacy of a &quot;homegrown&quot; group-level intervention to reduce HIV
      risk (unprotected anal sex with male partners) among young African American MSM in Los
      Angeles County, CA.
