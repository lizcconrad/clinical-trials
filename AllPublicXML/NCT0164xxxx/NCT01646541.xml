  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with mitral valve disease are symptomatic with shortness of breath and a
      limited activity level prior to mitral valve surgery. Despite surgical repair or replacement
      of the mitral valve, many patients remain symptomatic with an impaired ability to live an
      active lifestyle. Often after extensive evaluation, no other pulmonary, left ventricular
      dysfunction, or valvular heart disease is responsible for the continued symptoms, and some of
      these patients will be limited by persistent pulmonary hypertension (PH) at rest or with
      exertion that is responsible for limiting their activity level and impacting their quality of
      their life.

      It is our goal in the proposed study to systematically characterize symptomatic and
      asymptomatic patients greater than six months after mitral valve surgery using clinical data,
      echocardiographic evaluation, laboratory assessment, and in some patients, invasive
      hemodynamic measurements. The investigators will screen asymptomatic and symptomatic patients
      with resting echocardiography and also with echocardiography during exercise, as many
      patients will exhibit exercise-induced PH following mitral valve surgery. Pulmonary artery
      (PA) pressure will be estimated from echocardiography using Doppler-derived calculations. If
      elevated PA pressures are observed with echocardiography, then symptomatic patients will
      undergo right heart catheterization for invasive pressure measurement, which is the
      gold-standard for the diagnosis of PH. When PH is present and there is a normal wedge
      pressure (PCWP) during invasive pressure measurement, further assessment to identify
      potential candidates for PH therapy will be performed. This involves having patients breathe
      inhaled nitric oxide, a rapid-acting, pulmonary vasodilator with a short half-life. While
      breathing inhaled nitric oxide, blood pressure, PA pressure, PCWP, and cardiac output will be
      monitored to characterize individuals who could benefit symptomatically from pharmacotherapy
      to treat underlying PH. It is important to note that only a small minority of patients
      exhibit a positive vasodilator response and those with PH and a normal PCWP without an
      initial vasodilator response would still be identified as candidates for chronic PH therapy.

      The information generated from this proposed research will make a significant contribution to
      the understanding of PH in a group of patients in whom it has not been previously studied.
      Scientific reports on the evaluation of patients with PH after mitral valve surgery are
      almost nonexistent from the modern era. Furthermore, patients with PH due to mitral valve
      disease have been excluded from clinical trials of agents currently approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PH. Therefore, this work will carefully characterize
      PA pressures in an objective manner in a group of patients following mitral valve surgery who
      remain limited with respect to their activity levels. In addition, the investigators will
      gain a better understanding of the frequency with which patients have PH and a normal PCWP,
      which identifies a cohort of patients who could have an improvement in their symptoms and
      quality of life with chronic vasodilator treatment.
