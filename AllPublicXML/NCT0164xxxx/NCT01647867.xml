  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our project, established through collaboration between clinicians (Oscar Lambret
      Center-University Hospital) and scientists (IBL), aims to evaluate the expression of Met
      fragments in the lung cancer (LC). Unlike previous studies on Met by sequencing, in situ
      hybridization or immunohistochemistry, the investigators propose a protein analysis by
      Western blot of tumor samples and healthy tissue. This approach will evaluate the expression
      of full-length receptor, the potential presence of intracellular fragments, and their
      phosphorylation status.

      -  Patient information and collection of signed inform consent

        -  Blood sample collection before bronchoscopy or before surgery, at the same time as a
           usual blood assessment.

        -  Prospective collection of bronchial biopsies of patients with metastatic non small cell
           lung cancer, during a bronchoscopy at the Oscar Lambret Center (Dr Dansin)

        -  Prospective collection of resected specimens of patients with localized non small cell
           lung cancer, who were operated at the thoracic surgery unit of the University hospital
           (Pr Porte)

        -  Transportation of the samples to the pathology laboratories (Dr Robin, Pr Copin)

        -  Selection of blocks of interest and preparation of tumor samples

        -  Clinical data collection : date of biopsy or surgery, disease-free survival, overall
           survival, tumor characteristics, EGFR status, ALK, BRAF, HER2

        -  Transportation of tumor blocks and blood samples to the Institute of Biology of Lille
           for analyses: Western blot, immunohistochemistry and ELISA test)

        -  Return to storage of the tumor samples at the Oscar Lambret Center and at the University
           hospital of Lille
