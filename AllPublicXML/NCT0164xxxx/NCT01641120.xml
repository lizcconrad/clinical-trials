    <measure>Change in Patient Visual Analog Scale Score for Pre-injection Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study was a change in patient self-reported 100 mm (10 cm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for pre-injection anxiety. VAS scale (min=0- max=100 mm (10cm)) 0= no anxiety; 100 mm (10 cm)=very severe anxiety.
Data from Weeks 2 and 3 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 30 gauge needle was used for injection. The 30 gauge needle VAS mean refers to the mean for pre-injection anxiety for that needle size.
Data from Weeks 4 and 5 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 25 gauge needle was used for injection. The 25 gauge needle VAS mean refers to the mean for pre-injection anxiety for that needle size.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale Score for Post-injection Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study was a change in patient self-reported 100 mm (10 cm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for post-injection pain.VAS scale (min=0 - max=100 mm (10 cm)) 0= no pain; 100 mm (10 cm)=very severe pain.
Data from Weeks 2 and 3 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 30 gauge needle was used for injection. The 30 gauge needle VAS mean refers to the mean for post-injection pain for that needle size.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoint was assessment of fear of injection based on patient questionnaires completed prior to each injection. The patient will respond to each statement on a scale which ranges from 1 (almost always) to 4 (almost never).
Data from Weeks 2 and 3 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 30 gauge needle was used for injection. Mean describes fear of injection for the 30 gauge needle.
Data from Weeks 4 and 5 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 25 gauge needle was used for injection. Mean describes fear of injection for the 25 gauge needle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of Needle</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoint was assessment of the perception of the needle based on patient questionnaires completed after each injection. The patient will respond to each statement on a scale which ranges from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree).
A total of 6 statements were given to the participant the more strongly the participant agreed with the statement, the more favorably they perceived the needle.
Data from Weeks 2 and 3 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 30 gauge needle was used for injection. Mean describes perception of the 30 gauge needle.
Data from Weeks 4 and 5 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 25 gauge needle was used for injection. Mean describes perception of the 25 gauge needle.</description>

        <title>Fear of Injection</title>
        <description>Secondary endpoint was assessment of fear of injection based on patient questionnaires completed prior to each injection. The patient will respond to each statement on a scale which ranges from 1 (almost always) to 4 (almost never).
Data from Weeks 2 and 3 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 30 gauge needle was used for injection. Mean describes fear of injection for the 30 gauge needle.
Data from Weeks 4 and 5 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 25 gauge needle was used for injection. Mean describes fear of injection for the 25 gauge needle.</description>

Data from Weeks 2 and 3 were combined and averaged to obtain a single value as both weeks a 30 gauge needle was used for injection. The 30 gauge needle VAS mean refers to the mean for post-injection pain for that needle size.
