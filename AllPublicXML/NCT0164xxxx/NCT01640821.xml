  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Québec government launched in October 2006 an action plan (PAG) to reduce the prevalence
      of overweight and obesity among young people and adults by 2012. One of the five priorities
      of the PAG is to improve health services for individuals with weight-related issues. The
      development and implementation of sustainable weight-control strategies however remains a
      challenge, since weight loss is often regained by the majority of individuals over time.
      &quot;Health-At-Every-Size&quot; (HAES) interventions, which are mainly focusing on health rather that
      weight, have been proposed as an interesting alternative for individuals, mainly women, who
      are struggling with weight-related issues. Based on the HAES, &quot;Choisir de maigrir?&quot; (CdM?)
      program has been clearly identified by the PAG as one of the actions for improving health
      services and Quebec's government has already started a massive dissemination of the CdM?
      program in CSSS of Québec. In that context, it becomes imperative to rapidly assess the
      effectiveness and readiness of the program for a broad dissemination. The present research
      proposal falls directly within the scope of the PAG recommendation and the investigators
      general objective is to develop a population-based understanding of the effectiveness of the
      CdM? program in Quebec's CSSS by documenting the effects of the program on women's health in
      a natural setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of &quot;CdM?&quot; will be assessed with each CSSS at three time points: at baseline (T=1),
      at the end of the intervention period (T=2), and at 1-y post-intervention (T=3). While data
      collection instructions and assessment materials will be provided by the research team,
      administration of the CdM? program will be totally under the responsibility of each CSSS, so
      that the program will occur outside of the research team control. Validated questionnaires
      will be used to assess nutritional profile, physical activity level, and psychosocial
      variables among the participants (N=168). Weight, height and waist circumference will also be
      measured for each participant. In order to ensure that our results are not due to the effect
      of time, women on a waiting list for CdM? program, will be recruited (N=84) for the
      short-term effect. All these data will be treated using sophisticated analyses strategies.

    <description>The program is conducted in small groups of 12 to 15 women for 14 weekly sessions (13 3h-evening sessions and 1 intensive-day session of 6 hours). Two health professionals (a registered dietician and a social worker or psychologist) lead the group. Sessions include lectures, guided self-examination and observations, group discussions, and practical exercises. Different topics are discussed during sessions such as enjoyment of physical activity and healthy nutrition, setting realistic objectives with regard to weight loss, and acceptation of their own and others' body image. A weekly food diary and group discussions are used to facilitate the recognition of internal cues of hunger and satiety and the identification of external influences on eating behaviors and food intake.</description>
