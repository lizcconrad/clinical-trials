      The whole body vibration offers better treatment adherence among the elderly, minimizing
      effort and additional stress to the cardiovascular system and skeletal muscles compared to
      conventional exercise programs.

      Hypothesis: Patients with COPD undergoing a training program on the whole body vibration show
      better performance in the 6MWT and improvement in muscle strength.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly and in COPD patients weight loss includes sarcopenia, resulting from aging
      itself or due to disuse or disease states associated with and represents the reduction in
      muscle mass, leading to decreased strength and endurance, with repercussions on the
      functional abilities of the same. It reduces the power and muscle strength with aging which
      represent decreasing to carry out daily physical tasks.

      In COPD, exacerbations worsen the loss of muscle mass, affecting the respiratory and
      peripheral muscles, exercise capacity and survival rates, and in the case of severe
      malnutrition in advanced cases of the disease, the implications of this state are disability
      which occur between 10-15% in those with mild obstruction and 25% in moderate to severe
      obstructive and are associated with worse prognosis.

      The whole body vibration could be an efficient combination of training methods for elderly
      patients and is based on the generation of sinusoidal vibrations offered by a platform, which
      stimulates the muscle spindles resulting in activation of neurons α engines and develop
      muscle contractions, presenting itself as an alternative to conventional treatment for
      muscular endurance as well as improving physical fitness

    <description>Exercises on the platform will be made in semi-squat position, static. In the first month training will be held for 10 minutes for the exercises on the platform, 30 seconds of vibration of low intensity, interspersed with rest 60 seconds while standing beside the platform. In the second month training will be held for 15 minutes, lasting 60 seconds of vibration and 30 seconds of rest in standing beside the platform. For the first two weeks training will have low intensity and the last two weeks training will have higher vibration. In the third month, training will be held for 20 minutes, 60 seconds of vibration and 30 seconds of rest while standing beside the platform. The intensity of the vibration will be high.</description>
