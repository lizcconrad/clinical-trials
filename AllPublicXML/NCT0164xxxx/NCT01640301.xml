    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of laboratory-treated T cells and to see how
      well they work in treating patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) that has returned after
      a period of improvement (relapsed), previously treated with donor stem cell transplant.
      Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, may stimulate the immune
      system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Placing a gene that has been
      created in the laboratory into a person's T cells may make the body build an immune response
      to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with treating patients with high
      risk or relapsed AML, MDS, and CML after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      by adoptive transfer of virus-specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8 T cells
      genetically-modified to express a high affinity Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)-specific T cell receptor
      (TCR).

      II. Determine the anti-leukemic activity associated with treating patients with relapsed AML,
      MDS and CML after allogeneic HCT by adoptive transfer of virus-specific CD8 T cells
      genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific T cell receptor (TCR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and ability to migrate to and
      accumulate in bone marrow.

      II. Determine the maintenance of TCR expression and function of transduced T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients with no evidence of leukemia post-HCT receive WT1-sensitized T cells
      intravenously (IV) over 45 minutes (or longer for patients who are 15-30 kg) on days 0 and 14
      and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 14-28.

      ARM II: Patients with evidence of AML (minimal residual disease or overt relapse) post-HCT
      receive cyclophosphamide IV and fludarabine phosphate IV daily on days -4 to -2. Patients
      also receive WT1-sensitized T cells IV over 45 minutes (or longer for patients who are 15-30
      kg) on days 0 and 21 and aldesleukin SC BID on days 14-28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, at weeks 6
      and 8, at 3, 6, 12 months, and then annually for up to 15 years.

             months of enrollment

             for cell therapy at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI)

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding; women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum or urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) pregnancy test result within

             non-childbearing potential will be defined as being postmenopausal greater than one
             year or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy; all recipients of

          -  DONOR: HIV or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) seropositive

          -  DONOR: Pregnancy or nursing

          -  DONOR: Significant medical conditions (e.g. immunosuppressive therapy) that would make
