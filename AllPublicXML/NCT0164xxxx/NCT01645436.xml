      The aim of this randomized controlled trial on Physical Activity and Pediatric Cancer (PAPEC)
      is to assess the impact of an exercise program intervention in pediatric cancer patients
      undergoing chemotherapy for solid tumors. The investigators hypothesized the intervention
      will have a beneficial effect on the study outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients, of both sexes, children will be recruited for this trial with an age range
      between 4 to 16 years old, undergoing treatment for primary tumors (excluding central nervous
      system tumors). Each participant will be assigned randomly (with blocking on sex) to either
      intervention or control (usual care) group.

      The intervention group will participate in combined inpatient physical training (aerobic +
      strength) over neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The intervention will include three weekly exercise
      sessions of 60-90 minutes, and will be held in child's room or in a pediatric gym
      specifically enabled on the aforementioned hospital, depending on the children's health
      status.

      Primary outcomes [cardio-respiratory capacity (peak oxygen uptake), muscle strength (6RM leg
      and bench press, and lateral row), functional capacity ('Timed Up and Down Stairs test', and
      '3 m and 10m Time Up and Go tests'), physical activity levels (determined by accelerometry)
      and quality of life &quot;Child Report Form of the Child's Health and Illness Profile-Child
      Edition&quot;, Adolescent Edition and Parents Report Form )] and secondary outcomes [immune
      function (immune cell subpopulations, natural killer cells' cytotoxicity), inflammatory
      profile (blood levels of 47 cytokines) and leukocyte telomere length] will be measured in
      both groups in the following time points:

      (i) before the exercise intervention (immediately after diagnosis and before the start of
      treatment); (ii) after the exercise intervention (upon termination of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy); and iii) after a detraining period (2 months after the intervention).
