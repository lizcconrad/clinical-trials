      Objective of this study is to investigate the intracameral level of ganciclovir following
      topical application of 0.15% ganciclovir gel (VIRGAN©) for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior
      uveitis and endothelitis. Thirty patients who are diagnosed with CMV anterior segment
      infection, either uveitis or endothelitis, who have a positive aqueous real time PCR (RT-PCR)
      and/or positive tetraplex PCR for CMV and have not had any form of ganciclovir treatment in
      the past 1 month, will be recruited in the study after taking an informed consent. with
      active CMV anterior segment infection confirmed by a positive aqueous real time PCR (RT-PCR)
      and have not had any form of ganciclovir treatment in the past 1 month were recruited in the
      study. Patients were given 0.15% ganciclovir gel 1cc 5 times a day for 6 weeks. Following 6
      weeks of treatment, tears and aqueous samples will be collected. Aqueous will be sent for
      RT-PCR for CMV status. Ganciclovir drug level in both tears and aqueous will be measured by
      HPLC method. Clinically, degree of the intraocular inflammation, Intraocular pressure (IOP)
      and central corneal thickness (CCT) will be recorded at baseline and post-treatment.
