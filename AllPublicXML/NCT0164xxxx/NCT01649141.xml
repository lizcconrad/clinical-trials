    <textblock>
      This effectiveness study is being conducted to determine whether Trauma-Focused Cognitive
      Therapy (TF-CBT), a treatment model developed in specialty clinics by experts in the
      treatment of child sexual abuse, can be effectively transported to a state-contracted
      community mental health agency in the state of Delaware and used effectively by clinicians
      with little prior TF-CBT experience. The sample is comprised of youths receiving public
      mental health services and with diverse trauma histories.

      This investigation aims to examine the effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (TF-CBT) in treating child traumatic stress when implemented in community settings on
      a state-wide level in Delaware. Youth (ages 7-16 years) with a history of documented trauma
      (sexual or physical abuse, traumatic loss, domestic or community violence) and symptoms of
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) receive approximately 10 sessions of TF-CBT delivered in
      a state-contracted mental health agency. Children and adolescents are recruited from a public
      mental health population. PTSD symptoms and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems
      have been assessed in the first 72 participants at pre-treatment and then at 3-, 6-, 9-, and
      12-months after intake; subsequent participants (n=38) are only being assessed for symptoms
      and problems at pre-treatment and then at 3-, 6-months after intake.

    <description>PTSD symptoms area assessed with the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV (UPID). The UPID (Pynoos, et al., 1998) includes 48 items that can be administered as a questionnaire or structured interview. The instrument's three sections assess for trauma exposure and symptoms of DSM-IV PTSD in children ages 7-18. The UPID has good convergent validity (i.e., 0.70 in comparison to the K-SADS, epidemiologic version), a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.87 in diagnosing PTSD (Steinberg et al., 2004), and test-retest reliability of 0.84 (Steinberg et al., 2004)</description>

    <description>Behavioral problems are assessed with the parent version of the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 (CBCL: Achenbach, &amp; Rescorla, 2001)\.The CBCL is a 113-item parent self-report measure used to assess children's emotional and behavioral problems and social competencies. The CBCL has been used with acceptable levels of reliability (range 0.84-0.98) and content and criterion validity to measure mental health problems of children ages 6-18 years from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2001).</description>

    <description>Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is a structured, 12-16 session outpatient intervention originally developed to treat Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and related emotional and behavioral difficulties in youth with a history of child sexual abuse. TF-CBT's eight components are delivered in 90-minute weekly sessions split evenly between children and their parents. These components are summarized by the acronym PRACTICE including: psychoeducation and parenting skills (P), relaxation (R), affective expression and regulation (A), cognitive coping (C), trauma narrative development and processing (T), in vivo gradual exposure (I), conjoint parent/child sessions (C) and enhancing safety and future development (E).</description>
