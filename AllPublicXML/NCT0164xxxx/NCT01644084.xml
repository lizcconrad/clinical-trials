  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is advantageous to use 5% human albumin (HA) in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB), because preexposure of the synthetic surfaces of the CPB circuit to albumin decreases
      coagulopathy, platelet aggregation, immune responses. However the use of albumin is limited,
      because it is expensive and can rarely cause infection.

      Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) decreases clot strength and prolong clot formation. A recently
      developed 6% HES 130/0.4 is known to have fewer effects on hemostasis. However Schramlo AA et
      al. reported that short time infusion of HES 130/0.4 after cardiac surgery produced
      impairment in fibrin formation and clot strength in thromboelastometry tracings.

      Coagulopathy is directly related to bleeding and massive postoperative bleeding increases the
      risk of reoperation. Therefore it is important to avoid administration of fluids that can
      inhibit homeostasis after CPB.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 6% HES 130/0.4 as a component of
      priming solution on coagulation compared to 5% HA.

    <description>The purspose of this study is to investigate the effect of 6% HES 130/0.4 as a component of priming solution on coagulation compared to 5% HA. Rotation thromboelastography (ROTEM) was performed before and 24 h after CPB. Hemoglobin, platelet count and transfusion requirement were assessed for 24 h postoperatively.</description>
