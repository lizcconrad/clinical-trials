  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the efficacy of cogniVida™ on learning and memory
      performance (executive function, associative, spatial and verbal memory) as well as on mood
      and attention parameters after four, eight and eleven weeks of supplementation and in
      comparison with placebo.

      cogniVida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is regulated like a food. The U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and dietary supplements. The investigators do
      not claim that this supplement is meant to treat any ailment.
