        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women age 18 years old (inclusive) and older

          -  Recent hospitalization at HFHS Main Campus hospital with one of the following
             diagnosis

          -  Stable angina with medical management

          -  Myocardial infarction (MI)/Acute coronary syndrome

          -  Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)

          -  Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery

          -  Heart valve surgical repair or replacement

          -  Patients must be attending outpatient CR program at the HFHS Detroit location.

          -  Willingness to participate in the study and follow study requirements

          -  Willingness to respond to several surveys at the baseline and periodically during the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active substance abuse per medical record

          -  Unstable psychiatric condition

          -  Inability to exercise

          -  Unstable medical condition that would prevent safe and regular exercise training

          -  Uncorrected Severe Aortic Stenosis or Severe Mitral Stenosis

          -  Inpatient referring physician feels that exercise in contra-indicated due to safety
             reasons or is ill advised due to other patient specific factors

          -  LVAD, Heart Transplant. Although these patients qualify for CR, HFHS is not recruiting
             them due to difficulty in coordinating with surgical patients and their providers. In
             addition, there may also be surgical issues (infection, wound dehiscence, bone healing
             etc) that may reasonably interfere with exercise.
