      Questions: Does an evidence-based exercise program increase activities of daily living and
      physical fitness in institutionalized older adults? Does this program decrease the care
      dependency of institutionalized older adults? Design: A randomized control trial using
      group-based exercise was performed in 14 assisted-living facilities for the elderly (&gt;70
      years old).

      Outcome measures: Outcome measures were performance on ADL, physical fitness, and care
      dependency measures. The exercise program comprised group-based progressive resistance
      training, balance training, and functional training. The control intervention comprised
      social group meetings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To improve physical fitness, a combined exercise program including progressive resistance
      training, balance training, and functional training will be used in a sample of
      institutionalized elderly people. The exercise program has a frequency of 2 times a week and
      a duration of 16 weeks. The intensity is moderate, measured on a 0-10 scale. The level of
      intensity is specified as follows: on a 10- point scale, where no movement is 0 and maximal
      effort of a muscle group is 10, moderate-intensity effort is a 5 or 6, and high- intensity
      effort is a 7 or 8. There is currently insufficient evidence that a combined exercise
      program, developed to improve physical fitness, can improve ADL performance and care
      dependency also.
