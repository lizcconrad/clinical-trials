    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dalantercept works in treating patients with endometrial
      cancer that has come back or is persistent. Dalantercept may stop the growth of endometrial
      cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer who
      survive progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have
      objective tumor response (complete or partial), treated with dalantercept (ACE-041).

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of dalantercept in this cohort of
      patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with
      persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer treated with dalantercept.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth
      factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β),
      activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), endoglin (CD105), and other markers via
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and determine if there is correlation between expression and
      clinical response to treatment.

      II. To determine the correlation between ALK1 gene expression, other markers, and clinical
      response to treatment.

      III. To determine the correlation between concentration of VEGF, bone morphogenetic protein 9
      (BMP9), bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10), and ALK1 in pre-cycle 1 plasma using an
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and clinical response to treatment.

      IV. To correlate somatic mutations in candidate genes with response to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dalantercept subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <time_frame>Scans to assess response were done every other cycle for the first 6 months; every three months thereafter; and any time if clinically indicated based on symptoms or physical signs suggestive of progressive disease. Responses must be confirmed.</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) and based on imaging done every other cycle. Responses can be either partial or complete. Per RECIST v1.1 target and non-target lesions are assessed by MRI or CT scan: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all lymph nodes must be &lt; 10 mm in short axis; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD.</description>

    <description>Treatment and Progression-free Survival is defined as the duration alive from study entry until progression is documented, death or non-protocol treatment is initiated; whichever comes sooner. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 5 mm absolute increase and a 20% relative increase in the sum of measurable target lesions' longest dimensions relative to the smallest sum at baseline or on study or the appearance of new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
Non-protocol treatment initiation prior to disease progression and prior to 6 months from study entry was counted as an event for treatment and progression-free survival at 6 months. Disease progression within 6 months of study entry or death within 6 months of study entry and prior to disease progression counts as an event for treatment and progression-free survival at 6 months.</description>

        <description>Response was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) and based on imaging done every other cycle. Responses can be either partial or complete. Per RECIST v1.1 target and non-target lesions are assessed by MRI or CT scan: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all lymph nodes must be &lt; 10 mm in short axis; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD.</description>
        <time_frame>Scans to assess response were done every other cycle for the first 6 months; every three months thereafter; and any time if clinically indicated based on symptoms or physical signs suggestive of progressive disease. Responses must be confirmed.</time_frame>

          <description>Response was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) and based on imaging done every other cycle. Responses can be either partial or complete. Per RECIST v1.1 target and non-target lesions are assessed by MRI or CT scan: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all lymph nodes must be &lt; 10 mm in short axis; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD.</description>

        <title>Treatment and Progression-free Survival at 6 Months</title>
        <description>Treatment and Progression-free Survival is defined as the duration alive from study entry until progression is documented, death or non-protocol treatment is initiated; whichever comes sooner. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 5 mm absolute increase and a 20% relative increase in the sum of measurable target lesions’ longest dimensions relative to the smallest sum at baseline or on study or the appearance of new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
Non-protocol treatment initiation prior to disease progression and prior to 6 months from study entry was counted as an event for treatment and progression-free survival at 6 months. Disease progression within 6 months of study entry or death within 6 months of study entry and prior to disease progression counts as an event for treatment and progression-free survival at 6 months.</description>
        <time_frame>CT scan or MRI were to assess progression every other cycle for the first 6 months; every three months thereafter; and any time if clinically indicated based on symptoms or physical signs suggestive of progressive disease</time_frame>

          <description>Dalantercept 1.2 mg/kg (maximum starting dose of 120 mg) subcutaneously once every three weeks. One cycle is defined as three weeks.
Patients weighing more than 100 kg start treatment at 120 mg, and if dalantercept is tolerated for 2 cycles (i.e. toxicities are tolerable, less than grade 2 and resolved), the patient can be dose escalated to dosing based on actual body weight.
A CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to assess response by RECIST 1.1 is required every two cycles. Treatment was to continue until disease progression or adverse effects prohibit further therapy.</description>
