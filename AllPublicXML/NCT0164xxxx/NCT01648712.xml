  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal anticoagulation is mandatory during CPB in order to avoid hemostatic system
      activation. Platelet dysfunction is commonly observed after procedures performed under
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This is associated with a major risk of thrombosis and bleeding
      in the postoperative period.

      Coating of the surface has been shown to diminish these effects.Biocompatible surfaces,
      extracorporeal circulation technologies mimic critical characteristics of the vascular
      endothelium to provide thromboresistance and enhanced blood compatibility. Recently, a new
      physiologic non heparin coating with different functional aspects was developed as an
      alternative to heparin based biological coatings. This bio-passive Hydrophilic Polymer
      Coating Without Heparin (BalanceTM Bio-Passive surface) and pediatric oxygenation system
      (Affinity PixieTM Oxygenation System), is designed to mimic the natural interfaces of blood.
      The aim of this study is to compare the influence of a Balance - coated CPB system in
      pediatric use versus the Carmeda TM heparin-coated system in platelet function preservation
      and hemostatic activation.

      Platelet dysfunction is commonly observed after procedures performed under cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB). This is associated with a major risk of thrombosis and bleeding in the
      postoperative period.

      Coating of the surface has been shown to diminish these effects. Since the coagulation system
      and platelets are involved in the blood activation process, a coating might be a valuable
      approach to inhibit the different reactions. Improving the biocompatibility of the system by
      reduction of contact activation of blood elements is of significant importance, especially
      for neonates and infants who are more susceptible to the deleterious effects of
      extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Biocompatible surfaces extracorporeal circulation
      technologies mimic critical characteristics of the vascular endothelium to provide
      thromboresistance and enhanced blood compatibility. These biocompatible surfaces mitigate the
      foreign body response that occurs when blood comes in contact with non- endothelial surfaces.

      Recently, a new physiologic non heparin coating with different functional aspects was
      developed as an alternative to heparin based biological coatings. This bio-passive
      Hydrophilic Polymer Coating Without Heparin (BalanceTM Bio-Passive surface) and pediatric
      oxygenation system (Affinity PixieTM Oxygenation System), is designed to mimic the natural
      interfaces of blood.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint will be the difference in levels of ß thromboglobulin (ß TG) at T2 (15 min after end of bypass) between the two groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Assuming a reduction of 30% of ß TG in infants treated with Balance TM , a total of 64 infants, 32 on each arm, will be needed to detect a Δ = 246 (mean ß TG = 820ng/ml in group Carmeda and mean ß TG =574ng/ml in group Balance; standard deviation=300) , in the level of ß TG at T2 with a two sided p=0.05 and a power of 80%.
Taking in to account the use of non parametric test, we estimated an increase of the calculated sample size of 15%, yielding a total sample size of 74 patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Platelet mapping by thromboelastography (Hemoscope, Medtronic) will be performed at the following times: T0,T1,T2,T3.</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Flow cytometry will be analysed at T0, T1,T2. Fibrinogen levels, platelet count, prothrombin time, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), F 1+2, PF4 , will be analysed at each time of the study.
Differences of bleeding, and transfusion of any blood product, during the first postoperative 24 hours, will be collected.
Analysis of differences of activation at different times, for two different temperatures, used for CPB in the two centers.
Need of surgical review for bleeding, time of intubation, length of stay in ICU will be analyzed.</description>
