  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine safety and effectiveness of the technique using autologous stem cells in the
      treatment of urinary incontinence in one male subject.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous stem cells will be obtained from the subject by needle biopsy, sent to a lab for
      multiplication and after about 6 weeks time will be injected into the subjects urethra.

    <measure>Quality of Life (QOL) Described by the Patient's Response on the Patient Global Assessment of Severity (PGI-S) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-S is comprised of two questions. Question 1 asks the patient to describe how their urinary tract condition is now. Responses are 1 Normal, 2 Mild, 3 Moderate and 4 Severe. Question 2 asks the patient &quot;If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that?&quot; Responses are 1 Delighted, 2 Pleased, 3 Mostly Satisfied, 4 Mixed, 5 Mostly Dissatisfied, 6 Unhappy and 7 Terrible.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QOL) Described by the Patient's Response on the Global Response Assessment (GRA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GRA measures overall improvement with therapy. The patient's response describes their current condition compared to before they were treated. Responses are: 1 Markedly Improved, 2 Moderately Improved, 3 Slightly Improved, 4 No Change, 5 Slightly Worse, 6 Moderately Worse, and 7 Markedly Worse.</description>

    <description>The PGI-I is a global index used to rate the response of a condition to a therapy. The patient's response describes their current condition compared to before they were treated. Responses are: 1 Very Much Better, 2 Much Better, 3 A Little Better, 4 No Change, 5 A Little Worse, 6 Much Worse, and 7 Very Much Worse.</description>

        <description>The GRA measures overall improvement with therapy. The patient's response describes their current condition compared to before they were treated. Responses are: 1 Markedly Improved, 2 Moderately Improved, 3 Slightly Improved, 4 No Change, 5 Slightly Worse, 6 Moderately Worse, and 7 Markedly Worse.</description>
