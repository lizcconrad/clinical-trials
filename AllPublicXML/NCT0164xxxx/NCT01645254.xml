  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to study the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of the
      decoction of the aerial parts of Argemone mexicana (AM), administered in healthy volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open non comparative safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study clinical trial. Healthy
      volunteers aged from 18 to 50 years old will be recruited and followed 42 days after
      treatment initiation as in the current World Health Organization malaria drug protocol
      efficacy assessment protocol.

      Each volunteer will be take oral Argemone mexicana in decoction formulation. For the PK
      assessment purposes, 3 groups have been constituted: (i) a group will receive a unique dose
      of with blood withdrawal scheduled at 0 hour, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hour ,
      8 hours and 12 hours. (ii) a group will receive two doses (morning and evening) of Argemone
      mexicana for 14 days with blood withdrawal scheduled at 0 hours, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours,
      4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days and 14 days. (iii) a group will
      receive two doses (morning and evening) of Argemone mexicana for 14 days with blood
      withdrawal scheduled at 0 hour, 12 hours, 14 hours, 16 hours, 18 hours, 20 hours, 22 hours,
      24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days and 21 days Safety will be assessed clinically (Clinical
      exam and Electrocardiography) and biologically (hematology and biochemistry parameters will
      be measured) throughout the 42 days of thefollow-up.
