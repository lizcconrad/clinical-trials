    <ipd_description>The ZEN study was only a feasibility study with 30 subjects enrolled to see if therapy for this indication was viable. Although the preliminary data showed slight applicability/effectiveness, and no safety concerns, from a business standpoint, Medtronic chose not to pursue a pivotal trial and submit a PMA.</ipd_description>
