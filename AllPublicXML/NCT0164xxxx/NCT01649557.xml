  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, 52 week, open label study to assess the safety and tolerability
      of oral OPC-34712 (1 to 6 mg) as monotherapy in adult patients with schizophrenia. The study
      will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Enrollment into the study will be drawn from
      eligible subjects who have completed participation in Study 331-07- 203 and who, in the
      investigator's judgment, would benefit from continued treatment with oral OPC-34712.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) During First 6 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a participant while enrolled in the trial, whether or not it was considered drug related by the investigator. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death or was life-threatening or required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an AE that started after start of study medication or an AE that continued from baseline and that worsened, was serious, was study medication related, or resulted in death, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of study medication.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With AEs in 52-Week Enrollers.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a participant while enrolled in the trial, whether or not it was considered drug related by the investigator. A SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death or was life-threatening or required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization. A TEAE was defined as an AE that started after start of study medication or an AE that continued from baseline and that worsened, was serious, was study medication related, or resulted in death, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of study medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Score of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) by Study Week and at the Last Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 52 and Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 that indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive subscale items, 7 negative subscale items, and 16 general psychopathology subscale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranges from 30-210, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression- Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 52 and Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness for each participant were rated using the CGI-S. To perform this assessment, the investigator were to answer the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill was the participant at that time?&quot; Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, 2, 6, 26, 52 and Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP was a validated clinician-rated scale that measured personal and social functioning in four domains: socially useful activities (e.g, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Impairment in each of these domains was rated as absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, or very severe. These ratings were then converted to a total score based on a 100-point scale using algorithms to identify the appropriate 10-point interval, and the rater's judgment that determined the total score within the 10-point interval. Participants with a PSP total score of 71 to 100 were considered to have mild functional difficulty. Scores of 31 to 70 represented manifest disabilities of various degrees and ratings of 1 to 30 indicated minimal functioning that required intense support and/or supervision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression- Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 52 and Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of study medication was rated for each participant using the CGI-I. The investigator rated the participants total improvement whether or not it was due to the drug treatment. All responses were compared to the participants condition at Screening/Baseline (i.e, Week 6 visit of Protocol NCT00905307). Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive Subscale Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 4, Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 52 and Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity is rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. In positive subscale, the 7 positive symptom constructs were: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS positive symptom score ranges from 7-49, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. In negative subscale the severity was rated for the following 7 negative symptom constructs: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking. The PANSS negative symptom score ranges from 7-49, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Positive Response Rate.</measure>
    <time_frame>Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was defined as a reduction of ≥ 30% from Baseline in PANSS total score or CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) at the Last Visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Score of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) by Study Week and at the Last Visit.</title>
        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 that indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive subscale items, 7 negative subscale items, and 16 general psychopathology subscale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranges from 30-210, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Total Score.</title>
        <description>The PSP was a validated clinician-rated scale that measured personal and social functioning in four domains: socially useful activities (e.g, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Impairment in each of these domains was rated as absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, or very severe. These ratings were then converted to a total score based on a 100-point scale using algorithms to identify the appropriate 10-point interval, and the rater’s judgment that determined the total score within the 10-point interval. Participants with a PSP total score of 71 to 100 were considered to have mild functional difficulty. Scores of 31 to 70 represented manifest disabilities of various degrees and ratings of 1 to 30 indicated minimal functioning that required intense support and/or supervision.</description>

          <description>The efficacy of study medication was rated for each participant using the CGI-I. The investigator rated the participants total improvement whether or not it was due to the drug treatment. All responses were compared to the participants condition at Screening/Baseline (i.e, Week 6 visit of Protocol NCT00905307). Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive Subscale Score.</title>
        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity is rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. In positive subscale, the 7 positive symptom constructs were: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS positive symptom score ranges from 7-49, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Negative Subscale Score.</title>
        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. In negative subscale the severity was rated for the following 7 negative symptom constructs: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking. The PANSS negative symptom score ranges from 7-49, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
