  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if preoperative strength training will result in
      faster recovery and higher level of function six weeks after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced strength of the quadriceps muscle is a common clinical finding in patients with Knee
      Osteoarthritis and this seems to play a central role in the development of the disease. The
      strength of the quadriceps muscle have been shown to be reduced by 20-40% as compared to
      age-matched healthy controls and this decrease in muscle strength have been closely
      associated with a reduced level of function and increase of pain. Furthermore, it has been
      demonstrated that the preoperative strength of the quadriceps muscle in patients undergoing
      TKA, is associated with the level of function one year after surgery. Compared to the level
      before the operation, an additional operation-induced reduction of the strength of the
      quadriceps muscle up to 60% as has been demonstrated. Presumably, an optimizing of the
      strength of the quadriceps muscle could counteract the impact of the expected postoperative
      loss of muscle strength to such an extent that the loss will be of less clinical
      significance. It is hypothesized that an optimizing of the strength of the quadriceps muscle
      may have a favorable effect on the postoperative rehabilitation program and shorten the
      period of convalescence.
