      This study is being done to determine the dose of a chemotherapy drug (irinotecan [irinotecan
      hydrochloride]) that can be tolerated as part of a combination of drugs. There is a
      combination of chemotherapy drugs often used to treat gastrointestinal cancer, which consists
      of 5-FU (fluorouracil), leucovorin (leucovorin calcium), irinotecan and oxaliplatin and is
      known as &quot;FOLFIRINOX&quot;. FOLFIRINOX is a current drug therapy combination (or regimen) used for
      people with advanced pancreatic cancer, although this combination is not Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved for this indication. FOLFIRINOX was recently shown in a
      separate clinical trial to increase survival compared to another commonly used drug in
      pancreatic cancer called gemcitabine. FOLFIRINOX is also a reasonable regimen for those with
      other advanced cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, including colon cancer, rectal cancer,
      esophagus cancer, stomach cancer, gall bladder cancer, bile duct cancer, ampullary cancer,
      and cancers with an unknown primary location. The best dose of irinotecan to use in
      FOLFIRINOX is not known. This study will analyze one gene (uridine 5'-diphospho [UDP]
      glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 [UGT1A1] gene) of subjects for the presence
      of an alteration in that gene, which may affect how the body handles irinotecan. Genes help
      determine some of the investigators individual characteristics, such as eye color, height and
      skin tone. Genes may also determine why people get certain diseases and how medicines may
      affect them. The result of the genetic analysis will divide subjects into one of three
      groups: A, B, or C. Group A (approximately 45% of subjects) will receive the standard dose of
      irinotecan. Group B (approximately 45% of subjects) will receive a lower dose of irinotecan.
      Group C (approximately 10% of subjects) will receive an even lower dose of irinotecan

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate in cycle #1 in each of two UGT1A1
      genotype groups (*1*1, *1*28) using genotype-guided dosing of irinotecan as part of the
      modified (m) FOLFIRINOX regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the cumulative dose intensity of irinotecan achieved in each genotype group.

      II. To determine the response rates by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      (version 1.1) for each different disease (pancreatic cancer, biliary cancers, gastric cancer,
      colorectal cancer, adenocarcinoma of unknown primary) treated in the study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV
      over 1.5 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46
      hours on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
