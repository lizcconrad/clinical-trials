  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate the performance of fluoride delivered from a new dentifrice
      formulation without potassium nitrate. It will also evaluate the dose-response to fluoride by
      testing four dentifrices covering a range of sodium fluoride concentration.

    <measure>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (%SMHR) Dose Response Relationship</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SMHR test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMHR was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1-R)/ (E1-B)]*100.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Relative Erosion Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in mineral content of enamel specimens exposed to dietary erosive challenge were determined by measuring the length of the indentations. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine relative erosion resistance which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent relative erosion resistance was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100.</description>

    <measure>Enamel Fluoride Uptake (Corrected Data)</measure>

    <description>Enamel fluoride uptake was determined using the microdrill enamel biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride uptake by enamel was calculated based on amount of fluoride divided by area of the enamel cores. Data analysis was based on corrected data.</description>

        <title>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (%SMHR) Dose Response Relationship</title>
        <description>SMHR test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMHR was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first erosive challenge (E1) using formula: [(E1-R)/ (E1-B)]*100.</description>

        <title>Percentage Relative Erosion Resistance</title>
        <description>Changes in mineral content of enamel specimens exposed to dietary erosive challenge were determined by measuring the length of the indentations. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine relative erosion resistance which compared the indentations values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), first erosive (E1) and second erosive challenge (E2). Percent relative erosion resistance was calculated by formula: [(E1-E2)/ (E1-B)]*100.</description>
