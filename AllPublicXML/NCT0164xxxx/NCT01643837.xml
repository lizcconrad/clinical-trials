    <textblock>
      There are many current medical treatments for mastalgia, but few have been proven effective.
      Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative treatment as
      compared to a light touch protocol and standard management in the treatment of women with
      cyclical and non-cyclical mastalgia. We will compare duration of the pain, severity of the
      pain and the effect of the pain on quality of life.

      Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) as
      compared to a light touch protocol and standard management in the treatment of women with
      cyclical and non-cyclical mastalgia (breast pain).

      A randomized placebo controlled study will be conducted at two academic health care centers.
      Women with breast pain will be evaluated and followed by the breast surgeon. Once a
      pathologic cause has been ruled out, the women will be stratified and randomly divided into
      three study groups. Group A, B, and C. Group A will receive standard of care treatment. Group
      B will receive light touch (a placebo for the OMT treatment). Group C will receive OMT
      directed at treating mastalgia. The treatment will continue for three months.

      The subjects will fill out an initial pain questionnaire and a follow-up questionnaire each
      month. They will also be instructed to fill out a breast pain log daily for three months. A
      final questionnaire will be completed at six months. Statistical analysis will be utilized to
      determine whether the addition of OMT improves the severity or duration of the pain as well
      as quality of life as assessed by the patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women over 18 years of age presenting with breast pain, both cyclical and noncyclical,
             who complain of pain despite a negative full work-up for pathology, reassurance, and
             use of an appropriate supportive bra.

          -  A pain scale questionnaire will be completed by the subject. The pain should be
             present for at least 7 days each month if it is mild pain or be of moderate to severe
             intensity for at least 3 days each month. In addition, breast pain must have been
             present for a minimum of 2 consecutive months preceding the date of inclusion into the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women under 18 years old, women who have had recent breast surgery (&lt;2yrs), women who
             have breast implants.
