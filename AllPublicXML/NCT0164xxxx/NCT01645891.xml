    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Continuous Diffusion
      of Oxygen (CDO) therapy for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of CDO in combination with standard moist wound
      therapy (MWT) on wound healing as compared to standard MWT alone.

    <description>The TransCu O2® device is a non-invasive, electrochemical tissue oxygenation system intended for use with lower-cost wound dressings for the treatment of chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and other skin wounds through the continuous diffusion of oxygen (CDO). The goal of CDO therapy is to continuously supply pure oxygen to an oxygen-compromised wound to aid in wound healing</description>
