      Assess the psychometric properties of the Endometriosis Symptom Diary (ESD) and the
      Endometriosis Impact Scale (EIS) and provide evidence whether the PRO measures are reliable,
      valid and able to detect changes over time in approximately 250 patients with mild, moderate
      or severe endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy.
