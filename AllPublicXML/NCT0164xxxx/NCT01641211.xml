      This is a feasibility study to determine whether the Expanding Networks for Latinos through
      Community Engagement (ENLaCE) can be used to recruit Latino children into a randomized,
      controlled trial (RCT) to improve their asthma medication device technique. Children will be
      recruited from two pediatric ENLaCE clinics in Greensboro and randomly assigned to watch
      device technique videos (experimental group; n=50) or a nutrition video (control group, n=50)
      in Spanish or English after a regularly-scheduled medical visit. Children's device technique
      will be assessed before and after the visit. Process evaluation data will also be collected.
      The investigators hypothesize that children in the intervention group will have better device
      technique post-intervention than the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma affects almost 10% of children and is the most common health condition reported by
      North Carolina public schools. Latino children have higher rates of uncontrolled asthma and
      more asthma-related emergency department visits than their White counterparts. No studies
      have evaluated Latino children's asthma device technique; poor technique can compromise
      medication delivery to the lungs.

      The TraCS engagement core has spent the last 18 months developing the Expanding Networks for
      Latinos through Community Engagement (ENLaCE) network, which is comprised of over 15
      organizations in the Greensboro area. The core would now like to conduct a feasibility study
      to determine whether ENLaCE can be used to recruit Latino children into a randomized,
      controlled trial (RCT) to improve their asthma medication device technique. This would be the
      first assessment of whether ENLaCE can be used to recruit patients.

      MEDUCATION, an NIH-funded project developed by Polyglot Systems, Inc., has developed asthma
      device technique videos in Spanish and English. The member groups of ENLaCE believe the
      MEDUCATION videos are highly relevant for the Greensboro Latino community. Children will be
      recruited from two pediatric ENLaCE clinics in Greensboro and randomly assigned to watch
      device technique videos (experimental group; n=50) or a nutrition video (control group, n=50)
      in Spanish or English after a regularly-scheduled medical visit. Children's device technique
      will be assessed before and after the visit. Process evaluation data will also be collected.

    <measure>Change in inhaler, turbuhaler, and diskus technique</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Children will demonstrate how they use their metered-dose inhalers, turbuhalers, and diskuses using empty devices. The research assistant will record the number of steps performed correctly. Correct use of inhalers, diskuses, and turbuhalers will be measured as continuous variables.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child inhaler self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Child inhaler self-efficacy will be measured as a continuous variable using 1 item from the Bursch asthma management self-efficacy measure, &quot;How sure are you that you can use your inhaler correctly?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Control Test is a 5-item questionnaire assessing asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, and the effect of asthma on daily functioning. Scores range from 5 (poor control) to 25 (complete control). Studies show that the Asthma Control Test is reliable, valid, and responsive to temporal changes in asthma control.</description>
