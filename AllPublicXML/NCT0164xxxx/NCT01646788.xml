  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the use of NMB's
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of obstructive lesions of
      Arteriovenous (AV) Dialysis Fistulae/Grafts.

             not use adequate contraception.

          2. Previous participation in another study with any investigational drug or device within
             the past 30 days.

          3. Life expectancy of less than 12 months or factors making clinical and/or angiographic
             follow-up difficult.

          4. Known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or structurally-related compounds.

          5. Severe reaction to contrast agents that cannot be adequately premedicated prior to
             procedure.

          6. Stenosis with corresponding thrombosis treated within 7 days before enrollment.

          7. Patient with known contraindications for aspirin or other anticoagulant/antiplatelet
             therapy.

          8. Infected grafts/fistulae.
