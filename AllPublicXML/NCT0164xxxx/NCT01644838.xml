  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is always considered to shorten the duration of delivery without compromising the mother
      and fetus by obstetrics. Hyoscine and Promethazine are used widely in hospital and research
      is very limited, with conflicting results regarding the efficacy of these two drugs. So the
      investigators decided to compare of effect of hyoscine N-butyl bromide and Promethazine on
      length of active phase of the first stage of labor.
