      Objectives:

      The purpose of this research was to assess modifications caused by a concurrent water
      exercise program on plasma nitrite (NO3), cerebral vascular resistance and cholesterol in the
      elderly and analyze the correlations between these variables after intervention.

      Methods The sample was composed of 40 women mean age 69,21 ±5,27 years old, divided into an
      intervention (WG) and control group (CG). It was to measure nitrite concentration (NO3) by
      the Griess reaction; internal cerebral arteries were assessed by Doppler ultrasound to
      determine the resistivity index and Cholesterol was determined using the colorimetric
      enzymatic method and test kit. Intervention with water exercise program consisted of three
      weekly sessions for 16 weeks.

    <description>For NO analysis, serum was separated from the erythrocyte mass. The material was centrifuged in a SIGMA 4k15 centrifuge at 3500 rpm and 18° for 10 minutes (LANEX laboratory- UFPI); the serum was then pipetted and frozen at 80° for evaluation after retesting (16 weeks). NO production was determined based on NO3 in the supernatant of cultured cells, an indirect measurement of NO synthesis.</description>

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Carotid and vertebral arteries were assessed by Doppler ultrasound, with GE Logiq 5 equipment and multi-frequency linear transducer (Milwaukee - UEA). Parameters used were evaluation of peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity of the common carotid and left and right internal carotids, with the angle of insonation corrected to 60°. The resistivity index of arteries was calculated, resulting from the mathematical formula in centimeters per second (cm/s): Resistivity index = Peak systolic velocity - End-diastolic velocity / Peak systolic velocity.</description>

    <description>The WG was submitted to a 16-week WEP, with combined aerobic and resistance exercises in three weekly sessions. Water temperature was approximately 30º C with an average ambient temperature of 34° C. The pool had water levels ranging between 1,20 and 1,40 meters deep.</description>
