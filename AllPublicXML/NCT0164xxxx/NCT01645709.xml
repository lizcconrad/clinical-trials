  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Intra-Articular (IA) verapamil in the treatment of
      joint pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Subjects will discontinue all analgesic
      medications for the entire duration of the study, except for acetaminophen (taken on an as
      needed basis at no more than 2 g/day). At visit 2, subjects who meet all entry criteria will
      be randomized to receive a single injection of IA verapamil or IA placebo at a ratio of 1:1.
      Treatments will be given with fluoroscopy or ultrasound to confirm needle placement. Subjects
      will be monitored for blood pressure and heart rate (sitting and standing) for at least 1
      hour post-injection. Subjects will be evaluated at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 after
      treatment.

             steroids within 4 weeks prior to screening.
