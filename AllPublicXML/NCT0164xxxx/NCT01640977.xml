  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective non-concurrent controlled observational evaluation of short-term
      operative results. As such, study sites will capture perioperative (through 6-week
      postoperative follow-up) case data associated with 10 standard open PLIF (posterior lumbar
      interbody fusion) procedures. After this open experience, these same sites will capture the
      corresponding data from 10 subsequent cases where the MAS (Maximum Access Surgery) PLIF
      variant was performed. The data from both series of cases will be compiled to identify
      similarities and differences between the techniques.

      The objective of this evaluation is to collect and compare short-term factors related to the
      morbidity of approach using traditional posterior-approach interbody fusion techniques and a
      less invasive exposure for the same procedure. Perioperative measures and early outcomes will
      be documented to demonstrate differences in procedural requirements, safety, and early
      recovery. A total of 100 subjects will be consecutively enrolled in this prospective study
      from as many as 8 centers. Patients who, in the surgeon investigator's opinion, require
      instrumented lumbar interbody fusion and have consented to PLIF surgery for their conditions
      will be included. The following eligibility criteria are designed to identify existing clinic
      patients for whom study under this protocol is considered appropriate. All subjects must meet
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to be considered for enrollment.

    <description>The PLIF procedure achieves access to the degenerated disc from the back of the spine, and is performed through a single midline posterior incision that is typically expanded bilaterally past the facet joints to expose bony landmarks for pedicle screw fixation, which are traditionally placed in a trajectory from lateral to medial, requiring a more lateral starting point.</description>

    <arm_group_label>MAS PLIF</arm_group_label>
    <description>The MAS PLIF technique is a minimally invasive variant of the traditional PLIF procedure. It is similarly performed through a single midline posterior incision but is conducted through a more medialized posterior approach, avoiding the far lateral exposure typical of the traditional PLIF.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must meet all inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into this
             observational study:

               1. Indicated for posterior lumbar interbody fusion at one or two contiguous motion
                  segments between L1 and S1;

               2. 18+ years of age at the date of written informed consent;

               3. Able to undergo surgery based on physical exam, medical history and surgeon
                  judgment;

               4. Willing and able to return for post-treatment exams according to the follow-up
                  called for in the protocol;

               5. Signed and dated informed consent form.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in this
             observational study:

               1. Mental or physical condition that would limit the ability to comply with study
                  requirements;

               2. Spine abnormality requiring treatment at more than two levels;

               3. Prior surgery at operative or adjacent level(s);

               4. Involvement in active litigation relating to the spine (worker's compensation
                  claim is allowed if it is not contested);

               5. Significant general illness (e.g., HIV, active metastatic cancer of any type,
                  uncontrolled diabetes, dialysis dependent renal failure, symptomatic liver
                  disease);

               6. Participating in another clinical study that would confound study data.
