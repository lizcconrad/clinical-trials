    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the toxicity and safety of carboplatin administered by
      convection enhanced delivery into the tumor in patients with high grade glial neoplasms. This
      study is a dose escalating study, (the dose of the study drug is increased at set time
      points). Carboplatin is in a class of drugs known as platinum-containing compounds; it slows
      or stops the growth of cancer cells in your body. Convection enhanced delivery involves
      placing one or more catheters into the brain and delivering chemotherapy through those
      catheters directly into the brain

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose and define the toxicity profile of carboplatin
      delivered intracerebrally via convection enhanced delivery (CED) for patients with high grade
      glial neoplasms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the efficacy as defined by six-month progression free survival (PFS), median
      progression free survival, overall survival, and the radiographic response rate.

      II. Evaluate the drug distribution.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo craniotomy and then receive carboplatin intracerebrally via
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over 72 hours.
