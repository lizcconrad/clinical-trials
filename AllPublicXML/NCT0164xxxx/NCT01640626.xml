  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a sever lack in application of health education intervention for Soil Transmitted
      Disease (STH) in rural communities and in school children among Orang Asli in Pahang in
      Malaysia, and also there is a lack of information on the effect of different health education
      aspects on STH control in Malaysia, so the investigators think that introducing such new
      national educational package and for the first time in Malaysian's school will help children
      to make some behavior changes specially for the school children aiming to use these children
      as an educator agents to their families and preschool brothers and sisters, to build a base
      for this issue and to reduce STH intensity in these rural areas, which in turn will determine
      the best approach to health education intervention to be applied to other rural areas in
      Malaysia.

  <detailed_description>

      The World Health Organization established that infections with STH among schoolÂ¬children
      cause malnutrition, intellectual retardation and cognitive and educational deficits.

      Although school-based intervention specifically the deworming antihelminths drugs programme
      were introduced into school but still Orang Asli villages in Malaysia having a high intensity
      and higher prevalence rate for STH, therefore the objective of this article was to review
      other intervention means mainly the health education intervention into school children and
      rural community, where most of these studies concluded that health education intervention was
      successful in increasing knowledge and changing some of practices among people and children
      which in turn decreases the prevalence and intensity of the STH. Also we think applying such
      intervention in Malaysia would be a benefit to change knowledge and attitude towards STH, and
      it will be the first research study to be applied in this field.
