      The main objective of the study is to verify the reliability of the solutes volumes issued by
      the Debiotech JewelPUMPTM controlled by its remote.

      Three clinical sites are participating in this study:

        -  CHSF, Service of Endocrinology and Diabetology, CORBEIL-ESSONNES (91): Dr. Guillaume
           CHARPENTIER, Dr. Sylvia FRANC

        -  Grenoble University Hospital, Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes Diseases, Nutrition,
           GRENOBLE (38): Pr Pierre-Yves BENHAMOU

        -  CHU Jean Minjoz, Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology, BESANCON (25): Professor
           Alfred PENFORNIS, Dr. Annie CLERGEOT

      The study will be conducted in 20 patients with type 1 diabetes treated by external insulin
      pump. Patients will be informed of the study during a screening visit. After signing the
      informed consent, they will return to the center where they will wear a JewelPUMPTM
      containing saline water, they will use their pumps in parallel. The investigator or nurse
      education will form the operation of the JewelPUMPTM and they will be instructed to replicate
      the same settings between their usual and JewelPUMPTM pump. The patient will be asked to
      complete visual analog scales of satisfaction with their usual treatment and the various
      elements of the devices (usual pump, and JewelPUMPTM) have been weighed using a precision
      balance to have a form of a base for comparison.

      Patients will leave home for a period of about three days, but they will have to come back
      every days to the center. They will be asked to collect all events arising (programming
      problems to deliver a bolus, hardware failure ...) in a booklet.

      At the end of study visit, patients will return to the center where the volumes will be
      assessed by the perfused weighed the various components and devices where they will complete
      the visual analog scales of satisfaction at endpoint.

    <description>The study will be proposed during the visit of selection.
Visit of inclusion:
This visit will take place after having received the consent of the patient. Women will be asked to achieve a pregnancy test. Patients will wear a JewelPUMP containing saline solution in parallel with their usual insulin pump. They will be trained to use JewelPUMP.
Patients treated with insulin pump will be instructed to reproduce the same &quot;programming&quot; between their usual pump and the JewelPUMP, they will use in parallel.
Volume infused will be evaluated during a period of basal and bolus with a precision scale.
Patient monitoring: Patient have to come back to the centre every 24 hours for 3 days. Study visit:
Patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire of satisfaction to the JewelPUMPTM and Visual scales.
Volume infused will be evaluated with a precision scale, by comparison of weight of JewelPUMP and patients' usual pump</description>
