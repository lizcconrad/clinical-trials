    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to track outcomes and complications of patients at IUMC referred
      by physicians for EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation. This information is essential in order
      to disseminate future published information to physicians about this technique. A database
      will be created to track these patients undergoing an already scheduled/planned procedure.
      Phone calls at selected intervals will be made following the procedure to track any
      complications that occur

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cysts represent a wide spectrum of lesions. Many cysts are uniformly benign
      (pseudocysts) or have negligible malignant potential (serous cystadenomas). However, others
      represent premalignant (i.e. intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) or mucinous
      cystadenomas [MCN]), or malignant (i.e. invasive IPMNs or mucinous cystadenocarcinomas)
      tumors. Management of pancreatic cysts is challenging but surgery is generally recommended
      for cysts that are symptomatic, premalignant (except possibly branch duct IPMNs) or
      demonstrate malignancy by imaging features and/or biopsy. However, even in experienced
      hospitals, surgical resection or enucleation of pancreatic cystic tumors is associated with
      significant perioperative morbidity and mortality rates of 20-40% and up to 2%, respectively.

    <description>1. Patients will undergo EUS-guided cyst ablation with ethanol +/- paclitaxel as indicated for their scheduled procedure. 2. Patients will return 3 months after initial ablation for a repeat EUS, and ablation will be repeated if cyst size is &gt;10mm in diameter. 3. CT or MRI imaging will be performed 3 months after the second procedure to assess for cyst resolution.</description>
