    <textblock>
      Non operated cervix cancer are usually treated by radio-chemotherapy. Non control local rate
      is inexplicably close to 30%. However, important volume of those tumors and their hypoxia
      degree induce phenomenon of pathologic angiogenesis, explaining these therapeutic failures.

      Persistence of tumor hypoxia could be a predictive factor of local control

    <textblock>
      HPV linked cervix cancer is the second most prevalent form of female cancer. It's also the
      leading cause of death by cancer in Asia, South America and Africa. Hopefully, screening
      program lead to a 50 % of mortality reduction during the past 40 years. Classic therapeutic
      strategy consists of external pelvic radiation therapy associated with chemotherapy and
      followed by brachytherapy. Curative surgical removal is realized 4 to 6 weeks after radiation
      therapy. However relapse rate is frequent (20 to 30%). Biological mechanisms involved in this
      high relapse rate are not understood.

      Nevertheless, it is suggest that initial hypoxia of cervix tumor during 20 Gy radiation
      therapy is a pejorative prognostic factor. At the opposite, the amelioration of tumor
      vascularisation during 20 Gy radiation therapy is a positive prognostic factor. It's possible
      that an amelioration of hypoxia lead to lesser tumor resistance to radiotherapy. However such
      possibility has to be test during clinical trial.

      Thus, the objective of ANOXICOL study is to evaluate the predictive value of persistent
      hypoxia, during 20 Gy radiation therapy associated with chemotherapy, for local control of
      cervix cancer.
