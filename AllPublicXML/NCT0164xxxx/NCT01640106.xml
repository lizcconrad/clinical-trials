  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary (pilot) data regarding the
      feasibility of using dietary omega-3 supplementation in children with significant delays in
      language skills; a related secondary objective is to compare adherence to a dosage schedule
      of two easy-to-take formulations. A tertiary objective of this study is to collect
      preliminary (pilot) data pre- and post-supplementation to identify potential improvement of
      skills in a specific area of language development.

      HYPOTHESIS Hypothesis 1: Children with early developmental impairment in language will
      successfully take daily omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for a well-defined period of time
      (3 months); Hypothesis 2: Children with early developmental impairment will better adhere to
      administration of a small quantity of slightly fishy-tasting oil than to a large quantity of
      sweet-tasting paste; Hypothesis 3: A 3 month period of daily omega-3 supplementation will
      produce some improvement in fast-mapping language skills (a dynamic vocabulary learning skill
      that has been shown to rapidly improve after exposure to beneficial intervention).

    <measure>Change over 3 months in learning assessed by a fast-mapping task</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at time of diagnosis and 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A simple &quot;fast-mapping&quot; task, which is a measure of language learning used widely in linguistics research, will be performed in the pre and post-intervention period. We will present a list of non-words selected with only early-developing sounds to ensure that they are within the repertoire of developmentally impaired children. Scores are calculated in terms of number of items successfully completed. An initial and final assessment of dynamic language learning will be done as an addendum to scores on standardized language tests that establish a language impairment diagnosis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of fish oil vs. chewable Concordix paste</measure>
    <time_frame>Given for 3 months as intervention</time_frame>
    <description>In order to estimate the relative success of administering paste vs. oil in relation to omega-3 vs. placebo, a repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test for significant differences. The primary measure will be parental report as &quot;easy&quot; vs. &quot;difficult&quot; to administer, and the analysis will be run as Between group (paste vs. oil) by Treatment arm (omega-3 vs. placebo) by Adminstration success (easy vs. difficult).</description>
