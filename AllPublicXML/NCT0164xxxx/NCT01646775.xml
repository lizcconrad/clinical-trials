      Background: For cancer to grow and metastasize, inflammatory and immunologic conditions in
      the host must be favorable. The perioperative period provides inflammatory and immunologic
      changes that may be pro-malignant. Anesthetic medications, including the use of opioid
      medication, may contribute to these changes.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that perioperative immunologic changes in patients
      undergoing resection of hepatic colorectal cancer recurrence, as measured by natural killer
      cell function and cytokine levels, will undergo less alterations in those who receive only
      epidural bupivacaine, as compared to those who receive epidural bupivacaine and fentanyl.

      Methods: In this double blind control trial patients with no extra-hepatic evidence of
      cancer, undergoing a planned curative resection of hepatic recurrence of colorectal cancer,
      will be randomized to receive an epidural with bupivacaine and fentanyl, or bupivacaine
      alone. No other perioperative opioid medication will be given, and post-operative analgesia
      will be supplemented with acetaminophen and gabapentin. Blood samples and pain ratings using
      a verbal analogue scale will be obtained preoperatively, immediately and 6 hours
      postoperatively, and then daily until removal of the epidural catheter. Samples will be
      analyzed for levels of interleukin 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 17,TNF-α, TGF α and β, MCP-1, CRP,
      and NK cell activity. Cytokines will be measured using a suspension bead array immunoassay
      kit, and NK activity will be measured using flow cytometry of isolated peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells exposed to the K562 cell line and treated with fluorescent antibodies to
      intracellular markers of activation. Data will be compared between groups using t-tests, or
      Mann-Whitney tests as appropriate. To demonstrate a 50% smaller decrease of NK cell activity
      in the bupivacaine group as compared to the bupivacaine and fentanyl group the investigators
      will need to randomize a total of 30 patients.
