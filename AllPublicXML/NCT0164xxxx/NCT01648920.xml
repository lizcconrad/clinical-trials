      asthma

      Number of participants: Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled

      Reference product: NIOX MINO® Instrument (09-1100)

      Performance assessments: FeNO measurements will be performed according to the &quot;Perform FeNO
      Measurement&quot; guidelines on page 7 of the NIOX MINO® User Manual. MCC testing will be
      performed according to the ATS guidelines and the allergy and asthma specialists procedure
      for conducting MCC tests

      documentation of events meeting the definition of an Adverse Event (AE) and/or Serious
      Injuries as provided in this clinical investigation plan from the time that informed consent
      has been provided and during the study period

      Criteria for evaluations: This is an exploratory study and there are currently no plans for a
      formal statistical analysis. Information gained from this study may used to design and power
      subsequent studies in patients with suspected but undiagnosed asthma. Information collected

      INTRODUCTION

      Overview:

      The measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is the only clinical test for measuring airway
      inflammation that can be performed consistently and accurately in clinical practice at the
      point-of-care. Airway inflammation is now recognized as the central mechanism in the
      pathogenesis of asthma. The measurement of FeNO with the NIOX MINO® device provides a rapid,
      noninvasive, and inexpensive tool to assess airway inflammation in inflammatory airway
      diseases such as asthma. The test is easy to perform and requires minimal training for the
      operator to conduct the test.

      Role of Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO):

      FeNO has evolved as a predictive and prognostic biomarker for airway inflammation. Nitric
      oxide (NO) gas is produced in the epithelial cells of the bronchial wall as an intrinsic part
      of the inflammatory process.

      Measuring the amount of FeNO is useful in the initial assessment of patients with chronic
      cough or non-specific respiratory symptoms suggestive of asthma, and for the management of
      patients with established asthma who are receiving corticosteroid treatment.

      Intended Use:

      NIOX MINO® measures Nitric Oxide (NO) in human breath. Nitric Oxide is frequently increased
      in inflammatory processes such as asthma. The fractional NO concentration in expired breath
      (FeNO) can be measured by NIOX MINO® with assurance that such measurements are repeatable and
      according to guidelines for NO measurement established by the American Thoracic Society.

      Rationale for Study:

      The burden of asthma in the U.S. is significant and growing. In addition, it has been
      established that asthma is both over- and under- diagnosed. Equally concerning is the fact
      that nearly 75% of these misdiagnosed patients are receiving anti-asthma treatments. Data
      such as these point out the need for a simple, inexpensive and reliable way to establish the
      diagnosis of asthma.

      Presently, the assessment of patients with suspected but undiagnosed asthma is to perform
      Methacholine Challenge (MCC) testing to evaluate airway hyperresponsiveness. However, MCC,
      testing is difficult, time-consuming, and costly and also involves some level of risk to the
      patient. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that FeNO testing may be able to identify the
      patients who actually have asthma among those with suspected but undiagnosed asthma who have
      normal pulmonary function tests, thus potentially eliminating the need for MCC testing in
      many patients.

      CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVES To explore the utility of FeNO compared with MCC in
      assessing patients with suspected but undiagnosed asthma.

      CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN

      This is an exploratory, multi-center, single-visit, outpatient study. Approximately 50
      subjects will participate in the study during an (approximately 8-16 week study enrollment
      period:

        -  Demographics

        -  Physical Characteristics

        -  Smoking history (cigarettes only)

        -  FeNO

        -  Spirometry

        -  Asthma and Allergy Specialists MCC Test Procedure

      Subject discharge from the study:

      Once all information has been collected and all procedures have been performed, the subject
      will be discharged from the clinic and their study participation will be complete

      Medical device:

      The NIOX MINO® was initially cleared by the FDA on March 4, 2008 as a new hand-held device
      for the measurement of exhaled Nitric Oxide, a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation.
      The most recent clearance by the FDA was on September 2, 2010 for Instrument (09-1100), which
      will be used in this study. NIOX MINO® can be used in children 7-17 years of age and in
      adults 18 years of age or older in the initial assessment and management of asthma.

      The NIOX MINO® is a 10 second test based on exhaled breath measured at a 50 ml/second flow
      rate. Results are provided at the point of care within 2 minutes after the successful
      completion of the breath test. The test cannot be influenced by patient effort or variations
      in the clinician's test technique.

      Definitions:

      Adverse event: Any incident where the use of a medical device (including in vitro
      diagnostics) is suspected to have resulted in an adverse outcome in a patient.

      Serious Injury means injury or illness that:

        -  Is life-threatening

        -  Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body
           structure, or

        -  Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body
           function or permanent damage to a body structure.

      Malfunction: the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise
      perform as intended.

      Caused or contributed: the death or serous injury was or may have been attributed to a
      medical device, or that the medical device was or may have been a factor in a death or
      serious injury, including events occurring as a result of:

        -  Failure

        -  Malfunction

        -  Improper or inadequate design

        -  Manufacture

        -  Labeling

        -  User error

        <description>Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) measurements will be performed according to the &quot;Perform FeNO Measurement&quot; guidelines on page 7 of the NIOX MINO® User Manual (February, 2011). Methacholine Challenge (MCC) tests will be performed according to the ATS guidelines and the Allergy and Asthma Specialists Procedure for conducting MCC tests. Values from the two tests will be compared against final asthma diagnosis. A positive response to methacholine challenge is defined as a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in FEV1 at a methacholine dose less than or equal to 16mg/ml from baseline in response to methacholine. A negative response to methacholine challenge is defined as a less than 20% decrease in FEV1 at a methacholine dose less than or equal to 16mg/ml from baseline.</description>

Methacholine Challenge (MCC) tests were performed according to the ATS guidelines and the Allergy and Asthma Specialists Procedure for conducting MCC tests. Values from the two tests will be compared against final asthma diagnosis. Positive predictive value is a way of saying the likelihood a positive test means you have a disease. In this study, it is defined as the percentage of study participants with a high FeNO who have asthma.</description>
