  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of a short-term low calorie diet on
      patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 25 who are undergoing liver surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of a low calorie diet on intra-operative blood loss, technical ease of hepatic transection, complication rates (including infectious complications), length of stay and mortality in patients undergoing liver surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-operative blood loss will be strictly quantified. Units of autologous or donor blood transfused will be recorded. The surgeon will assess the ease of liver mobilization and parenchymal transection using a 1-5 scale where 1 is easy and 5 is hard. Post-operative complications, length of stay and mortality will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of a low calorie diet on steatosis and steatohepatitis.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Using tissue from hepatic parenchyma adjacent to resected neoplasms steatosis and steatohepatitis will be evaluated by a pathologist blinded to dietary intervention. Steatosis will be defined as mild, moderate or severe if 5-33%, 34-66%, or &gt;66% of hepatocytes contain fat inclusions. Steatohepatitis will be defined using NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) Activity Score (NAS) as an NAS 4 or greater, with &lt;4 defined as no steatohepatitis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The mechanism of decreased steatosis in patients undergoing a low-calorie pre-op diet by measuring levels of expression of molecules involved in the de novo synthesis, hepatic uptake and degradation of lipids.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of expression of molecules involved in the de novo synthesis, hepatic uptake and degradation of lipids will be measured to evaluate the mechanism of decreased steatosis.</description>
