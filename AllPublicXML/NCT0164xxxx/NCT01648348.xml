    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of
      anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 when given together with bevacizumab and to see how
      well they work in treating patients with glioblastoma multiforme that has come back.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 and bevacizumab, may
      find tumor cells and help kill them. Giving anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 together
      with bevacizumab may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TRC105 (anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody
      TRC105) combined with bevacizumab in this patient population. (Phase I) II. To assess the
      safety and adverse events of TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab in this patient
      population. (Phase II) III. To determine the efficacy of TRC105 in combination with
      bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma as measured by progression-free survival and compare it
      with the efficacy of bevacizumab alone in this patient population. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients, who are progression free at 6 months, treated with
      TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab as compared to bevacizumab alone. (Phase II) II. To
      assess the overall survival of patients treated with TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab
      compared to bevacizumab alone. (Phase II) III. To compare the impact of the treatment on the
      patients quality of life (QOL) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ)-C15-Palliative Care (PAL) and QLQ-brain
      neoplasm (BN)20 Patient Questionnaires. (Phase II) IV. To estimate patient recommendations
      for study participation to others using the Was It Worth It (WIWI) Questionnaire. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TRC105. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the immunogenicity
      of TRC105. (Phase I) III. To determine the relationship between tumor biomarkers, circulating
      biomarkers of vascular response and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor
      (VEGFR) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in predicting efficacy and/or toxicity of
      treatment. (Phase II) IV. To assess the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging
      including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a predictor of response and survival.
      (Phase II) V. To assess the utility of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI as a predictor of
      response to bevacizumab with or without TRC105. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105,
      followed by a randomized phase II study.

      Phase I (closed to accrual 1/14/14): Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over
      30-90 minutes on day 1 and anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 IV over 1-4 hours on days
      8 and 11 of course 1 and days 1 and 8 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 14 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and anti-endoglin
      monoclonal antibody TRC105 IV over 1-4 hours on days 8 and 11 of course 1 and days 1 and 8 of
      all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>MTD for this study will be defined as the highest safely tolerated dose level where at most 1 out of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) with the next higher dose having at least 2 patients out of a maximum of 6 patients experience DLT.

    <time_frame>The time from study randomization to documentation of disease progression, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival time is defined as the time from study randomization to documentation of disease progression. Patients who die without documentation of progression will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of death. Patients who fail to return for evaluation after beginning therapy will be censored for progression on the last day of therapy or date last known to be alive, whichever is later. Patients who are still alive and have not progressed will be censored for progression at the time of the last tumor assessment. The time-to-progression distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>MTD for this study will be defined as the highest safely tolerated dose level where at most 1 out of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) with the next higher dose having at least 2 patients out of a maximum of 6 patients experience DLT. A total of 6 patients treated at the MTD will be sufficient to identify common toxicities at the MTD. The number of DLT's will be reported here.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Phase II)</title>
        <description>Progression Free Survival time is defined as the time from study randomization to documentation of disease progression. Patients who die without documentation of progression will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of death. Patients who fail to return for evaluation after beginning therapy will be censored for progression on the last day of therapy or date last known to be alive, whichever is later. Patients who are still alive and have not progressed will be censored for progression at the time of the last tumor assessment. The time-to-progression distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life (QOL) as Assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL Questionnaire [Item 15: Global Health Status/Quality of Life] (Phase II)</title>
        <description>Quality of Life (QOL) as assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C15-PAL questionnaire, as measured by the change from baseline to the end of cycle 2 (4 weeks) in the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL item 15, Global health status/quality of life, score. The assessment was scored using EORTC’s scoring algorithms. The score range is from 0-100 (0 corresponding to worst outcome; 100 corresponding to best outcome). Range of the change in scores from baseline to cycle 2 (4 weeks) is (-100,100). The mean change in score and 95% confidence interval of the change from baseline to the end of cycle 2 (4 weeks) are reported below.</description>

        <description>QOL assessed by EORTC-QLQ-BN20 Patient Questionnaire (Brain cancer module), as measured by the change from baseline to the end of cycle 2 (4 weeks) in the EORTC QLQ-BN20 Items 1-20 are used to score the following 11 symptom scales: Future uncertainty (Items 1-3,5), Visual disorder (Items 6-8), Motor dysfunction (Items 10,15, 19), Communication deficit (Items 11-13), Headaches (Item 4), Seizures (Item 9), Drowsiness (Item 14), Itchy Skin (Item 17), Hair Loss (Item 16), Weakness of legs (Item 18), and Bladder control (Item 20). The assessment was scored using EORTC's scoring algorithms. The score range for each of the 11 symptom scales is from 0-100 (0 corresponding to not severe;100 corresponding to most severe).

      <desc>The revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All graded AEs are reported. Cancels in the Participant Flow table did not receive treatment. Serious AE (SAE) reports for this study may include any secondary serious or non-serious events considered related to the primary event (the reason for filing an expedited report); collectively, these events are referred to as Expedited Adverse Events (EAEs), and appear in the SAE table.</desc>
