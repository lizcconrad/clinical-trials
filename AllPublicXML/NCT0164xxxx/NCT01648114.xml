  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an educational intervention for pregnant women who are
      planning to breastfeed to promote exclusive breastfeeding and to increase the duration of
      breastfeeding.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will include a 20 to 30-minute one-to-one educational talk by a lactation
      expert explaining the facts of breastfeeding and answering participant questions. The
      educational intervention will focus on: (1) the importance of exclusive breastfeeding, (2)
      milk supply/demand and feeding on demand, (3) frequency of feedings, feeding cues, how to
      know an infant is getting enough milk, (4) avoiding artificial nipples until the infant is
      nursing well, (5) the importance of a good latch, (5) where to seek breastfeeding help and
      support, and (7) returning to work and continuing breastfeeding.
