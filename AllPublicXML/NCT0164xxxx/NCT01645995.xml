  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific policies on obesity reduction often include a recommendation to reduce sugar
      consumption as a means of lowering overall caloric intake. Reformulating processed foods
      (e.g. sugary products) is considered one of the key options for improving population diet.
      The implications of regular consumption of reformulated products are not fully understood.
      Previous studies have demonstrated that dietary compensation is common, although the extent
      is not fully elucidated. In addition to the perceived impact of sugar consumption on weight
      control, high sugar intake, specifically sucrose and fructose, has been implicated in the
      increase of plasma lipids and markers of insulin resistance. However to date no randomised
      controlled study has investigated whether the consumption of reformulated low sugar products
      as components of a habitual diet have a significant impact on plasma lipid, insulin or
      glucose concentrations within a free-living, non-diseased population. It is hypothesised that
      exchange of reformulated, low sugar food products for habitually consumed foods will result
      in dietary compensation and minimal weight change compared with unmodified products and will
      have little impact on plasma glucose, insulin and lipid levels.
