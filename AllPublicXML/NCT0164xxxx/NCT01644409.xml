      Long term open label study on safety and durability of the Urgent-SQ tibial implant device
      for refractory overactive bladder syndrome (OAB).

      This is a follow-up study of the study by van der Pal et al. (see reference). The Urgent-SQ
      is an ankle (tibail) implant that is used for on demand electical stimulation that stimulates
      the tibial nerve for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). The implant is
      placed via an minimal invasive surgical procedure. The implant can be activated with an
      external pulse generator.

      This study by van de Pal et al. was conducted with the approval of the local Medical Ethical
      Committee and with a one year systematic follow-up of eight patients. Since then, follow-up
      up and use of the device was open-label.

      This study reports on the long-term (9yrs) the safety and durability of the Urgent-SQ implant
      in these eight patients.

      Parameters evaluated were local pain and discomford at the site of the implant, AE's related
      to the implant or the use of the implant. Current use of the treatment and effectivity of the
      treatment.
