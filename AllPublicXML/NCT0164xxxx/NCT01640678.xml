  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous epidermal cell suspension grafting is an effective method of surgical treatment in
      vitiligo, which is suitable for treating larger areas with better cosmetic results as
      compared to other grafting methods. The ReCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (Avita
      Medical Europe Limited, Cambridge, UK) is an autologous cell harvesting device which,
      compared to other forms of autologous epidermal cell suspension grafting, is easier in use
      showing similar results. Furthermore, the ReCell device needs no laboratory facilities.
      Therefore, it is promising for patients with large vitiligo and piebaldism lesions.

      Objectives: Primary: to asses the efficacy and safety of autologous epidermal cell suspension
      grafting with the ReCell device after CO2 laser abrasion compared to CO2 laser abrasion alone
      and no treatment, in patients with piebaldism and stable vitiligo. Secondary: to assess the
      practical aspects and patients satisfaction of autologous epidermal cell suspension grafting
      with the ReCell device.

      Study design: Prospective observer blinded randomized controlled pilot study. Study
      population: 10 patients â‰¥ 18 years with stable segmental vitiligo or piebaldism who are under
      treatment at the Netherlands Institute for Pigment Disorders (NIPD) at the Academic Medical
      Centre University of Amsterdam.

      Methods: Three depigmented regions on the trunk or proximal extremities will be randomly
      allocated to; CO2 laser abrasion + ReCell autologous cell suspension grafting, or CO2 laser
      abrasion, or no treatment. After the transplantation, UV-treatment according to the standard
      treatment protocol of the NIPD will be started on all sites and continued for 3 months. Three
      and six months after grafting, the percentage of repigmentation of the lesions will be
      assessed.
