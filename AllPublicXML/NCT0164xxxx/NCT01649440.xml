  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of sepsis and its relevant multiple organ dysfunction remain a major problem
      in intensive care units with high morbidity and mortality. The differentiation between
      non-infectious and infectious etiologies, severity and organ function evaluation, and
      prognostic assessment are all challenging in routine clinical practice. Many biomarkers have
      been suggested for these purpose; however sensitivity and specificity even of high-ranking
      biomarkers still remain insufficient. Recently, metabolic profiling has attracted interest
      for biomarker discovery. In this study, LC-MS/MS will be perform to identify serum metabolic
      biomarkers for differentiation of SIRS/sepsis, severity and organ function evaluation, and
      prognostic assessment among 65 patients. The investigators enrolled 35 patients who were
      diagnosed with sepsis, 15 patients who were diagnosed with SIRS, and 15 normal patients.
      Moreover, the sepsis were further divided into sepsis, severe sepsis, and sepsis patients
      before death. Small metabolites that were present in patient serum samples were measured by
      LC-MS/MS techniques and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods, such as Principal
      Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and
      Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis. Based on the multivariate statistical
      analysis above, the investigators could distinguish sepsis from normal and SIRS; distinguish
      the difference among sepsis, severe sepsis and death. We hypothesis that some metabolites as
      identified in this study are promising biomarker candidates in the field of sepsis diagnosis
      and treatment.
