  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of IMPACT (Investigation of Motivational Interviewing and Prevention Consults
      to Achieve Cardiovascular Targets) is to determine the best management strategy for patients
      undergoing cardiovascular intervention. IMPACT is a prospective randomized trial that will
      enroll 400 patients post-cardiovascular intervention. The study will compare different
      cardiovascular prevention strategies: (1) usual care, (2) cardiovascular prevention consult,
      and (3) cardiovascular prevention consult with a behavioral intervention program over a
      6-month period. The trial hypothesis is that for patients undergoing a cardiovascular
      intervention, a prevention consult and behavioral intervention is superior to usual care in
      reducing cardiovascular risk. The primary endpoint will be non-HDL cholesterol. Secondary
      endpoints include other lipid values, metabolic risk, smoking cessation, physical activity,
      nutritional status, medication adherence and quality of life. IMPACT is scheduled to begin
      enrollment in the June of 2012.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

      Primary aim:

      The primary aim is that a targeted Cardiovascular Prevention consult will reduce non-HDL
      cholesterol compared to usual care at 6 months post-intervention.

      Secondary aim:

      The secondary aim is that a targeted Cardiovascular Prevention consult plus a behavioral
      intervention will reduce non-HDL cholesterol compared to usual care at 6 months
      post-intervention.
