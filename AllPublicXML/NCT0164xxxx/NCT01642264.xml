  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study was to develop an interactive Internet-based program
      (WeBREATHe: Web-Based Respiratory Education About Tobacco and Health) to train pediatric
      respiratory therapists and nurses to provide brief, hospital-based tobacco cessation
      interventions to parents of pediatric patients. The WeBREATHe program was based on a Phase I
      prototype which was evaluated with 50 pediatric respiratory therapists and nurses.

      In Phase II, the investigators redesigned and expanded the program with input from 50
      educators, nurses and respiratory therapists from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
      Center. Then the investigators evaluated the Phase II program in a randomized trial in which
      215 respiratory therapists and nurses from two large, urban children's hospitals were
      randomly assigned within hospital to either the Intervention (Training) Condition, or to a
      Delayed Treatment (Training) Control condition.

      Participants' demographic and tobacco use history were measured at baseline, and tobacco
      cessation intervention behaviors, attitudes, knowledge, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy
      regarding delivery of a tobacco cessation intervention were measured at baseline, 1 week
      post-training, and at 3 months post-training. User satisfaction measures were also collected
      at 1 week post-training from Intervention Condition participants. The investigators
      hypothesized that participants in the Intervention Condition would have increased tobacco
      cessation behaviors, positive attitudes and self-efficacy, and decreased perceived barriers
      than participants i the Delayed-Treatment Control Condition.

      Following evaluation, the investigators developed a final version of the interactive training
      program and created the administrative infrastructure for a marketable product.

    <measure>Performance of Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>14 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale of frequency. Ask = asking all patients' parents about tobacco use and documenting use in the patients' charts.
Advise = discussing health hazards of tobacco use and giving direct advice to quit.
Assess = determining parents' level of readiness to quit. Assist = discussing strategies or techniques to quit, setting a specific date to quit, discussing pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, giving written self-help materials to tobacco users.
Arrange = discussing local tobacco cessation resources and making a referral to a tobacco quit line.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes towards provision of tobacco cessation interventions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>9 items. Level of agreement measured on a 5-point Likert scale on 9 statements measuring attitudes towards provision of tobacco cessation interventions to patients' parents in pediatric settings. For example, &quot;It is appropriate for pediatric RTs and RNs to assess and document their patients' exposure to secondhand smoke (e.g., family members' tobacco use).&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Barriers</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>7 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Participants rate the level of routine barriers to provision of tobacco cessation interventions in pediatric settings, (e.g., lack of training, lack of time, lack of resources).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>6 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Participants rate their agreement to statements of perceived self-efficacy to perform Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange behaviors (e.g., &quot;I can ask my patients' parents about their smoking.&quot;)</description>
