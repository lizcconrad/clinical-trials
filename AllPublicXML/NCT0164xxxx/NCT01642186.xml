  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no effective standard treatment for fibrolamellar liver cancer that cannot be
      removed by surgery. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, 3 drugs
      called letrozole, leuprolide and everolimus will have on cancer. All of these drugs are FDA
      approved for the treatment of different cancers. Letrozole and leuprolide stop the body from
      producing estrogen, a normal hormone produced by the body. Too much estrogen may help
      fibrolamellar liver cancer grow. Everolimus is a drug that may block other chemicals in the
      body that can help cancer grow. The combination of letrozole and leuprolide plus everolimus
      may work well together.

                  last dose of study drug.

               -  Men must agree to use a double barrier method of birth control and to not donate
                  sperm during the study and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study

                  prior to initiating treatment. Prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive
                  injections, and contraceptive patch are not approved methods of contraception in
                  this study.

               -  Negative pregnancy test (serum hCG) result (applicable to women of child bearing
                  potential) within 7 days before Cycle 1 Day 1 of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent anticancer, or radiation therapy. Patients must have completed all
             anticancer therapy &gt; 4 weeks before the start of study therapy. The date of last

          -  Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another
             immunosuppressive agent. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.

          -  Concurrent oral contraceptive use or hormonal replacement therapy.

          -  Use of an aromatase inhibitor, GnRH agonist and/or tamoxifen within the past 30 days.
             Patients previously on fulvestrant or a q3 month GnRH agonist must have discontinued
             these medications for at least 3 months.

          -  Concurrent use of potent CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein inhibitors or potent CYP3A4
             inducers (please see Appendices 3 and 4). Where possible, otherwise eligible patients
             should be switched to alternative agents; otherwise, they will be excluded from the
             study.

          -  Potent CYP3A4 inducers decrease serum everolimus levels and should not be given
             concomitantly. Dose modifications of everolimus are not indicated in the presence of
             moderate CYP3A4 inducers [108]. Please refer to Appendix 3 for a complete list of
             potent and moderate inducers of CYP3A4.

          -  Potent CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein inhibitors can increase serum levels of everolimus
             and should not be co-administered. Moderate inhibitors may mildly-moderately increase
             serum everolimus levels, though there is no definitive evidence supporting a dose
             reduction [108]. Please refer to Appendix 4 for a complete list of potent and moderate
             inhibitors of CYP3A4.

          -  Any investigational drug received within one month of study enrollment.

          -  Any severe, uncontrolled medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,

          -  Patients who received any form of transplant and who are on any form of
             immunosuppressive therapy. However transplanted patients who are off immunosuppressive
             therapy for at least 4 weeks are allowed on the study, provided that any of their
             immunosuppressive-related toxicities have recovered to at least a grade 1.

          -  Known HIV positive with a CD4 count &lt; 500 cells/mm3.
