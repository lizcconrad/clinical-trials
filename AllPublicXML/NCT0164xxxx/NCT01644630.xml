    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test whether or not the use of screw-retained implant crowns on
      customized zirconia abutments results in biological, technical and esthetic outcomes similar
      to those obtained with cemented all-ceramic crowns on customized zirconia abutments, both
      made with a computer-aided design and manufacturing procedure (CAD/CAM).

      The null-hypotheses is that marginal bone level change is equal at screw-retained and
      cemented crowns

    <description>The final lithium disilicate crowns will be cemented with an adhesive cement after tightening the abutments with the torque indicated by the manufacturer and closing the screw access hole with white guttapercha. The abutment will be cleaned with ethanol. A retraction cord will be placed for cementation if indicated. The crown will be etched with hydrofluoric acid and subsequently silanized. A sufficient amount of cement will be filled in the crown without creating major excesses. When the crown is seated correctly, the cement will be light-cured for a few seconds to facilitate the removal of the now hard excess cement.
- Excess cement will be meticulously removed with a carbon scaler. The removal of all excess cement will be checked with an X-ray and by visual and tactile inspection.</description>
