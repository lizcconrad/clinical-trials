  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent study published by the Canadian Pain Society estimated the direct health care costs
      of chronic pain to be about 6 billion dollars. Over 1/3 of all Canadians reported that they
      either missed work or experienced reduced productivity due to chronic pain. Fibromyalgia
      Syndrome (FMS)is a condition that affects up to 10% of the Canadian population, many of whom
      are still in the prime of their lives. While pain and fatigue are prominent symptoms, FMS
      sufferers often experience sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal upset, chronic headache,
      memory and thinking problems, and depression. Standard treatments focus on medication and
      physical exercise but are not always successful. Acceptance-Based behavioural therapy (ABBT)
      is a relatively new approach that has been effective not only in treating mental health
      concerns such as anxiety and depression, but also other medical conditions such as diabetes
      and chronic pain. A novel ABBT for FMS was developed and pilot tested with a small group of
      participants. The results of this preliminary study were promising. Unfortunately, many
      people cannot adequately access available treatment due to long wait lists, prohibitive
      costs, or time/location constraints. Online treatments may offer improved access to care
      without reducing the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, the ABBT for FMS used in the
      pilot study is being adapted to an online format and will be evaluated with a larger group of
      participants. A wait-list/control group will be employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      online treatment as compared with treatment-as-usual. If found effective, this treatment
      would offer patients easier access to care at a significantly reduced cost to the health care
      system.

      The current study extended a pilot study (Shay, Tkachuk, Simister, Bailly, &amp; Skrabek, 2011),
      modifying the previous treatment to a 6 unit program that could be delivered online.
      Sixty-one participants completed the study, being randomly assigned to an online ABBT plus
      treatment-as-usual (online ABBT + TAU) group or a treatment-as-usual alone (TAU) group. All
      participants completed a series of self-report measures at baseline, at post-treatment, and
      at a 3-month follow-up. Linear mixed modelling supported significant differences between the
      groups in favour of the ABBT + TAU treatment group on the primary outcome measure
      (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQ-R); F (2, 52.82) = 20.10, p &lt; .0001)
      following treatment. The online ABBT + TAU group also had significantly greater improvements
      in depression, pain, acceptance, perceived helplessness, and kinesiophobia. Increased
      acceptance mediated the effects of treatment on improvements in FMS quality of life and FMS
      impact, while reduced helplessness mediated the effects of treatment on improvements in level
      of reported pain. Comments and subjective ratings of improvement were consistent with the
      quantitative results. Participants rated mindfulness (contact with present moment experience)
      as the most useful treatment unit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants of either sex aged 18 years and older with a formal diagnosis of FMS will
             be recruited.

          -  Individuals younger than 18 years of age will be excluded in order to ensure all
             participants have reached the age of majority and can provide consent.

          -  They will have a pain intensity rating of at least 4/10 based on self-report.
             Participants will also be screened using the Wolfe et al (2010) criteria during the
             in-person session to ensure they meet criteria for FMS.

          -  Must reside in and complete study from within Manitoba, Canada

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  People with co-morbidities such as rheumatologic conditions, other conditions
             affecting the immune system (e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis,
             lupus), brain injury, cognitive impairment that would limit a participant's ability to
             complete informed consent, active psychosis, substance abuse, uncontrolled major
             depression or bipolar disorder, active suicidality, or those who have current active
             injury claims will be excluded.

          -  Given the use of a large amount of reading materials, participants will be asked if
             they have completed at least grade 9 in high school. Those who have only completed
             grade 8 or lower will be excluded.

          -  Further, participants will be asked to maintain their pre-study treatment regime and
             not making changes to their medications or beginning other treatments for the duration
             of the study.
