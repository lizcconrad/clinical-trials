  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if in steroid na√Øve asthmatic children with elevated
      baseline exhaled nitric oxide, treatment with inhaled steroid and normalization of exhaled
      nitric oxide level results in restoration of the bronchodilator response to deep inhalation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that a deep inhalation (DI) would increase airway caliber in
      normal subjects. Whereas in asthmatics with spontaneous bronchoconstriction (obstruction of
      the airway), DI was shown to worsen airway obstruction. The mechanism for this variability in
      response to DI is not well-understood, but seems to be a key in understanding the
      pathophysiology of the disease, and possibly in the development of an effective therapy. Air
      way inflammation resulting in airway wall thickening and peribronchial edema is thought to
      play a role how the airway responds to deep inhalation. This study assess if reduction in
      airway inflammation (as measured by level of exhaled NO)results in optimization of the
      bronchodilator response to deep inhalation

    <description>M/P40 ratio is defined as the ratio of flow at 40% of FVC (forced vital capacity) on the flow-volume curve after maximal inspiration to flow at 40% of FVC on the flow-volume curve after partial (60%-70% of FVC) inspiration (M/P40 ratio)</description>
