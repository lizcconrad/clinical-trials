  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive form of brain
      stimulation, can reduce pain in the laboratory and in the clinic. The purpose of this study
      is to investigate how TMS relieves pain and affects pain circuitry in the brain. One of the
      primary study hypotheses is that opioid blockade will significantly reduce the pain relief
      produced by left prefrontal cortex TMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive forms of brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are currently being investigated as
      alternative or adjunctive therapies for pain. Clinical interest in these techniques continues
      to grow because of rising opiate abuse and inadequate pain management strategies. Despite
      this enthusiasm, studies on the efficacy of repetitive TMS (rTMS) for pain have produced
      mixed results. Some of the most promising and informative research has focused on rTMS for
      perioperative pain. In two different postoperative studies, a single session of left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) rTMS after gastric bypass surgery reduced morphine
      self-administration by 40% when compared to sham stimulation. These data are particularly
      fascinating given the role of the DLPFC in top-down pain processing.

      Centered at the juncture of Brodmann Areas (BAs) 9 and 46, the DLPFC remains a popular
      therapeutic target for rTMS given its accessible location and presumed role in high-order
      cognition and emotional valence. Animal and human studies suggest that cingulofrontal regions
      like DLPFC may modulate pain perception via recruitment of opioidergic midbrain and brainstem
      structures like the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM),
      respectively. These data outline the functional circuitry that might be involved in the
      analgesic effects of DLPFC rTMS.

      While many studies aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of DLPFC rTMS for pain management,
      few have examined how it affects pain processing. Imaging the cerebral signature of pain
      before and after left DLPFC rTMS might reveal information about pain circuitry and help to
      elucidate the mechanism by which prefrontal rTMS may produce analgesia. Previous studies
      suggest that opioid blockade abolishes left but not right DLPFC rTMS-induced analgesia. In
      this study, our a priori hypothesis was that left DLPFC rTMS would attenuate blood
      oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal response to painful stimuli in pain processing
      regions. More specifically, we anticipated that midbrain and medulla BOLD signal changes
      induced by left DLPFC rTMS would be abolished by pretreatment with the Î¼-opioid antagonist
      naloxone.

          <description>Outside of the 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, participants underwent resting motor threshold assessment, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex localization and preliminary pain testing. Next, participants were placed in the scanner for baseline pain testing. After baseline testing, participants were asked to rate the pain that they had experienced. Participants were subsequently removed from the scanner and randomized to receive approximately 10 ml intravenous naloxone (0.1mg/kg) or saline immediately prior to 20 minutes of sham left DLFPC rTMS. Following sham rTMS, participants returned to the scanner for the same block testing performed at baseline. After rating their pain, participants were removed from the scanner for 20 minutes of real left DLPFC rTMS. Participants then returned to the scanner for the final block test.</description>

            <description>Participants first underwent baseline pain testing in the scanner. At the conclusion of baseline testing, participants were asked to rate the pain that they had experienced. Participants were subsequently removed from the scanner and randomized to receive 10 ml intravenous (I.V.) naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) or saline immediately before 20 min of sham left DLFPC rTMS. Following sham rTMS, participants returned to the scanner for the same block testing performed at baseline. After rating their pain, participants were removed from the scanner for 20min of real left DLPFC rTMS. Participants then returned to the scanner for the final block test. The I.V. pretreatment was randomized such that participants received saline on one visit and naloxone on the other visit.</description>

          <title>Pain Rating</title>
          <description>There are two experimental visits separated by one week. During each experiment, pain ratings will be measured every 30 minutes. &quot;Preliminary testing&quot; will be done 30 minutes into the experiment. The purpose of preliminary testing is to select the temperature that will be used to induce pain throughout the experiment. &quot;Baseline testing&quot; will be done 60 minutes into the experiment. &quot;After sham rTMS&quot; will be done 90 minutes into the experiment. &quot;After real rTMS&quot; will be done 120 minutes into the study. The pain scale used in a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). There was an 11-point rating system where &quot;0&quot; represented no pain and &quot;10&quot; represented unbearable pain.</description>
