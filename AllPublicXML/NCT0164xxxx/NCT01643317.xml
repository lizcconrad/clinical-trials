    <textblock>
      Screening studies for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) in 65 to 79 years aged men, have shown
      a significant reduction in AAA related mortality. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of
      screening for AAA in men in the Netherlands has been demonstrated by using a Markov model.
      Screening might be even more (cost-) effective if targeted on high risk groups, such as
      patients with a particular cardiovascular disease with a known increased risk of having an
      AAA.

      Project SCAN (Screening CardioVascular patients for Aortic aNeurysms) is a project focused on
      targeted AAA screening to proactively diagnose patients at high risk of having an aneurysm
      that eventually may rupture. This pilot project aims to study the value of a screening
      protocol in daily practice to detect AAA's in high risk patients.

      1. Offering PAD and CAD patients a non-invasive abdominal ultrasound after a careful
           process of shared-decision making

        2. Recording data on aneurysm detection on all PAD and CAD patients screened:

             1. General information (age, gender)

             2. Medical history on CardioVascular risk factors (such as smoking history,
                hypertension, and other cardiovascular medical conditions - only information that
                is already recorded in the patient's medical history chart)

             3. AAA - Yes/ No (Yes if ≥3 cm AAA)

             4. If ≥3 cm aneurysm, record exact size and outcome in time (surveillance, treatment,
                no treatment)

             5. If treated, record treatment type (EVAR or Open) and outcome
