  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Timing of initiating domiciliary no invasive ventilation (NIV) in amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis patients remains unclear. The hypothesis of the study is that the early use of NIV,
      in the initial phase of respiratory muscle weakness, improves the prognosis of ALS patients.

      Principal objective: To evaluate the impact of early NIV in the survival of ALS patients.

      Secondary objectives:To determine the effects from early NIV in the progression of
      respiratory muscle weakness. To analyze the impact of early NIV in the quality of life of ALS
      patients. To evaluate the correlation between the FVC and other parameters of respiratory
      evaluation (maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNP),
      nocturnal desaturation) and their utility in the early indication of the NIV. To evaluate the
      tolerance to the early NIV.

      Methods: multicentric, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial with a parallel
      treatment design. Patients will be included when their FVC reaches the threshold of the 75%
      of the predicted value and will be randomized in: Group A: the NIV treatment will begin
      immediately and Group B: the NIV treatment will be started when patients fulfil at least one
      of the following criteria: (i) FVC &lt; 50% predicted, (ii) orthopnea, and/or (iii) PaCO2 &gt; 45
      mmHg. Follow-up visits will be done every three months with pulmonary function test,
      nocturnal pulse oximetry, quality of life and quality of sleep tests, assessment of disease
      progression (ALSFSR-R scale), tolerance and compliance with NIV.

      ALS patients with early impairment of respiratory muscles (FVC around 75%) will be radomised
      to initiate NIV or conventional follow-up.

      The NIV treatment will be initiated during a hospital with the model of ventilator VIVO 40
      (BREAS Medical AD, Sweden) using a pressure support assisted/control mode, with a minimum
      pressure support 10 cm.

      Initial NIV indication in both groups of patients will nocturnal. Patients will be defined as
      tolerant to NIV if they do not refer inconveniences and is able to asleep with NIV.

      The efficacy of the intervention will be compared in both groups with survival until death or
      change to invasive tracheal ventilation as a prymary efficacy parameter.
