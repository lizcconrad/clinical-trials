      The purpose of this study is to test blood and tissue samples of people with Ulcerative
      Colitis (UC) to see what effects Vitamin D3 may have on the immune system. This research is
      being done because it could lead to the development of new treatment for people with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

      The primary endpoint of the trial is the change in colonic permeability as a global
      assessment of vitamin D3 effects throughout the colon in patients with Ulcerative Colitis.
      Secondary endpoints will be changes in colonic tight junction protein expression, and their
      relationship to serum vitamin D level, VDR expression, inflammatory cytokines, and histologic
      inflammation
