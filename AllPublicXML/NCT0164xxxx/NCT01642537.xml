    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient understands the implications of participating in the study and provides
             informed consent

          2. Patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluation and can be contacted
             by telephone

          3. Patients referred for a catheter ablation procedure to treat an atrial or ventricular
             arrhythmia

          4. Patient can be heparinized during the procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients requiring an emergency ablation procedure

          2. Patients hemodynamically unstable

          3. Patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure

          4. Women who are pregnant or lactating

          5. Patients having cardiac surgery within the past two months

          6. Patients with Long QT Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, or Torsade de Pointes

          7. Patients with intracardiac thrombus, tumor, or other abnormality which precludes
             catheter introduction

          8. Patients with acute myocardial infarction within 3 months

          9. Patients awaiting cardiac transplantation

         10. Patients enrolled in any other clinical study

         11. Patients with an age &lt;18 or &gt;75 years

         12. Patients with stable/unstable angina or ongoing myocardial ischemia

         13. Patients with congenital heart disease (not including atrial septal defect (ASD) or
             patent foramen ovale (PFO) without a right to left shunt) where the underlying
             abnormality increases the risk of an ablative procedure

         14. Patients with pulmonary hypertension (mean or systolic pulmonary artery (PA) pressure
             &gt; 50mm Hg on Doppler echo)

         15. Patients with a left atrial diameter &gt; 55 mm

         16. Patients with any arrhythmia currently being treated where the arrhythmia or the
             management may interfere with this study

         17. Patients with active infection or sepsis

         18. Patients with untreatable allergy to contrast media

         19. Patients with a history of blood clotting (bleeding or thrombotic) abnormalities

         20. Patients with any known sensitivities to heparin or warfarin

         21. Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (identified by a
             forced expiratory volume [FEV1] &lt;1)

         22. Patients with severe co morbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, will not allow the patient to be a good study candidate
             (i.e. other disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse, shortened life
             expectance, etc.)
