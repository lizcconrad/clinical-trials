  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial in which women with symptomatic mild pelvic organ
      prolapse undergoing Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy (PFPT) receive vaginal estrogen versus
      placebo to see if a combined approach to treatment leads to improvement in clinical outcomes.
      The investigators predict that PFPT in combination with vaginal estrogen will lead to
      decreased pelvic floor symptoms and improved anatomical support corroborated by biomarker
      data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is unknown. Few studies have correlated
      patient symptoms and amount of prolapse with biomarkers. POP has traditionally been managed
      with a pessary or surgery. Recent studies suggest a reduction in POP symptoms following
      Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy (PFPT). Vaginally delivered hormones are also commonly used to
      treat prolapse symptoms, with little evidence supporting a clinical benefit. The
      investigators hypothesize that the optimal approach to improving prolapse symptoms in the
      patient with mild prolapse requires re-alignment and strengthening of levator muscles via
      PFPT, and optimization of tissue integrity via local estrogen therapy. The investigators
      propose to test this hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial in which women with
      symptomatic mild prolapse opting for PFPT, receive treatment with PFPT in combination with
      vaginal estrogen versus placebo. The investigators predict that the combined approach will
      lead to decreased symptoms and improved anatomical support corroborated by biomarker data.
