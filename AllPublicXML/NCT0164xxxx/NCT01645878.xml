    <textblock>
      Exclusive breastfeeding is very important for an infant's growth and development.
      Self-efficacy is a modifiable psychological variable in sustained breastfeeding that is
      defined as a mother's confidence in her perceived ability about successful exclusive
      breastfeeding. Self- efficacy beliefs function as an important set of human motivation ,
      affect , and action which operate on action, through motivation, cognitive and affective
      interventing process. teaching strategies ,based on Bandura,s self-efficacy theory and adult
      learning principles were incorporated in this research design. In regards with the importance
      of education in increasing breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusive breastfeeding, the
      current study was conducted in order to compare of the effectiveness of two educational
      methods, i.e., &quot;Hands on&quot; and&quot; Hands off&quot; on breastfeeding self-efficacy in primiparous
      mothers.

      In the present clinical trial, 136 nursing mother were randomly assigned to one of the three
      groups. Participants in the experimental groups received one of the structured one-on-one
      educational sessions (i.e., hands off or hands on) within the first two hours of giving
      birth. Mothers in control group received usual postpartum care. Follow-up assessments were
      conducted one, four, and eight weeks after the birth. Data collection was done through
      interview forms, examination and observation, checklist of breastfeeding status,
      breastfeeding self-efficacy and daily-feeding form.
