    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the critical components of motivational
      interviewing (MI), a psychotherapeutic intervention, in reducing heavy or problematic
      drinking. The study will disaggregate MI into its component parts and test full MI compared
      to MI without its directive strategies. This study will test whether the directive elements
      of MI are critical or whether MI effects may be attributable solely to its Rogerian,
      non-directive components. For more information, go to http://caspirnyc.org/p_motion.html

      Project Motion is a clinical research study for people seeking to reduce, but not stop their
      drinking. Individuals who qualify will receive a comprehensive assessment and brief
      individual psychotherapy at no cost. The study is being conducted by a team of scientists at
      Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and the New York State Psychiatric
      Institute and is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Our offices are located
      next to Columbus Circle and we offer convenient hours for appointments.

      The purpose of our study is to understand how brief psychotherapy helps people reduce alcohol
      consumption and drinking problems. For example, we know that some people can reduce drinking
      with little or no treatment, whereas others benefit from one-on-one psychotherapy. However,
      we do not know why this happens. Individuals who qualify and decide to participate will be
      assigned by chance to one of three conditions. Individuals assigned to the first two
      conditions will receive brief psychotherapy, beginning the first week of their participation
      in the study. Individuals in the third condition will receive feedback on their drinking and
      be asked to reduce their drinking with the aid of telephone self-monitoring for a period of 8
      weeks. Individuals in the third condition will then receive psychotherapy as well. The delay
      of 8 weeks will allow us to understand how the psychotherapy works compared to how people
      change without counseling.
