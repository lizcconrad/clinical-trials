  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adalimumab and to
      determine how well it works in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis in the Chinese population. Psoriasis is a chronic immunologic disease characterized
      by marked inflammation and thickening of the epidermis that result in thick, scaly plaques
      involving the skin.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Greater Than or Equal to 75% Reduction (PASI 75) Response at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with a greater than or equal to 75% reduction (improvement) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at Week 12. PASI is a composite measure of the level of erythema (redness of the skin), induration (hardening of the skin), and desquamation (peeling of the skin) on 4 sites (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities), each of which are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very marked). The possible range for PASI score is 0 to 72, with the highest score representing complete erythroderma of the severest possible degree; a decrease in score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) [Period A]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form-36 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales. The PCS is represented by 4 subscales: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and general health perception. The MCS is represented by 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have choices per item. Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which were transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. PCS and MCS scores were constructed as a T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 and no minimum or maximum score. The difference from baseline to week 12 in SF-36 PCS and MCS was calculated.</description>

          <title>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index</title>
          <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a composite measure of the level of erythema (redness of the skin), induration (hardening of the skin), and desquamation (peeling of the skin) on 4 sites (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities), each of which are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very marked). The possible range for PASI score is 0 to 72, with the highest score representing complete erythroderma of the severest possible degree; a decrease in score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with a greater than or equal to 75% reduction (improvement) in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at Week 12. PASI is a composite measure of the level of erythema (redness of the skin), induration (hardening of the skin), and desquamation (peeling of the skin) on 4 sites (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities), each of which are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very marked). The possible range for PASI score is 0 to 72, with the highest score representing complete erythroderma of the severest possible degree; a decrease in score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) [Period A]</title>
        <description>Short Form-36 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales. The PCS is represented by 4 subscales: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, and general health perception. The MCS is represented by 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have choices per item. Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which were transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. PCS and MCS scores were constructed as a T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 and no minimum or maximum score. The difference from baseline to week 12 in SF-36 PCS and MCS was calculated.</description>
