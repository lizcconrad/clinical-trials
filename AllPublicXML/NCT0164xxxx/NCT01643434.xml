  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistant hypertension (ReHy) is an emerging clinical and public health problem which tends
      to increase because populations are living longer and there is a growing global epidemic of
      obesity, diabetes and sleep apnea. It is also tempting to speculate that the excessive
      dietary salt ingestion reported in many countries can contribute substantially to the risk of
      ReHy development. ReHy is defined as persistent high blood pressure (above the target goal)
      in spite of the use of at least 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes, one of them
      must being diuretics.

      Data regarding the exact prevalence of ReHy are very limited. In addition, little data is
      available about 3-drug combinations but a simplified treatment algorithm has demonstrated
      that a combination of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or
      an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) plus diuretic, adding a calcium channel blocker when
      necessary, controlled 64% of hypertensive patients and, in addition, was even more efficient
      than the current guideline-based management. By contrast, the fourth drug to be added-on the
      triple regimen is still controversial and guided by empirical choices or personal
      preferences. Recent studies suggest the emerging role of spironolactone as the &quot;first-line&quot;
      fourth drug for treating resistant hypertension. Conversely, because of the
      pathophysiological rationale, others have proposed the use of β-blockers or even centrally
      acting agents for managing the sympathetic hyperactivity. The present concerns about the
      limited blood pressure reducing effect of β-blockers, especially in elderly people, the
      potent effect of centrally acting agents and our personal experience are pointing to
      clonidine as the fourth drug to be added-on to a multidrug combination for reaching optimal
      blood pressure in patients with ReHy. Nevertheless, no studies have been performed comparing,
      head-to-head, which one is the best fourth drug (spironolactone or clonidine) to be added-on
      to a common used multidrug combination in order to treat this condition.

      Therefore, the principal objectives of the ReHOT Trial are to assess prospectively: (1) the
      prevalence of ReHy in a cohort of outpatients with stage II hypertension; (2) the effect of
      spironolactone on blood pressure, in comparison to clonidine, when added to a multidrug
      combination consisting of chlorthalidone plus ACEi (or ARB) plus amlodipine, all of 3
      up-titrated to the highest dose; (3) the role of measuring sympathetic nervous system
      activity and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity on predicting the response of blood
      pressure to spironolactone and clonidine.
