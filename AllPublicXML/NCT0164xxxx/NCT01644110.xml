      The proposed study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase-Ib/II trial to assess the efficacy of
      oral drug combination ruxolitinib and pomalidomide in primary and secondary MF patients.
      Dosages of the drugs are derived from previous Phase-I/II studies; ruxolitinib treatment will
      be started at 10 mg twice daily, whereas the dose of pomalidomide will be 0.5 mg once daily.

      Dose reductions and discontinuations will be allowed in case of myelosuppressive effects.

      Intra-patient dose escalation will be permitted for ruxolitinib to optimize efficacy of the
      therapeutic regimen; pomalidomide will be given in a permanent dosage of 0.5mg per day.

      Treatment response will be evaluated continuously after each treatment cycle (1 cycle = 28
      days) according to the IWG-MRT criteria expanded by the response criterion RCT-independency.

      In case of progressive disease study therapy will be stopped; In patients showing response or
      stable disease, continuous therapy within the study is intended for a maximum of 12 treatment
      cycles; After completion of 12 treatment cycles, therapy can be continued if a measurable
      benefit of treatment is evident. This extension has to be discussed between the local and the
      principle investigator. Conditions leading to patient withdrawal from the study are detailed
      in the protocol &quot;PATIENT WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY PARTICIPATION&quot;.
