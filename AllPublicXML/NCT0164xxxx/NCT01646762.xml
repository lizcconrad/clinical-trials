    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
      works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has returned or did not respond to
      treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) of single agent nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane)
      (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in patients with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the adverse events associated with use of single agent nab-paclitaxel
      (Abraxane) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To evaluate overall survival, time to progression, and duration of response among
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma undergoing treatment with single agent
      nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Have a Confirmed Partial Response or Better</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>A confirmed partial response or better will be considered synonymous with &quot;success&quot; and is defined to be a stringent complete response (sCR = complete response (CR) + Normal serum FLC ratio + Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow), CR (= Negative immunofixation of the serum and urine + &lt;5%plasma cells in bone marrow + Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas + normalization of FLC ratio), very good partial response (VGPR = partial response (PR) + Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis ), or PR (≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to &lt;200 mg per 24 h) noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations. The percentage of successes (confirmed PR or better) will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients times 100. Confirmed PR or better will be evaluated using all cycles of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from registration to death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause. The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from registration to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of time to progression will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the 3 month progression-free rate (percentage) will be provided. Progression is defined as:
Any one or more of the following: Increase of 25% from lowest value in:
Serum M-component (absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dl
Serum M-component increase ≥ 1 g/dl, if lowest M component was ≥ 5 g/dl
Urine M-component (absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 h)
If at on study, the only measurable non-bone marrow parameter was free light chain (FLC), the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase must be &gt;10 mg/dl)
Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute % must be ≥10%) Or any one or more of the following felt related to the underlying clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder
Development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or bone lesions
Hypercalcemia (≥11.5 mg/dl)
Decrease in hemoglobin of ≥2 g/dl
Serum creatinine level ≥2 mg/dl</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response of All Evaluable Patients Who Have Achieved a Partial Response or Better</measure>
    <time_frame>Date at which the patient's earliest best objective status is first noted to be at least a partial response or better to the earliest date progression is documented, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients who have achieved a partial response or better (stringent complete response (sCR = complete response (CR) + Normal serum FLC ratio + Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow), CR (= Negative immunofixation of the serum and urine + &lt;5%plasma cells in bone marrow + Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas + normalization of FLC ratio), very good partial response (VGPR = partial response (PR) + Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis ), or PR (≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to &lt;200 mg per 24 h) ) as the date at which the patients earliest best objective status is first noted to be at least a partial response or better to the earliest date of progression is documented. The distribution of duration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Toxicity as Assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity is defined as a grade 3 or higher adverse events that is classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The assignment of attribution to study treatment and grade (or degree of severity) of the adverse event are classified using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. The percentage of patients with a maximum grade 3 or higher adverse event at least possibly related to the study treatment are reported below.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (percentage) is defined as the percentage of patients with a partial response (PR) or better. A PR or better will be considered synonymous with &quot;success&quot; and is defined to be a stringent complete response (sCR = complete response (CR) + Normal serum FLC ratio + Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow), CR (= Negative immunofixation of the serum and urine + &lt;5%plasma cells in bone marrow + Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas + normalization of FLC ratio), very good partial response (VGPR = PR + Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis ), or PR (≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to &lt;200 mg per 24 h) noted as the objective status. The percentage of successes (PR or better) will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients times 100. PR or better will be evaluated using all cycles of treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients Who Have a Confirmed Partial Response or Better</title>
        <description>A confirmed partial response or better will be considered synonymous with &quot;success&quot; and is defined to be a stringent complete response (sCR = complete response (CR) + Normal serum FLC ratio + Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow), CR (= Negative immunofixation of the serum and urine + &lt;5%plasma cells in bone marrow + Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas + normalization of FLC ratio), very good partial response (VGPR = partial response (PR) + Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis ), or PR (≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to &lt;200 mg per 24 h) noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations. The percentage of successes (confirmed PR or better) will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients times 100. Confirmed PR or better will be evaluated using all cycles of treatment.</description>

        <description>Toxicity is defined as a grade 3 or higher adverse events that is classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The assignment of attribution to study treatment and grade (or degree of severity) of the adverse event are classified using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. The percentage of patients with a maximum grade 3 or higher adverse event at least possibly related to the study treatment are reported below.</description>

        <description>Overall response rate (percentage) is defined as the percentage of patients with a partial response (PR) or better. A PR or better will be considered synonymous with &quot;success&quot; and is defined to be a stringent complete response (sCR = complete response (CR) + Normal serum FLC ratio + Absence of clonal cells in bone marrow), CR (= Negative immunofixation of the serum and urine + &lt;5%plasma cells in bone marrow + Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas + normalization of FLC ratio), very good partial response (VGPR = PR + Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis ), or PR (≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to &lt;200 mg per 24 h) noted as the objective status. The percentage of successes (PR or better) will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients times 100. PR or better will be evaluated using all cycles of treatment.</description>
