      Logotherapy has never been evaluated in HIV-infected teenagers. In this study, we will
      evaluate the meaning of life by using The Purpose in Life Test and the affect of logotherapy
      in HIV infected youth at HIV-NAT, Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre and King Chulalongkorn
      Memorial Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the HAART era, HIV infected children can live longer and will grow up to become teenagers.
      However, some may develop psychosocial problems because they have lost family members,
      experienced poverty, social discrimination etc. Being a normal teenager is tough and is the
      most complex period of his/her life. This is the period when most teenagers will find their
      identity and reasons for living. Therefore it is believed that interventions may help
      HIV-infected teenagers better deal with life. For this study, logotherapy, a therapy that
      will help a person to discover his/her purpose in life, live meaningful life, and attain
      self-esteem was used. The success of the intervention was evaluated by using The Purpose in
      Life Test.

    <description>Logotherapy is therapy during which the interaction between the therapist and the client centres on the topic of meaning. The problems that the clients experience are presented to the client as inseparable parts of his everyday life. The client is then challenged to discover his/her meaning and to take responsibility in facing up to his/her problem. This approach is aimed at helping the client to deal and understand what his /her existences entail.</description>
