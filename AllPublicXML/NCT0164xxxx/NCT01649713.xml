      This is a yearly licence tolerability and immunogenicity study of Fluval AB suspension for
      injection (trivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine, active ingredient content: 15
      μgHA/strain/0.5mL) in adult and elderly subjects to assess immunogenicity of a single
      intramuscular injection of Fluval AB suspension for injection, as measured by
      haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, and to evaluate safety and tolerability (incidence of
      adverse events) of a single intramuscular injection of Fluval AB suspension for injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the 2011-2012 vaccination season the following influenza virus strains were recommended
      to be included in the influenza vaccines:

        -  A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like virus,

        -  A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2)-like virus,

        -  B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.

      For the 2012-2013 season the following strains were recommended (Amended EU Recommendations
      for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Composition for the Season 2012/2013,
      EMA/CHMP/BWP/140597/2012):

        -  A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like virus,

        -  A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like virus,

        -  B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus.

      Since the A/H3N2 and the B virus strains were changed, a yearly licence clinical study have
      to be performed.

             treated clinically significant organ or systemic diseases (e.g. asthma or diabetes),
             such that, in the opinion of the investigator, the significance of the disease will
             not compromise the subject's participation in the study;

          -  Female volunteers aged 18-59 years (i.e. participants of childbearing potential) with

          -  Concomitant participation in another clinical study;

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the
             evaluation of the study;

          -  Past or current psychiatric disease of the volunteer that upon judgement of the
             investigator may have effect on the objective decision-making of the volunteer;
