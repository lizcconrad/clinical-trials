  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pre-operative cardiac surgery, 30 to 40% of patients with mitral valvulopathy have had
      episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) or are in permanent or chronic atrial
      fibrillation (CAF). According to the 1999 PMSI data, close to 4000 mitral valve interventions
      were performed in France, in other words, more than 1000 patients present with this condition
      annually; despite a surgical correction of their valvulopathy, patients presenting with a
      pre-operative chronic atrial fibrillation remain in fibrillation following surgery despite
      treatment with anti-arrhythmic agents associated or not with a cardioversion. Thus, the
      survival rate without AF recurrence is 10% at 1 year and 5% at 2 years in patients with AF
      prior to surgery; on the other hand, patients in sinus rhythm at the time of surgery and
      without an antecedent of AF exhibit an incidence of no AF of 90% and 74% at 1 and 2 years,
      respectively. It has also been shown in numerous studies that the long-term morbidity in
      patients with atrial valve surgery is higher in those with AF.

      For more than 10 years, radio-frequency techniques using the endocavitary approach have shown
      a greater efficacy in maintaining sinus rhythm than drug therapy even though the techniques
      are invasive. These radio-frequency techniques were developed and tested during mitral
      surgery, but, to the investigators knowledge, there is only one randomized study that was
      carried out in a population with permanent AF using radio-frequency technique via the
      endocardial approach. Maintenance of sinus rhythm was obtained in only 44.4% of patients
      versus 4.5% in the control group; these results are not in accordance with the published
      prospective and retrospective registries using the technique peri-operatively. The principal
      problem of this study is the absence of medical treatment in the control group. In addition,
      the use of the radio-frequency technique requires an atriotomy resulting in a prolonged
      surgical time, which increases the peri-operative morbidity.

      Other simpler ablation techniques have been developed, such as the one using ultrasound. In
      comparison with the radio-frequency method, this latter technique presents numerous
      advantages including the absence of an atriotomy due to the fact that the epicardial pathway
      is used, a short procedure time (11 min on average), excellent reproducibility, the
      transmural character of the lesions, along with the simplicity of application. There is not,
      to the investigators knowledge, a randomized study comparing the peri-operative ultrasound
      technique (EPICOR) in mitral valve surgery with the conservative reference treatment, notably
      mitral valve surgery coupled with long-term amiodarone treatment. In effect, while amiodarone
      is the most efficacious anti-arrhythmic agent in the long-term, this drug is associated with
      a high percentage of significant side effects, close to 20% at 2 years. The only available
      results using the ultrasound technique are the registries pertaining to the follow-up of
      patients undergoing cardiac mitral or aortic surgery, with an antecedent of AF. The results
      appear to be encouraging with 85% of cases maintained in sinus rhythm at 12 months in the
      most recent studies. In this clinical context, a French multi-centric registry evaluated the
      peri-operative treatment of AF with all of the proposed techniques (cryotherapy,
      radio-frequency, and ultrasound). The percentage of maintenance of sinus rhythm appears to be
      lower than in the historical registries, at the level of 60%, but the techniques used in this
      registry were multiple even if 50% of patients were treated with ultrasound; in addition,
      there was no randomization and follow-up was only for 6 months.

      As a consequence, it is very difficult to have a precise idea, in the literature, of the
      medium- and long-term efficacy of this technique. Despite a diffusion and utilization of the
      technique in clinical practice, the efficacy of the ultrasound technique has not been
      compared, in a standardized manner, with amiodarone, which is the only anti-arrhythmic agent
      that has shown good efficacy in maintaining post-operative sinus rhythm following cardiac
      surgery. We propose to undertake an open, prospective, randomized, multicenter study
      evaluating the efficacy of treatment with ultrasound (EPICOR) in the maintenance of sinus
      rhythm following mitral surgery in two parallel groups, one group with ablation via
      ultrasound &quot;EPICOR&quot; and a control group treated with &quot;amiodarone&quot;, including a long-term
      follow-up of 18 months. The strategy in this study necessitates the use of amiodarone in the
      two groups during the first 2 months followed by a cardioversion in the cases of persistent
      AF 2 months following surgery in both groups, with a cessation of amiodarone therapy in the
      ultrasound group and maintenance of therapy in the control group. The parallel treatment with
      amiodarone in the two groups following the surgical intervention is necessary in order to
      avoid confounding factors in the analysis. In effect, AF during the postoperative period is
      frequent and may be considered to be secondary to a number of factors, such as the surgery
      itself, inflammation, temperature, metabolic disturbances, pericardial effusion, etc. This
      approach is justified, because if the benefit associated with the peri-operative ultrasound
      technique is validated, this would allow for a reduction in the use of anti-arrhythmic
      agents, which are associated with side effects, along with a decrease in long-term morbidity
      via the resulting maintenance of sinus rhythm. In addition, the technique of ablation via
      ultrasound could, among others, replace the surgical technique of reference (Cox surgery) for
      which the principal inconvenience is the prolongation of the time of surgery, resulting in an
      elevated peri-operative morbidity. Therefore, the principal objective of the study is to
      compare, at 18 months, the efficacy of surgical treatment with ultrasound (EPICOR) on the
      maintenance of sinus rhythm following mitral valve surgery in comparison with amiodarone.

    <description>Intraoperatively, in addition to the usual gesture, it will be conducted a systematic exclusion-ligation of the left atrium and the establishment of electrodes atrial and ventricular pacing. The right pulmonary veins are isolated by dissection of the inter-atrial groove and application of the probe by biting on the atrial tissue, the procedure is identical on the left after dissection of the area between the left pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins. The use of ultrasound application will require 10 minutes to around the pulmonary veins using a multi-electrode probe set to deliver an output pulse from 15 to 100 Watts at a frequency from 3.5 to 4.6 MHz. Using EPICOR extends the operating time of 15 minutes.</description>
