      Evaluation of Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Therapy for Pain Relieft Following Total
      Knee Arrhtoplasty (TKA)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized postmarket trial to assess the efficacy of the Select TENSâ„¢ Pain
      Management System, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device, for reducing
      pain and narcotics requirement in patients managed with a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This
      will be a placebo-controlled study involving 116 patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA
      procedures; 58 patients will be randomly selected to be treated postoperatively with an
      active TENS unit and the other 58 patients will be randomly selected to be treated with the
      placebo TENS unit (control group). Patients will be enrolled at two sites within the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System (Main Campus and Lutheran Hospital). Both treatment and
      control groups will receive a femoral nerve catheter, standard during a primary TKA. It is
      hypothesized that TENS (in combination with a femoral nerve catheter) can reduce narcotic
      usage, reduce pain, and allow for a quicker return to function following TKA.

    <description>Pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a vertical line, 10 centimeters in length, with each centimeter marked by its' corresponding whole number (1, 2, 3, etc.). It ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being maximum pain.</description>

    <description>Physical Component Score. Physical Component Score (PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. PCS provides emphasis on questions about general health, physical functioning and role playing and bodily pain. PCS is standardized using a z-score transformation and normed to a US population (Based on a 1990 norm) of a score of 50.0 and a standard deviation of 10.0. Normalized scores reported.</description>

EMPI Select TENS: The unit is capable of 0-60 milliamps of output current. The 4 electrodes will be focused on the posterior aspect of the knee during the immediate postoperative period and lasting through discharge from the hospital. Once the patient is discharged, he/she will be instructed to use the device as he/she would like, whether it is a continuation of the posterior placement of the electrodes, or a more traditional anterior criss-cross positioning. Patients will be instructed to use the device for 2 hours on, followed by 30 minutes off, as needed. Amount of TENS usage and average intensity used will be recorded. An assessment of blinding will be conducted at the conclusion of the study by asking patients what treatment arm they think that they received.</description>

            <description>Active TENS in combination with a femoral nerve catheter. Patients will begin using the TENS unit immediately following surgery and continuing throughout the 6 weeks postoperatively.
EMPI Select TENS: The unit is capable of 0-60 milliamps of output current. The 4 electrodes will be focused on the posterior aspect of the knee during the immediate postoperative period and lasting through discharge from the hospital. Once the patient is discharged, he/she will be instructed to use the device as he/she would like, whether it is a continuation of the posterior placement of the electrodes, or a more traditional anterior criss-cross positioning. Patients will be instructed to use the device for 2 hours on, followed by 30 minutes off, as needed. Amount of TENS usage and average intensity used will be recorded. An assessment of blinding will be conducted at the conclusion of the study by asking patients what treatment arm they think that they received.</description>

        <description>Physical Component Score. Physical Component Score (PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. PCS provides emphasis on questions about general health, physical functioning and role playing and bodily pain. PCS is standardized using a z-score transformation and normed to a US population (Based on a 1990 norm) of a score of 50.0 and a standard deviation of 10.0. Normalized scores reported.</description>
