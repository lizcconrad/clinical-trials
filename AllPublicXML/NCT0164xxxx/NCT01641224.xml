  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of pinaverium and an herbal
      medication for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Pinaverium has been in many countries, but
      there is no randomized, double-blind, large sample size, and placebo-controlled study on this
      medication yet. Tong Xie Yao Fang (Formula for pain and diarrhea) is a historically and
      contemporarily used traditional Chinese medicine that can be used for IBS. The hypothesis is
      that the two remedies are effective and safe for IBS treatment when tested by modern clinical
      standards and criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pinaverium bromide (pinaverium), an antispasmodics, is one of the most commonly used IBS
      medication worldwide. However, original clinical studies on pinaverium are scarce. Only five
      original clinical studies from Europe, one from Latin America, and one from Asian were found.
      These studies were single-centered and small sample sized (19 - 53 IBS patients) studies.

      Tong Xie Yao Fang has long been used in China. Its efficacy and safety has not been evaluated
      by modern scientific method.

      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pinaverium and Tong Xie Yao
      Fang for IBS treatment in a double-blind, randomized, and large sample size clinical trial
      using placebo as a control.
