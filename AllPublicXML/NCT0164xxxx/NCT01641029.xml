  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyelonephritis is a serious infection that manifests with fever, back pain, nausea, and
      vomiting. In the U.S., it is estimated that there are 20 cases of pyelonephritis per 10,000
      annually, with the highest incidence in young women. Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes over
      80% of these infections. Over the last two decades, E. coli resistance has emerged to
      commonly prescribed antimicrobials, such as ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
      (TMP/SMX). Most recently, resistance to fluoroquinolones and strains producing
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) have been observed. In order to better understand
      the evolution and current state of antibiotic resistance among E. coli urinary tract isolates
      so as to better inform treatment decisions, the investigators propose to conduct an
      investigation to: a) determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among E. coli
      causing acute pyelonephritis in various patient groups, and specifically healthy
      community-dwellers with uncomplicated infections, b) determine the specific prevalence of
      fluoroquinolone-resistance and ESBL-producing E. coli, and c) determine potential risk
      factors for fluoroquinolone and ESBL-producing E. coli infections.

        Patients will be recruited from ten U.S. university-affiliated medical center emergency
        departments participating in a CDC-collaborative emerging infections sentinel network,
        EMERGEncy ID NET. Patients presenting with symptoms of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis
        will be enrolled by treating physicians or study coordinators.
