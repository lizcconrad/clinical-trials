  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-site (Southern Methodist University (SMU) and Boston University (BU)) study aims to
      examine the effectiveness of exercise interventions for the treatment of generalized anxiety
      disorder (GAD). If effective, the use of exercise as a component of treatment for GAD would
      have a significant public health impact. In addition to improving GAD treatment outcome,
      exercise is expected to offer health benefits and promote further lifestyle changes.

      The present study involves the randomization of 52 adults with GAD to either a 12-week
      combined supervised- home-based moderate-intensity aerobic exercise protocol (EX) or a
      12-week combined supervised- home-based stretching protocol (CTRL). The investigators
      hypothesize that participants in the EX intervention will evidence greater improvements in
      anxiety symptoms and quality of life relative to individuals receiving the control
      intervention.

    <measure>GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a self-reported questionnaire for screening and severity measurement of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

    <time_frame>changes from baseline to week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety sensitivity was measured using the Anxiety Sensitivity Index a 16-item questionnaire designed to assess one's tendency to respond fearfully to anxiety-related symptoms. Data on the reliability and validity of the ASI scales have been favorable .</description>

    <measure>Psychiatric Diagnoses</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening week 0</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic exclusions and lifetime prevalence of Axis I diagnoses will be determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV non-patient version (SCID-NP; First et al., 2004) during Screening Visit 1. The SCID will be administered during by trained doctoral-level interviewers and will be supervised by the PIs, as has been done successfully in the past (e.g., Zvolensky, Leen-Feldner et al., 2004; Smits et al., 2009).</description>

    <description>C-SSRS is a standardized measure of current and past self-injurious behavior, suicidal intent, and suicidal behaviors. The C-SSRS has demonstrated good reliability and validity (Hammad et al., 2006; Posner et al., 2007). The C-SSRS will be administered at the Screening Visit.</description>

    <description>The exercise intervention is a 12-week program involving 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise (65-69% of participant's age-predicted [220-age] maximum heart rate) each week. Participants will complete one 50-minute supervised treadmill exercise session in the laboratory and 100 minutes of exercise on their own. These exercises may include walking, jogging, biking, or other forms of aerobic exercise. The at-home exercise regimen will be individualized for each participant.</description>
