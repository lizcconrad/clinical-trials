  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm, double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study, with
      12 weeks of therapy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DLBS3233 in improving metabolic
      control in newly diagnosed type-2-diabetic patients, as measured by A1c level, fasting and
      2-hours post-prandial plasma glucose, fasting insulin level, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, adiponectin
      level, lipid profile, and body weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two groups of treatment in this study who will receive DLBS3233 or placebo of
      DLBS3233 (with lifestyle modification) for 12 weeks of therapy.

      Clinical and physical examination to evaluate the efficacy and safety as well as measurement
      of fasting and 2-hour post-prandial plasma glucose level will be performed at baseline and
      every 6-weeks-interval. Other clinical and laboratory examinations will be performed at
      baseline and at the end of study.
