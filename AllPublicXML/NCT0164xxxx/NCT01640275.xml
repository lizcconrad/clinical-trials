    <textblock>
      Previous work in animal models suggests that inhalational anesthetic agents may accelerate
      Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, but it is unclear to what extent this may happen in humans.
      Here, the investigators propose to measure Alzheimer's disease-related neural markers in the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients exposed to anesthesia while undergoing neurosurgical
      procedures that require lumbar drain placement. Patients will be randomized to either receive
      inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane or intravenous anesthesia with propofol.

      CSF and blood samples will each be collected at the induction of anesthesia, and then again
      ten and twenty-four hours later. CSF samples will be assayed for amyloid beta, tau, and other
      Alzheimer's disease-associated markers; blood samples will be assayed for serum inflammatory
      markers and used for genotyping studies. These studies should clarify the effect of common
      anesthetic agents on Alzheimer's disease related neural markers.
