  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 20 million Americans have allergic nasal symptoms including stuffiness, sneezing and a
      &quot;runny&quot; nose. AkPharma's Calcium Glycerophosphate used as a nasal spray wash is believed to
      improve these symptoms without side effects common to over the counter and prescription
      medication. It is hypothesized that Calcium Glycerophosphate will have a perceived
      improvement in breathing comfort.

      Subjects will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria and consented if they fit the
      same criteria. They will be instructed on keeping a nasal diary of symptoms &quot;runny, itchy,
      congestion, sneezing, voice changes and throat clearing&quot;. They will have blood drawn for
      allergy testing. After a 1 week run-in, subjects will return their diary. If they still
      qualify based on the diary they will have baseline labs drawn and baseline breathing test
      (Spirometry) performed. They will also have a nasal wash and specimen collection performed.
      They will be instructed on use of the nasal wash. There will be three more weekly visits
      before study conclusion which will include diary submission, Spirometry and nasal wash and
      specimen collection. On the final visit blood will again be collected as well.
