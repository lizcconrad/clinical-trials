      The FDA approved the &quot;limited enrollment&quot; registry to provide us with additional clinical
      data from which to design a pivotal IDE study. FDA has stated that their decision for this
      was based upon &quot;adequate safety information&quot; which was submitted to them as part of the
      original IDE submission. Therefore, the purpose of this &quot;limited enrollment&quot; registry study
      is to gather initial data on the device's performance, when used with a Calcaneal Stem.

    <description>The FFI, Foot Function Index is a validated self-administered scoring system designed to measure the subject's pain, disability and activity levels within the past week. Possible scores range from 0-100 with a lower score representing less pain, greater function and less restricted ambulation.</description>
