    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open label, randomized, pilot study to evaluate safety and efficacy of
      Human Platelet Lysate (HPL) in subjects with Androgenetic Alopecia undergoing hair
      transplantation. The study is being conducted at 2 centers in India. The primary endpoints
      are Increase in Hair Follicle viability after transplant, Improvement in Caliber &amp; Density of
      hair and Improvement in Photographic assessment from randomization to end of study. The
      secondary endpoints are Physicians and Patients self assessment score.
