      This study investigates the effect of high-dose alkylating chemotherapy compared with
      standard chemotherapy as part of a multimodality treatment approach in patients with
      oligo-metastatic breast cancer harboring homologous recombination deficiency.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed infiltrating breast cancer

          -  Oligometastatic disease defined as one to three metastatic lesions, with or without
             primary tumor, local recurrence, or locoregional lymph node metastases, including the
             axillary, parasternal, and ipsilateral periclavicular regions. All lesions must be
             amenable to resection or radiotherapy with curative intent. Staging examinations must
             have included a PET-scan plus diagnostic CT-scan of the chest and abdomen, and an
             isotope bone scan. When the isotope bone scan is doubtful and plain radiographs do not
             explain the abnormality, MRI or CT-scan of the affected skeletal region must be
             performed.

          -  The tumor must be HER2-negative (either score 0 or 1 at immunohistochemistry or
             negative at in situ hybridization in case of score 2 or 3 at immunohistochemistry).

          -  The tumor must be ER positive (≥ 10% nuclear staining at IHC) and poorly
             differentiated (grade 3).

        or ER negative; the rare tumors that are ER-negative and PgR-positive will be eligible, if
        this pattern of hormone receptor expression can be verified in the NKI-AVL reference
        pathology lab.

          -  Known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers are eligible regardless of the estrogen
             receptor status of their tumor.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/l, platelets ≥ 100 x 109/l)

          -  Adequate hepatic function (ALAT, ASAT and bilirubin ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal)

          -  Adequate renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min)

          -  LVEF ≥ 50% measured by echocardiography or MUGA

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Able to comply with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No malignancy other than breast cancer, unless treated with curative intent without
             the use of chemotherapy or radiation therapy

          -  No current pregnancy or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must use
             adequate contraceptive protection.

          -  No concurrent anti-cancer treatment or investigational drugs
