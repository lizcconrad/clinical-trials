    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the knowledge level, attitudes, and perceptions among
      staff of Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) clinics and intravenous drug users (IDUs) who
      attending MMT clinics, which is the most reachable population for HCV/HIV intervention in
      China. This study will also explore the barriers that prevent IDUs from getting HCV/HIV
      intervention/prevention and medical care services. This study will help to understand and
      address this important problem in China and other Asian countries.

      The investigators propose to conduct 3 inter-related studies over 4 years using both
      qualitative and quantitative research methods to address a series of research questions.
      Firstly, The investigators will begin by assessing HCV/HIV knowledge, attitudes, perceptions,
      risk behaviors, and infection among IDUs in MMT clinics (Study 1) and HCV/HIV knowledge,
      attitudes, and HCV/HIV-related services among MMT staff (Study 2). Secondly, based on
      knowledge accumulated from Studies 1 &amp; 2; The investigators will adapt and develop HCV/HIV
      education materials appropriate for Chinese IDUs and drug treatment service providers, and
      then use the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change as a conceptual model to measure if
      our educational program will increase patients' readiness to consider changing HCV/HIV risk
      behaviors and getting medical care for HCV/HIV (Study 3). Finally, by integrating findings of
      these three studies and by consulting with leading experts in HCV/HIV. The investigators plan
      to develop HCV/HIV intervention program applicable in China, which can be tested in future
      formal experimental trials.

What are the most important barriers that impact IDUs obtaining HCV services? What are the important barriers that prevent you from offering HCV/HIV-related service to IDUs? What recommendation do you have to increase HCV/HIV-related medical services in MMT clinics?.</description>
