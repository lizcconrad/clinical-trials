  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;The prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) is approximately 13%. PPD is associated with a
      higher maternal morbidity and mortality, and also with pervasive effects on the emotional,
      cognitive and behavioral development of the infant.

      Stressful life events, socio-demographic and obstetrical risk factors have been associated
      with the risk of PPD. Genetics risk factors of PPD have also been identified. We are
      presently studying for the first time how maternal stressors may interact with genetic
      factors to increase the risk of PPD (Gene x Environment interaction)&quot;.

      &quot;The prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) is approximately 13%. PPD is associated with a
      higher maternal morbidity and mortality, and also with pervasive effects on the emotional,
      cognitive and behavioral development of the infant.

      Stressful life events, socio-demographic and obstetrical risk factors have been associated
      with the risk of PPD. Genetics risk factors of PPD have also been identified. We are
      presently studying for the first time how maternal stressors may interact with genetic
      factors to increase the risk of PPD (Gene x Environment interaction).

      We want first to analyze the allelic association between SNPs of 5-HT, HPA and
      neurodevelopment genes and PPD with a case control association study We then analyse the
      interaction between maternal stressors during pregnancy and SNPS of our candidate genes
      (CRHR1, 5-HTT, TPH, BDNF, HMCN1).

      3000 Caucasian mothers are included after pregnancy in 8 maternities and are evaluated at the
      inclusion, at 8 weeks and at 1 year with DIGS, FISC, EPDS and HAD, Stressful life events
      (Paykel). Blood are collected for all subjects for DNA extraction.

      At week 8 and 1 year after pregnancy we search PPD with EDPS and DSM-IV criteria of
      depression&quot;.
