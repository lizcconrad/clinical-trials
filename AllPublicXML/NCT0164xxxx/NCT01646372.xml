  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether formal instruction on the use of
      cognitive aids in managing a crisis will result in better longterm retention of knowledge and
      skills. In particular, this study examines the impact of cognitive aid teaching on the
      Advanced Cardiac Life Support course.
