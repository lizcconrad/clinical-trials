  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Osmotic Release Oral
      System (OROS) hydromorphone using standardized conversion from prior opioid therapy among
      participants with cancer pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective (study following participants forward in time), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), single-arm, multi-center (conducted in more than one
      center) study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of stable dose of OROS hydromorphone
      among participants with cancer pain. The duration of this study will be 28 days and will
      include visits at: Day 0 (Baseline), Day 7, 14 and 28. The OROS hydromorphone will be
      administered orally for 28 days and dose titration (incremental increase in drug dosage to a
      level that provides the optimal therapeutic effect) will be done every two days upon
      administration of dose. Rescue medication (a medication intended to relieve symptoms
      immediately) of morphine will be permitted throughout the study duration. Efficacy of the
      participants will primarily be evaluated by Brief Pain Inventory score. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) assesses the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions (interference items). The severity items are scored from 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. The interference items are scored from 0=no interference and 10=interferes completely.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Given Rescue Pain Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue medication was a medication intended to relieve symptoms immediately. Rescue medication of morphine was used during the study duration and dose was set at 10-15 percent of the total daily morphine dose which ranged from 10-60 milligram.</description>

For all participants, 24-hour stable opioid dose (of either morphine or oxycodone) will be converted to a single daily dose of OROS hydromorphone using standard equi-analgesic ratios and dose will be increased if needed, but not more than 40 mg and not more frequently than every two days. The study drug will be administered up to 28 days.</description>

          <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant, which ranges from &quot;very much worse&quot; to &quot;very much improved&quot; (as compared to Baseline).</description>
          <population>ITT population included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication at Baseline. &quot;n&quot; signifies those participants who were evaluated for this measure at the specified time point. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

          <description>OROS Hydromorphone was administered as either 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36 or 40 mg oral tablet once daily in the morning. For all participants, 24-hour stable opioid dose (of either morphine or oxycodone) was converted to a single daily dose of OROS hydromorphone using standard equi-analgesic ratios and was increased if needed, but not more frequently than every two days and not more than 40 mg. The study drug was administered up to 28 days.</description>
