      This is a clinical trial to test an experimental drug for the treatment of Eosinophilic
      Esophagitis (EoE)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory disorder of the esophagus and is a
      recognized clinical entity. Symptoms include feeding problems, heartburn, regurgitation,
      vomiting, abdominal pain and food impaction. The symptoms of EoE may be similar to
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) but do not resolve with gastric acid suppression. EoE
      is defined histologically as the presence of &gt; 15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high power
      fields on one or more esophageal biopsy specimens.

      This Phase II study is comparing oral budesonide (OBS) to placebo to demonstrate that OBS
      induces a histologic response and a symptom response using a Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire
      over a 16 week course of therapy.

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Histologic response was defined as a peak eosinophil count &lt;/= 6/high power field (light microscopy) (HPF) across all esophageal levels at the final treatment evaluation (Week 16). An independent, central pathologist determined the peak eosinophil count from the proximal, mid-, and distal levels and selected the maximum peak value. Histopathology data were collected in a blinded fashion.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in The Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) Score at The Final Treatment Period Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' dysphagia symptoms were evaluated using the 4-item DSQ. The questionnaire was developed by the Sponsor, as an ePRO measure, according to the principles of the Final Guidance for Industry for Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PRO Guidance December 2009). All participants used a diary, and responded to Questions 1 (did you eat solid food) and 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If the participant's answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing).The DSQ score was calculated based on responses to Questions 2 and 3 [14 x (sum of points from Questions 2 and 3 in the daily DSQ)/number of diaries with non-missing data]. Baseline was the DSQ score of the 14-day period before randomization. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in The Histopathologic Epithelial Features Combined Total Score at The Final Treatment Period Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Each esophageal biopsy specimen was evaluated microscopically by an independent, central pathologist for signs of epithelial inflammation and lamina propria fibrosis. Histopathologic epithelial features of each available esophageal level biopsy consisting of basal layer hyperplasia, eosinophil peak, dilated intercellular spaces, eosinophil microabcesses, surface layering, surface alteration, and apoptotic epithelial cells were scored and summed. Histopathology data were collected in a blinded fashion. Histopathology epithelial features were scored for both grade and stage. Each feature had a possible score of 0-3 for grade as well as stage. Thus each of the 3 levels had a possible score of 21, and a possible total grade or stage score of 63 for a maximum combined score of 126. The grade and stage score of the lamina propria was not included because the biopsy material was not available. A negative change from baseline indicates that epithelial inflammation decreased.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in The Total Endoscopy Score at The Final Treatment Period Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The gross endoscopic appearance of the esophageal surface was evaluated by a blinded study center physician. Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus were recorded with respect to 5 major categories, including exudates or plaques, fixed esophageal rings, edema, furrows, and strictures. The endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the 5 major categories - grade 0-1 for strictures; grade 0-2 for exudates or plaques, edema, and furrows; and grade 0-3 for fixed esophageal rings for the proximal and distal locations. The maximum endoscopy score was 10 points for each location (proximal and distal), and the total endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the proximal and distal locations (maximum total score of 20 points). Baseline was defined as the endoscopy score at screening. A negative change from baseline indicates that appearance improved.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Activity at The Final Treatment Period Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The physician Investigator (or qualified physician's assistant or nurse practitioner) completed the PGA to provide the global assessment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) disease activity using a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) scale. The VAS is a 100 mm horizontal line on which the right extreme (100) is labeled &quot;worst possible disease activity&quot; and the left extreme (0) is labeled &quot;no disease activity&quot;. The PGA raters were instructed to consider the line for the VAS a continuum with their own medical opinion or judgment of extremes on either end and to draw a vertical line at a point that best approximates the participant's current level of EoE disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates that disease activity decreased.</description>

          <description>Eligible participants entered a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline period. Participants ingested the first dose of placebo in the clinic in the presence of study center personnel, and the remaining doses were ingested at home. Participants took placebo twice daily (bid); once in the morning after breakfast and once in the evening at bedtime; the volume per dose was 10 mL of oral liquid.</description>

The volume per dose was 10 mL of oral liquid (10 mL qd; 0.2 mg/mL). Thereafter, an optional dose increase to 1.5 mg twice daily (bid) (7.5 mL bid; 0.2 mg/mL) and then to 2 mg bid (10 mL bid; 0.2 mg/mL) was allowed for subjects whose response to the 2 mg once daily dose was inadequate, as determined by the Investigator; a dose decrease to 2 mg once daily was allowed at any time.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) Score at The Final Treatment Period Evaluation</title>
        <description>Participants' dysphagia symptoms were evaluated using the 4-item DSQ. The questionnaire was developed by the Sponsor, as an ePRO measure, according to the principles of the Final Guidance for Industry for Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PRO Guidance December 2009). All participants used a diary, and responded to Questions 1 (did you eat solid food) and 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If the participant's answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing).The DSQ score was calculated based on responses to Questions 2 and 3 [14 x (sum of points from Questions 2 and 3 in the daily DSQ)/number of diaries with non-missing data]. Baseline was the DSQ score of the 14-day period before randomization. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Histopathologic Epithelial Features Combined Total Score at The Final Treatment Period Evaluation</title>
        <description>Each esophageal biopsy specimen was evaluated microscopically by an independent, central pathologist for signs of epithelial inflammation and lamina propria fibrosis. Histopathologic epithelial features of each available esophageal level biopsy consisting of basal layer hyperplasia, eosinophil peak, dilated intercellular spaces, eosinophil microabcesses, surface layering, surface alteration, and apoptotic epithelial cells were scored and summed. Histopathology data were collected in a blinded fashion. Histopathology epithelial features were scored for both grade and stage. Each feature had a possible score of 0-3 for grade as well as stage. Thus each of the 3 levels had a possible score of 21, and a possible total grade or stage score of 63 for a maximum combined score of 126. The grade and stage score of the lamina propria was not included because the biopsy material was not available. A negative change from baseline indicates that epithelial inflammation decreased.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Total Endoscopy Score at The Final Treatment Period Evaluation</title>
        <description>The gross endoscopic appearance of the esophageal surface was evaluated by a blinded study center physician. Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus were recorded with respect to 5 major categories, including exudates or plaques, fixed esophageal rings, edema, furrows, and strictures. The endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the 5 major categories – grade 0-1 for strictures; grade 0-2 for exudates or plaques, edema, and furrows; and grade 0-3 for fixed esophageal rings for the proximal and distal locations. The maximum endoscopy score was 10 points for each location (proximal and distal), and the total endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the proximal and distal locations (maximum total score of 20 points). Baseline was defined as the endoscopy score at screening. A negative change from baseline indicates that appearance improved.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Activity at The Final Treatment Period Evaluation</title>
        <description>The physician Investigator (or qualified physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner) completed the PGA to provide the global assessment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) disease activity using a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) scale. The VAS is a 100 mm horizontal line on which the right extreme (100) is labeled “worst possible disease activity” and the left extreme (0) is labeled “no disease activity”. The PGA raters were instructed to consider the line for the VAS a continuum with their own medical opinion or judgment of extremes on either end and to draw a vertical line at a point that best approximates the participant's current level of EoE disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates that disease activity decreased.</description>

        <description>The EoE survey assessed the following symptoms: heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Participants indicated, by checking a box, if they had a change in symptoms (excluding dysphasia or food impaction) within the past 2 weeks. Baseline was defined as the assessment before randomization. Responses were as follows regarding symptoms at the final treatment evaluation: Improved - participant reported a specific symptom at baseline, but changed to no specific symptom (‘Yes’ to ‘No’); No change - participant reported or did not report a specific symptom at both baseline and the final treatment evaluation; Worsened -participant did not report a specific symptom at baseline, but changed to report that specific symptom (‘No’ to ‘Yes’).</description>

        <description>This outcome assessed the symptoms of participants who were symptom-free at baseline. The EoE survey assessed the following symptoms: heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Participants indicated, by checking a box, if they had a change in symptoms (excluding dysphasia or food impaction) within the past 2 weeks. Baseline was defined as the assessment before randomization. Responses were as follows regarding symptoms at the final treatment evaluation: No change - participant did not report a specific symptom at both baseline and the final treatment evaluation; Worsened -participant did not report any symptom at baseline, but changed to report at least 1 symptom at the final treatment evaluation.</description>

        <description>Participants' dysphagia symptoms were evaluated using the 4-item DSQ. The questionnaire was developed by the Sponsor, as an ePRO measure, according to the principles of the Final Guidance for Industry for Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PRO Guidance December 2009). All participants used a diary, and responded to Question 1 (did you eat solid food) and Question 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If the answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Question 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and Question 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing).The DSQ+pain response was defined as a &gt;/= 30% and &gt;/= 50% reduction from baseline in the combined score from Questions 2, 3, and 4. The 2-week DSQ+pain score was calculated by adding points from Questions 2, 3, and 4 and then taking the average of the available scores over each 2-week interval.</description>

If the participant's answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing). Values were calculated for all the days that Question 1 was answered from 14 days prior to baseline visit up to the final treatment period evaluation.</description>

All participants used a diary, and responded to Questions 1 (did you eat solid food) and 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck).

Question 1 is rated as Yes (score=0) or No (score=1); higher values indicate a worse outcome. Baseline was the DSQ score of the 14-day period before randomization. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>
