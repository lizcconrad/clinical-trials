    <measure>Change in the Sum of the Score From the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale and Motor Examination in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (Parts II+III, a UPDRS Subtotal) From Baseline to the End of Double-blind Maintenance Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS assessments (Parts II+III) will be performed at every visit.
For the assessment of the subject's disability, Part II of the UPDRS will be used. Data will be gathered pertaining to the subject's disease state in the &quot;on&quot; state. Subjects will respond to questions about their general state in the week prior to their scheduled visit in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee). For the assessment of the subject's motor function, Part III of the UPDRS will be used and the assessments will be done while the subject is in the &quot;on&quot; state.
The UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living) consists of 13 items scored between 0 and 4. The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) consists of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score is calculated as sum of these 27 individual scores. The sum score ranges from 0 to 160, higher scores denote greater disability.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS assessments (Parts II+III) will be performed at every visit.
For the assessment of the subject’s disability, Part II of the UPDRS will be used. Data will be gathered pertaining to the subject’s disease state in the “on” state. Subjects will respond to questions about their general state in the week prior to their scheduled visit in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee). For the assessment of the subject’s motor function, Part III of the UPDRS will be used and the assessments will be done while the subject is in the “on” state.
The UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living) consists of 13 items scored between 0 and 4. The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) consists of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score is calculated as sum of these 27 individual scores. The sum score ranges from 0 to 160, higher scores denote greater disability.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS assessments (Parts II+III) will be performed at every visit. For the assessment of the subject’s disability, Part II of the UPDRS will be used. Data will be gathered pertaining to the subject’s disease state in the “on” state. Subjects will respond to questions about their general state in the week prior to their scheduled visit in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee). For the assessment of the subject’s motor function, Part III of the UPDRS will be used and the assessments will be done while the subject is in the “on” state.
The UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living) consists of 13 items scored between 0 and 4. The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) consists of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score is calculated as sum of these 27 individual scores. A higher score denotes greater disability.</description>
