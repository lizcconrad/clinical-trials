  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid has benn widely used to reduce perioperative bleeding in several operations
      such as cardiac surgery, liver transplant and joint arthroplasty with good results. Few
      studies in laminectomy had conflicting results and varying in doses. The objective is to
      compare perioperative bleeding in major laminectomy between patients receive doubles doses of
      tranexamic acids (15 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) with who receive pacebo (0.9% NaCl).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      78 patients undergoing major laminectomy (with instrumentation or equal or more than 3 levels
      laminectomy) will be enrolled. We exclude patients who age over 65, anemia, allergy to
      tranexamic acid, history of deep vein thormbosis (DVT), ischemic heart disease (IHD),
      pulmonary embolism (PE), strokes, liver disease, chronic kidney disease with creatinine &gt;2.0
      mg/dl, and coagulopathy. After randomization, before induction and 3 hour after the first
      dose, patients will receive study drug or placebo intravenously. The standard anesthesia and
      monitoring will be tha same for all of the patients. Perioperative mild hypotensive technique
      will be used with the mean arterial pressure more than 60 mmHg and nearly the end, the blood
      pressure will be back to normal for the bleeding check. Hematocrit will be monitored at the
      begining and every two hours. Blood will be given if the hematocrit is below 30%. The
      perioperative fluid will be managed by anesthesiologist who will not know the patients'
      groups. The next morning, the hematocrit and blood creatinine will be checked and if the
      hematocrit is lower than 30%, blood will be given. Perioperative blood loss, total fluid and
      blood transfusion within 24 hours will be recorded. If there are any suspected symptoms and
      signs of DVT, angina, CHF, PE, strokes or other complications, the necessory investigations
      will be done for the definite dignosis and the appropriate treatment will be started
      immediately.
