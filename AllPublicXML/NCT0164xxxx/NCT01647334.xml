  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to use a type of radiation (adaptive radiotherapy) to deliver curative-intent
      treatment to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, whose tumors would otherwise be too
      large for standard curative treatment. The study will use adaptive radiotherapy to achieve
      these goals. Adaptive radiotherapy is a process whereby treatment plans are modified during
      the course of treatment due to patient and tumor variations (ie. weight loss or tumor
      shrinkage). This may allow for dose escalation, while limiting the side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Willing to provide informed consent

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung carcinoma

          -  Locally advanced stage IIIA or IIIB lung carcinoma according to AJCC 7th edition

          -  Expected lung V20 of 35-60%, as determined at the time of 4D-CT simulation

          -  Assessment by medical oncologist and radiation oncologist, with adequate hepatic and
             renal function for administration of cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy, at the
             discretion of the medical oncologist

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical comorbidities or other contraindications to radiotherapy or
             chemotherapy

          -  Prior history of lung cancer within 5 years

          -  Prior thoracic radiation at any time

          -  Metastatic disease

          -  in some select cases, patients with a solitary metastasis (i.e. brain metastasis) may
             receive radical chemoradiotherapy after resection/ablation of their metastatic lesion,
             as standard practice. In such cases, the patient may be enrolled onto this study at
             the discretion of the local principle investigator once the metastasis has been
             treated.

          -  inability to attend full course of radiotherapy of follow-up visits

          -  Pregnant or lactating women
