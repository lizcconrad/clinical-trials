  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to culturally tailor a technology-based individualized
      adherence intervention for Black and Latino patients with uncontrolled HTN or T2DM, who are
      non-adherent to their medications, and determine its acceptability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized controlled trial design, this study will compare the efficacy of a
      tailored adherence intervention (TAI) to a single patient education (PE) session, on
      medication adherence among 40 high-risk Latino patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN)
      who are non-adherent to their prescribed antihypertensive medications. Patients randomized to
      the PE group will receive a single patient education session on HTN and medication management
      by a trained research assistant (RA) at the baseline visit. Patients randomized to the TAI
      group will complete a tailoring survey at the baseline visit to identify the most salient
      adherence barriers to the individual, which will be used to create an individualized
      adherence profile. Following completion of the tailoring survey, patients will collaborate
      with the RA to identify the most suitable mix of intervention strategies for improving
      medication adherence (i.e., reminder aids, motivational interviewing, case management) that
      are matched to the barriers outlined on patients' individualized adherence profiles.

    <description>Medication adherence will be assessed with an electronic monitoring device (EMD). Adherence is defined as the scheduling adherence metric, which is the proportion of days in which a patient takes their medication correctly divided by the total number of days that s/he is expected to take them in that period.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the AI group will participate in 9 sessions with bilingual Health Coaches who will utilize a culturally tailored adherence checklist to identify patient's specific medication adherence barriers. Based on the patient's responses, the Health Coach will then engage in targeted patient-centered counseling to assist patients in developing individualized self-monitoring strategies to overcome these barriers and improve adherence behaviors.</description>
