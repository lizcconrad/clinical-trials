  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard post-operative radiographic protocol for the monitoring of fractures at HSC
      includes post-operative in hospital radiographs as well as radiographs at the two week follow
      up appointment. This is in addition to good quality intra-operative radiographs. With current
      operative techniques and implants, orthopaedic surgeons can achieve reliably stable internal
      fixation. In fact, patients are often allowed to take weight through the fractured limb
      immediately post-operatively. In these cases, redundant post-operative radiographs likely
      represent an avoidable cost to the system financially, and an avoidable cost to the patient
      in additional time spent in hospital and unnecessary radiation exposure.

    <description>Control group: patients will receive standard radiographs post-operative day one or two in hospital, as well as radiographs in clinic at two and six weeks. Each time radiographs are completed, the surgeon or resident will document if a change in fixation position is noted and if a change in patient management will be entertained (addition, modification or maintenance of cast or splint use, modification of or decision not to advance activity level, need for further surgery to adjust fixation or fracture reduction). The patients' time spent in clinic will be recorded upon arrival and upon completion of the patient-physician interaction.</description>

    <description>Treatment group: these patients will not have routine post-operative in hospital radiographs, or radiographs in clinic at two weeks. After examining the patient, the surgeon or resident can order radiographs if required at any time. The decision will be made based on patient complaints of increased pain, appearance of abuse of the splint or cast suggesting lack of compliance or visible clinical deformity of the limb. The reason leading to radiographs will be documented by the ordering physician. If radiographs are ordered based on a wound complication, this will be specifically documented. Radiographic findings will be documented on a form identical to that used for the control group.</description>
