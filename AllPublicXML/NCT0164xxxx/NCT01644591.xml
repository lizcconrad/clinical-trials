  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
      can control the disease in patients with more than 3 melanoma brain tumors.

      SRS is the delivery of focused, high-dose radiation given in a single session to the tumors
      with a minimal dose given to uninvolved areas of the brain.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 49 patients will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Procedure:

      You will receive SRS on Day 1. There will be 1 day of treatment.

      You will sign a separate consent form for SRS that will explain the procedure and risks in
      detail.

      Study Visits:

      At 1, 6, and 9 months (+/- 14 days) after Day 1, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will have an MRI to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will complete the same 8 cognitive function tests and 3 questionnaires you completed
           at screening.

      At 4 and 12 months (+/- 14 days) after Day 1, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will have an MRI to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will complete the same 8 cognitive function tests and 3 questionnaires you completed
           at screening.

      If the disease returns after treatment, you may receive additional SRS. Your treatment
      options will be discussed with you.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your active participation on the study will be over when you have completed the Month 12
      visit.

      If an MRI scan shows that you have more than 15 lesions, you will be withdrawn from the
      study. Your doctor(s) will discuss future treatment options with you.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will return to the clinic for follow-up visits.
      The following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will have an MRI to check the status of the disease.

    <description>Time to local failure estimated using product-limit estimator of Kaplan and Meier for each treatment arm. Local control and distal control in brain measured by contrast-enhanced brain MRI scan using modified RECIST criteria. For local control, progressive disease (PD) is considered local failure, or stable disease with deterioration of neurological examination with a grade III or worse toxicity on the CTCAE v4.0 nervous system disorders toxicity grading scale. All others complete response (CR), partial response (PR), asymptomatic stable disease (SD) are deemed success.</description>

    <measure>Neurocognitive Decline</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline HVLT-R score compared to HVLT-R score in patients surviving 4 months. Preservation of function defined as improvement of HVLT-R score or decline by 4 points or less. Failure defined as decline by 5 or more points. Time to neurocognitive decline estimated for each treatment arm using product limit estimator of Kaplan and Meier. Logrank test stratified by the stratification factors used at randomization to compare the 2 treatment arms with respect to the time to neurocognitive decline.</description>

SRS performed on day 1. 8 cognitive function tests given at baseline and at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after Day 1 of radiation treatment. 3 questionnaires regarding quality of life and symptoms given at baseline and at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after Day 1 of radiation treatment.

             and be able to withhold anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications a minimum of 24 hours
             prior to radiosurgery treatment (or until INR normalizes), on the day of treatment and
             24 hours after radiosurgery treatment has concluded.

          9. Patients can be undergoing concurrent systemic therapy, such as temozolomide, at the
             discretion of their treating oncologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients are excluded if they have been treated with whole brain radiotherapy within
             the prior 3 months.

          2. Patients are excluded if they have a history of metastatic cancer in addition to
             melanoma or a history of uncontrolled non-metastatic cancer. Patients with localized

             with a serum beta HCG no greater than 14 days prior to study registration, or
             breast-feeding. (The exclusion is made because gadolinium may be teratogenic in
             pregnancy).

          5. Patients are excluded if there is any history of gadolinium allergy.

          6. Patients are excluded if they are unable to obtain a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             scan for any other reason.
