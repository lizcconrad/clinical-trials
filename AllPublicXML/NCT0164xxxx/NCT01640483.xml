    <textblock>
      Post-hoc analysis of psychotherapy outcome data suggest that psychodynamic techniques for
      Major Depressive Disorder are differentially efficacious dependent on personality traits of
      the patient. More specifically, supportive techniques are hypothesized to be more efficacious
      for dependent patients, interpretative techniques to be more efficacious for self-critical
      patients, and mixed supportive/interpretative techniques to be more efficacious for mixed
      dependent/self-critical patients. Moreover, supportive techniques are hypothesized to impact
      on depressive symptoms through increased relational capacities while interpretative
      techniques impact through increased self-understanding.

      These hypotheses are tested in an experimental single case design with three dependent, three
      self-critical and three mixed dependent/self-critical depressive patients. These patients go
      through a time-limited (50 sessions) experimental treatment which exists of a sequence of
      four A phases (control conditions), one B phase (supportive techniques only), one C phase
      (interpretative techniques only), and one BC phase (mixed supportive/interpretative
      techniques).

    <time_frame>25 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>•Measures each session: The BDI-II with adapted instructions is used to measure depressive symptoms. The process variables associated with change in depressive symptoms will be studied in an exploratory way by means of Psychotherapy Process Q Set (PQS) ratings of the transcripts of the sessions.
•Measures during A phases: Besides the SCID-I (session 1 and 2 of each A phase) and SCID-II (session 3 of each A phase) interviews, the therapist will administer the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ).</description>

    <description>• Measures that are applied each session (also during A phases): The relational capacities (CDPS-RC) and insight (CDPS-IN) subscales of the Capacity for Dynamic Process Scale (CDPRS) of nine researcher-rated items.
• Measures that are applied during A phases: The therapist will administer the Clinical Diagnostic Interview (CDI, session 4 and 5 of each A phase),and a broad-spectrum set of self-report outcome measures, including the Symptom Check List (SCL-90-R), the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems - 64 (IIP-64), the SELVES and the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI).</description>
