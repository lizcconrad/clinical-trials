  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endonase, a kind of protease, is known to cause both extensive degradation of mucins and a
      reduction in mucus viscosity. As part of the search for more effective forms of therapy
      against H. pylori when it colonizes not only the surface of the surface mucosal cells but
      also the surface mucous gel layer covering the mucosal surface of the stomach. The
      investigators decided to investigate whether or not endonase might have additive effect of
      pronase on the efficacy of eradication therapy against Helicobacter pylori.
