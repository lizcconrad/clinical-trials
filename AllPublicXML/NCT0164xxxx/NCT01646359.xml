  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients under mechanical ventilation, Usefulness of dynamic indices based on the
      heart-lung interactions for guiding volume resuscitation has been well validated. Recently,
      validity of pulse pressure variation (PPV) has been also reported to predict fluid
      responsiveness. Oesophageal Doppler (OED) allows continuous monitoring of several important
      hemodynamic variables. Of the OED variables, corrected flow time (FTc) has been evaluated and
      used as a preload index, and has been reported to predict fluid responsiveness. Prone
      position caused physiologic and hemodynamic changes and influenced the predictability and
      cut-off values of SVV and PPV for fluid responsiveness. In this prospective controlled study,
      the investigators evaluated the validity of PPV and FTc as predictors for fluid
      responsiveness in supine and prone position in patients undergoing posterior lumbar spinal
      fusion

    <description>1.Esophageal doppler monitor (CARDIO Q®, DELTEX MEDICAL. Brighton, U. K.)-inserted into the esophagus and positioned approximately 35-40 cm from the teeth. The position of OED prove was confirmed by continuously measuring blood flow velocity in the descending thoracic aorta and focused to find the optimum peak velocity and waveform signal.</description>

    <description>2.philips Intelivue MP70 monitors (Intellivue MP70, philips medical Systems, Suresnes, France) -a radial arterial cannula was inserted and arterial pressure waveforms were monitored through Philips Intelivue MP70 monitors. In the monitor, PPVauto was displayed in real-time. It based on automatic detection algorithms, kernel smoothing, and rank-order filters.</description>
