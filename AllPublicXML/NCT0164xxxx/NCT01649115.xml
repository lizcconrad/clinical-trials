    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Lifestyles Passport
      Program (HLPP) in preventing infant and childhood obesity. It is hypothesized that the
      participants in the intervention arm will exhibit less excessive weight-for-length gain from
      4- to 6-months of age. In 2-years and 5-years, it is predicted that the participants in the
      intervention arm will yield lower Body Mass Index (BMI) z-scores than the participants in the
      control arm, who receive usual care.

    <description>The child's weight and length will be extracted from the medical record at the child's 4-month and 6-month old office visit and the weight-for-length z-scores will be calculated. The difference between each arm's z-score will be compared.</description>

    <time_frame>At 2-years and 5-years of the child's age.</time_frame>
    <description>At 2-years and 5-years of age, the child's height and weight will be extracted from the medical record and BMI will be calculated. Each arm's BMI z-score will then be compared.</description>

    <measure>Mother's Knowledge, Skill, Attitude and Behavior.</measure>

    <description>At baseline, all participants will answer a battery of questionnaires, including a pre-test and the &quot;Newest Vital Sign&quot; assessment tool. The day after the intervention, a post-test will be administered over the phone to the participants in both arms. Two months after the baby is born the same post-test and the &quot;Newest Vital Sign&quot; assessment tool will be administered in person.</description>

    <description>The Usual Care arm, will not be receiving the interactive nutrition education. They will be meeting with the Registered Dietitian twice in person after the participants are randomized in each arm, and once on the phone. The first meeting, they will be receiving pamphlets and handouts, which are typically given as part of usual care. The second meeting is a post-test assessment and Newest Vital Sign Assessment Tool. The second meeting and the follow-up phone call are both the same for usual care and the Healthy Lifestyles Passport arm.</description>
