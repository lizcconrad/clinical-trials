  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is one of the common endocrine disorders. The major
      clinical symptoms involve stones, bones, abdominal groans and psychiatric moans. Increased
      parathyroid cell proliferation and decreased calcium-mediated control of the PTH secretion
      are characteristic findings. The most common cause of PHPT is adenoma followed by hyperplasia
      and carcinoma.The molecular mechanisms involved in parathyroid tumorigenesis are partially
      known. Few genes have been identified and their roles are under study.

      The genes which are under study by different groups are unable to give a definite direction
      towards the understanding of parathyroid tumorigenesis and the mechanism involved in
      overgrowth of parathyroid tissue. So identifying different proteins and their regulation
      pattern from adenomas to carcinomas will be the initial steps towards understanding the
      proteins involved in tumorigenesis of parathyroid tissues. By using proteomics approach one
      can generate protein level information. In this study, using a combined approach based on 2 D
      gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS), the investigators propose to study a
      comparative proteomics to examine the changes of protein profiles in parathyroid tumor
      tissues with normal and hyperplasic parathyroid tissues. This work plan will help us to
      understand differentially expressed proteins in patients with PHPT. This will help in
      understanding the disease and identifying better diagnostic and curative measures of the
      disease. The investigators are also planning to access nuclear morphometry changes in
      sporadic parathyroid tumors. It will help in establishing cellular and nuclear change pattern
      variations from normal to parathyroid tumors.

      Subjects:

      All the PHPT patients attending outdoor patient clinic of Endocrinology and General Surgery
      department of Nehru Hospital, PGIMER, Chandigarh will be enrolled in this study.

      Sample collection:

      A parathyroid tissue sample will be taken from the patients undergoing for parathyroidectomy.
      Samples will be collected immediately after surgery, snap frozen and stored at -80oC until
      use. In addition 10 ml of blood will also be taken from these patients for estimating
      biochemical parameters.

      Controls:

      Normal parathyroid gland will be used as control and it will be obtained from patient
      undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter as an elective procedure at the institute.

        Patients visiting the hospital for hypercalcemia, bone pain, renal problems and other
        symptoms related to primary hyperparathyroidim will be consider. Investigations and
        clinical symptoms will be confirmed for primary hyperpathyroidism. Finally if patient
        suggested for surgery then he will be included in the study
