    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open label, pilot study to evaluate safety and efficacy of Autologous
      Human Platelet Lysate (HPL) in subjects with Facial Wrinkles (Nasolabial Folds). The study is
      being conducted at 2 centers in India. The primary endpoints are Improvement in Wrinkle
      Severity Rating Scale ( WSRS ) as per ATLAS photographic grading at rest and on full smile
      and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). The secondary endpoints are improvement in
      photographic assessment, Physician's assessment scores, Patient's assessment scores form
      enrollment to end of study.
