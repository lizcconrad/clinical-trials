      This randomized phase II clinical trial studies probiotic supplementation in preventing
      treatment-related diarrhea in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Probiotics may
      help prevent diarrhea caused by treatment with chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Incidence of moderate/severe (grade 2-4) diarrhea graded according to Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      II. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Diarrhea (FACIT-D) Trial Outcome
      Index.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on dose delays or reductions due to
      gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity.

      II. To evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on anti-diarrheal medication use.

      III. To evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on overall health-related quality
      of life (HR-QOL).

      IV. To evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on febrile neutropenia.

      V. To evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on adverse GI effects. VI. To
      evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on overall survival. VII. To evaluate the
      effects of probiotic supplementation on progression free survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive a mixture of Lactobacillus plantarum strain 299v, Bifidobacterium
      lactis probiotic supplement, and Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) for 9 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID 9 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months.
