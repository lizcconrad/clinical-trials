      The aim of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the operation of a
      prehospital teleconsultation system in the Emergency Medical Service.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six ambulances from five different Emergency Medical Service (EMS) districts are equipped
      with a portable telemedicine system. The paramedics can use this system to contact a so
      called &quot;tele-EMS physician&quot; after consent of the patient is obtained. The tele-EMS physician
      has an audio-connection to the EMS team and receives vital parameters (e.g., ECG, pulse
      oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure) in real-time. Also 12-lead-ECGs can be transmitted to
      the tele-EMS physician. The transmission of still pictures - taken with a smartphone - and
      video streaming from the inside of the ambulance can be carried out, if meaningful. The
      tele-EMS physician supports the EMS team in obtaining all relevant medical history, ECG
      diagnosis, general diagnosis and can delegate the application of medications. This can be
      carried out to bridge the time to the arrival of an EMS physician or in less severe cases
      without an EMS physician on-scene. The safety and efficacy of the introduction and operation
      of this system should be evaluated.
