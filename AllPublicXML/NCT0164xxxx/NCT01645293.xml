  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cutaneous CD30 positive lymphoma will receive systemical and topical treatment
      with their own genetically modified T cells. Treatment evaluation consists of assessment of
      safety and preliminary evidence of response.

    <description>Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of treated lesion.
Partial Response (PR): At least 30% decrease in the sum of two diameters compared to the initiatal diameters of the treated lesion.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least 20% increase in the sum of two diameters of treated lesions.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of two diameters while on study.</description>
