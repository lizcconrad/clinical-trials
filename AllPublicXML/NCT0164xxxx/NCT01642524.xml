    <textblock>
      The TOPHR HIT trial is a clinical trial of patients experiencing blunt trauma who present
      with an injury to their head which makes them unconscios. The study compares two different
      fluids given to the patient in the out of hospital setting by a paramedic. The two fluids are
      salt water (standard treatment) versus a higher concentration of salt water mixed with a
      sugar (study fluid). The patients have an equal chance of receiving either fluid and the
      paramedic and the patient and the treating trauma surgeon do not know which fluid was
      provided in the out of hospital setting.

      Study Objective

      The primary objective of this study is to report feasibility in accordance with the
      methodology described by Lancaster and Dodds, specifically addressing:

        1. baseline survival rates for the treatment and control group to aid in the design of a
           definitive multicentre trial.

        2. randomization compliance rate.

        3. ease of protocol implementation in the out-of-hospital setting.

        4. adverse rate of Hypertonic Saline Dextran (HSD) infusion.

      The secondary objectives include measuring the effect of HSD in modulating the
      immuno-inflammatory response to severe head injury and its effect on modulating the release
      of neuro-biomarkers into serum; evaluating the role of serum neuro-biomarkers in predicting
      patient outcome and clinical response to HSD intervention; evaluating effects of HSD on brain
      atrophy post-injury and neurocognitive and neuropsychological outcomes.
