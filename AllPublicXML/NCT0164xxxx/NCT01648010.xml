  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of intravesical instillation of TC-3
      Hydrogel disposable device for retention of mitomycin C chemotherapeutic drug in the urinary
      bladder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-muscle-Invasive Bladder cancer is mainly treated by tumor resection (Trans Urethral
      Resection - TUR), followed by series of intravesical instillations of prophylactic
      chemotherapeutic drugs as Mitomycin C (MMC).This treatment approach is limited due to rapid
      dilution the chemotheraputic drug by the incoming urine and clearance by urination.

      TheraCoat core technology is based on a reverse thermal (low viscosity at 5Â°C) degradable gel
      (TC-3)for MMC retention in the urinary bladder.

      Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel,in a liquid state, is mixed with MMC.TC-3 mixed with
      MMC is instilled to the bladder by a catheter.Following gel insertion to the bladder, the gel
      solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder. Upon contact with urine the gel
      dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder.

      Intravesical MMC using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment efficiency due to
      prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder exposure to MMC.

    <description>Study participants undergoing bladder instillation with MMC mixed with TC-3 6 hours prior to radical cystectomy. During these six hours the MMC levels in urine and blood will be measured every hour and the Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax)and Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be calculated and compared to the standard toxicity level in patients treated with MMC in saline (standard of cure). In addition, patient tolerability to treatment will be evaluated.</description>
