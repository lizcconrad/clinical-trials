  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology characterized by
      peripheral polyarthritis, symmetric, which leads to joint destruction and deformity. It is
      estimated that the RA reaches about 0.5% of the population. According to data from DATASUS,
      was responsible for 26,671 hospitalizations, 229 deaths and cost exceeding R$ 20 million in
      2005-2007.

      The main bodily changes are related to joint problems, however, systemic manifestations are
      also found in organs such as lung and heart. Although cardiovascular diseases are the most
      responsible of the deaths AR, pulmonary complications are common and account for 10% to 15%
      of all mortality. Anaya and colleagues point out that the pulmonary involvement contributes
      significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Although pulmonary involvement is a
      frequent manifestation in RA, the prevalence and nature of rheumatoid lung disease has not
      yet been precisely established. Several lung disorders such as interstitial pulmonary
      fibrosis, pulmonary nodules and bronchiolitis may ocorrer1. Laitinen et al point out that
      studies of lung function appear to be a valuable helper for radiography in the evaluation of
      pulmonary involvement in connective tissue diseases. Previous studies indicate that patients
      with RA have an increased incidence of abnormal lung function, according to assessments
      including spirometry, lung volume tests and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide.

      Thus, the main objective of this study is to analyze the respiratory mechanics of patients
      with RA. Specific objectives were to seek to understand whether a relationship exists between
      duration of rheumatoid disease and lung function in these patients.

      For this, the investigators used 18 subjects in the control group, free of pulmonary disease
      and / or heart, all nonsmokers. In the RA group, a total of 72 patients divided into 4 groups
      of 18 volunteers each, classified according to disease duration (0-5 years, 6-10 years, 11-15
      years and&gt; or = 16 years). It is noteworthy that all patients in the RA group will also be
      non-smokers, since it is already known in the literature that smoking impairs lung function.
      All individuals will perform the function test with a trained technician and qualified to
      function. The examinations will be conducted: Forced oscillation technique and spirometry, in
      that order.

        The control group will consist of healthy subjects, nonsmokers, who had no episode of
        respiratory infection thirty days before the examinations.

        The group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis will be comprised of individuals treated at
        the Department of Rheumatology (Hospital Universitártio Pedro Ernesto) nonsmokers, who had
        no episode of respiratory infection thirty days before the examinations.
