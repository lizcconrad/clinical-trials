    <textblock>
      Aggressive behavior (AB) is a major burden to society with severe socio-economic
      consequences. Genetic studies suggest a high heritability of AB; in particular, the low
      expressing allele of the MAOA gene (MAOA-L) has been associated with increased AB. Recent
      neural aggression models have suggested a dysfunctional emotion regulation circuit including
      amygdala, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortex. Dysregulated serotonergic (5-HT)
      projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the amygdala have been suggested to promote
      aggressive behavior. This finding is well in line with the observation that the MAOA-L allele
      leads to a reduced expression of monoamine oxidase A and thus to an overflow of 5-HT in
      serotonergic cortico-amygdalar projections. However, due to methodological and ethical
      constraints, the neural substrates of AB are difficult to assess. A possible solution is the
      use of virtual violence which permits AB against virtual characters without direct
      consequences for any real person and can be easily applied in functional imaging experiments.
      There is evidence that virtual and real aggression share common neural substrates. AB in
      violent video games inhibits rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala in line
      with the suggested neurophysiological circuits underlying real-life AB.

      Our study plan comprises the assessment of brain activation patterns during virtual AB in a
      violent video game with functional magnetic resonance imaging under three experimental
      conditions in randomized, double-blind fashion:

        1. Increase of synaptic 5-HT with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, Cipralex
           Â®);

        2. reduction of synaptic 5-HT with the Rapid Tryptophan Depletion Test (RTD); and 3)
           Placebo.

      A blood sample genotyping will assess the allelic expression of the MAOA gene. We hypothesize

        1. a modification of the ACC-amygdala system by the serotonergic intervention and

        2. an interaction with the genotype concerning the MAOA gene. The results of this study
           will give valuable insights into the neurogenetic biology underlying aggression which
           will open new perspectives for therapeutical and pharmacological intervention.
