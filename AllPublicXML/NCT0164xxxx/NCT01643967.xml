      -  Clinical trial, open, phase III, multicenter, prospective, comparative, controlled,
           randomized to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the use of ozone released by Philozon
           Medplus device versus conventional therapy in treating patients with diabetic foot.

        -  Primary Objective: evaluate the efficacy and safety of ozone released by the device
           Philozon Medplus in the treatment of patients with diabetic foot.

        -  Secondary objective: evaluate ozone analyzer by environmental ozone Philozon Medplus
           released by the device in the clinical setting after using the device for rectal
           insufflation in a patient with diabetic foot.

        -  Study population: Patients of both sexes, consisting of 100 patients over 18 years,
           patients with diabetic foot.

        -  Treatment: 50 patients receive ozone therapy (topical and rectal insufflation of ozone).
           50 patients will receive conventional treatment (Sunflower Oil).
