      The aim of this trial has been to explore the effects of self-positioning on cognitive
      performance in the work environment using a standardized cognitive test battery to evaluate
      executive function under two conditions: sitting and standing.

      Methods: This counterbalanced controlled trial involved 17 men (mean age +/-SD: 29.8 +/- 5.5)
      all with a science background and graduate degrees. The participants were accustomed to
      working in an open environment and none of whom currently using standing desks. We used a
      modified version of the CNS Vital Signs (CNSVS) test battery to assess cognitive executive
      function (CEF) in two typical work positions - standing and seated. Participants were
      randomly assigned to a standing or seated position to begin the testing procedure. Upon
      completion of the first test round they were instructed to rest for 10 min. in a dark room
      with no distractions before commencing the second round of testing positioned in the
      alternate fashion. The main outcome measure was a CNSVS score in each of the six CEF domains
      in the two different work positions
