        <description>A subject has been considered “on” when he/she felt the effects of L-dopa. The subject recorded the exact time of L-dopa intake and his/her status at the time of the L-dopa dose. In instances when the subject was 'off' when taking his/her L-dopa, he/she recorded the exact time their status changed to 'on'.
Note for percent change calculations: when absolute time at Baseline was 0 hours, the absolute Baseline value was assumed to be 1 minute for calculation purposes.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Relative Time Spent “on” From Baseline to the End of Double-blind Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>A subject has been considered “on” when he/she felt the effects of L-dopa. The subject recorded the exact time of L-dopa intake and his/her status at the time of the L-dopa dose. In instances when the subject was &quot;off&quot; when taking his/her L-dopa, he/she recorded the exact time their status changed to &quot;on&quot;.
Note for percent change calculations: when relative time at Baseline was 0%, the relative Baseline value was assumed to be 0.1 for calculation purposes.
Relative time spent “on” will be calculated in two stages. Each valid daily diary will have an associated relative time “on” calculated as relative time “on” for day = 100*[total absolute time “on” for day/ absolute time awake for day]. Relative time spent &quot;on&quot; is then calculated by averaging the daily relative time “on” for the valid days of that visit.</description>

        <title>Change in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS Part III Motor Examination) During “on” Periods From Baseline to the End of Double-blind Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) assessment consists of 27 questions, measured on a 5-Point scale (0 to 4). The sum score is calculated as sum of these 27 individual questions. This score ranges from 0 to 108, higher scores denote greater disability.
A subject has been considered “on” when he/she felt the effects of L-dopa. The subject recorded the exact time of L-dopa intake and his/her status at the time of the L-dopa dose. In instances when the subject was 'off' when taking his/her L-dopa, he/she recorded the exact time their status changed to 'on'.</description>
