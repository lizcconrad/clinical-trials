    <textblock>
      Subjects will be studied on four occasions in the Clinical Research Unit at Washington
      University School of Medicine. Sessions and drugs are:

        1. Intravenous buprenorphine

        2. Sublingual buprenorphine

        3. Cyclosporine, then intravenous buprenorphine. Subjects then take oral cyclosporine twice
           daily, until

        4. Sublingual buprenorphine; continue oral cyclosporine twice daily for 5 days
