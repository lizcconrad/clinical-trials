  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also have other diseases
      referred to as comorbidities. Often these patients require health care by a variety of health
      care professionals from services linked to hospitals and in the community. Unfortunately,
      sometimes it may be difficult for these patients to receive appropriate care in a timely
      manner resulting in a trip to the emergency department. As well, patients may benefit from
      education that enables them to recognize early signs indicating they are getting sicker and
      to self-manage their disease. Our study will examine a strategy that includes a case manager
      who will make weekly phone contact with COPD patients with comorbidity that present either to
      the emergency department or are admitted to hospital. Weekly contact will focus on teaching
      patients to recognize worsening symptoms and self-management strategies. The case manager
      will work with patients, caregivers, community health care providers and hospital specialists
      to promote communication and optimize care delivery. The investigators will examine the
      impact of our intervention on the need for emergency department visits and hospital
      admission. The investigators will also examine the impact on patients' health related quality
      of life, number of COPD exacerbations, and disease progression.
