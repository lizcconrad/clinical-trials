  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Freedom from fecal incontinence reintervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 36 months after the last Solesta treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is freedom from Fecal Incontinence Reintervention. Patients will be evaluated at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the last Solesta treatment for the occurrence (or lack of occurrence) of Fecal Incontinence Reintervention. Fecal Incontinence Reintervention includes Fecal Incontinence treatment of sphincteroplasty, implantation of artificial bowel sphincter, retreatment with Solesta, graciloplasty, sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) or other surgical interventions that occur more than 3 months after the last primary Solesta treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 36 months after last Solesta treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness endpoint of Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life using the Rockwood instrument will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 36 months after last Solesta treatment. Patients will fill out a questionnaire at screening visit and at follow up visits. The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life instrument is a questionnaire completed by patients that assesses the impact of quality of life as it relates to Lifestyle, Coping/Behavior, Depression/Self perception and Embarrassment. The FIQL instrument consists of a total of 29 questions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline,3, 6, 12, and 36 months after last Solesta treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness endpoint of CCFIS will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 36 months after last Solesta treatment. The investigator will calculate the CCFIS based on a patient interview. The CCFIS is a summed score of 5 individual parameters (i.e., frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid, solid, of need to wear pad, and of lifestyle changes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Perceived Effect Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 6, 12 and 36 months after last Solesta treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness endpoint of Global Perceived Effect Score will be assessed at 6, 12 and 36 months after last Solesta treatment. Global perceived effect is a subjective score and reflects the patient perception of their degree of FI after treatment compared to the period before treatment and ranges from 1-7 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Fecal Incontinence Reintervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from 6 to 36 months after last Solesta treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who undergo Fecal Incontinence Reintervention the effectiveness endpoint of Time to Fecal Incontinence Reintervention will be measured from the date of last treatment with Solesta to the date of first Fecal Incontinence Reintervention. Fecal incontinence reinterventions will include any of the following FI treatments: sphincteroplasty, implantation of artificial bowel sphincter, retreatment with Solesta, graciloplasty, SNS or other surgical interventions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anatomic stability of the Solesta</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at time of Solesta treatment and again at 6 and 36 months after the last Solesta treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the relative anatomic stability of the Solesta Injectable Bulking Agent in a subpopulation of patients enrolled at 3-4 sites as assessed by transrectal ultrasound. Solesta will be assessed by comparing anatomical positioning of the Solesta implant, as determined by transrectal ultrasound at Visit 3a (for patients who did not receive a second Solesta treatment) or Visit 3b (for patients who received a second Solesta treatment at Visit 3a) to positioning at 6 and 36 months after the last Solesta treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of any peri-injection device related infectious adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from time of injection up to 2 weeks after Solesta treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary safety endpoint will be the occurrence of peri-injection device related infectious Adverse Events for patients treated with or without prophylactic antibiotics (as decided by treating physician) prior to injection.</description>
