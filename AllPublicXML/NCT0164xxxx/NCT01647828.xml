    <textblock>
      The study consists of a Phase1b lead-in portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of OMP-59R5 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine followed by a Phase 2,
      multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled portion to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      OMP-59R5 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in subjects with previously
      untreated stage IV pancreatic cancer.

          2. Histologically or cytologically documented stage IV ductal adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas.

          3. Performance Status (ECOG) 0 or 1

          7. For women of child-bearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test at screening and
             use of physician-approved method of birth control from 30 days prior to the first
             study drug administration to 30 days following the last study drug administration.

          8. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use physician-approved
             contraception from 30 days prior to the first study drug administration to 30 days
             following the last study drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following major exclusion criteria will not be eligible for
        participation in the study:

          1. Neuroendocrine tumors (i.e., carcinoid, islet cell cancer) of the pancreas.

          2. Known brain metastases.

          3. Prior therapy, including systemic therapy, surgical resection or radiation for newly
             diagnosed stage IV pancreatic cancer.

          4. Presence of any serious or unstable concomitant systemic disorder incompatible with
             the clinical study (e.g., substance abuse, uncontrolled intercurrent illness including
             active infection, arterial thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism).

          5. Any disorder that would significantly compromise protocol compliance.

          6. Prior non-pancreatic malignancy treated with chemotherapy. Prior malignancies treated
             with surgery and/or radiotherapy alone must be in remission ≥3 years. The following
             prior malignancies are allowable irrespective of when they occurred: in situ carcinoma
             of the cervix, in situ ductal breast cancer, low-grade local bladder cancer, and
             nonmelanotic skin cancer.

          7. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
