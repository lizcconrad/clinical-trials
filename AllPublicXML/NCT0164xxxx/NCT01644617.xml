  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-related effectiveness, the safety and the
      tolerability of MK-8237, compared to placebo, in the treatment of house dust mite
      (HDM)-induced allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis in adults. The primary hypothesis is that
      administration of MK-8237, compared to placebo, results in dose-related improvement in the
      average total nasal symptom score (TNSS) determined during environmental exposure chamber
      (EEC) challenge.

    <measure>Average Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) During Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) Challenge Session at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The average total TNSS included the evaluation of 4 nasal symptoms: itchy nose, blocked nose, runny nose, and sneezing. The endpoint was based on participant diary entries over the last 4 hours of the EEC challenge session at Week 24. TNSS was the total of scores for the 4 nasal symptoms, each scored on a 4-point rating scale (0=no symptoms; 1=mild symptoms; 2=moderate symptoms; 3=severe symptoms). The total TNSS ranged from 0 to 12 points. The 24-week TNSS was analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and baseline TNSS as covariates and expressed as a least squares mean with 95% confidence interval. A decrease in TNSS for participants receiving either dose of MK-8237 compared to placebo indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

The endpoint was based on participant diary entries over the last 4 hours of the EEC challenge session at Week 24. TSS was the total of scores for the 4 nasal symptoms and 2 ocular symptoms, each scored on a 4-point rating scale (0=no symptoms; 1=mild symptoms; 2=moderate symptoms; 3=severe symptoms).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced At Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to last dose of treatment plus 2 weeks of follow-up (Up to 26 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a cancer, was associated with an overdose, was another important medical event.</description>

        <title>Average Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) During Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) Challenge Session at Week 24</title>
        <description>The average total TNSS included the evaluation of 4 nasal symptoms: itchy nose, blocked nose, runny nose, and sneezing. The endpoint was based on participant diary entries over the last 4 hours of the EEC challenge session at Week 24. TNSS was the total of scores for the 4 nasal symptoms, each scored on a 4-point rating scale (0=no symptoms; 1=mild symptoms; 2=moderate symptoms; 3=severe symptoms). The total TNSS ranged from 0 to 12 points. The 24-week TNSS was analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and baseline TNSS as covariates and expressed as a least squares mean with 95% confidence interval. A decrease in TNSS for participants receiving either dose of MK-8237 compared to placebo indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

          <title>Average TNSS During EEC Challenge Session at Week 8</title>
          <description>The average total TNSS included the evaluation of 4 nasal symptoms: itchy nose, blocked nose, runny nose, and sneezing. The endpoint was based on participant diary entries over the last 4 hours of the EEC challenge session at Week 8. TNSS was the total of scores for the 4 nasal symptoms, each scored on a 4-point rating scale (0=no symptoms; 1=mild symptoms; 2=moderate symptoms; 3=severe symptoms). The total TNSS ranged from 0 to 12 points. The Week 8 TNSS was analyzed using the ANCOVA model with treatment and baseline TNSS as covariates and expressed as a least squares mean with 95% confidence interval. A decrease in TNSS for participants receiving either dose of MK-8237 compared to placebo indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

          <title>Average TSS (TNSS + TOSS) During EEC Challenge Session at Week 8</title>
          <description>The average total TSS included the evaluation of the 4 nasal symptoms of the TNSS (itchy nose, blocked nose, runny nose, and sneezing) plus the 2 ocular symptoms of the TOSS (gritty/feeling/red/itchy eyes and watery eyes). The endpoint was based on participant diary entries over the last 4 hours of the EEC challenge session at Week 8. TSS was the total of scores for the 4 nasal symptoms and 2 ocular symptoms, each scored on a 4-point rating scale (0=no symptoms; 1=mild symptoms; 2=moderate symptoms; 3=severe symptoms). The total TSS ranged from 0 to 18 points. The Week 8 TSS was analyzed using the ANCOVA model with treatment and baseline TSS as covariates and expressed as a least squares mean with 95% confidence interval. A decrease in TSS for participants receiving either dose of MK-8237 compared to placebo indicated an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <description>D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae serum IgG4 levels were measured using the Immunocap® assay at baseline and Week 8. IgG4 levels were expressed in Log 10 scale mg/L. Mean Week 8 IgG4 levels were compared to the mean IgG4 levels at baseline. Analysis was based on the ANOVA model with treatment as the fixed effect and reported as a least squares mean with 95% confidence interval.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced At Least One Adverse Event (AE)</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a cancer, was associated with an overdose, was another important medical event.</description>
