    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct a follow-up study with women that had participated
      in the Yale Pink and Blue Study of depression in pregnancy and birth outcomes. The Yale Pink
      and Blue Kids Study is a follow-up study with the mothers and also with the children they
      were pregnant with in Yale Pink and Blue. These children are now between the ages of 4 and 8
      years old, which is a perfect time to look at developmental outcomes in children. This study
      will look at children with exposure to nicotine or antidepressants during pregnancy, as well
      as children who were not exposed. The investigators hypothesis is that children who were
      exposed to either nicotine or antidepressants in pregnancy will have poorer developmental
      outcomes than children who were not exposed. The investigators are also interested in
      determining whether nicotine exposure or antidepressant exposure results in poorer outcomes.

      The investigators specific aims are:

        1. To determine whether pre-school and school aged offspring exposed to maternal cigarette
           smoking or antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have social-emotional
           problems compared to children who were not exposed to cigarettes or antidepressants
           during pregnancy.

        2. To determine whether pre-school and school aged children who were exposed to prenatal
           maternal cigarette smoking or antidepressants during pregnancy display cognitive
           impairments as compared to children who were not exposed to either prenatal maternal
           cigarette smoking or antidepressants.

        3. To determine if pre-school and school aged children who were exposed to maternal
           prenatal cigarette smoking or antidepressants display impaired motor development as
           compared to children who were not exposed to maternal cigarette smoking or
           antidepressants in pregnancy.

    <measure>Externalizing and internalizing behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-2) is one of the most widely-used measures for evaluating maladaptive behavioral and emotional problems in children between the ages of 2 and 18. It assesses internalizing (i.e., anxious, depressive, and overcontrolled) and externalizing (i.e., aggressive, hyperactive, noncompliant, and undercontrolled) behaviors. In addition to the CBCL-2, we will use direct observation of a 2-minute mother-child interaction session to measure externalizing and internalizing symptoms, as parent report on the CBCL-2 may be biased by maternal psychopathology.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive impairment is measured using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-2), which measures both verbal and nonverbal intelligence through questions , riddles, and pictures. A computer test, CogState, will also assess cognitive functioning, specifically executive functioning through card-related tasks that will ask a child to respond in different ways.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fine &amp; Gross Motor Development</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Fine and Gross Motor Skills will be measured using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2) (10), the most widely administered test of fine and gross motor skills in children ages 4 to 21. Administration time is approximately 60 minutes. Subtests include: Fine Motor Precision, Fine Motor Integration, Manual Dexterity, and Bilateral Coordination.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Each subject is a previous study participant known to this research team who has agreed to
        be contacted about future studies. We will review only their research records and not
        medical records in order to determine eligibility. There are no subjects for whom the
        ability to give informed consent can be questioned. All of the subjects were at least the
        age of 18 at the time of their initial PAB participation between 2005-2008, and thus are at
        least age 20 at the present time. All subjects are English speaking.

        These are women who participated in the PAB Study (HIC #12394) and delivered a singleton
        birth (no twins or triplets) between 2005-2008. We are inviting them and their children
        (now aged 4-8) to participate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who participated in the Yale Pink and Blue Study and had children born between
             2005 and 2008.

          -  Exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy will be defined as those women with no exposure in
             pregnancy and continuous use of SSRIs (defined as taking at least one SSRI during
             every trimester).

          -  Exposure to nicotine will be defined as no exposure (no cigarettes during pregnancy),
             light exposure (an average of less than one cigarette a day over pregnancy duration),
             and heavy exposure (an average of one cigarette a day over the duration of pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Spanish-Speaking women and women who live over a one hour driving distance from Yale
             will be considered ineligible.

          -  Children are not eligible if their mother had gestational exposure to prescription
             drugs in the FDA-defined category of D or X, since this can confound our assessment.

          -  Women with discontinuous use of SSRIs (defined as using SSRIs during pregnancy, but
             not every trimester) will also be excluded.
