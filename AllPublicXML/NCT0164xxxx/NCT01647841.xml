  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how differences in the nutritional status and
      concentration of hormones and cytokines associated with cachexia in HIV+ and HIV- pregnant
      women living in a semi-rural and rural region of northern Tanzania affect fetal growth,
      pregnancy outcomes and early infant health and development. The study hypothesis is that HIV+
      women will have worse nutritional status and a greater degree of cachexia which will
      negatively impact fetal growth, pregnancy outcomes and early infancy health and development.
