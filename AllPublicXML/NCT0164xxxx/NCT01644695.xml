    <textblock>
      Abdominal wall incisional hernia is a common finding in patients who have undergone previous
      intra-abdominal surgeries. Common methods of abdominal fascial closure include primary
      closure, mesh inlay versus onlay, with or without component separation. All these methods
      have been shown to have recurrence rates for hernia between 3%-60% in the literature. The
      study describes the investigators innovative and preferred method for reconstruction of the
      abdominal wall as BARS (bony anchoring reinforcement system). This method manages the
      abdominal fascial integrity to reduce the recurrence of incisional hernia while providing an
      aesthetically superior abdominal wall contour.

      â€¢ Overview of Research

        -  100 anticipated subjects

        -  Data collection methods- Patients will be evaluated with serial history and physical
           exams, as well as EMG evaluations. Patients will be asked to report their degree of
           function and satisfaction.

        -  Data analysis methods -Data that we will collect from patients will serve as anecdotal
           evidence to support the research theory.

        -  We will collect data from patients from testings conducted at the hospital and private
           office. We will be conducting pre-testing, post-testing, compare results, and surveys.

        -  The anticipated significance of this research study is that this procedure may greatly
           improve the quality of life of these severely debilitated patients, reduce the morbidity
           and mortality rates, and reduce the health care cost burden of chronic care and
           recurrent hospitalizations.

        -  The BARS technique for incisional hernia reconstruction provides excellent reinforcement
           with improved contour, decreased recurrence rates and decreased morbidity for the
           abdominal wall.

    <description>Abdominal exposure was obtained via a lower horizontal incision, a vertical incision, or through a combination horizontal/vertical (ie fleur-di-lis) pattern. Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of intra-abdominal adhesions with hernia sac excision was performed prior to fascial closure. Primary closure of the abdominal fascia was performed with a combination of components separation and placement of biologic mesh over the fascial incision line in onlay fashion. Typically three bone anchors were used to secure the synthetic mesh at the pubic symphysis and two bone anchors to the ASIS bilaterally. The superior aspect of the marlex mesh was sutured to fascia avoiding any incorporation of the costal perichondrium. Quilting sutures were used to secure the mesh to the rest of the abdominal fascia.</description>

            <description>The subjects selected for this trial were over 18 years of age with an appropriate complex, incisional hernia. These patients were consented and treated with the BARS(bony anchoring reinforcement system)procedure.
Bony Anchoring Reinforcement System : Abdominal exposure was obtained via a lower horizontal incision, a vertical incision, or through a combination horizontal/vertical (ie fleur-di-lis) pattern. Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of intra-abdominal adhesions with hernia sac excision was performed prior to fascial closure. Primary closure of the abdominal fascia was performed with a combination of components separation and placement of biologic mesh over the fascial incision line in onlay fashion. Typically three bone anchors were used to secure the synthetic mesh at the pubic symphysis and two bone anchors to the ASIS bilaterally. The superior aspect of the marlex mesh was sutured to fascia avoiding any incorporation of the costal perichondrium. Quilting sutures were used to</description>
