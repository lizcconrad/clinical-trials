  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts can confer health
      benefits. In vitro and clinical studies support the idea that lactobacilli have protective
      effects on oral health. A recent study in which preschoolers consumed milk drinks enriched
      with Lactobacillus rhamnosus, reported a reduction in caries, as well as additional benefits
      to children.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of daily consumption of milk beverages
      enriched with Lactobacillus rhamnosus on the incidence of caries in preschool Chilean
      children.

      In this randomized controlled trial, preschool children belonging to Integra Foundation will
      be invited to participate. After obtaining parentÂ´s informed consent, clinical and
      microbiological testing of saliva at baseline, 6 m, 12m and 18m will be performed.
      Differences in prevalence and incidence of caries, dmft and microbial diversity between
      groups will be assessed.
