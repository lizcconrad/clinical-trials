  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the use of the PARI LC Sprint Sp
      nebulizer in the treatment of asthma in children under 36 months reduces the duration of
      hospitalization.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether the use of the LC Sprint Sp
      Nebulizer results in:

      A-shortened duration of oxygen-dependence.

      B-reduced side effects by assessing the patient's heart rate before and 30 minutes after the
      first aerosol and noting the occurrence of desaturation &lt;90% during the nebulisation
      sessions.

      C-increased acceptance of the aerosol, measured via a questionnaire given to the patient's
      parents at the end of hospitalization (a single questionnaire will be completed by either
      parent or both parents).

      D-shortened length of stay based on the following discharge criteria: observation of a
      respiratory severity score ≤ 2 (Clinical Asthma Score (CAS)) for at least 12 consecutive
      hours and a transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2)&gt; 94% when awake or &gt; 91% during sleep.
