      Primary Objective:

      - To assess effectiveness of prophylactic treatment of hematological complications (grade ≥ 3
      neutropenia) resulting from cabazitaxel treatment for 21 days after treatment initiation.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  PSA response rate;

        -  Descriptive assessment of CTC (circulating Tumor Cells);

        -  Rates of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia and grade ≥3 diarrhea over the
           treatment period;

        -  Description of the Health Quality of Life of the patients;

        -  Incidence of adverse events.

          -  History of congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months,
             or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris or uncontrolled hypertension;

          -  Uncontrolled severe illness or medical condition (including uncontrolled diabetes
             mellitus)

          -  Presence of severe comorbidity, which in the opinion of the investigator, puts the

          -  Known seropositivity for HIV;

          -  Presence of significant psychiatric or neurological disease, in the investigator's
             opinion;

          -  Presence of uncontrolled hypercalcemia;

          -  Refusal to use appropriate contraception during the study period;

          -  Participation in any clinical trial in the last 12 months, unless there is benefit to
             the patient to be justified by the principal investigator

          -  Concurrent or planned treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of
             cytochrome P450 3A4/5

          -  Inadequate organ and bone marrow function

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
