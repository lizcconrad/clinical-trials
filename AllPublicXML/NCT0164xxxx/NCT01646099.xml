    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the effectiveness of a Sun Protection Strategies
      internet-based program for kidney transplant recipients. Since the medication taken to
      preserve the kidney transplant puts kidney transplant recipients at increased risk of
      developing a sunburn as well a skin cancer, the program will help people learn how to
      practice effective sun protection for their condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive interviews about an internet-based sun protection strategies program will be
      performed with up to 45 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who have participated in past
      surveys. A second group of 150 KTRs will be asked to evaluate the internet-based module for
      the effectiveness of information. A third group of 12 KTRs will be asked to evaluate the
      internet-based module for usability. A fourth group of 160 KTRs will be asked to take part in
      a randomized controlled trial evaluating the fully developed internet-based sun protection
      strategies program.

      Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at risk to develop skin cancer. Adequate sun
      protection after transplantation can reduce the risk of developing skin cancer. In 2006, the
      National Kidney Foundation (NKF) found that sun protection education delivery and content
      varied among transplantation centers. Clinicians rarely knew when to initiate education about
      skin cancer risks and prevention including timing and scope, and rarely demonstrated
      understanding of the importance of reminders for and repeated education of patients.
      (National Kidney Foundation 2006) The NKF supported standard, formal, well timed skin cancer
      prevention information and sending reminders to KTRs at the beginning of summer.

      Aims:

        1. To explore culturally sensitive use of terms describing ethnic cultural perceptions of
           sun burning, pigment darkening after sun exposure and description of skin color by the
           amount of photoprotective pigment in the skin.

        2. To pilot test the internet-based sun protection brochure with English speaking KTRs
           representing 3 ethnic groups: White, Black and Hispanic.

        3. To explore understanding of the importance of sun protection and the KTRs' confidence in
           their being able to practice sun protection.

    <description>Use of sun protection will be measured using 10 questions about what a person regularly does in summer during a warm sunny day and during a cloudy day regarding: 1) use of sunscreen; 2) wearing hat; 3) shirt with sleeves; 4) sunglasses; and 5) staying in the shade. The scores for these questions will be summed to derive a dichotomous measure of sun protection use (1= use of sun protection often or always; 0 otherwise).</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three telephone interviews will be done on Mondays after at least 2 holiday weekends in which the weather is reported as sunny or partly sunny by the national weather service (Memorial Day, 4th of July and Labor Day) as well as one sunny non-holiday weekend. The KTR will be asked if they experienced a sunburn or skin irritation. The response will be dichotomous (yes/no).</description>

    <description>Prior to summer, KTRs who agree to participate will receive a text message with their access code to the Internet intervention to access from their homes on a personal device. After online completion of baseline assessments, participants will be randomized to receive the intervention or general skin care information (control). Following the initial use, the participants may revisit the Internet intervention on a personal device or at the doctor's office on a tablet PC. Over the next 6 weeks, sun protection text reminders will be sent to intervention KTRs' cell phones and they will respond that they read the message. Control participants will receive text messages about general skin care.</description>
