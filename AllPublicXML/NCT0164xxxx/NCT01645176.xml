      The purpose of this study of a combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and atorvastatin is
      to learn about the effects in inflammation and pain in patients with Osteoarthritis of the
      knee. These medications are FDA approved and commercially available.

    <measure>Change in Synovitis</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MRI readings performed independently by two musculoskeletal radiologists, using a semi-quantitative scoring system based on MRI assessment of knee OASynovitis scored using axial &amp; sagittal CE-MRI sequence, while effusion &amp; bone marrow lesions were scored using non-CE-MRI sequences of parent study.
Synovitis defined as enhancing thickened synovium (&gt;2 mm) &amp; was evaluated at nine sites of joint-medial &amp; lateral parapatellar recess, suprapateller, infrapatellar, intercondylar, medial &amp; lateral perimeniscal, &amp; adjacent to anterior &amp; posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL/PCL) in all subjects. Synovial thickness was scored semi-quantitatively based on maximal thickness in any slice at each site as follows: grade 0 if &lt;2mm, grade 1 if 2-4 mm &amp; grade 2 if &gt;4mm. For assessment of whole knee synovitis scores of all sites were summed and categorized: 0-4 normal or equivocal synovitis; 5-8 mild synovitis; 9-12 moderate synovitis &amp; &gt;/= 13 severe synovitis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ambulatory subjects with OA of the knee with symptoms for at least 6 months and pain
             on the majority of days in the last 30 days. Symptoms must include knee joint pain.

          2. Male or female adults age &gt;40 years with a body mass index &lt;35

          3. Radiographic evidence of at least one osteophyte in either knee on posteroanterior
             (PA) and lateral standing, flexed x-ray.

          4. A Kellegren-Lawrence score of 2-3, or KL score of 1 accompanied by a clinically
             apparent effusion in the index knee.

          5. A WOMAC pain score of &gt;8 on the index knee at screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A requirement for treatment with high potency opioids for pain relief.

          2. Unwilling to abstain from NSAIDs and/or other analgesic medications except
             acetaminophen (i.e., COX-2 inhibitors, tramadol) for 48 hours and acetaminophen for 24
             hours prior to pain assessments during the study. Subjects taking low dose aspirin for
             cardiovascular health may remain on their stable dose throughout the study.

          3. On an unstable dose of NSAIDs or analgesics for at least 1 months prior to screening
             visit 1.

          4. Using a handicap assistance device (i.e., cane, walker) &gt;50% of the time.

          5. Undergoing new physical therapy or participating in a weight loss or exercise program
             that has not been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening visit 1 and will not
             remain stable during their participation in the study.

          6. Had a previous history of arthroscopic or open surgery to the index knee in the past 6
             months or planned surgery during study follow up.

          7. Had joint replacement surgery in the index knee.

          8. Received corticosteroid, short acting hyaluronic acid, or other intraarticular
             injections of the index knee within 3 months of screening visit 1 and/or not willing
             to abstain from treatments for the duration of the study

          9. A history in the past 5-10 years of reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
             psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis associated with inflammatory
             bowel disease, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis or fibromyalgia.

         10. Clinical signs and symptoms of active knee infection or radiographic evidence of
             crystal disease other than chondrocalcinosis (i.e. gout).

         11. A history of abnormal laboratory results &gt;2.5 x ULN indicative of any significant
             medical disease, which in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the subjects
             participation in the study

          <title>Change in Synovitis</title>
          <description>MRI readings performed independently by two musculoskeletal radiologists, using a semi-quantitative scoring system based on MRI assessment of knee OASynovitis scored using axial &amp; sagittal CE-MRI sequence, while effusion &amp; bone marrow lesions were scored using non-CE-MRI sequences of parent study.
Synovitis defined as enhancing thickened synovium (&gt;2 mm) &amp; was evaluated at nine sites of joint-medial &amp; lateral parapatellar recess, suprapateller, infrapatellar, intercondylar, medial &amp; lateral perimeniscal, &amp; adjacent to anterior &amp; posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL/PCL) in all subjects. Synovial thickness was scored semi-quantitatively based on maximal thickness in any slice at each site as follows: grade 0 if &lt;2mm, grade 1 if 2-4 mm &amp; grade 2 if &gt;4mm. For assessment of whole knee synovitis scores of all sites were summed and categorized: 0-4 normal or equivocal synovitis; 5-8 mild synovitis; 9-12 moderate synovitis &amp; &gt;/= 13 severe synovitis.</description>
