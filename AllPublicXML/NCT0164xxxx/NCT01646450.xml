      A single arm, open label, prospective, phase IV trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of

      IV) NSCLC and mutated EGFR.

        -  Primary endpoint to assess progression-free survival

        -  Secondary endpoints to assess the overall survival, objective response rate, disease

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of first documentation of tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival was assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant was known to have died, the time to death was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant was censored at the last date they were known to be alive.</description>

    <measure>Objective response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with an objective response. An objective response (OR) was defined as a patient having a best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response.</description>

          -  Positive EGFR Mutation.

          -  No previous systemic anticancer therapy.

          -  Measurable lesion according to RECIST with at least one measurable lesion not
             previously irradiated, unless disease progression has been documented at that site.

          -  Provision of written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of clinically active Interstitial Lung Diseases (Patients with chronic,

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to icotinib or any of the excipients of this product.

          -  Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
