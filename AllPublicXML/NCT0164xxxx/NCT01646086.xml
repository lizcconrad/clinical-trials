  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the long term goal of strengthening behavioral weight loss programs, the purpose
      of this project is to test an enhanced, daily weight tracking instruction against the current
      standard of care (weekly weight tracking) and an alternative mode of care (no weight
      tracking).

      The investigators postulate that daily weight tracking will boost ongoing awareness of and
      engagement in dietary intake and physical activity monitoring, thus improving weight loss
      outcomes. The central hypothesis of the study is that daily weight tracking will improve
      weight loss processes and outcomes relative to less frequent weight tracking, without adverse
      effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the pernicious reach of obesity and the evidence that current behavioral treatments are
      modestly effective at changing weight, efforts to refine behavioral recommendations in order
      to improve weight loss interventions are crucial. Frequency of tracking body weight presents
      itself as a prime target for behavioral enhancement during weight loss. Daily self-monitoring
      (e.g., of dietary intake and physical activity) is already well-established as a central
      component of the behavioral weight loss process. However, the current standard of care in
      behavioral weight loss with regard to weighing is weekly tracking of weight, and some
      programs caution against any weight tracking. It has been suggested that frequent weight
      tracking may have a negative impact on mental health and outcomes during weight loss, but
      there are minimal data that address this concern experimentally in the context of an active
      weight loss program. Observational evidence from behavioral weight control trials and
      community studies suggests that greater frequency of tracking weight is associated with
      better weight outcomes. Stronger experimental evidence is needed to establish a causal link
      between weight tracking and weight outcomes and to elucidate the impact on mental health
      during weight loss. To achieve the long-term goal of strengthening behavioral weight loss
      programs, the purpose of this project is to test an enhanced, daily weight tracking
      instruction against the current standard of care (weekly weight tracking) and an alternate
      model of care with very limited data (no weight tracking). In pursuit of study goals, 336
      overweight and obese adults will be recruited and randomized to one of three 12-month weight
      loss interventions with a 12-month follow-up (24 months total time in study): the standard of
      care (weekly weight tracking during weight loss), an enhanced condition (daily weight
      tracking during weight loss), or a comparison condition (no weight tracking during weight
      loss). The rationale behind this proposal is that within the context of social ecology and a
      social-cognitive framework of behavior change, enhancement of this key environmental feature
      (i.e., the weight tracking environment) during weight loss will contribute to success by
      promoting self-efficacy for this critical behavior. Specific aims of the study will seek to
      determine the effects of weight tracking frequency on the weight loss process and outcomes,
      as well as to elucidate the effects of weight tracking frequency on mental health during
      weight loss. This study will have the expected outcome of enhancing the standard of care for
      weight loss, leading to better weight control for overweight and obese adults and thus
      directly mitigating the public health impact of the obesity crisis.

    <measure>Perceptions of Weight Tracking</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete an 8-item questionnaire to assess beliefs about their weight tracking assignment during the study. The measure asks participants to rate daily, weekly, or no weight tracking in terms of ease, interest level, ability to remember, awareness, reward value, usefulness, understanding, and how motivated they are to engage in their assigned weight tracking frequency. These items measure aspects of cue strength and motivational value, both of which are important to the process of behavior modification within a social-ecological frame (DiClemente et al., 2001; Elder et al., 2007)</description>

    <measure>Barriers to Weight Tracking</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To elucidate factors that may impede engagement in daily or weekly weight tracking, participants will complete an assessment of perceived barriers to tracking weight. Items for this measure were adapted from a measure of barriers to diet and exercise developed by a member of the research team and used in numerous weight loss studies These items will provide feedback on factors that may interfere with weight tracking and will provide guidance for adaptation and use of weight tracking instructions for future interventions.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete brief screening items developed for the study to assess smoking status, sedentary behavior (television viewing) and days per week of engaging in weight control behaviors, including diet and physical activity monitoring. Weight tracking frequency (never, every other month, monthly, weekly, or daily) and number of body weight scales at home will also be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Dietary Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ, 2010) is a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that assesses usual intake and portion size of 124 foods. Responses are scored and analyzed using proprietary Diet*Calc software, which provides reasonable and valid estimates of macronutrient and caloric intake compared to 24-hour recall administrations (Millen et al., 2006) and alternate FFQ protocols (Subar et al., 2001). A subset of 168 participants (50%; 56 per treatment condition) will be randomized at baseline to a 24-hr dietary recall protocol.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>

    <description>The Paffenbarger Activity Questionnaire (PAQ; Paffenbarger et al., 1978) will be administered to provide an estimate of calories expended per week in leisure time physical activities. The PAQ has been associated with weight loss outcomes in intervention trials (e.g., Harris et al., 1994). A subset of 168 participants (50%; 56 per treatment condition) will be randomized to a 7-day accelerometer protocol at baseline and 12 months to enhance physical activity measurement during active weight loss, to elucidate any changes in daily patterning of activity that might occur during intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Mood States</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form (PANAS-X) will be administered as a momentary assessment of mood during randomly selected intervention sessions. The measure, consisting of 60 adjectives that are rated on a five-point Likert scale (from 1=very slightly or not at all to 5=extremely), assesses positive and negative affect, basic negative emotions (fear, hostility, guilt, sadness), basic positive emotions (joviality, self-assurance, attentiveness), and additional mood states (shyness, fatigue, serenity, surprise).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life Events</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Life Experiences Survey (Sarason et al., 1978) will assess a broad range of life changes and events that could affect participation in weight tracking or other study recommendations. We expect that participants who endorse a greater number of stressful life events will have poorer adherence, will be less able to maintain tracking diaries, and will experience greater negative affect relative to those with fewer life events during the study (Dunkley et al., 2003; Sarason et al., 1978).</description>

    <description>Measures used to screen participants prior to study entry will be repeated during the trial for ongoing monitoring. These include the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns to assess binge eating, and the SCOFF Eating Disorder Screening Questionnaire to assess presence of symptoms associated with anorexia or bulimia.</description>
