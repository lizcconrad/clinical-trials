    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the use of a single-use negative pressure wound
      therapy system (NPWT) will have an effect on the reduction of post-surgical incision healing
      complications following breast reduction surgery and to assess the medium-term aesthetic
      appearance and quality of the resultant scar,compared with standard of care dressings.

      The aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the
      Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) system (PICO) with regard to the reduction
      of postsurgical incision healing complications during the immediate postoperative treatment
      phase, and to assess the medium-term aesthetic appearance and quality of the resultant scar,
      in patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty, compared to standard care.
