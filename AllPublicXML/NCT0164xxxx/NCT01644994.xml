  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to introduce a new therapeutic method of intracavitary chemotherapy (cisplatin)
      combined with a fibrin carrier (Vivostat®) after pleurectomy/decortication or extrapleural
      pneumonectomy in a phase I and II study for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma patients by
      evaluation of the safety in a dose-escalating model (phase I), and confirmation of safety and
      efficacy in phase II with the maximum tolerated dose in phase I.
