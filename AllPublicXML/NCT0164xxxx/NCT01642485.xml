  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moxifloxacin is routinely used as a probe to confirm assay sensitivity in thorough
      electrocardiogram (ECG) studies. It has been shown that a meal shortens the QT interval,
      which may affect pharmacokinetics (PK) and/or pharmacodynamics (PD) of the study drug.
      However, there is no published data clarifying this issue. There is also a paucity of data
      investigating ethnic differences of the effects of medicines on QTc.

      The aims of the study were to compare the effect of different food contents to placebo on the
      changes in ECG and to demonstrate the effect of insulin, C-peptide and glucose on the ECG.
      This was done by giving different treatments on separate days, which included intravenous
      insulin, a high carbohydrate breakfast [&gt;70%], and a calorie reduced low carbohydrate
      American FDA standard breakfast. Moxifloxacin 400 mg was used as a positive control and was
      given with and without food to Caucasian and Japanese volunteers to investigate racial
      differences.

      This study was initially performed in 24 healthy Caucasian and Japanese volunteers with an
      option to increase the sample size to up to 54 volunteers. The decision to increase the
      sample size to 32 was based on the standard deviation of the ECG intervals observed in the
      first 24 volunteers. This analysis was performed by an independent statistician under blinded
      conditions.

      Each volunteer participated in 2 periods. Each period consisted of 1 baseline day (D-1)
      followed by 3 study days (D1 - D3) when the various food effect and drug treatments or
      placebo were administered. All volunteers received all treatments. Moxifloxacin was always
      given on D3 to prevent any carryover effect and there was a minimum washout period of 3 days
      in between the 2 periods.

      How well the treatments (insulin/glucose, high carbohydrate breakfast, calorie reduced
      breakfast and moxifloxacin) were tolerated by the volunteers was assessed and any side
      effects noted.

      We compared the effects of the various treatments between Caucasian and Japanese volunteers.

      Moxifloxacin and placebo were given to volunteers by mouth, i.e. they were asked to swallow
      them with water. The different types of breakfast were provided which volunteers were asked
      to eat. Insulin and glucose were administered intravenously (Insulin/glucose clamp). Hence,
      the study was performed as an open-label design.

      This study was conducted as a single site study at Richmond Pharmacology/ St George's
      University of London.

    <description>Scott et al (2002) demonstrated an increase in the heart rate of 10bpm in some healthy subjects following ingestion of a carbohydrate meal. There was significant correlation between the resultant hyperinsulinaemia and an increase in skeletal muscle blood flow, and sympathetic activity, with a reduction in vascular resistance.
If postprandial insulinaemia is a significant influence on the QT interval, then carbohydrate rich meals would be expected to show greater effect. Therefore, to explore this on two separate days of the study subjects will be given one of two different types of breakfast:
A high carbohydrate content breakfast, (&gt;70% carbohydrate)
A reduced calorie FDA standard breakfast, (58% fat, low carbohydrate content) to determine effect on QT interval.</description>

    <description>A euglycaemic/hyperinsulinaemic clamp, (DeFronzo, 1979) involves acutely raising the plasma insulin levels to a steady state and maintaining a state of euglycaemia with a glucose infusion, thereby effectively stopping endogenous insulin and C-peptide release. This technique will confirm whether hyperinsulinaemia has any effect on the QT/QTc interval.</description>

          <description>Subjects participating in the study attended for screening, two treatment periods (periods 1 and 2) of 4 assessment days each and a follow-up visit. Data obtained on study days 1 and 2 compared the ECG effects of different types of food and placebo. Each period consisted of a baseline ECG day (day â€“1) and treatment days (days 1â€“3). Moxifloxacin was given in fasted condition or with Continental breakfast, on day 3 of each study period. The two periods were separated by at least 3 days to allow for the effects of moxifloxacin to wash-out. No wash-out was required between the other treatments investigated. The ECG and samples for PK and PD analysis on the treatment days were taken at the corresponding clock time points as on the baseline days. Each subject received all treatments and all the comparisons between treatment effects were made intra-individually reducing the anticipated variability and thereby reducing the sample size.</description>

        <title>The Effect of Food (Fasted and Fed State) on the Degree of QT Prolongation Caused by Moxifloxacin</title>
        <description>The primary baseline corrections were calculated using averaged QTc baseline values (the mean of all median readings recorded for each time-point on the baseline Day -1). This single value (QTcbaselineAV) was used to calculate Î”QTc for each study period.</description>

        <population>Since the baseline was used as a covariate in the analysis, using the standard deviation of the change from baseline, in the simple sample size formula is justified. Assuming a standard deviation of 7 msec for the single differences, sample sizes for the sum can therefore work with a standard deviation of 6.5 msec.</population>

            <description>This study was designed as an open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial that evaluated the effect of a 400 mg oral dose of moxifloxacin in fasted conditions to a baseline and a placebo treatment. Data obtained on study days 1 and 2 compared the ECG effects of different types of food and placebo. Each period consisted of a baseline ECG day (day â€“1) and treatment days (days 1â€“3). Moxifloxacin was given in either the fed or fasted condition, on day 3 of each study period. The two periods were separated by at least 3 days to allow for the effects of moxifloxacin to wash-out. The ECG and samples for PK and PD analysis on the treatment days were taken at the corresponding clock time points as on the baseline days. Each subject received all treatments and all the comparisons between treatment effects were made intra-individually reducing the anticipated variability and thereby reducing the sample size.</description>

        <title>The Food Effects (Calorie Reduced FDA Breakfast and Carbohydrate Rich Continental Style) on QTcF</title>
        <description>Scott et al (2002) demonstrated an increase in the heart rate of 10bpm in some healthy subjects following ingestion of a carbohydrate meal. There was significant correlation between the resultant hyperinsulinaemia and an increase in skeletal muscle blood flow, and sympathetic activity, with a reduction in vascular resistance.
If postprandial insulinaemia is a significant influence on the QT interval, then carbohydrate rich meals would be expected to show greater effect. Therefore, to explore this on two separate days of the study subjects will be given one of two different types of breakfast:
A high carbohydrate content breakfast, (&gt;70% carbohydrate)
A reduced calorie FDA standard breakfast, (58% fat, low carbohydrate content) to determine effect on QT interval.</description>

            <title>Insulin Clamp</title>
            <description>A euglycaemic/hyperinsulinaemic clamp was used to stop any endogenous C-peptide and insulin production. The clamp acutely raised the plasma insulin concentrations to a steady-state and maintained glucose concentrations at/or slightly lower than the individual subjects baseline reading. For each subject two 18G cannulas were inserted, one in the antecubital fossa for insulin and glucose infusions, and one for pharmacokinetic (PK) and blood glucose sampling.</description>

            <description>A euglycaemic/hyperinsulinaemic clamp involves acutely raising the plasma insulin levels to a steady state and maintaining a state of euglycaemia with a glucose infusion, thereby effectively stopping endogenous glucose and insulin production, and as a result reducing the release of C-peptides. This technique will firstly test whether hyperinsulinaemia has an effect on QT interval, and secondly whether C-peptide levels play any role in the proposed effect on the QT interval.</description>
