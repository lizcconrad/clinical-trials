    <textblock>
      Stanford Goals is a large-scale, community-based randomized controlled trial of an
      innovative, interdisciplinary, multi-component, multi-level, multi-setting (MMM) approach to
      treating overweight and obese children. Primary Research Question: Will a 3-year, innovative,
      interdisciplinary, multi-component, multi-level, multi-setting (MMM) community-based
      intervention to treat overweight and obese children significantly reduce BMI compared to an
      enhanced standard care/health and nutrition education active comparison intervention?
