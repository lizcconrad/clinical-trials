      The purpose of this study is to compare the changes measured by Somanetics Invos cerebral
      oximeter to the mean arterial pressure at brain level in patients having elective shoulder
      replacement surgery. The Somanetics Invos System measures and monitors the oxygen saturation
      (rS02) of blood in the brain tissues to help prevent brain injury or other complications. The
      investigators hypothesize that maintaining normocarbia and systemic mean arterial pressure at
      or above 70mmHg during general anesthesia in the beach chair position will decrease the
      number of cerebral deoxygenation events during the procedure.
