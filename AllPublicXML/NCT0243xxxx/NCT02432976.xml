  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A diminution of quality of life is often reported by patients after coronary artery bypass
      graft (CABG) surgery. A part of this diminution could be explain by postoperative left
      ventricular (LV) dysfunction.

      Exenatide (Byetta®) is an incretin mimetic, characterized by an anti-hyperglycemic effect
      that depends on the blood glucose level. Recent data have suggested that exenatide could
      improve LV function by an inotropic effect in patients suffering from cardiogenic shock or
      from congestive heart failure. Moreover, patients suffering from congestive heart failure
      reported a better quality of life when they were treated with exenatide compared to placebo.

      The investigators hypothesize that perioperative exenatide infusion could improve
      postoperative quality of life in CABG surgery patients.

      The ExeQOL study is an ancillary study of the ExSTRESS trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov
      identifier: NCT01969149).

      The ExSTRESS trial is a phase II/III randomized-controlled trial that aim at assessing
      intravenous exenatide versus insulin for perioperative glycemic control in CABG surgery.

      The phase II of the ExStress trial will assess the safety and the efficacy of a continuous
      intravenous infusion of exenatide for the management of post operative stress hyperglycemia
      after planned coronary artery graft bypass (CABG) surgery.

      The aim of the phase III of the ExSTRESS trial is to compare the efficacy of a continuous
      intravenous infusion of exenatide to the gold standard treatment, i.e the intravenous
      infusion of short-acting insulin, for the management of post operative stress hyperglycemia
      after planned CABG surgery.

    <description>The SF-36 score is a self-administered questionnaire that assess both the physical and the psychosocial health-related quality of life.
The use of the SF-36 score is recommended by the French Health Authority in coronary patients.
The variation of the SF-36 score value at 3-months is defined as the difference between the SF36-score value at 3 months minus the preoperative SF-36 score value.</description>
