      The primary objective is to describe the safety and tolerability of ticagrelor, by assessment
      of adverse events (characteristics, reporting rate, severity, relationship and risk factors),
      especially the bleeding events as defined in 8.1 and other serious adverse events (SAEs)
      during 1-year follow up in Chinese acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.

      The trial is a multi-centre, prospective cohort, non-interventional study to be conducted in
      the department of cardiology from approximately 20 tier-2 or 3 hospitals, China. The study
      requires Chinese subjects aged over 18, diagnosed as ACS and treated with ticagrelor at least
      one tablet from the department of cardiology in the around 20 tier-2 or 3 hospitals. The
      subjects will be tracked up to 1 month after the discontinuation of ticagrelor for AE events
      and 1 year after enrollment for major cardiovascular events. This is an observational study.
      The prescribing doctor is in charge of prescribing or discontinuation ticagrelor. The
      investigator in an observational study may not intervene in the treatment. All 1000 subjects'
      related data will be collected
