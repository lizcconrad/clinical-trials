  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies a pancreatic nutritional program for helping patients with
      stage I-III breast cancer who are overweight or obese lose weight. When patients have a high
      level of sugar in their blood, due to eating sugary foods and/or a sedentary lifestyle, the
      pancreas needs to work harder to digest the sugar. This can cause weight gain, obesity, and
      other illnesses. Breast cancer patients who are overweight and obese are more likely to have
      their breast cancer return. The pancreatic nutritional program is a diet and lifestyle
      intervention that helps protect the pancreas by keeping blood sugar levels low, and may help
      patients achieve sustained weight loss, improved health, better quality of life, and possibly
      a better outcome to their treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the change in body weight at 6 months post-intervention relative to baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine changes in: body composition; body chemistry; physical fitness; inflammatory
      markers; deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair capacity; and quality of life per the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B)+4, version 4 questionnaire at 6 months
      post-intervention relative to baseline.

      II. To describe adverse events possibly related to wearing the glucometer sensor or following
      the pancreatic nutritional program (PNP) diet.

      III. To document compliance with the various components of the PNP (wearing the glucometer
      sensor; recording body weight; completing journal entries; completing meal cards; attending
      weekly counseling sessions with diet instructor).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in the PNP intervention, which begins with a baseline meeting with a
      diet and lifestyle instructor to discuss baseline testing results, begin an educational plan,
      determine an individualized eating plan, and print out food choices. Patients also undergo
      automated glucometry every 15 minutes, review their individual food choices and blood glucose
      levels 90 minutes after eating, keep a daily nutrition and lifestyle journal log, fill out a
      daily meal discovery card log, and attend weekly meetings with a diet and lifestyle
      instructor for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 1 week and then at 6 months.
