    <textblock>
      Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of the AVERT PLUS to monitor contrast volume used during
      angiographic procedures.

      Research Design: The AVERT PLUS is an FDA 510K cleared device which consists of a contrast
      delivery modulator designed to reduce unnecessary contrast dye delivery to the patient during
      angiography (coronary or peripheral) and a concomitant system to precisely measure contrast
      volume delivered to the patient. This will be a first in man prospective observational study
      of the accuracy of this system to quantify contract volume used during clinically indicated
      angiography in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty consecutive subjects who consent to participate and are undergoing planned angiography
      will be enrolled. The AVERT PLUS is a system which is external to the patient and connected
      to the control syringe that the physician uses to deliver the contrast dye to the patient.
      For each injection that the physician performs, the starting syringe volume, the ending
      syringe volume, and the net contrast delivered to the patient will be recorded. At the same
      time, the net volume delivered to the patient will also be recorded from the AVERT PLUS
      console. For each injection, these two sets of variables will be compared to determine
      accuracy of the AVERT PLUS to quantify net contrast volume used.
