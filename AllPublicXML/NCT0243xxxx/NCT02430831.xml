      Study type:

      Randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms Objectives

      Primary : Demonstrate that daily supplementation of colicky infants with Nidina formula
      containing L. reuteri DSM 17938 decreases the daily crying duration at 21 days Secondary :
      Evaluate the effects of daily supplementation of colicky infants with Nidina formula
      containing L. reuteri DSM 17938 measured as

        1. the number of &quot;responders&quot; or the &quot;treatment success&quot; (ie infants for which defined as
           the percentage of children achieving a reduction in the daily average crying time &gt;50%
           in 3 weeks. (day 1 to day 21 of the study)

        2. maternal depression and family functioning scoring

      Inclusion criteria :

        -  less then 12 weeks of age

        -  term infant (≥ 38 weeks gestational age)

        -  birth weight &gt; 2,500g

        -  infantile colic diagnosed according to modified Wessel's criteria, i.e. crying more than
           an average of 180 min/day during the 3 days prior to enrollment.

        -  parental motivation to postpone changes in the infant feeding mode, unless necessary

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  birth weight less than 2500 g

        -  failure to thrive

        -  chronic illness or major medical problem

        -  gastrointestinal disease

        -  cow's milk allergy ( confirmed prior to exclusion; difficult to diagnose so early ??)

        -  use of any antibiotic or probiotic in the week (7 days) prior to enrollment

        -  use of proton pump inhibitors in the week (7 days) prior to enrollment

        -  if breastfeeding, use of probiotic by the mother in the week (7 days) prior to
           enrollment

        -  infant receiving solid foods (such as cereals, mashed fruits or vegetable purée)

        -  change of feeding mode planned by parents during the study period

      Randomization and blinding: to be written by the CRO, according to its own procedures.

      Extreme caution should be given to blinding. Methods should give full certainty that blinding
      was perfect at the subject (parent) level, but also at the pediatrician and with all involved
      personnel.

      Randomization should be done according to 3 feeding modes :

        -  &quot;breast feeding: only breast, except for 2 bottle feedings a week,

        -  &quot;formula fed&quot;: only formula except two breast feeding a week,

        -  &quot;mixed feeding&quot;: all the remaining
