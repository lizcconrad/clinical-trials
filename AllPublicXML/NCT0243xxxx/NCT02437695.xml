  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although a condition for surgery, robotic interventions applied with steep
      Trendelenburg-lithotomy (ST-L) position may cause positional injury and peripheral neuropathy
      if good position is not achieved on the operating table. This study will be a 7-year
      retrospective examination of postoperative positional injury (PPI) in patients undergoing
      robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate diagnosis.

      Patients who underwent RARP between 2008-2014 will be evaluate. Patients with known
      peripheral neuropathy, lumbar-cervical discopathy, or history of orthopaedic surgery or
      trauma will exclude. The demographic data of patients, ASA, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CMI),
      Body Mass Index (BMI), operating time (OT) and Trendelenburg time (TT) will obtain from
      patient records. Patients will be questioned as to whether or not PPI had developed, if so,
      in which extremity, in what form (sensory-motor), duration, whether or not a doctor had been
      consulted, if so, what treatment had been given and whether or not the PPI had continued.
