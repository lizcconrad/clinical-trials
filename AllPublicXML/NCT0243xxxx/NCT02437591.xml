    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of fidaxomicin
      (FDX) and primary metabolite OP-1118 in Subjects with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and C.
      difficile Infection (CDI).

      This study will also compare CDI clinical response to the microbiological response in terms
      of magnitude of reduction of C. difficile total viable count and spore count during treatment
      with FDX and if achieved; the time to microbial eradication; determine time to negative CDI
      toxin assay in stool specimens during treatment with FDX; assess the stool concentrations of
      FDX and metabolite OP-1118 throughout therapy; assess the length of hospital stay,
      readmissions and resource utilization for IBD patients receiving FDX; record the incidence
      and severity of Adverse Events (AEs) and document the impact of treatment on Quality of Life
      as measured by the changes in Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score.
