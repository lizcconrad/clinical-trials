      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy of a
      darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) fixed dose combination
      (FDC) tablet versus Darunavir/Cobicistat (DRV/COBI) FDC coadministered with
      Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) FDC in human immunodeficiency virus-1
      (HIV-1) infected, antiretroviral (ARV) treatment naive adult participants.

      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (a medical
      research study in which neither the researchers nor the participant know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), active-controlled (study in which the experimental treatment or
      procedure is compared to a standard [control] treatment or procedure) study. The study
      consists of 5 periods: a Screening period, Double-blind treatment period, Single-arm
      treatment period, Extension period and a Follow-up period. Participants will receive either
      darunavir (DRV)/ cobicistat (COBI)/emtricitabine (FTC) /tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) fixed
      dose combination (D/C/F/TAF FDC) or DRV/COBI FDC along with FTC/TDF FDC. Primarily percentage
      of participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -1 Ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than
      (&lt;) 50 copies per milliliter (copies/ml) defined by snapshot analysis will be evaluated.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>FDA Snapshot Approach is based on the last observed viral load data within the Week 48 window: virologic response is defined as HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (observed case); missing HIV-1 RNA is considered as non-response.</description>

    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Events with Grade 3 or higher (3=Severe; 4=life-threatening; 5=fatal) are events that significantly interrupt usual daily activity, require systemic drug therapy/other treatment and are, in many situations, considered unacceptable or intolerable events.</description>
