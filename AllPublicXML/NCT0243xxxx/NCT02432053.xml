      The objective of the study is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of once-daily Advagraf in
      adult population undergoing kidney or liver transplantation in India.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, multi-centre, open label prospective study of once daily Advagraf in 200
      patients undergoing kidney or liver transplantation in India. Adult patients undergoing
      kidney or liver transplantation and meeting all other eligibility criteria will be enrolled
      in the study. Enrolled patients will be administered once daily dose of Advagraf for 12
      weeks. During these 12 weeks a total of 9 regular visits will be undertaken.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (common to kidney and liver transplant patients):

             prior to enrolment and must agree to practice effective birth control during the
             study. Tacrolimus may reduce the clearance of steroid based contraceptives leading to
             increased hormone exposure; particular care should be exercised when deciding upon
             contraceptive measures.

          -  Patients should be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study, and
             should provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Patients with end stage liver disease and who are a suitable candidate for primary
             liver transplantation.

          -  Patients scheduled to receive a liver transplant from a cadaveric or living donor

          -  Liver cirrhosis.

          -  Significant liver disease, defined as having either elevated serum glutamic pyruvic

             oxaloacetic transaminase/ aspartate transaminase (SGOT/AST) (at least 2.5 times the
             upper value of the normal range at the investigational site) or elevated total
             bilirubin levels (at least 2.5 times the upper value of the normal range at the
             investigational site) or all of them during the 28 days prior to entry into the study.
