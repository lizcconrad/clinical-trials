    <time_frame>Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained clinical cure was defined as the absence of otorrhea in the study ear at Day 8 (end of treatment (EOT)) per the Investigator assessment. Participants were considered a treatment failure if, at any time during the course of the study, an alternative therapy was initiated to treat the post-surgical infection. All participants who had missing or indeterminate outcomes were considered a failure (same as baseline observation carried forward).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Microbiological Success at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological success was attained if all pretherapy bacteria were absent in the study ear for the test-of-cure (TOC) specimen, which was presumed a success for subjects with no otorrhea at Day 14. Participants were considered a treatment failure if, at any time during the course of the study, an alternative therapy was initiated to treat the post-surgical infection. All participants who had missing or indeterminate outcomes were considered a failure (same as baseline observation carried forward).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Cessation of Otorrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The time to cessation of otorrhea in the enrolled ear(s) was calculated as the number of days from the day of surgery to the absence of otorrhea (ie, no discharge) as reported by the parent/caregiver. Participants were considered a treatment failure if, at any time during the course of the study, an alternative therapy was initiated to treat the post-surgical infection. All participants who had missing or indeterminate outcomes were considered a failure (same as baseline observation carried forward).</description>

          -  Suspected bacterial infection at time of surgery in at least 1 ear.

          -  Willing to refrain from water immersion of the ears following surgery without the use
             of adequate ear protection during swimming, bathing, showering and other water-related
             activities.

          -  Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) must read and sign the informed consent.

          -  Parent or caregiver must agree to comply with the requirements of the study and

          -  Current acute otitis externa (AOE), malignant otitis externa (MOE) or other conditions
             which could interfere with evaluation of the study drug.

          -  Any systemic disease or disorder, complicating factor or structural abnormality that
             would negatively affect the conduct or outcome of the study based upon assessment by
             the Investigator.

        <description>Microbiological success was attained if all pretherapy bacteria were absent in the study ear for the test-of-cure (TOC) specimen, which was presumed a success for subjects with no otorrhea at Day 14. Participants were considered a treatment failure if, at any time during the course of the study, an alternative therapy was initiated to treat the post-surgical infection. All participants who had missing or indeterminate outcomes were considered a failure (same as baseline observation carried forward).</description>
