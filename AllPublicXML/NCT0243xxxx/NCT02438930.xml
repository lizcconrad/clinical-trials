      This study pilot tests and intervention to help individuals reduce their risk for acquiring
      or transmitting HIV. The intervention is implemented when people are tested for HIV in an
      outpatient clinic in rural Uganda. Approximately half of participants will receive the
      intervention and the other half will receive the usual counseling provided during HIV
      counseling and testing.

    <description>The brief intervention is adapted from the OPTIONS project, which is a brief client-centered risk reduction intervention for HIV-positive patients in clinical care. The OPTIONS intervention content is based upon the IMB model of health behavior change, and uses motivational interviewing techniques to create client-centered discussions in which HIV counselors and patients collaborate to identify patients' HIV transmission risk behaviors and to mutually identify strategies and goals for reducing the patient's risky behavior.
The brief intervention will be facilitated by health care providers (nurses, lab technicians) specifically trained in the intervention protocol and will consist of 2 brief counseling sessions occurring during the same-day rapid HIV-testing procedure</description>
