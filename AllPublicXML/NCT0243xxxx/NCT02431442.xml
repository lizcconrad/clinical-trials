  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the multiple dose safety and tolerability of RM-493
      (setmelanotide) as well as pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD; weight loss)
      profile, in healthy obese patients for 2 to 4 weeks. In addition, one panel of patients with
      a specific genetic deficiency in the hypothalamic leptin- proopiomelanocortin (POMC) -
      melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway, those with heterozygous partial or full loss of
      function (LOF) of the MC4R gene, will also be studied. The study drug (RM-493 and placebo)
      will be administered subcutaneously in a blinded fashion by subcutaneous (SC) infusion or
      injection.

             BMI range; to be eligible heterozygous subjects may have a BMI 27 -55 kg/ m2,
             inclusive.

          -  Stable body weight during the previous 6 months, based on Investigator judgment.

          -  Blood pressure &lt;140/90 mmHg at Screening and D-1. Measurement may be repeated within
             24 hours, based on Investigator judgment.

          -  Females must not be pregnant and must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at
             the Screening Visit and Day -1.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or else use any two of
             the following medically acceptable forms of contraception from the Screening Period
             through the Final Study Visit: hormonal, condom with spermicidal jelly, diaphragm or
             cervical cap with spermicidal jelly, or IUD. Hormonal contraception must have started
             at least 3 months prior to screening. A female whose male partner has had a vasectomy
             must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable contraception. Subjects
             must agree to practice the above birth control methods for 30 days from the final
             visit as a safety precaution.

          -  Females of non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal
             for at least 12 months (and confirmed with a screening FSH level in the
             post-menopausal range), do not require contraception during the study.

          -  Males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use two medically
             acceptable forms of contraception as described above, with one of the two forms being
             condom with spermicide, from the Screening Period through the Final Study Visit. Males
             with female partners of childbearing potential who themselves are surgically sterile
             (status post vasectomy) must agree to use condoms with spermicide over the same period
             of time. Male subjects must agree to practice the above birth control methods for 30
             days from the final visit as a safety precaution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fasting blood glucose &gt;126 mg/dL at screening. Heterozygous subjects will be excluded
             for a fasting blood glucose &gt;140 mg/dL.

          -  Active or history of any clinically significant medical condition including renal,
             hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, genitourinary, endocrine,
             immunologic, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric or hematological disease, based on
             Investigator judgment.

          -  Acute illness or history of illness, which in the opinion of the Investigator, could
             pose a threat or harm to the subject or obscure interpretation of laboratory test
             results or interpretation of study data.

          -  Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, positive hepatitis C antibody or positive HIV
             test at screening or a history of positive testing (e.g. liver biopsy, serology)

             intake.

          -  A significant history of drug/solvent abuse within 5 years of screening or a positive
             test for drugs of abuse test at screening or on Day -1.

          -  Positive alcohol (breath test) or nicotine screen at Screening Visit or Day 1
             (positive nicotine screen does not apply to heterozygous cohort).
