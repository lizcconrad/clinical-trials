  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and feasibility of injecting irinotecan
      hydrochloride drug-eluting beads directly into the cavity remaining after a tumor is
      surgically removed in patients with a type of brain tumor (glioblastoma multiforme - also
      known as glioma) that has returned after prior therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A challenge in the treatment of glioma is the delivery of treatment to the brain after
      systemic administration due to the blood brain barrier. To improve drug delivery to the brain
      to achieve very high local concentrations of the anti-neoplastic agent with low system
      toxicity, a local regional approach is proposed. CM-BC2, an irinotecan hydrochloride
      drug-eluting bead, is an investigational medicinal product intended for direction injection
      into the tumor resection margin. The objective of this trial is demonstration of safety and
      feasibility of this intraparenchymal injection of irinotecan hydrochloride drug-eluting beads
      in the treatment of recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. histologically confirmed diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) (World Health
             Organization grade IV)

          2. recurrent disease

          3. patient will be considered a good candidate for resection and will have estimated life
             expectancy of at least 12 weeks as estimated by the Principal Investigator or
             designee. The decision to opt for resection of the recurrence must be independent of
             study selection.

          4. Tumour characteristics:

               -  Single unilateral and supratentorial lesion

               -  On clinician's assessment, must be operable under normal considerations of risk
                  vs. benefit for condition and prognosis

          5. patient will have received conventional treatment at the time of initial diagnosis,
             including surgery (biopsy or de-bulking), and/or radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy

          6. male or female; no racial exclusions; at least 18 years of age

          7. Pregnancy must be excluded in female patients by beta- HCG (Human Chorionic
             Gonadotropin); all patients agree to use adequate contraception for study duration

          8. Karnofsky Performance Status of at least 60

          9. Patients must be able to understand consent and study instructions as well as follow
             prescribed instructions

         10. patient must have signed written informed consent prior to study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. patient must not be enrolled in any other clinical trial for 30 days before or after
             participation in this trial

          2. history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical make-up or
             composition to CM-BC2, alginate or irinotecan; or has any other contraindications to
             irinotecan therapy

          3. open communication between the ventricle CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) and tumour
             resection cavity/site must be avoided. In the case of opening ventricles during
             surgery, the surgeon must decide whether effective closure is possible by obstructing
             the gap with Gelfoam/other appropriate materials

          4. Tumor surgery, other than stereotactic biopsy of the GBM, or other neurosurgery within
             30 days prior to study entry

          5. Multiple GBM lesions

          6. Irinotecan chemotherapy within 30 days prior to study treatment

          7. radiotherapy or stereotactic (gamma knife) radiosurgery within 90 days prior to study
             entry

          8. loco-regional (intra-cranial) therapy for the treatment of GBM, including
             administration of biodegradable polymer wafers containing Carmustine and/or
             brachytherapy, in the 6 months prior to study entry

          9. Significant liver function impairment: aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase
             (ALT) greater than 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin greater
             than 2 x ULN

         10. significant renal impairment: creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL

         11. Coagulopathy Prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of less than
             1.5 x control, and/or platelet count of less than 100 x 10⁹/L

         12. Hb less than 8 g/dL and/or neutrophil count (ANC - Absolute Neutrophil Count) of less
             than 1 x 10⁹/L

         13. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, makes it in the patient's best
             interest not to participate in the study

         14. Pre-existing cerebral oedema that, in the surgeon's opinion, poses unacceptable risk
             of post-operative oedema. This decision may be at time of surgery.

         15. Presence of concurrent malignancy, except for adequately controlled limited basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix
