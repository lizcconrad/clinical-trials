  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy, and its incidence is expected to
      increase in many countries in coming decades. Though prognosis for patients with HCC is
      generally poor, hepatic resection can be an effective curative treatment, and its indications
      have been expanding in recent years. Resection can be reasonably safe and effective even for
      patients with micro- or macrovascular invasion. However, the recurrence rate of HCC is as
      high as 74% for patients with intermediate and advanced HCC after resection. Microvascular
      invasion is one of the main risk factors which influence risk of HCC recurrence and patient
      prognosis after resection. Therefore, adjuvant therapy to prevent tumor recurrence after
      resection is so important to improve patient prognosis.

      Nowadays, adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is reported to be effective in
      reducing early recurrence rate and mortality for patients with HCC with risk factors of
      recurrence. Sorafenib is a novel drug which is effective for advanced stage HCC. However, the
      efficacy of adjuvant sorafenib for postoperative HCC is unknown. Therefore, it is interesting
      to investigate the efficacy of adjuvant sorafenib, and compare its efficacy to TACE, TACE
      plus sorafenib, or best supportive care for patients with postoperative HCC and microvascular
      invasion.
