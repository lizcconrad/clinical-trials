  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate if the addition of long-acting reversible
      contraception (LARC) focused video-counseling during prenatal care increases uptake of
      postpartum LARC.

      Eligible participants will be identified in the prenatal period and will be randomized to one
      of two groups. The control group will receive the standard of care contraceptive counseling
      during prenatal counseling. The intervention group will also receive the standard of care
      contraceptive counseling during prenatal care, but will also watch an evidence-based,12
      minute LARC First video created by the CHOICE project which provides information on different
      contraceptive methods. All participants will receive information regarding access to free
      LARC methods in the postpartum period. All participants will be called at 12 weeks
      postpartum. Independent of randomization arm, they will all undergo a 5-minute survey by
      phone about contraceptive method choice and use.
