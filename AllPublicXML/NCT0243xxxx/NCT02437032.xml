    <textblock>
      A key challenge facing reproductive biologists is the integration of the knowledge about
      oocyte-secreted factors into coherent physiological mechanisms of how oocytes govern
      folliculogenesis, cumulus cell function, and oocyte and embryo development. Although key
      oocyte-secreted factors have been identified, understanding their modes of action is
      complicated by multiple interactions between maternal and oocyte signaling molecules, as well
      as the constantly changing state of physical interactions between the oocyte and its
      companion somatic cells during folliculogenesis. Thus, the investigators study aimed to
      determine if there is any relationship between different gonadotropin preparations and
      oocyte-secreted factor secretion, the endocrine pattern in follicular fluid, and the
      apoptotic rate in cumulus cells during controlled ovarian stimulation.

    <textblock>
      The follicular environment is primarily influenced by the type of gonadotropin the follicle
      is exposed to during the follicular phase. The role of gonadotropins has been especially
      important in improving the efficiency of in vitro fertilization. Several studies comparing
      the use of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) with recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone
      (rFSH) have found significant differences in the endocrinological profile and the follicular
      dynamics. These differences have been related to the human chorionic gonadotropin
      (hCG)-driven luteinizing hormone (LH) activity added to hMG. Moreover, differences in the
      proportion of acid residues in FSH molecules should be considered.

      On the other hand, the main physiological regulatory hormones of follicular survival are the
      gonadotropins. Suppression of serum gonadotropins leads to massive apoptosis of granulosa
      cells in developing follicles resulting in atresia; whereas, gonadotropin treatment of early
      antral and pre-ovulatory follicles prevents this unplanned apoptosis. However, studies using
      cultured rat granulosa cells have shown that treatments with FSH or LH/hCG are ineffective in
      preventing spontaneous apoptosis, suggesting neighboring theca cells and local factors
      produced in the ovary are important for regulation of follicle growth and atresia.

    <description>An oral contraceptive pill (Microgynon30®, Bayer Hispania, Spain) was taken for a maximum of 21 days, starting on day 1-2 of the menses of the previous cycle. After a wash-period of five days after the last pill, donors started to receive daily doses of 150-300 UI of rFSH (Gonal-F®, Merck-Serono, Spain; n=30) depending on their age, body mass index (BMI) and ovarian response in previous cycles. Daily doses of 0.25 mg gonadotropin- releasing hormone antagonist cetrorelix (Cetrotide®, Merck-Serono, Spain) were started on day six of stimulation in each group. When at least three or more leading follicles reached a mean diameter of ≥18 mm, hCG (Ovitrelle®, 250 µg; Merck-Serono, Spain) was administered subcutaneously</description>
