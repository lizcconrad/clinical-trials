      A prospective, single-arm, mono-centre pilot study to obtain preliminary information on the
      ability of Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation (DRGS) in alleviating the painful symptoms in
      patients with small fiber neuropathy (SFN).

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-arm, mono-centre pilot study enrolling a maximum of 31
      patients with SFN. All enrolled patients will receive a trial neurostimulation (TNS) lasting
      from 3 to 30 days and only patients with a positive result in terms of pain intensity
      reduction will be eligible for the implanted neurostimulation (INS) phase. The target number
      of patients eligible for INS is 10 and this population will be assessed for impact of DRGS on
      the neuropathic pain caused by SFN. The expected duration of patients participation will be
      14 months. The rationale for this open label approach is that this is a novel technique for
      which pilot data with regard to applicability and efficacy have yet to be established. Data
      gathered in the study will provide preliminary data required to assess the feasibility of
      this intervention, to be used for possible future studies with a more rigorous methodological
      approach (i.e. controlled trial, randomized controlled trial).

    <description>Spinal Modulation Axium™: an external trial neurostimulator (TNS) is used for the trial period, followed by an implanted neurostimulator (INS) if the TNS is successful. The TNS and INS are a pacemaker-sized devices that send out mild electrical pulses. The stimulator contains a battery and electrical components. Both TNS and INS are constant voltage devices. The TNS is used first and is worn on the outside of the clothing. The INS is implanted under the skin and support:</description>

    <description>The participants will undergo implantation of electrodes for stimulation of fuor dorsal ganglia (Spinal Modulation, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA). Each participant will have one to four electrodes positioned according to the individual distribution of pain in the extremities. After implantation the electrode will be connected to an external neurostimulator: Spinal Modulation Axium™ for 3-30 days to evaluate their effectiveness (test stimulation).
If during the trial treatment the pain will decrease significantly (&gt; 50%) a neurostimulator will be 'implanted for the continuation of the permanent neurostimulation. The neurostimulator is implanted in the abdomen in a subcutaneous pocket.</description>
