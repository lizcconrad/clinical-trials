  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and
      related behavioral rituals (compulsions), is a common psychiatric illness that often emerges
      in childhood and causes life-long disability in over 50% of patients. Psychological theory
      suggests that OCD symptoms are driven by a person's difficulty disengaging their feelings
      from simple tasks (e.g. washing hands, locking a door) due to excessive anxiety about
      performance errors. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the gold standard treatment for OCD,
      repeatedly exposes patients to their OCD-stressor until this anxiety is reduced. While CBT is
      typically more effective in teenagers than adults, patients from both age groups are usually
      left with residual symptoms, highlighting the need for better treatments. In this study, CBT
      will be studied in both teen-aged and adult patients. Two groups, both with childhood onset
      OCD, will be randomized to either CBT for OCD or stress management training (SMT), an active
      therapy but with minimal effects on OCD symptoms. The investigators will also study
      age-matched, healthy controls as comparison subjects.

      Before and after 12 weeks of CBT, all subjects will undergo functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (fMRI) scans to see what regions of the brain become active when a concentration task
      is performed and how that activation is changed after CBT. The purpose of this study is to
      demonstrate the brain changes associated with CBT treatment and how differences in these
      changes in teenage compared to adult patients may drive differences in CBT response.

      While the study itself is of parallel design for its data-collection and measurement purpose,
      it is listed as a partial-crossover design in the IRB-approved protocol because subjects
      randomized to the SMT group are given the option of entering 12-weeks of CBT sessions after
      all of their SMT data collection. To understand brain changes that occur with CBT compared to
      SMT in both age groups, the investigators will collect fMRI data before and after therapy.
      Some limited data will be collected in patients who are initially randomized to SMT but then
      opt to crossover to CBT. fMRI data will also be collected in healthy teens and adults before
      and after 12 weeks (but without intervening therapy) to allow the investigators to control
      for the simple effects of time that may cause brain changes that are not related to therapy.

    <description>fMRI BOLD signal response of posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC), ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior insula (aIns) during performance monitoring. This signal will be measured as BOLD contrast estimates for errors compared to correct trials based on average signal in a priori defined regions of interest for pMFC, vmPFC and aIns. The investigators are looking for increases in pMFC activation in adolescents from pre- to post-treatment. In contrast, the investigators are looking for increases in inverse connectivity (resting state and during task) between vmPFC and aIns in adults from pre- to post-treatment.</description>

    <description>OCD symptom severity measured by the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for adults and the Child Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for adolescents. This scale is administered by an independent assessor to rate OCD symptom severity on a scale of 0 to 40, with 40 being most severe. The investigators are looking for decreases in OCD severity ratings from pre- to post-treatment.</description>
