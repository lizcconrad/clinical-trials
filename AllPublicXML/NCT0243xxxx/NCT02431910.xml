    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is analyze the immediate and late effects of the application of KT
      in neuromuscular performance of the quadriceps in postural balance and function of the lower
      limb of healthy subjects.

      Sixty volunteers, females will be recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups with 20
      members each: control group (CG) - 10 minutes at rest; placebo group (PG) - Kinesio Taping
      (KT) without application of tension in the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus (VM) and rectus
      femoris (RF); and Kinesio Taping group (KTG) - application of KT with tension in VL, VM and
      RF. All volunteers will be evaluated for their distance from the single and triple hop test,
      postural balance (baropodometry), the joint position sense (JPS), the knee extensor torque
      (concentric and eccentric assessment at 60 °/s) and electromyographic activity of the VL
      muscle in five distinct stages: the first before the intervention (AV1), the second
      immediately after (AV2) and the following three 24h (AV3), 48 (AV4) after the intervention
      protocol. Soon after the AV4, KT will be removed after 24 hours and take place the last
      review (AV5).

    <description>The Kinesio Taping (KT) is applied on the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles longitudinally from proximal to the distal. For the RF proximal anchor is applied 5cm below the anterior superior iliac spine and the distal anchor the upper edge of the patella. VL in the proximal and distal anchor will be fixed in greater trochanter of the femur and the lateral edge of the patella. As for the VM muscle proximal anchor will be applied to the middle third from the medial region of the thigh and the distal anchor on the medial edge of the patella. The anchors are applied with 0% tension and therapy area will follow on the belly of the muscles with a 0%.</description>

The anchors are applied with 0% tension and therapy area will follow on the belly of the muscles with a 50%. This application will be held with subjects standing on one foot, with the hip of the non-dominant limb at 0º and knee flexed at 90º.</description>
