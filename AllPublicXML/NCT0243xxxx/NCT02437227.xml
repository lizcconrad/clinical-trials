  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a first in man, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      how the drug works in the body in patients with all solid tumours. The aim of this study is
      to determine the most effective dose of the study drug that can then be further investigated
      in patients with advanced melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic malignant melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK, with a notable
      proportion of young patients. The development of immunotherapies (such as Ipilimumab), and
      targeted therapies (such as Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor) have resulted in improved survival
      outcomes for patients but is still only measured in months and not years. These targeted
      therapies are also only useful for patients with the relevant genetic mutation, leaving a
      significant proportion of patients without targeted therapy options. The need for more
      effective (and ideally curative) melanoma treatments remains. The Institute of Cancer
      Research, with funding from the Wellcome Trust, have created and developed a new panel of
      inhibitors that aim to more effectively terminate the growth, spread and survival signals
      that sustain the cancer. The broader targets allow patients possessing a range of genetic
      mutations to potentially benefit from this targeted therapy. It is hoped that these drugs
      could be used as both primary therapy for treatmentnaive patients as well as rescue therapy
      for those who have progressed on other targeted therapies.

      This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of one of these new
      compounds, CCT 3833, and to define the maximum tolerated dose in patients with advanced
      melanoma. The study also aims to examine the way that CCT3833 works within the body. Once the
      maximum tolerated dose has been established a small number of melanoma patients, with
      specific mutations and at different treatment option stages, will be treated to gain
      additional safety information and an initial indication of the possible efficacy of CCT3833
      on melanoma tumours.

    <description>CCT3833 is a poorly soluble crystalline compound. It is multi-polymorphic and one form, designated Form D, has been purified and typically has a particle size of about 15-20 μm. Form D readily absorbs and desorbs water, but is not a hydrate and has been selected as the form to take forward into clinical development.</description>

             suppository.

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception as
             defined above, during the study and for 6 months afterwards. Men with pregnant or
             lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception to prevent
             exposure to the foetus or neonate.

         15. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical study.
