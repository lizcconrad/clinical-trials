          2. Must be able to communicate with the Investigator, understand, and comply with the
             requirements of the study, and agree to adhere to restrictions and examination
             schedules.

          3. Must be a male or female subject from any race between 18 to 65 years of age
             (inclusive) at the time of signing the ICF, and in good health as determined by
             Physical Examinations (PE).

          4. Must comply with the following acceptable forms of contraception:

               1. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity
                  in which conception is possible must use barrier contraception with male condoms
                  NOT made out of natural animal membrane (e.g., latex or polyurethane condoms are
                  acceptable) while on study drug, and for at least 90 days after the last dose of
                  study drug.

               2. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 1 must have a negative pregnancy test at
                  Screening and at Baseline (i.e., on Day -1). FCBP who engage in activity in which
                  conception is possible must agree to use one of the following forms of
                  contraception during their entire participation in the study and for at least 30
                  days after administration of the last dose of study drug:

                    -  Option 1: Any one of the following: non-oral hormonal contraception (e.g.,
                       injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device;
                       tubal ligation; or a partner with a vasectomy; OR

                    -  Option 2: Oral contraceptive pills PLUS one additional barrier method of the
                       following: (a) male or female condom NOT made out of natural animal membrane
                       (e.g., latex or polyurethane is acceptable); (b) diaphragm with spermicide;
                       (c) cervical cap with spermicide; or (d) contraceptive sponge with
                       spermicide; OR

                    -  Option 3: TWO of the following barrier methods: (a) male or female condom
                       NOT made out of natural animal membrane (e.g., latex or polyurethane is
                       acceptable); (b) diaphragm with spermicide; (c) cervical cap with
                       spermicide; or (d) a contraceptive sponge with spermicide.

             Note: All other females must have been surgically sterilized for at least 6 months
             before Screening (proper documentation required), or be postmenopausal (defined as 24
             months without menses before Screening, and an estradiol level of &lt; 30 pg/mL and a
             plasma Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level &gt; 40 IU/L at Screening).

          5. Must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 33 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          6. No clinically significant laboratory test results, as determined by the Investigator.

          7. Must be afebrile, with supine systolic BP of 90 to 140 mmHg, a supine diastolic Blood
             Pressure (BP) of 60 to 90 mmHg, and pulse rate of 40 to 110 bpm.

          8. Must have a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) at
             Screening. Male subjects must have a QTcF value ≤ 430 msec. Female subjects must have

             administration or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever is
             longer).

          7. Donated blood or plasma prior to 4 weeks before the first dose administration to a
             blood bank or blood donation center.

          8. History of multiple drug allergies (i.e., two or more);

          9. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual [DSM]) prior to 2 years before first dose administration, or a
             positive drug screen reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.

         10. History of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM) prior to 2
             years before dosing, or a positive alcohol screen.
