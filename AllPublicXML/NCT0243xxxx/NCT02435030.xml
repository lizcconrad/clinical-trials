    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-therapeutic observational study in NP-C patients. The aim is to
      characterize the individual patient disease progression profile through the historical and 6
      months prospective evaluation of clinical, imaging, biological(biomarkers) and quality of
      life data.

      Patients will be offered enrollment into a Phase II/III study on arimoclomol at the end of
      the study.

          -  Diagnosis of Niemann Pick disease Type C (NP-C), either NPC1 or NPC2;

          -  NP-C diagnosis genetically confirmed (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] sequence analysis);

          -  Both NPC1 and NPC2 patients are eligible;

          -  Presenting at least one neurological symptom of the disease (for example, but not
             limited to, hearing loss, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, ataxia, dementia,
             dystonia, seizures, dysarthria, or dysphagia);

          -  Ability to walk either independently or with assistance;

          -  Ability to travel to the corresponding clinical trial site repeatedly (every 6 months)
             for evaluation and follow-up;

          -  Treated or non-treated with miglustat;

          -  If a patient is under prescribed treatment with miglustat, it has to be under stable
             dose of the medication for ≥ 3 continuous months prior to inclusion in the study;

          -  Sexually active patients must be willing and able to use an adequate method of
             contraception throughout the study, for example: diaphragm + spermicide; intrauterine

             medication;

          -  Ability to comply with the protocol-specified procedures/evaluations and scheduled
             visits;

          -  Willing to participate in all aspects of trial design including serial blood sampling,
             skin biopsies and imaging (ultrasonography) collections.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No written informed consent obtained from the patient or their parent(s)/legal
             guardian(s) (and assent if appropriate to local laws and regulation) before any study
             related procedures;

          -  Recipient of a liver transplant or planned liver transplantation;

          -  Patients with uncontrolled severe epileptic seizures period (at least 3 consecutive
             severe epileptic seizures that required medication) within 2 months prior to the
             written consent. This includes patients with ongoing seizures that are not stable in
             frequency or type or duration over a 2 month period prior to enrollment, requiring
             change in dose of antiepileptic medication (other than adjustment for weight) over a 2
             month period prior to enrollment, or requiring 3 or more antiepileptic medications to
             control seizures;

          -  Neurologically asymptomatic patients;

          -  Severe liver insufficiency (defined as hepatic laboratory parameters, aspartate
             transaminase [AST] and alanine transaminase [ALT] greater than three-times the upper
             limit of normal for age and gender;

          -  Severe renal insufficiency, with serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal ;

          -  Severe manifestations of NP-C disease that would interfere with the patient's ability
             to comply with the requirements of this protocol;

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient's clinical condition does not allow
             for the required blood collection and/or skin biopsies as per the protocol-specified
             procedures;

          -  Treatment with any IMP within 4 weeks prior to the study enrollment;

          -  Treatment with any IMP during the study in an attempt to treat NP-C;

          -  Current participation in another trial is not permitted unless it is a
             non-interventional study and the sole purpose of the trial is for long-term follow
             up/survival data (registry);

          -  Patients will be excluded if there is a confirmed risk linked to the MRI procedure to
             be performed in the subsequent therapeutic interventional study [i.e.: implanted
             cardiac pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator, implanted neural
             pacemakers, cochlear implants, implanted metallic foreign bodies in the eye or CNS
             (such as a CNS aneurysmal clip), any form of implanted wire or metal device that may
             concentrate radio frequency fields and/or confirmed history of unexpected serious
             adverse reaction to sedation or anesthesia (if sedation is necessary)];

          -  Patients will be excluded if there is a confirmed risk linked to the skin punch biopsy
             procedure like severe thrombocytopaenia, at investigator's discretion.
