  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a surgical procedure to help children with intractable fecal incontinence gain
      continence for stool through construction of a tube that connects the abdominal wall to the
      colon near or through the appendix. This tube allows easy administration of enema solution
      into the first part of the colon. Putting enema solution through that tube into the colon is
      called an antegrade continence enema or ACE and has been shown to work well in helping some
      but not all children prevent stool accidents. The purpose of this study is to compare a large
      volume ACE flush using a salt water solution called normal saline with a small volume ACE
      flush using liquid glycerin. The aims of this study are to: 1) find the most effective dose
      and flush frequency of each solution; 2) compare which solution given at the best dose takes
      the least amount of time to clear the colon of stool, has the least side effects, and is the
      most effective in preventing stool accidents; and 3) to determine if administration of either
      of the ACE flushing solution affects colon health and the bacteria in the colon.

      Fecal incontinence past the time of toilet training is devastating to affected children.
      Antegrade continence enema (ACE) therapy administered through a catheterizable stoma
      surgically placed in the cecum has helped children with intractable fecal incontinence attain
      continence for stool. There are a number of retrospective studies demonstrating the variable
      effectiveness rates of ACE therapy. This variability may be due to what is used to flush.
      There are no prospective trials evaluating the effectiveness of different flushing regimens.
      . The catheterizable stoma used for the antegrade administration of enema solution is
      frequently made by bringing the appendix out through the abdominal wall or by placing a
      skin-level device (button) in to the cecum. ACE therapy administration through the appendix
      or into the cecum has the potential to disrupt the gut microbial ecosystem, causing dysbiosis
      and immune dysfunction. The effects of ACE administration on colonic microbiome and mucosal
      immunity have not been investigated. This pilot study will compare a high volume normal
      saline (NS) flush and a low volume USP glycerin flush. The primary aims of the study are to
      compare which solution, given at an optimal dose and frequency, is delivered in the least
      amount of time, with fewer side effects, while promoting the higher degree of fecal
      continence and quality of life, and to determine if administration of antegrade enema
      solution through an appendicostomy/cecostomy affects gut microbiota.

    <time_frame>Data collection will start with the first flush administered following discharge from the hospital (estimated to begin in week three) and will be collected with every subsequent flush through completion of the study, an expected average of 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Flush side effects will be measured using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS). The WBFPRS has undergone extensive testing, is preferred by children, and has well established psychometrics in the pediatric population. The scale ranges from 0 (very happy without pain) to 5 (the worse pain imaginable). Each pain level is associated with a facial expression. The child is asked to choose the face that best describes his/her level of discomfort. The WBFPRS will be used to evaluate the presence and severity of flush side effects, including abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, sweating, dizziness, and pallor. The parent will call if the child is having flushing regimen-associated accidents or discomfort greater than a 4 on the WBFPRS. Documentation of side effect severity will be completed by the parent and child on a data-collection form and reviewed weekly with the study coordinator to encourage completion of all relevant data</description>

    <description>The investigator will keep a research log documenting and detailing any event that may cause a change in level, stability, or trend of dependent variables not related to the intervention, for example treatment with antibiotics or an intercurrent illness. The number of episodes of fecal soiling per week will exclude accidents caused by viral, bacterial, or drug-induced gastroenteritis; these will be recorded and analyzed as confounds</description>

    <description>This trial uses a repeated measures, single subjects alternating treatments A-B-C-Bʹ-Cʹ-B1ʹ withdrawal design in which all subjects are tested under all conditions and each subject acts as his or her own control. The subjects will be randomly assigned to either normal saline or USP glycerin to control for order effects. Baseline data A will serve as the control and will be obtained pre-operatively. This arm will evaluate dose-response relationship and will be used to identify the minimum dosing volume and frequency while promoting fecal continence of ACE administration for NS and USP glycerin. When the optimal dose has been identified, the child will continue on that dose for 2 weeks to insure treatment stability and effectiveness.</description>
