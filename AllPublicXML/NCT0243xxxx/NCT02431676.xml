  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center randomized trial with three arms, and an allocation
      ratio of 1:1:1. The study design is an efficacy study to evaluate the effect of metformin and
      coach-directed behavioral weight loss versus self-directed weight loss on IGF-1 and IGF-1 to
      THE IGFBP-III ratio blood levels after 6 and 12 months of intervention. The coach-directed
      Behavioral Weight Loss arm is a web-based remote delivery and communication system that
      promotes healthy behavioral changes. The Metformin arm is a pharmaceutical intervention of
      oral metformin. This is a secondary prevention study for men and women who have survived
      solid malignant tumors
