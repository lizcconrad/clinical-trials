  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine if the initiation of a 'screen and treat' program for cryptococcal
      disease among HIV positive individuals decreases morbidity and mortality among individuals
      with CD4 count &lt; 100 cells/mm3. The study will screen individuals who are asymptomatic for CM
      and are either ART naïve or ART experienced with CD4 count &lt; 100 cells/mm3.

      The introduction of an cheap, easy to use point of care diagnostic test the lateral flow
      assay will facilitate rapid diagnosis of cryptococcal disease in resource limited settings.
      The investigators will determine the efficacy of the lateral flow assay in identifying latent
      and asymptomatic cryptococcal disease. The investigators will determine the efficacy of the
      test in detecting disease in readily available body fluids such as urine and whole blood
      obtained via finger-stick method. The investigators will also determine the cost
      effectiveness of a screen and treat approach for cryptococcal disease in Zimbabwe.

      The investigators also wish to understand why some individuals with low CD4 counts reactivate
      cryptococcal disease and screen positive for cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) while others with
      similar levels of immunocompromised do not.
