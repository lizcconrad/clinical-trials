  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is often accompanied by insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia. Acanthosis
      nigricans (AN) is a skin condition commonly present on the neck of obese children. Metformin
      is a useful drug for conditions characterized by insulin resistance.The aim of this study is
      to compare the efficacy of metformin versus placebo on AN lesions of the neck as well as
      their effects on metabolic and anthropometric variables in a sample of obese children. This
      is a 12-week randomized, double-blind randomized trial involving obese children with AN to
      receive either metformin or placebo.

      Evaluations will be performed every three weeks. Clinical, histological and colorimetric
      assessments of AN lesions will be compared initially and at the conclusion of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acanthosis nigricans (AN) are lesions affecting localized areas of the skin in persons with
      obesity and/or hyperinsulinemia. Roughening of the skin is related with histological
      papillomatosis and the skin darkening is due to hyperkeratosis. Biochemical mechanisms for
      developing this hyperplastic lesion involve local cutaneous growth factors. Nearly 40% of
      Native American teenagers have acanthosis nigricans, whereas about 13% of African American,
      6% of Hispanic, and less than 1% of white, non-Hispanic children aged 10-19 have clinically
      apparent acanthosis nigricans. AN is a clinical surrogate of laboratory-documented
      hyperinsulinemia.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of metformin versus placebo on AN lesions of
      the neck as well as their effects on metabolic (HOMA, triglycerides, cholesterol) and
      anthropometric variables (BMI, waist) in a sample of obese children. This is a 12-week
      randomized, double-blind randomized trial involving obese children with AN to receive either
      metformin or placebo.

      Evaluations will be performed every three weeks. Clinical, histological and colorimetric
      assessments of AN lesions will be compared initially and at the conclusion of the study.
      Burke´s scale, papillomatosis and hyperkeratosis, and the L* axis of will be used to measure
      the AN improvement.

    <description>Initial and after intervention assessment of acanthosis nigricans using the quantitative scale of Burke (Diabetes Care 22:1655-1659, 1999).
Five anatomical sites were chosen to assess the presence and extent of AN: neck, axilla, knuckles, elbows, and knees. The neck and axilla are graded for severity on a scale from 0 to 4. For AN present on the neck, texture of the affected area is also measured on a scale from 0 to 3. Knuckles, elbows, and knees are graded as AN present (1) or absent (0). Score goes from 0 to 14.</description>
