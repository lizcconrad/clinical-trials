  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with testicular germ cell cancer (GCC) have a high cure rate, however
      impaired muscle function and fatigue are the most common complications among patients with
      GCC undergoing treatment with chemotherapy. Although exercise is widely recommended,
      information about physiopathological effects of cancer therapy in skeletal muscle is very
      limited.

      Methods/Design: The present study is a randomized controlled trial comparing an
      individualized program of muscular strength and endurance with aerobic training compared to a
      control group. All variables will be measured at the beginning and at the end of a 8-week
      intervention by the same evaluator, who will hide the disposition of participants to each
      group. Besides, it will be monitoring during de following 6 months (24 weeks) after training
      for all outcome variables.

      Background: Patients with testicular germ cell cancer (GCC) have a high cure rate, however
      impaired muscle function and fatigue are the most common complications among patients with
      GCC undergoing treatment with chemotherapy. Although exercise is widely recommended,
      information about physiopathological effects of cancer therapy in skeletal muscle is very
      limited. Our aim is to evaluate the effects of an individualized exercise program with
      aerobic training in water running on cancer-related fatigue.

      Methods/Design: The present study is a randomized controlled trial comparing an
      individualized program of muscular strength and endurance with aerobic training compared to a
      control group. The investigators will conduct this trial in patients undergoing chemotherapy,
      recruited by the Departament of Oncology of Virgen de la Victoria Hospital (MÃ¡laga). Patients
      will be included and evaluated before the first cycle of chemotherapy and assigned
      experimental or control group randomly. All variables will be measured at the beginning and
      at the end of a 8-week intervention by the same evaluator, who will hide the disposition of
      participants to each group. Besides, it will be monitoring during de following 6 months (24
      weeks) after training for all outcome variables.

    <description>The intervention will be an 8-week program of individualized physiotherapy strength and muscular endurance with aerobic training, led by physiotherapists in groups of 8-10 participants. Each program will be individualized based on the evaluations of muscular strength and enduranceas well as determination of aerobic-anaerobic zone transition described in previous studies In sessions of one hour 3 times a week. Each session will consist of 30 minutes of exercises performed on land followed by 20 minutes of continuous running in treadmill.
In week 1 and 2 participants carry out 3 sets of 15 repetitions (reps) to become familiar with the exercises. From week 3 onwards participants will perform 4 sets of 10 reps. If the participant can do more than 12 reps, weight will be increased. All exercises are conducted supervised to ensure proper technique and adequate progression.</description>
