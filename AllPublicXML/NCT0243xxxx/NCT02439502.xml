      The intent of this study is to evaluate the performance and usability of Fuse in routine
      practice EndoChoice's Fuse system - Fuse is an FDA, CE and AMAR approved Endoscopic system
      (Gastroscope and Colonoscope).

      Fuse® system The Fuse system is intended for diagnostic visualization of the digestive tract.
      The system also provides access for therapeutic interventions using standard endoscopy tools.
      The Fuse system consists of camera heads, endoscopes, video system, light source and other
      ancillary equipment.

      Fuse Colonoscopes in conjunction with the FuseBox™ processor are indicated for use within the
      lower digestive tract (including the anus, rectum, sigmoid colon, colon and ileocecal valve)
      for adult subjects.

      Fuse Gastroscopes in conjunction with the FuseBox™ processor are indicated for use within the
