      The EAGLE study is a Phase 3, open-label, multi-center, two-part, single-arm study of
      GeNOsyl(R) delivery system(s) to evaluate if inhaled nitric oxide-induced vasodilation
      predicts successful wean from parenteral prostacyclin (PGI) in subjects with World Health
      Organization (WHO) Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) undergoing a medically
      necessary right heart catheterization (RHC). All subjects enrolled in the study will undergo
      an attempt to wean from parenteral PGI per standard of care.

      This study will be divided into 2 parts: a Pilot Phase followed by Pivotal Phase.

        -  The Pilot Phase will enroll up to 20 subjects. The information derived from the Pilot
           Phase will evaluate safety, and assess the vasoreactivity test response rate.

        -  Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in the Pivotal Phase of the study, to gather
           further data on weaned successes from parenteral PGI. The Investigator and study staff
           involved with the wean and patient management will be blinded in this phase of the study
           to the vasoreactivity results.

    <time_frame>Visit 4 - Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the number of subjects that achieve Wean Success that are Vasoreactivity Response (VR) positive (+) versus VR negative (-)and the number of subjects that are Wean Failures that are VR(+) versus VR(-).
Wean-Success:
No parenteral PGI therapy at 3 months post-wean completion; and
Clinical stability, where clinical stability is defined as:
A decrease in 6MWT distance less than 10% from pre-wean; and
NT-proBNP increase &lt;15% from pre-wean; and
WHO Functional Class &lt;III
Wean-Failure:
Subjects that wean successfully but do not meet all clinical stability components of the Wean-Success definition above; or
Failure to wean within the 3 month Transition Period; or
Re-initiation of parental PGI during the 3 month post-wean or subject does not meet the definition of clinical stability at 3 month post-wean; or
Death or hospitalization due to progression of disease; or
Atrial septostomy; or
Heart and/or lung transplantation</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject or subject's legally authorized representative signs and dates an
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form prior to the
             initiation of any study-related activities.

          -  The subject has been diagnosed with PAH (WHO Group 1) and is WHO Functional Class I or
             II at Screening.

          -  The subject has documented continuous PGI use for ≥ 1 year from Screening, without a
             significant interruption (i.e., ≤ 2 day interruption) and without a failed complete
             wean attempt.

          -  The subject is a candidate for weaning off parenteral PGI therapy (per Investigator
             judgment and standard of care).

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The subject has a hypersensitivity or allergy to ingredients of inhaled nitric oxide
             or other clinically significant allergies (clinical significance per Investigator
             judgment).

          -  The subject has a PCWP or left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) ≥15 mmHg at
             Baseline.

          -  The subject has participated in an investigational product or device study within the
             30 days prior to Screening.
