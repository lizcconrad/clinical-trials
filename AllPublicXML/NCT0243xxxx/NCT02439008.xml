    <textblock>
      This study will follow-up immune cell populations, secreted factors and released nanovesicles
      in the blood before, during and after high dose radiation therapy which should give new
      information of the efficacy of the hypofractionated high dose radiation therapy and a
      rationale for adjuvant immunotherapy.

      -  Patient information and collection of a signed informed consent form

        -  Clinical data collection

        -  Blood samples of 35 mL:

             1. after registration, prior to the first fraction of radiotherapy

             2. within 15 minutes after the administration of the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd
                radiotherapy sessions

             3. one week, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after the last radiotherapy
                session

        -  Storage of the blood samples at ambient temperature

        -  Transportation of the samples to the Institute of Biology of Lille (IBL) - CNRS UMR8161
           for analysis

        -  Destruction of the samples at the end of the analysis
