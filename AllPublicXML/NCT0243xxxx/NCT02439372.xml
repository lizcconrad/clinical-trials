  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consequences of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection reactivation on ulcerative colitis
      flare, as a flare-worsening factor or simple bystander, are debated. Theoretically,
      CMV-specific cell-mediate immune response will further categorize the patients into high or
      low risk of CMV colitis. The investigators thus evaluate the usefulness of CMV-specific
      ELISPOT assay in patient with ulcerative colitis flare to assess the the impact of CMV
      colitis on ulcerative colitis flare.

      Moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients admitted in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
      center will be enrolled in this study. Eligible patients had active UC with a Mayo score of
      6-12 points (moderate or severe disease activity). The investigators will evaluate whether
      CMV-specific cell-mediated immune response at admission will predict the risk of active
      cytomegalovirus infection (true pathogen versus bystander).
