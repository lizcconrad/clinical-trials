    <textblock>
      The objective of this Open Label Study is to evaluate effects of Rolapitant IV solution, and
      its metabolite, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the P-gp substrate (digoxin), the BCRP
      substrate (sulfasalazine), and multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe substrates in a healthy
      adult population.

      -  Part A will compare the PK of oral digoxin alone and in combination with an IV infusion
           of rolapitant.

        -  Part B will compare the PK of an oral dose of sulfasalazine alone to the PK of an oral
           dose of sulfasalazine in combination with an IV infusion of rolapitant

        -  Part C will compare the PK of an oral dose of the Cooperstown Cocktail (midazolam,
           omeprazole, warfarin, caffeine, and dextromethorphan) alone and when given in
           combination with an IV infusion of rolapitant.

             prior to administration of the first dose of study drug (Day 1)

          -  Subjects with poor venous access and/or cannot tolerate venipuncture

          -  Subjects with a history of significant complications or anxiety associated with the IV
             administration of medications that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could make the
             subject

          -  Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to sulfasalazine (Part B only).
