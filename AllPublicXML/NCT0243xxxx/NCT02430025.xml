    <textblock>
      This proposal delineates a research plan to collect blood from the patients with
      cardiovascular diseases for the purpose of establishing a molecular biological bank registry.
      The Fujian provincial hospital will enroll 8,000 patients.The blood collected will be
      processed to create a repository of molecular biological plasma. Along with a sample of blood
      collected from individual patients, a concise general medical history, demographic data,
      electrocardiographic data, echocardiographic data, and laboratory data will be collected. A
      short interview will take place after enrollment during the outpatient visit or hospital
      stay, or may be conducted via phone call after enrollment. All the clinical data gathered
      will be compiled in Fujian provincial hospital center database, and would be stored in a
      format where a culmination of clinical findings, i.e. representing a disease of interest, can
      be used to search the database to identify the blood samples of all patients with such
      characteristics for further study.

      The study is to commence on May 1st 2015 and is to be completed within 3-5 years. The
      targeted number of patients to be enrolled is 8,000. All patients have the history of
      cardiovascular diseases, will be eligible to be enrolled. Patients inclusion criteria are as
      follows, once informed consent is obtained:

        1. Males or females at least 18 years old.

        2. Patient has not been previously enrolled in the molecular biological bank registry of
           the Fujian provincial hospital.

        3. Patient able to give informed consent.

        4. Any patient with history of cardiovascular diseases (If a subject reports history of
           cardiovascular diseases at another facility, outside records will be obtained to confirm
           the diagnosis.
