  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective biobank set up to collect serum from patients with disorders associated
      with changes in androgens, estrogens or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), before and/or
      after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro cell-based bioassays may be a technique to measure serum androgen or estrogen
      bioactivity. In this study investigators are collecting serum (and if possible, urine)
      samples from different cohorts of patients, before and/or after treatment.

      The aim is to measure androgens, estrogens and SHBG as well as in vitro bioactivity with
      newly developed cell-based bioassays, and to compare different techniques to each other as
      well as to clinical endpoints available in the patient's Electronic Health Record.
