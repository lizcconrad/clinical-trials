    <textblock>
      The current study using the longitudinal study in preschool children to exam three study
      issues: 1) using the neuropsychological functions (ie. Behavioral inhibition, delay aversion,
      the variability of reaction time) among the preschool children predict the ADHD diagnosis and
      behavior symptoms in 1.5 years later. 2) using the behavior inhibition, delay aversion and
      the variability of reaction time (using the parameter among Gaussian distribution and
      ex-Gaussian distribution) explore the association between attention and motor inhibition
      problems. 3) explore the transaction effect between the neuropsychological functions and
      family function and parenting to predict ADHD comorbidity with oppositional defiant
      disorder.4) explore the association between the internalizing/ externalizing problems of ADHD
      and temperament. The current study has opportunity to describe and to answer the complicated
      problems for heterogeneous neuropsychological deficits in ADHD, and to elucidate the core
      issues for ADHD have comorbid with ODD. The most important contribution is to offer the
      empirical evidence to make a clean suggestion in ADHD diagnosis and intervention in preschool
      age.

      The current study would follow the same participants for 1.5 years, time 1 is around 4-5
      years old, and time 2 is around 6-7 years old.

      Participants:

        -  100 typical developmental control

        -  120 ADHD high risk preschool children at time 1

      The diagnosis at time 2 to have three groups in this study:

        -  ADHD persistent

        -  ADHD remission

        -  typical developmental control

      The measurements were included

        -  the different neuropsychological test (ie. behavioral inhibition, delay aversion, and
           vigilance task)

        -  the ADHD behavioral rating scales and diagnosis interview

        -  the scaling for family function and parenting

        -  intellectual assessment

      This study could offer the suggestion for the further intervention in ADHD.
