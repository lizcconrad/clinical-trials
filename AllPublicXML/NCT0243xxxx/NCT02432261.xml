  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, two-center trial to evaluate the
      gonadotropin suppressive activity of transdermal treatment with a combined NES/T gel, or T
      gel alone, for 28 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 45 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment
      groups. A description of each group is as follows:

        -  Group 1 (30 subjects): 5.0 mL of the 1.62% combined gel (containing 8.3 mg NES + 62.5 mg
           T) applied each day on the arms and shoulders

        -  Group 2 (15 subjects): 4.4 mL of the 1.62% AndrogelTM (containing 62.7 mg T) applied
           each day to the arms and shoulders

      The total duration of treatment will be 28 days followed by a 72 hour sampling period to
      assess half-life and a recovery period of at least 28 days, at which point the subjects will
      return to the clinic for an end of study visit.

    <description>To quantify the gonadotropin suppressive activity of 4 weeks daily therapy of a combination transdermal gel containing 8.3 mg Nestorone® (NES) gel and 62.5 mg (1.62%) testosterone (T) gel, and of T gel (1.62%) alone. Specifically, the proportion (and 95% CI) of men who suppress both gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) to ≤ 1 IU/L in each group, will be quantified.</description>

    <description>General composite safety as measured various times during the study by CBC, chemistry, AEs, vital signs, general pre- and post-treatment physical exams and PSA levels.
In addition to the above composite measures, another safety outcomes to be included in the overall composite safety review will include changes in mood based on Patient Health Questionnaire and changes in sexual function based on Psychosexual Safety outcomes, both measured by a questionnaire.</description>
