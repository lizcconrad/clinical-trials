      This is a long-term-safety roll-over extension study for a Phase II Study (Protocol
      CPC-001-07). Patients having safely completed the 12-week maintenance phase of Study
      CPC-001-07 will be eligible for admission. Subjects will remain on their CPC-201 MTD as
      determined in Study CPC-001-07. The dose of CPC-201 will be increased from 15 mg/day
      (administered in Study CPC-001-07) to 20mg/day starting on Day1. For those patients who do
      not tolerate 20mg/day CPC-201, the dose of CPC-201will be decreased to its previously
      tolerated level of 15mg/day.

      This protocol allows to increase patients' MTD of CPC-201, as previously determined in the
      Phase II Study (CPC-001-07 protocol) by, 5mg or 10mg increment up to a maximum of 60 mg/day
      starting on Day7 or Month 3 visits of this extension protocol per Investigator's judgment and
      patient's tolerability.

      This extension study is intended to continue for each enrolled patient for up to 6 months
      unless medically contraindicated. Patients may withdraw from this study at any time. Upon
      termination of this study, patients will return to their original daily donepezil dose of 10
      mg/day and will continue to receive CPC-201 mg/day for one final week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent document
             indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures required by the study
             and are willing to participate in the study and comply with all study procedures and
             restrictions. Informed consent must be obtained from the patient and/or a designated
             representative prior to initiating any procedures of the study.

          2. Have safely completed 12 week maintenance phase of CPC-001-07 study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Renal and hepatic dysfunction with:

             Total Bilirubin: &gt;1.5 x UNL AST: &gt;2.5 x UNL ALT: &gt;2.5 x UNL Serum Creatinine: &gt;1.5 x
             UNL Creatinine Clearance: &lt;30 mL/min (calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation)

          2. History or presence of myasthenia.

          3. ECG findings of:

             Complete Left Bundle Branch Block; Ventricular pacing; 2nd degree or 3rd degree AV
             block; Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter; HR &lt;45 or &gt;100; PR &gt;220 msec; or QTcF
             &gt;450 msec in male, &gt;470 msec in female

          4. Patients considered unlikely to co-operate in the study, and/or poor compliance
             anticipated by the investigator.

          5. Any other clinically relevant acute or chronic diseases which could interfere with
             patients' safety during the trial, or expose them to undue risk, or which could
             interfere with study objectives.
