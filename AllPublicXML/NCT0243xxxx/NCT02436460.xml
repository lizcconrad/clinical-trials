    <textblock>
      This study is to establish the safety, determine if there is an improvement in steroid
      refractory acute graft-vs-host disease (aGvHD) compared to historical cohorts, and determine
      the changes of aGvHD-associated T-cell clones in patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD
      following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation administered AbGn-168H once weekly
      for 4 weeks.

      AbGn-168H is a humanized monoclonal antibody. This is a dose escalation study using a
      modified toxicity probability interval method. AbGn-168H will be administered intravenously
      (IV) once weekly for four weeks, in patients with steroid refractory aGVHD following
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up for 90 days.The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety, and
      the secondary objectives of this study are to determine if there is an improvement in disease
      response at 3 months after diagnosis of steroid refractory aGVHD compared to historical
      cohorts and to determine the changes in frequency and/or phenotype of aGVHD-associated T cell
      clones in response to AbGn-168H therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of skin, gut and/or liver steroid-refractory GVHD by clinical assessment of
             treating physician following allogeneic HCT. Patients who fail to respond to steroids
             by 7 days are considered steroid-refractory

          2. Previously-treated with any conditioning regimen and any GVHD immune suppression
             prophylaxis and formulation of steroids, except as noted in Exclusion Criteria #2.

          3. AbGn-168H (neihulizumab) therapy can begin not more than 14 days after diagnosis of
             aGvHD

          4. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &gt; 50%

          5. No evidence of HCT graft failure or multi-organ failure

          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled infections not responsive to antimicrobial therapy requiring intensive
             critical care

             unresponsive to therapy

          3. Treatment with investigational GVHD prophylactic agents (eg, CCR5 inhibitors;
             lenalidomide; and/or bortezomib) within the 7 days prior to the 1st dose of
             neihulizumab

          4. Treatment with other investigational agents within the prior 7 days prior to the 1st
             dose of AbGn-168H (neihulizumab)

          5. CMV PCR &gt; 500 copies/mL or evidence of end-organ damage due to CMV
