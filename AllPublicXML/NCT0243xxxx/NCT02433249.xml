  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to develop an intervention, based on empirical evidence
      and health-related behavioral change theory, to enhance motivation for engaging in
      fall-reducing physical activities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention being developed, Ready~Steady, combines 3 components; a) interpersonal
      motivation, b) intrapersonal motivation, and c) physical activity. Theoretical concepts from
      the wellness motivation theory are (a) translated into intervention strategies; and (b)
      operationalized as variables to form a basis for evaluating this intervention. The overall
      objective is to advance the development of Ready~Steady by assessing the impact of its
      motivation components.
