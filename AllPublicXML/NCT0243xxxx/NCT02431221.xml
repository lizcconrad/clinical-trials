      A Study on the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Perhexiline maleate in Subjects with
      Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Moderate-To-Severe Heart Failure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      clinical trial of the effects of perhexiline maleate on a rank-ordered, hierarchical variable
      consisting of outcome and functional measures in 350 subjects with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy and symptoms of moderate to severe congestive heart failure. The study is
      designed in four parts: 1) an open-label run-in period of 2 weeks, 2) A blinded, randomized
      phase of variable duration (anticipated between 6 months and 18 months depending on
      enrollment rate), 3) an open label period of 3 months, and 4) a randomized withdrawal period
      of 3 months. Subjects who do not experience an adverse outcome (death or resuscitated
      ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, need for surgical intervention, cardiovascular
      hospitalization, occurrence of atrial fibrillation, or study dropout) will undergo
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing in order to determine change from baseline in maximum oxygen
      consumption.

    <description>Perhexiline maleate will be supplied in 100 mg and 25 mg tablets. It will be initially administered at a dose of 200 mg once a day in tablet form for at least six months. After initiation of dosing, perhexiline dosing will be determined using plasma level guided dose adjustment. Dosing decisions will be made by an unblinded dose control center.</description>

    <description>Placebo will be administered once a day in tablet form for at least six months. Tablets will be identical in size and shape to perhexiline tablets.

    <description>perhexiline maleate, oral, 25mg or 100mg tablets Whenever initiating PHM therapy, subjects will receive a loading regimen of PHM as indicated in in the Heart Metabolics Dose Justification document. Drug levels will be measured first on Day 4 +/- 1 day, with an initial dose adjustment performed on Day 7 +/- 1 day, as needed. The next sampling will occur on Day 21 +/- 1 day for potential dose adjustment, as advised by the DCC, on or about Day 24. Subsequent dosing will be monitored and advised by a Dose Control Center</description>
