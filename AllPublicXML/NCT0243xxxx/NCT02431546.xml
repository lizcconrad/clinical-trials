  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of a mobile health cardiovascular
      prevention program in patients who have recently graduated from cardiac rehabilitation. The
      mobile health program will focus on promoting healthy lifestyles through the use of a mobile
      application (app), mobile physical activity monitor and a system of remote health coaching.

      By testing a novel mHealth intervention focused on lifestyle modification, this trial will
      address a critical evidence gap in the care of patients after they graduate from CR. Many
      patients who graduate from traditional CR struggle with unhealthy lifestyles, and these
      patients currently have no lifestyle-based care strategies to help them. The results of this
      study have the potential to lead to new sustainable and resource-efficient, lifestyle-based
      preventive care strategies for patients with stable CVD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized trial designed to examine the hypothesis that a
      lifestyle-based mobile health cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention program administered to
      graduates of a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program will improve physical activity, body
      composition, fitness, and quality of life (QOL).

      The investigators may enroll up to 52 men and women volunteers from a pool of graduates of
      the Duke Cardiac Rehabilitation Program who are initially eligible to participate in this
      study. Of the 52 men and women volunteers who may be initially consented, it is anticipated
      that a portion (potentially 30%) may drop out during the study timeline, and approximately 40
      are expected to complete this study. Following informed consent and baseline testing, the
      participants will be randomized in a 3:1 fashion to receive VIDA's 12-week mHealth program
      focused on lifestyle modification through remote health coaching in order to improve physical
      activity, body composition, and fitness. The multi-domain mHealth intervention will mirror
      traditional CR programs by focusing primarily on a structured physical activity intervention
      within the context of a comprehensive lifestyle program. Physical activity will be monitored
      by Fitbits and will be integrated into VIDA's mHealth platform which will also include
      modules on physical activity, weight management, heart healthy diet, medication adherence,
      coping with a chronic disease, psychosocial management, and stress management/sleep. Health
      coaches will be used to guide patients through the 12-week program. All participants will
      undergo measures of physical activity, body composition, fitness, and QOL at baseline and at
      12-weeks.

    <description>VIDA is a mobile technology that is well positioned to provide healthcare coaching. After completing the CR program, each participant will have access to the VIDA mobile phone platform for the 12-week intervention, and be instructed to download the app on his/her smart phone. VIDA will assign an individual professional health coach selected from a pool of well-trained and experienced health professionals-nutritionists, fitness trainers, nurses and health educators. Each coach will engage their patient in a productive and meaningful health mentorship on a daily basis. The coach and patient work as a team to successfully set goals and make small changes that add up to significant improvements in the patients' dietary choices, physical activity, medication management, as well as understanding of their health status.
Physical Activity: A goal of &quot;total number of steps&quot; to attain daily will be provided by the Duke study team to the patient and monitored using a Fitbit activity tracker.</description>

All participants will be contacted by study personnel in order to schedule visits at baseline and 12-weeks for the outcome assessments.</description>

    <description>Health coaching is an innovative, holistic approach oriented towards one's full health and wellbeing. Coaches provide mentoring and support regarding many areas of life that impact one's health with a focus on skill-building. Health coaches do not provide medical advice, treat any medical conditions, provide mental health therapy, or provide individualized assessments of nutrient needs. Health coaches will not conduct medication counseling activities that would alter the prescribed regimen nor provide medication information/advice that would be considered the practice of medicine or pharmacy.
A Fitbit activity monitor will be used to track daily physical activity and provide real-time feedback to the participant.</description>
