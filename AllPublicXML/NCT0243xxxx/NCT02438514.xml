    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the potential utility of stress-related biomarkers
      obtained via dried blood spots (DBS) and retinal scans by collecting new data from mothers
      and children within the New Haven MOMS Partnership, a well-established community-partnered
      research setting. The proposed research could greatly advance the application of
      stress-related biomarkers within community-based research by increasing our understanding of
      how stress, trauma, and depression influence biology in childhood and adulthood, as measured
      using minimally-invasive approaches.

        children in New Haven.

        Primary source of recruitment will be the screening/needs assessment from our affiliated
        MOMS Partnership protocol, however, we will actively respond to inquiries from any
        preliminarily eligible biological mother in the New Haven community who expresses interest
        in the study
