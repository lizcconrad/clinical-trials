  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary and general objective of the clinical introduction of the SFP as the current
      standard of care is to improve the quality of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer patients
      by reducing radiation-induced side effects without hampering treatment efficacy in terms of
      locoregional tumour control and overall survival and to systematically evaluate the
      beneficial effect of newly introduced radiation technology for this particular group of
      patients. The clinical introduction of the SFP will allow for a systematic and broad scale
      quality improvement cycle for head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. In
      fact, this methodology can be considered a kind of quality circle for the clinical
      introduction of new radiation techniques, aiming at continuous efforts for further
      improvement.

      Specific objectives

        -  To develop, validate, and improve normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models
           for a wide variety of acute and late radiation-induced side effects relevant for head
           and neck cancer patients (step 1);

        -  To use the outcome of the NTCP models to better inform patients on the risks on acute
           and late toxicity;

        -  To use the outcome of the NTCP models for the definition of dose constraints for
           radiotherapy treatment planning in current practice;

        -  To use the outcome of the NTCP models for the development and investigation of the
           potential benefit of new and emerging radiation delivery technique, such as swallowing
           sparing intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton radiotherapy.

        -  To compare the outcome of new radiation delivery techniques that are clinically
           introduced with the current standard in terms of radiation-induced toxicity,
           patient-rated symptoms and quality of life and in terms of locoregional tumour control
           and overall survival
