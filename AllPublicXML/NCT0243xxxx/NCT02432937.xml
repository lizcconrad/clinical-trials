      The study aims to compare the effects of two doses of Corever with placebo in patients with
      essential hypertension. Eligible subjects who belong to one of the following subtypes are
      planned to be enrolled: (1) patients with essential hypertension without drug control, or (2)
      uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment with up to 2 antihypertensive agents. Of note,
      the second category will receive randomized study treatments in addition to continuing their
      previous medication throughout the trial. The study also wants to investigate the safety
      profile of Corever during treatment period.
