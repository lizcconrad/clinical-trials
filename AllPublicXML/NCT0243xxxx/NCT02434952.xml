  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Cambodia, falciparum is becoming more difficult to treat because drugs are becoming less
      effective. The investigators can help to try to prevent the spread of this resistant malaria
      by adding a drug that will make it more difficult for the mosquito to drink up the malaria in
      people's blood. If the mosquito cannot drink up the malaria, then the malaria cannot develop
      in the mosquito so it will not be able to inject malaria back into people when it bites. The
      drug the investigators will use is called primaquine.

      Primaquine commonly causes the red cells in the blood to break apart if they are weak. Red
      cells need enzymes to work properly and weak red cells have low amounts of an enzyme called
      glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The investigators want to know if treating malaria
      with primaquine will be safe for the red cells. To do this study, the investigators need to
      know if a subject has low G6PD or not.
