  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activity of COTI-2 has been demonstrated in various cancer tumor models. With its p53- and
      AKT-based mechanisms of action, COTI-2 is anticipated to be highly relevant in treatment of
      patients with gynecologic malignancies or head and neck suamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      This study is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of COTI-2 in patients
      with advanced and recurrent gynecologic malignancies and HNSCC to establish a recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future studies.

      Patients are currently being recruited for Part 2 of the study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-part, multi-center, open-label, Phase 1, first-in-patient study of COTI-2 in
      patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, endometrial, or cervical
      cancer (collectively gynecological malignancies), and in patients with head and neck squamous
      cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      COTI-2 will be self-administered as a single agent, orally, once daily for 5 days followed by
      2 treatment-free days each week.

      Part 1 of the study will be dose finding in patients with gynecological malignancies using a
      3 + 3 design to establish the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) over 6 planned cohorts.

      Part 2 of the study will be dose finding in patients with HNSCC using a 3 + 3 design to
      establish the MTD over 6 planned cohorts.

      Part 3 of the study will enrol a further 10 Ovarian and 10 HNSCC participants to further
      establish tolerability and efficacy at the MTD.
