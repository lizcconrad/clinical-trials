      This is a prospective, single-center, open label, within-subject clinical trial to evaluate
      the identification of anatomical markers in the gastrointestinal tract using the IRIS feeding
      tube. The trial will evaluate hospitalized subjects who require short-term enteral feeding
      with an anticipated duration of at least 3 days while in an intensive care unit (ICU) or
      step-down unit. Eligible men and women at least 18 years of age who give voluntary, written
      informed consent to participate in the clinical investigation will be included as subjects.
      If a potential subject is incapacitated and unable to provide informed consent, a designated
      legally authorized representative will be allowed to provide the informed consent on behalf
      of the subject to allow their participation in the study. Study entry will be defined as the
      point of signed informed consent. A Prospective, Single-Center, Open Label, Within-Subject
      Case Series to Evaluate the Identification of Anatomical Markers in the Gastrointestinal
      Tract Using the KANGAROO™ Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology
