  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This subproject is included in a project coordinated between program groups Evaluation of
      Health Services of Epidemiology and Public Health (Project CAMISS). The overall objective is
      to evaluate different aspects of health care received by patients with breast cancer from the
      diagnostic process, treatment, complications, survival and quality of life, to provide
      information to improve the effectiveness of interventions, reduce variability, have best
      predictive rules and increase the quality of life. The main objective of the subproject is to
      create and validate prospectively predictive rules of recurrence, complications, mortality,
      changes in quality of life in these patients at admission and one/two years of treatment and
      to evaluate the external validity of our rules to predict relapses, complications and
      mortality in the retrospective sample of patients participating in screening programs.
      Observational methodology with information available from a retrospective cohort of women
      diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 and another 2-year prospective follow-up included 2040
      incident cases of breast cancer in 18 hospitals of 5 regions. Cohorts will learn clinical and
      health care diagnosis, tumor, treatment, hospital, follow-up (complications, relapse, and
      vital status) cost and quality of life. Prediction rules are created by means of
      regression/Cox models at the prospective sample and also investigators will assess the
      external validity in the retrospective cohort in the case of recurrence, complications and
      mortality. Expected results: There are currently no results of cohort analysis of the
      diagnostic process of care that integrates different aspects. The study will create tools to
      assist prognostic and therapeutic decision making process in these patients
