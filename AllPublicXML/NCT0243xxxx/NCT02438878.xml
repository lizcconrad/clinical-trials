      The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the impact on infant growth and
      infant-feeding practices of a low-cost series of video trainings and tools targeted to
      medical staff and designed to support ongoing Baby Behavior education of WIC participants.
      The intervention, currently used in all California WIC agencies, teaches caregivers to
      recognize and understand healthy infant behaviors such as the range of infant cues and common
      patterns for sleep and crying. This project will also evaluate the acceptance, knowledge
      transfer, and use of the tools by health care providers and medical staff. It is expected
      that trained staff will be prepared to share Baby Behavior messages with their patients and
      that the information will be delivered quickly and easily during well-baby visits.

    <description>The intervention is comprised of 2 components: HCP and medical staff training and participant education. The trainings will be video-based and aim to build providers' knowledge and skills to support parents' recognition and understanding of common healthy infant behaviors that may be misinterpreted by parents. The intervention does not include any specific recommendations for infant feeding, nor does it include any information related to the assessment, diagnosis or treatment for any medical condition.
After completion of the intervention trainings, health care providers and medical staff will be asked to use what they learned with the mothers of infants in their care. Short handouts for mothers will be provided as tools to reinforce the verbal education. All educational materials will be focused only on supporting parents' abilities to recognize and understand common, healthy infant behaviors.</description>
