  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a non-randomized clinical trial of 60 HIV-infected infants
      identified within 48 hours of birth and their mothers to investigate the consequences of very
      early ART on the establishment and maintenance of the viral reservoir.

      The first phase (early ART initiation within 48 hours of birth) will examine the trajectory
      i.e. changes over time of the viral reservoir and detection of HIV-specific antibody
      responses in infants testing HIV-positive within 48 hours of birth and initiating early ART.

      Secondary pathogenesis aims will test whether markers of neonatal immune quiescence are
      associated with the extent of seeding and rate of decline of the viral reservoir when ART is
      started at a young age and investigate whether markers in infant stool samples can be used as
      a non-invasive method of defining relevant immune and HIV-specific parameters associated with
      viral reservoir size.

      The investigators hypothesize that developmental characteristics of newborn immunity may make
      this period the optimal time to begin ART and influence the seeding of the viral reservoir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs using antiretrovirals (ARVs) have
      had tremendous success in sub-Saharan Africa. However, HIV transmission continues to occur
      because (1) implementation of PMTCT is incomplete and (2) ARV interventions are not 100%
      effective in blocking infection. Thus the challenge of providing treatment to HIV-infected
      children is far from over. The capacity of early ART treatment to favorably influence the
      viral reservoir and potentially lead to post-treatment cessation viral control needs to be
      described in the population of infants, and to identify useful public health strategies.

    <description>All infants enrolled in the trial, regardless of maternal PMTCT regimen, will be initiated on a triple ARV regimen consisting of nevirapine (NVP), zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC) presumptively based on the initial positive result. This regimen will be continued to 42 weeks post menstrual age (PMA). At this time, infants will be switched to LPV/r, ZDV and 3TC to be continued to 104 weeks or longer unless otherwise preferred by the treating clinician or if any clinical or laboratory contraindications are identified.</description>
