      The purpose of the present randomized-controlled trial is to investigate the efficacy of
      Metacognitive Training for Depression (D-MCT), a new low-threshold, modular group
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the existence of evidence-based treatment methods, a significant treatment gap
      remains for major depression. While in acute psychiatric treatment of severely depressed
      patients a pharmacological treatment is usually applied, depression-specific
      psychotherapeutic (group) concepts are rarely part of the treatment, though recommended in
      clinical guidelines. A main reason is that present group concepts were designed primarily for
      outpatient settings and do not meet the structural requirements of inpatient care (i.e.,
      short residence time, continuous admissions and dismissals).

      Metacognitive Training for Depression (D-MCT) is a new low-threshold, modular group
      intervention which was designed to fill this treatment gap by addressing contextual and
      structural shortcomings of existing concepts for the use in inpatient treatment. The training
      targets depressive symptoms by changing (meta-) cognitive biases identified in both cognitive
      models of depression and basic research. D-MCT was positively evaluated with regard to
      feasibility and acceptance in a non-randomized pilot study.

      Aim of the present randomized-controlled trial is to investigate the efficacy of D-MCT as an
      add-on intervention in inpatient treatment of depressed patients compared with a standard
      add-on group therapy (Positivity Training, PT). Based on a power analysis, the investigators
      target a sample size of 60 depressed patients, who will be randomized either to D-MCT or PT.
      Blind to diagnostic status, symptom level as well as cognitive biases will be assessed pre-
      and post-treatment (8 group sessions) as well as 3 months later (follow-up). Primary outcome
      parameter is severity of depressive symptoms measured with the HDRS total score (17-item
      version). Secondary outcome measures are self-assessed depression (BDI), dysfunctional
      beliefs (DAS), metacognitions (MCQ), self-esteem (RSE), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF).

    <description>D-MCT is conceptualized as a variant of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that uses a metacognitive perspective to focus on the modification of cognitive biases by using creative and engaging strategies (e.g., multimedial presentation). The training seeks to enable group members to recognize and correct the often automatic and unconscious depressive thought patterns, in part by viewing this depressive thought process at a distance (i.e., depersonalizing). Besides dysfunctional assumptions about one's thought processes, more general cognitive biases, which have been identified by basic research are at the core of the D-MCT. Finally, dysfunctional coping-strategies (i.e., thought suppression, rumination as problem-solving) are discussed and modified.</description>

    <description>Positivity Training (PT) is a &quot;euthymic therapy&quot; group based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a focus on the education and training of sensual enjoyment and pleasure. Aim of the training is to reduce depressive symptomatology by increasing the ability to enjoy and to (re-)install positive sensory experiences. Therefore, group members are informed about the impact of positive experiences on well-being and the awareness of the five senses is trained in different practical exercises (hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch).</description>
