  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends cooling (inducing mild hypothermia) patients
      who were resuscitated following cardiac arrest but who remained comatose. Induced mild
      hypothermia is now the standard of care for post-resuscitation patients in the intensive care
      unit (ICU) setting. The use of cooling has recently moved to pre-hospital and emergency
      department (ED) application as more current studies show that early initiation of cooling
      significantly improves neurologic outcomes and survival rates instead of waiting until the
      patient arrives in the ICU to initiate cooling. In the pre-hospital setting chilled saline
      (4°C) and packing the body in ice have been the primary methods to initiate induced mild
      hypothermia The Excel Cryo Cooling System is a non-invasive cervical collar (C-collar) that
      provides cooling to the carotid arteries, the main blood supply to the brain, and allows for
      the rapid initiation of selective cerebral cooling. The investigators are planning to use
      MRI-thermometry to see how quickly the Excel Cryo Cooling Collar can drop brain temperature
      when applied by itself.

      Healthy volunteers will be used for this study to provide important temperature data on the
      effectiveness of the Excel Cryo Cooling System. The investigators will be able to use the
      data from this project to further the current clinical research in induced mild hypothermia
      after cardiac arrest.
