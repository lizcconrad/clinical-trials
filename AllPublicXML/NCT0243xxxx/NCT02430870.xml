      This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-center, multiple-dose
      study in healthy participants and participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This
      study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-648 when
      administered as multiple oral doses of TAK-648 solution at escalating dose levels in healthy
      participants of Japanese decent and participants with T2DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being evaluated in this study is TAK-648 for the treatment of T2DM.

      This study will consist of 2 parts: (1) multiple ascending doses in participants with T2DM
      treated with a stable dose of metformin, (2) multiple ascending doses in healthy participants
      of Japanese descent.

      Part 1 of this study will consist of 2 multiple dose treatment cohorts (Cohorts 1-2
      designated as P1C1 and P1C2) dosed sequentially in escalating order. The projected doses of
      TAK-648 for Part 1 are 0.15 and 0.35 mg of TAK-648, but may be adjusted higher or lower, and
      additional cohorts may be added, based on available safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data. All
      cohorts in Part 1 will consist of 8 (2 placebo) T2DM participants.

      Part 2 of this study will consist of 3 multiple dose treatment cohorts (Cohorts 1-3
      designated as P2C1, P2C2 and P2C3) in healthy participants of Japanese descent dosed
      sequentially in escalating order. The projected doses of TAK-648 chosen for Part 2 are 0.05,
      0.15 and 0.35 mg of TAK-648, but may be adjusted higher or lower based on available safety
      and PK data. All cohorts in Part 2 will consist of 8 (2 placebo) healthy participants of
      Japanese descent.

      Additional cohorts may be recruited and studied as necessary to better evaluate safety,
      tolerability, PK, and/or PD parameters.

          <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
