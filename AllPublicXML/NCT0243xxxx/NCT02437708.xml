    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of autologous 'leucocyte and platelet rich fibrin' (L-PRF) on
      the periapical bone healing and further root development of infected immature permanent
      teeth. In the test group regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) is performed with L-PRF as
      scaffold, in the control group REP without L-PRF is performed .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regenerative endodontic procedures are biologically based procedures designed to restore
      function of a damaged and nonfunctioning pulp by stimulation of existing stem and progenitor
      cells present in the root canal and/or the introduction and stimulation of new stem and
      dental pulp progenitor cells into the root canal under conditions that are favorable to their
      differentiation and reestablishment of function. L-PRF has the potential advantage of
      creating a bioactive construct that stimulates the local environment for differentiation and
      proliferation of these stem and progenitor cells. We have designed this confirmatory study to
      test the hypothesis that the use of L-PRF in REP of infected permanent immature teeth will
      accelerate periapical bone healing and stimulate the root maturation.

    <description>The first REP session will be performed as described by Diogenes et al. (2013). For the second REP-session a venipunction will be performed before the endodontic treatment. 2 to 4 tubes of blood will be collected per tooth. These blood samples will be put into a centrifuge for 12 minutes at 2700 rpm. Fibrin clots will be collected after centrifugation and inserted in the root canal with endodontic pluggers. Medcem Portlandcement (GmbH, Swiss) will be used instead of mineral trioxide aggregate in the second session, to prevent tooth discoloration.</description>
