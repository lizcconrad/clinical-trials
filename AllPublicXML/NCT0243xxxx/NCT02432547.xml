  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 24 month phase IV, randomised, prospective, multicentre, clinical trial of
      laser therapy to areas of peripheral retinal ischaemia combined with intravitreal aflibercept
      versus intravitreal aflibercept monotherapy. Both arms will have 2mg intravitreal aflibercept
      according to a treat and extend protocol.

      The specific aim of the study is to test whether laser therapy of peripheral retinal
      ischaemia reduces the overall number of intravitreal aflibercept injections required to
      control DMO over a 24 month period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of blindness in individuals between the ages of
      20 and 65 years in developed countries. Swelling of the central retina, or &quot;macular oedema&quot;,
      is the commonest cause of visual loss in diabetic retinopathy.

      Recent studies have suggested peripheral retinal ischaemia contributes to macula oedema in
      diabetes and retinal vein occlusions. Intravitreal anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
      (VEGF) therapy, such as Aflibercept (Eylea) has shown encouraging results in managing
      Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO). There is evidence that regular treatment with anti-VEGF drugs
      reduces DMO and improves vision on average.

      Previous research at this institution has shown that an average of between 7 and 11
      injections are required in the first year to stabilise the disease. However, there is a
      significant burden to patients in terms of frequent visits to the eye specialist, time off
      work and repeated injections into the eye. The purpose of this study is to see whether
      targeted peripheral retinal laser therapy to areas of the retina with impaired blood supply
      can reduce the number of intravitreal aflibercept injections required over 2 years to
      stabilise DMO.

    <description>Aflibercept is a soluble decoy receptor and is produced by fusing all-human DNA sequences of the second immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of human VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1 to the third Ig domain of human VEGFR-2, which are then fused to the Fc region of human IgG-1. By binding to VEGF-A, aflibercept prevents activation of the native VEGF receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The study sites will be supplied by Bayer with aflibercept. Intravitreal injection of 2mg in 0.05 ml aflibercept will be administered to the study eye, according to a pre-defined treat and extend regimen.</description>

    <description>In the experimental group, targeted laser photocoagulation will be applied to areas of peripheral retinal ischaemia 1 month after the initial intravitreal aflibercept. The trial design allows another session of targeted laser photocoagulation 1 month later to complete the treatment if required. Wide-field photography is planned at 3 months to determine if further targeted laser photocoagulation is required, and if so a third session can be applied. The laser settings are based on those used in current clinical practice and have been prospectively defined in the protocol.</description>

             peribulbar triamcinolone within the last 3 months, or anti-VEGF drugs (bevacizumab,
             ranibizumab or aflibercept) within the last 2 months in the study eye.

          -  Cataract surgery within the last 3 months in the study eye

          -  Previous PRP laser treatment in the study eye

          -  Previous vitrectomy in study eye

          -  Media opacity including cataract that already precludes adequate macular photography
             or cataract that is likely to require surgery within 12 months

          -  Intercurrent severe disease such as septicaemia, any condition which would affect
             follow-up or photographic documentation (e.g. geographical, psycho-social)

          -  Blood pressure &gt;180/110

          -  Patient has a condition or is in a situation that in the investigator's opinion may
             put the patient at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with the patient's participation in the study
