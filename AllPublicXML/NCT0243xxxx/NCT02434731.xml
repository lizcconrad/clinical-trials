  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Needle procedures are the most common and important source of pain and distress in children
      in the health care setting. Children with intellectual disability from any cause experience
      pain more frequently than healthy children. They often require venipuncture or IV cannulation
      for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Pain in this population is often unrecognised
      because these patients are frequently unable to self-report their pain. Now it's possible to
      measure pain in children with intellectual disability with specific pain scales, like
      NCCPC-PV (Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist, Post-operative Version).

      The efficacy of a device combining vibration and cold for pain relief during venipuncture or
      IV cannulation has been recently reported in children. The device's actions are based on the
      Gate Control Theory, whereby cold and vibrations stimulate large fiber and inhibitory neurons
      to interrupt nociception. This non-pharmacologic technique for pain relief could be useful in
      this kind of patients in emergency department. To date, there is no study that validated
      Buzzy device for pain relief in children with intellectual disability.

      The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of Buzzy® (a device that provides cold and
      vibration), in reducing the pain during venipuncture or IV cannulation, in children with
      intellectual disability.
