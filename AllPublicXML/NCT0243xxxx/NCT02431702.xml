  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate (PP:
      paliperidone palmitate once-monthly and 3-month injections) versus oral antipsychotic (OAP
      [that is oral paliperidone extended release {ER}, oral risperidone, or another OAP]) in
      delaying time to treatment failure. The study will also evaluate changes in cognition,
      functioning, brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume following treatment with PP compared
      with OAP in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder.

      A Prospective, matched-control, Randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), open-label,
      flexible-dose, study in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform
      disorder to compare disease progression and disease modification following treatment with PP
      long-acting injection (once-monthly followed by 3-month injections) or OAP (Any of the
      following 7 OAPs are permitted: aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone ER,
      perphenazine, quetiapine, and risperidone). The study consists of 3 parts. Part-1 (Oral
      Run-In Phase), Part-2 (Disease Progression) and Part-3 (Extended Disease Progression and
      Disease Modification) with unique endpoints. Screening period will be up to 4 Weeks. Duration
      of Parts will be as: 2 months for Part-1, 9 months for Part-2 and Part-3. All participants
      will initially receive oral paliperidone ER or oral risperidone in Part-1. After
      paliperidone/risperidone treatment in Part-1, participants will be randomized into 1:2 ratio
      to receive PP or OAP in Part-2. Participants who complete Part-2 will enter into Part-3
      wherein OAP group participants of Part-2 will be re-randomized into 1:1 ratio to OAP-OAP
      group and OAP-PP group, and PP group will continue without further randomization. Treatment
      failures will be evaluated in Part-2 and Part-3 of the study. Also changes in cognition,
      functioning, brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume will be evaluated in the study.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout.

    <description>Time to first treatment failure will be the time from participant's randomization to the first treatment failure, which was a composite endpoint consisting of any of the following events: new arrest/incarceration, psychiatric hospitalization, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment due to safety or tolerability, treatment supplementation with another antipsychotic due to inadequate efficacy, discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment due to inadequate efficacy, increase in level of psychiatric services to prevent imminent psychiatric hospitalization, suicide.</description>

    <measure>Part-3: Change From Baseline in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery is an instrument that contains 10 tests to measure cognitive performance in 7 cognitive domains: speed processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. The composite score combines the individual scores of the 10 tests and scores them on a normative scale to derive a T-score and composites scores.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale assesses degree of a participant's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. Score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on 4 domains there will be 1 total score. Participants with score of 71 to 100 have mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>Intracortical myelin (ICM) volume is a potential biomarker of etiology and treatment response of schizophrenia, therefore is included in the study to evaluate disease progression and disease modification. Brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume will be measured by inversion recovery (IR) and spin echo (SE) MRI.</description>
