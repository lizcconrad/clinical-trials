  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study also aims to determine the effect of a strong enzyme (CYP3A4) inducer-rifampin- on
      drug exposure of Glasdegib. This study will be conducted in healthy subjects given a single
      dose of glasdegib in each period.

    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy female subjects of non-childbearing potential and/or male subjects who, at the
             time of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is
             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Female subjects of non childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following
             criteria:

               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses
                  for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or
                  physiological cause; AND have a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level
                  confirming the post-menopausal state;

               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

               3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure.

          -  All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered
             to be of childbearing potential.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive urine drug screen

          -  Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec.
             If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility.

          -  Subjects with family history of myocardial infarction, congenital long QT syndrome,
             torsades de pointes or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias.

          -  Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; male subjects with partners
             currently pregnant; male subjects able to father children who are unwilling or unable
             to use two highly effective methods of contraception as outlined in this protocol for
             the duration of the study and for at least 90 days after the last dose of
             investigational product and, refrain from sperm donation for the duration of the study
             and for at least 90 days after the last dose of investigational product.
