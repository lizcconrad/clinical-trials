    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare tacrolimus dosing of the new Envarsus®-based
      immunosuppressive regimen with current clinical practice (Prograf or Advagraf) over 6 months
      following de novo renal transplantation in a real-life setting in different European
      Countries.

      This is a Multicentre, Open label, Randomized, Two-arm, parallel-group study to assess
      efficacy and safety of Envarsus® compared with tacrolimus used as per current clinical
      practice in the initial maintenance setting in de novo kidney transplant patients. The study
      will be conducted in approximately 10 european countries.
