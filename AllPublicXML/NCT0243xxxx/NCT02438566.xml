  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if the oral form of a medication (tranexamic
      acid) to reduce bleeding can be used in place of an intravenous (IV) form, to learn the best
      way to give tranexamic acid: either a pill by mouth, or a solution by vein.

      The purpose of this research is to determine if the oral form of a medication (tranexamic
      acid) to reduce bleeding can be used in place of an intravenous (IV) form.to learn the best
      way to give tranexamic acid: either a pill by mouth, or a solution by vein. Tranexamic acid
      is a medicine that reduces blood loss and reduces the need for blood transfusions in surgery.
      This drug is not experimental and has been used widely to treat patients in many settings,
      including orthopedic procedures, to reduce bleeding. This medication is now part of the
      standard of care at many centers in the U.S. and around the world. Orthopedic procedures have
      used iv tranexamic acid more often, but there are reasons to believe that the oral form may
      be at least equivalent and perhaps better at lower cost to the health care system. No other
      study has yet performed a systematic comparison to answer the question.
