      OBJECTIVE:Purpose of this study is to set forth the sedative efficacy and effects on early
      period cognitive functions of two premedication drugs used for ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography) METHODS:This randomized and double blind study was performed with
      forty (18-70 of age) ASA I-III risk group patients for who elective ERCP was planned.
      Cognitive functions of patients were determined by mini-mental test (MMT). 0.5 mg/kg
      midazolam or 1mg/kg tramadol drop was administered orally before intervention to patients who
      were randomly divided into two premedication groups.

      Vital signs,BIS (Bispectral index), mRSS (modified Ramsay Sedation scale), NRS (numeric
      rating scale ) was evaluated. If MMT (mini-mental test) was ≤ 23 at 60th minute it was
      considered as cognitive impairment. Recovery period, post-procedure state of cognitive
      function at 60th minute were recorded.

      The Outcome Measures are number of Participants with Adverse Events, and the incidence of
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction assessed by MMT (mini-mental test) in first 60 minutes.
