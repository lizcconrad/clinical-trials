      The main purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and adverse event
      profile of pembrolizumab in subjects who have high risk melanoma before and after their
      standard of care surgical resection, and to collect tumor tissue from subjects before and
      after receipt of pembrolizumab to look at how the experimental drug interacts with tumor
      tissue. Subjects will receive 1 dose of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, followed by complete
      resection and then a year of adjuvant pembrolizumab
