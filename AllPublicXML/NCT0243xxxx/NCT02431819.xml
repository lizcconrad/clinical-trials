  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elastic compression stockings are recommended in the treatment venous insufficiency.
      Degressive compressive stockings have been used for many decades and are characterized by a
      high pressure applied at the ankle and a decreasing pressure from the ankle to the knee.
      Progressive compressive stockings were developed to have a maximal pressure at the calf. This
      concept is based on the calf pump role in the venous return. Patients with PAD (Peripheral
      Arterial Disease) often suffer from venous insufficiency. But elastic compression stockings
      are strictly contraindicated for patients with PAD because highest pressures on ankle could
      slow down the superficial microcirculation.

      On patients with PAD and venous insufficiency, the progressive compressive stockings could be
      well indicated. Strongest pressure at the calf should increase the pump effect and the muscle
      mechanical efficiency during the walk without deleterious effect.

    <measure>the absence of worsening of PAD after 15 days of progressive compressive stockings ware</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is a safety one: the absence of worsening of PAD after 15 days of progressive compressive stockings ware. A worsening is defined as:
Worsening of the systolic ankle pressure index (SPI) defined by a relative reduction of the SPI higher than 15% compared to the index value at inclusion,
Worsening of the toe-brachial index (TBI) defined by a relative reduction of TBI higher than 15% compared to the index value at inclusion,
Relative reduction of the number of active and repetitive ankle extensions in upright position higher than 25% compared to the index value at inclusion.
If at least one of these criteria is met, the PAD will be considered as worsening. If none of these criteria is met, the patient will be considered as no worsening.</description>
