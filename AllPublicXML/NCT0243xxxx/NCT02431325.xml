      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether teduglutide can repair a &quot;leaky&quot;
      gut, decrease inflammation, and prevent or treat plaque, a build-up of fat and other
      materials in the blood vessels of the heart, in people with HIV. HIV disease is linked to
      inflammatory changes and leakiness of the gut. These changes or conditions may increase the
      risk of developing heart and blood vessel disease. The investigators believe teduglutide can
      help repair the gut barrier in people with HIV, leading to a decrease in inflammation and
      plaque in the blood vessels of the heart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As more people with HIV gain access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART),
      cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent and a significant cause of
      mortality. Activation of the innate immune system may stimulate inflammatory mechanisms of
      atherosclerosis development. Loss of gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal epithelial integrity and
      loss of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria occur in HIV-infected patients
      and are not fully restored by cART. Translocation of microbial products from the intestinal
      lumen into the systemic circulation has been demonstrated to be increased in HIV-infected
      patients and the investigators hypothesize that it is a key driver of monocyte and macrophage
      activation. In turn, these pro-inflammatory monocytes and macrophages can induce
      atherosclerotic disease development. The purpose of the research study is to determine the
      effects of a glucagon-like peptide-2 analog, teduglutide, on intestinal epithelial integrity,
      microbial translocation across the gut lumen, markers of innate immune system activation
      including the monocyte transcriptome, bone, arterial inflammation, and atherosclerosis in a
      6-month randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled proof of concept trial in HIV-infected
      individuals.
