  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the diagnostic utility of Sudoscan in assessing small
      fiber nerve function, specifically those of the sudomotor, in patients with autoimmune
      disorders (i.e fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy can manifest in different autonomic and painful symptoms, but current
      diagnostic tools are confined to nerve conduction studies and quantitative sensory testing.

      The former can only asses the large nerve fibers and fail to reflect sudomotor function, the
      latter tool can be subject to technical error. Pain and autonomic dysfunction, which reflect
      small fiber dysfunction has recently gained much interest in disorders with polyneuropathy
      but current studies have been confined mostly to diabetic polyneuropathies. There has been
      growing evidence that autoimmune disorders such as fibromyalgia can also manifest in small
      fiber dysfunction. Because of the complexity of diagnosing small fiber dysfunction, there are
      yet no standard protocols on how to assess and treat these patients. Sudoscan uses reverse
      iontophoresis to assess the function of the sweat glands. The tool is easy to use,
      non-invasive with quantitative results that are objective.

      The objective of this study is to assess the small fiber function; that is the sudomotor
      function; using Sudoscan in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis.
