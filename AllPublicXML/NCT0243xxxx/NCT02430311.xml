  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 parts phase I, open label trial of olaparib monotherapy and olaparib in
      combination with paclitaxel in patients with solid tumours. Part A will assess the single and
      multiple dose pharmacokinetics of olaparib monotherapy and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of
      olaparib in combination with paclitaxel. Part B will assess the safety of multiple doses of
      olaparib in Cohort 1 and of olaparib when co-administered with paclitaxel in Cohort 2
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A will access the pharmacokinetics of olaparib: Cohort 1 will investigate the single and
      multiple dose pharmacokinetics of olaparib following 300mg bd monotherapy dose(s); Cohort 2
      will investigate the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of olaparib following 100mg bd
      monotherapy dose(s) and the multiple dose pharmacokinetics in the presence of co-administered
      paclitaxel (80mg/m2 weekly on days 1, 8 and 15 of a single 28-day cycle).

      In Part B: Safety profile of olaparib 300mg bd as monotherapy and olaparib 100mg bd in
      combination with weekly paclitaxel will also be investigated in Chinese patients.
