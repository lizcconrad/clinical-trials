  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shivering is a common side-effect of epidural anesthesia. In studies to date, the assessment
      of shivering has been based on a simple scale using descriptive words rather than actual
      measurements. We believe that we can assess shivering more scientifically by using a novel
      method to quantify arm movements during shivering.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This novel method will allow the investigators to quantitatively assess and measure shivering
      in obstetric parturients undergoing varying procedures under epidural anesthesia.
