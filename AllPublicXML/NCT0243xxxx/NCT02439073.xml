      Purpose The purpose of the PROLUCA study is to investigate the efficacy of early
      postoperative rehabilitation in a non-hospital setting in patients with operable lung cancer,
      with focus on exercise training.

      Design/Methods

      One hundred and twenty-eight (n=128) participants (64 patients/study arm) with Non-Small Cell
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC), stage I-IIIa, referred for surgery, will be randomized to one of the
      following two groups:

        1. Early postoperative rehabilitation initiated as early as two weeks after surgery

        2. Postoperative rehabilitation initiated 14 weeks after surgery Intervention The
           intervention consists of a supervised group exercise program comprising resistance and
           cardiorespiratory exercise two hours weekly for 12 weeks combined with individual
           counseling.

      The primary study endpoint is Maximal oxygen uptake measured by a VO2peak test (direct
      measurement) Secondary endpoints include: Six minutes walk distance (6MWD),
      One-repetition-maximum (1RM) Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on health related quality of
      life, fatigue, depression, lifestyle, postoperative complications, hospitalization time, sick
      leave, work status and survival.

      Results The results of PROLUCA will identify the optimal timing of postoperative
      rehabilitation in NSCLC patients with focus on increasing physical capacity and health
      related quality of life and reducing the side effects from the treatment of the cancer
      disease.
