  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of ZEB1 in CTCs for gastric cancer,
      its correlation with the clinicopathology of gastric cancer, and the role of ZEB1 in invasion
      and metastasis in gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasion and metastasis of tumors and postoperative recurrence are the main causes of death
      in patients with gastric cancer and are also the key factors affecting the clinical treatment
      and prognosis.

      In this study, the investigators will detect the expression of ZEB1 in different types of
      CTCs(epithelial,mesenchymal and mixed phenotype) for gastric cancer by CanPatrolTM2 detection
      technology.Our investigation of the relationship between ZEB1 and the occurrence and
      development as well as the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer is expected to provide
      data for the prognosis and targeted therapy of gastric cancer.

      Approximate 100 consecutive patients with gastric cancer and CTCs(+) will be enrolled in this
      study.Detection of ZEB1 expression in CTCs at baseline will show the relationship between
      ZEB1 and clinicopathological variables. Postoperative follow-up of ZEB1 expression in CTCs
      will be performed every three months in the first year and every six months in the following
      two years. The results may indicate the role of ZEB1 in CTCs about invasion and metastasis
      for gastric cancer .The aim of this study is to clarify the clinical significance of ZEB1
      expression in CTCs for gastric cancer.
