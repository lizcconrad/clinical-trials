      The Two-Way Communication Checklist (2-COM) is a communication tool developed by van Os et
      al. (2002). It aims to provide an opportunity for patients to voice their needs and problem
      to minimize the discrepancy and miscommunication between patient and professional carer. In
      this randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to examine whether using 2-COM
      checklist would lead to improvement in first episode psychosis patient's overall
      satisfaction, change in treatment option in clinicians and consultation time.

      Communication is at the heart of psychiatric practice. Good communication has positive impact
      on treatment, treatment satisfaction and treatment adherence. However, different
      characteristics of psychosis barricade the communication between clinicians and patients.
      Consequently, the divergent views of needs of care between patients and clinicians may be
      established due to miscommunication. Such divergence may barricade the planning and the
      outcome of treatment.

      In Hong Kong, the core psychiatric services as well as early intervention for first episode
      psychosis patients are provided by psychiatric outpatient clinics. Mental health services in
      Hong Kong are overwhelmed by large demands of the services and inadequate mental health care
      workforce such as low psychiatrists-to-population ratio and psychiatric nurse-to-population
      ratio. The large demands of services and inadequate mental health care workforce restrained
      the services' quality. In some busy psychiatric outpatient clinic, a clinician needs to
      consult 30 patients in a 3-hour session. Hui et al. (2008) study showed that the mean
      consultation time in one of the general psychiatric outpatient clinic in Hong Kong is 5.8
      minutes.

      To sum up, a cost-effectiveness instrument is in need for the early intervention psychiatric
      outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. The instrument has to reduce the needs' divergence,
      communication between clinicians and patients, and enhance the patients' involvement of
      clinical decision-making in the rushed psychiatric consultation. The Two-Way Communication
      Checklist (2-COM) may satisfy the demand.

    <description>A patient satisfaction questionnaire as used in Hui et al. (2008) was adopted in this study. This was a self-administered questionnaire rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = very satisfactory to 5 = very unsatisfactory). The questionnaire consisted of 2 parts. Part A has 6 items concerning the perceived attitude of the clinician (subscale score range, 6-30). Part B has 11 items concerning communication with the clinician (subscale score range, 11-55). The higher score indicates the higher satisfaction.</description>

    <time_frame>within 30 minutes after a psychiatric consultation</time_frame>
    <description>A checklist that measured change in treatment was adopted. This checklist included 4 items which will be rated on a dichotomous selection (yes/no) by clinician. The 4 items are related to the change of medication, providing information about treatment, involvement of other members of the care team and professional support services.</description>

    <description>The Two-Way Communication Checklist (2-COM) is a communication tool developed by Van Os et al. (2002). It aims to provide an opportunity for patients to voice their needs and problem to minimize the discrepancy and miscommunication between patient and professional carer. 2-COM questionnaire was designed to give patients while they are waiting for consultation. Patients can either tick yes or no in the questionnaire to decide which the perceived problems are and which needs they want to discuss with the clinician. During the consultation, the ticked items would be discussed.</description>
