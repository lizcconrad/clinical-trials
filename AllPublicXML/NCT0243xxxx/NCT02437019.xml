  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide early access to Ibrutinib treatment for participants
      with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and collect additional safety
      data while the medication is not commercially available.

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (when
      more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) early access
      program (EAP) study. The study will be conducted in 2 phases: a Screening Phase
      (approximately 30 days prior to administration of first dose) and a Program Drug Phase (Day 1
      up to 30 Days after last dose of study drug). Enrolled participants will receive 420
      milligram (mg) oral ibrutinib once daily on a 28-day cycle until disease progression,
      occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, no longer achieving clinical benefit, or the end of
      program. Treatment will be continuous (without interruption) and self-administered. Disease
      evaluations will be conducted according to local standard of care as clinically indicated.
      Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study. All enrolled and on-going
      participants in the program will continue to receive ibrutinib by the EAP until marketing
      approval or 6 months after this date.
