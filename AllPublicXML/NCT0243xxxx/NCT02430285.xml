    <textblock>
      Acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by common
      bile duct (CBD) stones or sludge, which requires prompt diagnosis and treatment by endoscopic
      removal of the material. Accurate detection of CBD stones is warranted to select patients for
      early therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

      In clinical practice the decision to perform an ERCP is often based on biochemical and
      radiological criteria despite they already have been shown to be unreliable predictors of CBD
      stone presence.

      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is not currently a worldwide standard diagnostic procedure early
      in the course of acute biliary pancreatitis, but it has been shown to be accurate, safe and
      cost effective in diagnosing biliary obstructions compared with magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and ERCP and therefore in preventing unnecessary ERCP and its
      related complications.

      The investigators aim to investigate the clinical usefulness of early EUS in the management
      of ABP.

      All consecutive patients entering the emergency department due to acute abdominal pain and
      showing biochemical and/or radiological findings consistent with possible ABP will be
      prospectively enrolled. Patients will be classified as having a low, moderate, or high
      probability of CBD stones, according to established risk stratification. All enrolled
      patients will undergo EUS within 48 h of their admission. ERCP will be performed immediately
      after EUS only in those cases with proven CBD stones or sludge.

      The following parameters will be investigated: (1) clinical: age, sex, fever; (2)
      radiological: dilated CBD, (3) biochemical: bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (gGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
      amylase, lipases, C-reactive protein (CRP). Association between presence of CBD stone at EUS
      and the individual predictors were assessed by univariate logistic regression. Predictors
      significantly associated with CBD stones (p&lt;0.05) will enter in a multivariate logistic
      regression model.
