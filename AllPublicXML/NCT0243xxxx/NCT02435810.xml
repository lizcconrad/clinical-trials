      Background:

      - Inflammation is how the body reacts to infection or injury. . Infections or inflammation in
      the brain and nerves can be serious. There aren t always good tests to detect this.
      Researchers want to learn more about how diseases affect the brain and nerves to develop
      better tests and treatments.

      Objective:

      - To learn more about how inflammation and infections hurt the brain and nervous system.

      Eligibility:

      - People at least 2 years old with a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of nervous system
      infection or inflammation.

      Design:

        -  For some participants, a clinician outside of NIH will collect blood, tissue, and other
           samples. These will be sent to NIH and analyzed.

        -  Other participants will have several visits to NIH. Children may not have all these
           tests.

        -  Participants will have:

        -  Medical history.

        -  Physical and neurological exam.

        -  Blood and urine samples collected.

        -  Saliva collected. They will chew on a piece of sterile cotton for one minute.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong
           magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder.
           Participants will get a contrast agent through an intravenous (IV) catheter during the
           MRI. A needle will be used to guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into an arm vein.

        -  Lumbar puncture. Skin will be numbed and a needle will be inserted into the space
           between the bones in the back. Fluid will be removed.

        -  Some participants may have optional study procedures. These may include eye tests,
           memory and thinking testing, tests with electrodes on the head, or skin biopsy.

      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to examine the natural course of infectious and inflammatory
      diseases of the nervous system, to identify causative or associated pathogens when unknown,
      and generally to better understand the underlying immunological, genetic and pathophysiologic
      mechanisms that cause and contribute to these diseases and their ultimate neurological
      outcomes.

      Study Population:

      The study population will be patients at least 2 years old with known or suspected infection
      or inflammation of the nervous system. Subjects will be recruited through referrals to the
      NIH.

      Design:

      This is a longitudinal case series with standardized research data collection at predefined
      time points. Subjects will have scheduled visits at the NIH either as an outpatient or an
      inpatient. The core research evaluations include: a comprehensive history and neurological
      examination; blood, urine, and saliva collection; neuroimaging; and lumbar puncture. All
      subjects who are willing and able will be asked to return for at least a 1-year follow up
      visit. Subjects will be eligible for longitudinal follow up until the clinical phenotype has
      been fully characterized or the subject is too ill to participate in further evaluations.

      Additionally, we will also enroll subjects with known or suspected infections or inflammation
      of the nervous system from whom only biological samples collected by outside clinicians will
      be processed and retained for research analyses. In cases were samples remain from those
      collected for clinical reasons and the samples are deidentified and coded, the samples may be
      obtained with a waiver of informed consent.

      Outcome Measures:

      The study outcomes will primarily be the characterizations of varied inflammatory and
      infectious nervous system diseases. These characterizations will include: the clinical
      phenotype and biomarkers.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        At the time of enrollment, subjects will:

          1. Have a known or suspected infection or inflammation of the nervous system based on
             clinical or imaging data provided by the referral facility. For the purpose of this
             study, neuroinfectious disease or neuroinflammation is defined as any of the
             following:

               1. fever with nervous system signs or symptoms (excluding delirium)

               2. any neurological symptoms accompanied by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with evidence
                  of inflammation (which may include pleocytosis, hypoglycorrachia, elevated
                  protein, or other evidence of intrathecal immune activation including IgG index
                  or presence of oligoclonal bands)
