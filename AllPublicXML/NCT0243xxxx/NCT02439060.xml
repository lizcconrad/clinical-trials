    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well biologic mesh works in preventing parastomal
      hernia in patients with bladder cancer who are undergoing radical cystectomy, or removal of
      the bladder, and ileal conduit diversion. An ileal conduit is a tube created from your small
      intestine that will be used as a tube for urine to flow out of your body. Parastomal hernia
      is a type of hernia that can occur in the stomach area where the ileal conduit is placed.
      Biologic mesh may help prevent parastomal hernia following surgery and ileal conduit
      diversion.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of developing parastomal hernia detected either clinically or
      radiologically in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit, with or without mesh.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of developing symptomatic parastomal hernia requiring surgical
      intervention in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or without mesh.

      II. To estimate the time from cystectomy with an ileal conduit to diagnosis of clinical
      parastomal hernia development in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or
      without mesh.

      III. To estimate the time from cystectomy with an ileal conduit to diagnosis of radiological
      parastomal hernia development in patients with radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or
      without mesh.

      IV. To estimate the rate of stomal prolapse and time to its development in patients with
      radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with or without mesh.

      V. To evaluate mesh-related complications in mesh group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo placement of biologic mesh during radical cystectomy and placement of
      the ileal conduit.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care radical cystectomy and placement of the ileal
      conduit.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 2-4 months for 2 years.

    <description>All patients randomized, who undergo a radical cystectomy with an ileal conduit, will be classified according to whether or not they received the mesh implant. Observed toxicities and complications during and after surgery will be summarized by treatment received, severity, timing (time from surgery), and frequency.</description>
