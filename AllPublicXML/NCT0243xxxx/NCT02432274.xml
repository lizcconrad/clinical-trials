  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 study evaluating safety, tolerability, and efficacy of lenvatinib in
      children and adolescents with refractory or relapsed solid malignancies and young adults with
      Osteosarcoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 5 cohorts:

      Cohort 1 (Single-Agent Dose-Finding) will use dose-escalation to find the recommended dose
      (RD) of lenvatinib using a time-to-event continual reassessment method (TiTE-CRM) design in
      children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumors. When the RD is
      identified, Cohorts 2A, 2B, and 3A will start in parallel.

      Cohort 2 (Single-Agent Expansion) will evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib at the RD in
      children, adolescents, and young adults with

        1. 131 iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) [Cohort 2A] or

        2. Relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma [Cohort 2B]

      Cohort 3A (Combination Dose-Finding) will determine the RD of lenvatinib in combination with
      ifosfamide and etoposide in participants with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma.

      Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion) will evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib at the RD from
      Cohort 3A in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide in participants with relapsed or
      refractory osteosarcoma. Participants with osteosarcoma who have enrolled into Cohort 1 or 2B
      and experienced progressive disease on lenvatinib as well as lenvatinib-naive participants
      with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma will be candidates for enrollment in Cohort 3B.

      Lenvatinib will be provided as hard capsules containing 1, 4, or 10 mg lenvatinib. Lenvatinib
      capsules should be dissolved in water or apple juice for children unable to swallow capsules.

             published by the CDC.

             b) Urine dipstick less than 2+ for proteinuria. Participants who have greater than or

             nitrosoureas; 4 weeks for definitive radiotherapy, and 2 weeks for palliative
             radiotherapy; 3 months from high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue; 3 weeks from
             major surgery. Participants must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all
             prior anticancer therapy before enrollment into the study.

         16. Written and signed informed consent from the parent(s) or legal representative

        Exclusion criteria:

             chemotherapy, or radiation therapy) except alopecia, and ototoxicity due to cisplatin

          7. Two or more prior vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth

             including definitively treated superficial melanoma, in-situ, basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin).
