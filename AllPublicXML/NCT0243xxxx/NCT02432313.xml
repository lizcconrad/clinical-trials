      Parts 1 and 2:

      Subjects take 1 dose of various formulations of the study product, and provide samples for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis after each, with at least 7 days between doses.

      Part 3:

      Subjects take 2-4 doses of study product or placebo for 6 days, plus 1 additional dose, and
      provides samples for PK analysis.

      Parts 1 and 2:

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on the day before dosing (Day -1). Subjects will fast
      overnight and receive the study product in the morning of Day 1 in a non-randomized manner.
      Subjects will remain onsite until 24 h post-dose and will return to the clinical unit at 36
      and 48 h post-dose to provide a sample for PK analysis.

      There will be at least a 7-day washout between regimens. Subject will be telephoned 3-5 days
      after the final dose to ensure his/her ongoing well-being.

      Part 3:

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on the day before dosing (Day -1). Subjects will fast
      overnight (for Day 1 and Day 7) and receive the study product or placebo on a once, twice, or
      three times a day regimen in a randomized, double-blind manner. Subjects will remain onsite
      until 24 h after the final dose (Day 7), leaving the clinic on the morning of Day 8 and
      returning at 36 and 48 h post last-dose to provide a sample for PK analysis.

      Subject will be telephoned 3-5 days after the final dose to ensure his/her ongoing
      well-being.
