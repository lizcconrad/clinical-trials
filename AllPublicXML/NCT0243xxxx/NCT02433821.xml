  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The neck pain comes from disturbances related to the cervical spine, of multifactorial origin
      and is considered a frequent problem of disability.

      Pilates is a physical conditioning method that has been widely used to improve posture and
      develop body awareness.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Pilates method in the control of pain,
      function and quality of life in patients with chronic mechanical neck pain.

      Methods: 64 patients with chronic mechanical neck pain will be selected and randomized into
      two groups: intervention and control. Both groups will be assessed for pain, function,
      quality of life and medication intake.

      The intervention group will hold Pilates sessions for three months, with two sessions per
      week. The control group will continue with the usual drug treatment. Both groups will be
      instructed to use 750mg acetaminophen every 6 hours if there is pain, but consumption of the
      drug will be controlled.

      Although the symptoms of neck pain are common in the population, no study has investigated
      the effects of the Pilates method as a possible treatment for neck pain. The hypothesis is
      that the Pilates method can offer benefits to these patients.
