    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, 1:1, non-comparative phase II trial. Patients with early
      stage MPM will be randomized between Arm A: immediate P/D followed by three cycles of
      chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2, both drugs given on day 1, every
      three weeks) Arm B: three cycles of chemotherapy (same regimen) followed by P/D, for
      non-progressing patients

      This is an academic led, multicenter, randomized, 1:1, non-comparative phase II trial.
      Patients with early stage MPM will be randomized between

        -  Arm A - immediate surgery: immediate P/D followed by three cycles of chemotherapy
           (pemetrexed 500mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2, both drugs given on day 1, every three
           weeks) for non-progressing patients

        -  Arm B - delayed surgery: three cycles of chemotherapy (same regimen) followed by P/D,
           for non-progressing patients.

      A maximum of four weeks (±2 weeks) will be allowed between the baseline tumor assessment and
      the start of treatment (surgery or chemotherapy). Randomization should be done as soon as
      possible after baseline tumor assessment.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the feasibility of immediate P/D
      followed by cisplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy or deferred P/D after cisplatin/pemetrexed
      chemotherapy in patients with early stage MPM.

      The results of this study will allow the LCG to take one of the arms further to a comparative
      study with either no surgery or EPP as control arm. The choice of the comparator will depend
      on the result of a parallel ongoing randomized study in the UK, comparing P/D with no surgery

    <description>A patient is considered to be a &quot;treatment success&quot; if he/she meets all of the following criteria:
Patient has received the full protocol treatment, defined as 3 cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin (allowing for the dose adjustments described in section 5.3), preceded/followed by pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) (as described in section 5.3).
Patient alive and has no evidence of progression/relapse at week 20 (±2 weeks) after the first day of starting protocol treatment (either chemotherapy or P/D).
Patient has no persisting grade 3-4 treatment side-effects (CTCAE V 4.0) at week 20 (±2 weeks) after the first day of starting protocol treatment (either chemotherapy or P/D)</description>

    <description>Treatment side-effects will be assessed for all patients and graded per CTCAE category upon occurrence of the event. The investigator will assess whether those events are surgery or/and drug related (no reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) and this assessment will be recorded in the database for all adverse events. Surgical side effects during the perioperative period will be scored according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification of Surgical Complications as an exploratory approach.</description>
