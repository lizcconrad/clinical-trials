  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attempts to quit cigarette smoking are often accompanied by negative mood and problems in
      attention and memory. These effects, in turn, may contribute to smoking relapse. This
      exploratory/developmental project examines the effects of a novel medication, GTS-21, on
      individuals interested in smoking cessation. It is hypothesized that GTS-21 will reduce
      negative affect, improve cognition and/or reduce smoking relapse in healthy adult men and
      women who are chronic cigarette smokers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is a clinical trial assessing the effects of GTS-21 (an Î±7 nicotinic receptor
      partial agonist) on smoking, mood, neurocognition, and neurophysiology, in a small sample of
      chronic smokers who are currently healthy and interested in smoking cessation. Using a
      double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, 54 (27 women) community smokers who
      have demonstrated a readiness to quit will participate over a 7 week active trial. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to active drug or placebo groups. Across the study period,
      participants will undergo repeated neurobehavioral testing, laboratory assessments of
      cardiovascular and liver function, and provide weekly updates regarding smoking behavior,
      mood state and side-effects.

             cigarettes

          -  Must not report current use of nicotine replacement therapies (i.e., occasions of &gt; 4
             h/week during a typical week, even if not used as a cessation aid)

          -  Must not have used bupropion within the previous year

          -  Must not report any past use (regardless of year) of varenicline
