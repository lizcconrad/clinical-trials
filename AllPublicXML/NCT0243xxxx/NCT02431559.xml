        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian,
             fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma with measureable disease (as defined
             by RECIST 1.1.) after first or second line platinum-based chemotherapy, for which
             treatment with PLD is indicated. Platinum-based therapy is defined as treatment with
             carboplatin, cisplatin or another organoplatinum compound. Platinum-resistant is
             defined as having a platinum-free interval (PFI) of &lt; 12 months after first- or
             second-line platinum-based chemotherapy, or having disease progression while receiving
             second-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

             Subjects are allowed to have received, but are not required to have received:

               -  one additional cytotoxic regimen and/or PARP inhibitor for management of
                  recurrent or persistent disease.

               -  biologic therapy (e.g., bevacizumab) as part of their primary treatment regimen
                  or part of their treatment for management of recurrent or persistent disease.

          2. Histologic documentation of the original primary tumor.

          3. Documented radiographic disease progression &lt; 12 months after the last dose of first-
             or second-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

          4. Subjects in Phase 2 must have disease amenable to biopsy and must be willing to
             undergo pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies. Optional for Phase 1.

             Note: archival tissue will be requested for all subjects preferably from primary tumor
             site prior to cancer treatment; however, archival tissue is not a requirement for
             study entry.

          5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          6. Laboratory parameters for vital functions should be in the normal range. Laboratory
             abnormalities that are not clinically significant are generally permitted, except for
             the following laboratory parameters, which must be within the ranges specified,
             regardless of clinical significance:

               -  Hemoglobin: ≥ 9 g/dL

               -  Neutrophil count: ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

               -  Serum bilirubin: ≤ 1.2 mg/dL

               -  AST/ALT: ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase: ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          7. Age ≥18 years.
