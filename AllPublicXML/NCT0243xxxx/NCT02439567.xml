      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of sustained virological response in
      liver and spleen stiffness in patients with HCV compensated advanced chronic liver disease
      treated with new all oral antiviral drugs in order to determine factors implicated in
      stiffness change and its implications for long-term follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Prospective cohort study including consecutive patients (with baseline liver stiffness
      measurement ≥10 kPa who meet the Baveno VI criteria for compensated advanced chronic liver
      disease) who initiate treatment with new all oral antiviral drugs following current
      recommendations in Spain.

      In all these patients the following parameters will be assessed:

        -  Baseline liver and spleen stiffness and CAP measurements at the time of starting therapy
           and then, during treatment in week 4 and week 12 (end of treatment). After finishing
           therapy, these measurements will be repeated at 6 and 12 months of follow-up.

        -  Routine lab tests, including liver enzymes and viral load, will be performed at
           baseline, 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, and at 3 and 6 months after finishing therapy
           according to standard clinical practice.

        -  Liver ultrasound will be performed every 6 months as a routine procedure in patients
           wiht liver cirrhosis.

        -  Patients who were known to have esophageal varices prior to therapy will be assessed
           with an upper endoscopy 12 months after finishing therapy if they achieve SVR.
