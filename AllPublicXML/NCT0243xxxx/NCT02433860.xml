  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant need for nicotine cessation programs for pregnant women in Spokane
      County. SCRIPT has been proven to be an effective method for smoking cessation in pregnant
      women. This study will evaluate the success of SCRIPT delivered by pharmacists. At the end of
      the study, the investigators hope to have three questions answered: 1) what is the quit rate
      of pregnant women in the Spokane area who receive the SCRIPT intervention delivered by
      pharmacists? 2) How does the quit rate compare to the quit rates of SCRIPT programs delivered
      by other health care providers as documented in the literature? And 3) Does the SCRIPT
      intervention have a significant effect on quit rates for pregnant women compared to current
      Spokane county quit rates? Urine cotinine tests will be used to document smoking status
      before delivery of the SCRIPT program, approximately one week after quit date and at &gt;36 wks
      gestation or at delivery for study participants.

      1. The goal of this project is to evaluate the success of pharmacists in delivering the
      SCRIPT smoking cessation program. The research questions that need to be addressed are: i.
      What is the quit rate of pregnant women in the Spokane area who receive the SCRIPT
      intervention delivered by a pharmacist? ii. How does this quit rate compare to the quit rates
      of other SCRIPT programs given by other health care providers (social workers, nurses, etc.)?
      iii. Does the SCRIPT intervention have a significant effect on quit rates for smoking
      pregnant women compared to current Spokane county quit rates?

    <description>Participant will be shown a short DVD &quot;Commit to Quit: During and After Pregnancy. She will be given &quot;a Pregnant Woman's Guide to Quitting&quot; booklet.
Participant will be asked their nicotine use status and it will be confirmed with a CO meter test and cotinine urine test. Those not consenting to be part of the study will not receive the urinalysis.
Participant will be advised to quit smoking. The pharmacist will review the Guide with the participant. The participant will receive a phone call around the time of their quit/reduction date. The participant will meet again approximately one week after their quit/reduction date and receive a CO meter test and urine cotinine test.
At the end of the program pregnant women will answer a follow-up questionnaire. Those women participating in the research study will be given a cotinine urine test at approximately &gt; 36 weeks gestation or at delivery.</description>
