    <textblock>
      Allogeneic transplant can sometimes be an effective treatment for leukemia. In a traditional
      allogeneic transplant, patients receive very high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation
      therapy, followed by an infusion of their donor's bone marrow or blood stem cells. The
      high-dose chemotherapy drugs and radiation are given to remove the leukemia cells in the
      body. The infusion of the donor's bone marrow or blood stem cells is given to replace the
      diseased bone marrow destroyed by the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. However, there
      are risks associated with allogeneic transplant. Many people have life-threatening or even
      fatal complications, like severe infections and a condition called graft-versus-host disease,
      which is caused when cells from the donor attack the normal tissue of the transplant patient.

      Recently, several hospitals around the world have been using a different type of allogeneic
      transplant called a microtransplant. In this type of transplant, the donor is usually a
      family member who is not an exact match. In a microtransplant, leukemia patients get lower
      doses of chemotherapy than are used in traditional allogeneic transplants. The chemotherapy
      is followed by an infusion of their donor's peripheral blood stem cells. The objective of the
      microtransplant is to suppress the bone marrow by giving just enough chemotherapy to allow
      the donor cells to temporarily engraft (implant), but only at very low levels. The hope is
      that the donor cells will cause the body to mount an immunologic attack against the leukemia,
      generating a response called the &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot; effect or &quot;graft-versus-cancer&quot;
      effect, without causing the potentially serious complication of graft-versus-host disease.

      With this research study, the investigators hope to find out whether or not
      microtransplantation will be a safe and effective treatment for children, adolescents and
      young adults with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the safety and feasibility of standard chemotherapy plus GCSF-mobilized
           Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell, Apheresis (HPC-A) in pediatric patients with relapsed or
           refractory hematologic malignancies.

        -  To estimate the response rates to standard chemotherapy plus GCSF-mobilized HPC-A in
           pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To describe the event-free and overall survival of patients treated with standard
           chemotherapy plus GCSF-mobilized HPC-A.

        -  To estimate the time to neutrophil and platelet recovery after treatment with standard
           chemotherapy plus GCSF-mobilized HPC-A.

        -  To determine the cumulative incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease
           (GVHD).

      OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:

        -  To characterize donor chimerism and microchimerism.

      Patients will receive standard chemotherapy followed by infusion of donor peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients who have at least a
      partial response are eligible to receive a second cycle.

      Diagnostic lumbar puncture and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy will be given prior to cycle 1.
      Patients without evidence of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia will receive no further IT
      therapy during cycle 1. Patients with CNS disease will receive weekly IT therapy
      (age-adjusted methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine) until the cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) becomes free of leukemia (minimum of 4 doses).

      Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and biopsy to assess response will be performed on approximately
      day 29 of therapy.

      For hematopoietic stem cell mobilization, donors will receive G-CSF (Filgrastim) (Neupogen®)
      each day for 5 days given subcutaneously (SQ) prior to HPC-A collected by leukapheresis on
      day 6.

    <measure>Number of Participants by Stratum Who Complete 2 Cycles of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of therapy cycle 2 (approximately 2-3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>If two or more patients die from causes other than leukemia progression or experience ≥ Grade 3 GVHD that is associated with detectable donor chimerism due to this protocol, or demonstrate persistent engraftment defined as &gt;5% donor chimerism at the time of count recovery (ANC &gt; 0.3 x 10^9/L and platelet count &gt; 30 x 10^/L), then the cohort will close due to intolerability. Any subject who transfers to transplant prior to completion of two courses without experiencing an unacceptable toxicity is considered inevaluable for purposes of evaluating tolerability. Accrual will be halted for intolerability if there are two or more failures in tolerability among the first six subjects who are evaluable for tolerability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants Who Experience Therapeutic Success</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of therapy cycle 2 (approximately 2-3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be counted towards this two-stage design. Therapeutic success for patients at time of enrollment is defined as:
Patients with fewer than 5% blasts, a ≥ 10-fold decrease in level of minimal residual disease after completion of 1 or 2 cycles of therapy.
Patients with greater than 5% in leukemic blasts in the marrow, achieving CR or CRi after completion of 1 or 2 cycles of therapy.
In terms of efficacy, patients who die before achieving therapeutic success will be counted as a failure, and all patients who receive ≥ 1 dose of protocol chemotherapy will be counted as a failure or success. Only subjects who withdraw or die prior to receiving the first dose of protocol chemotherapy will be considered inevaluable and replaced. The evaluation of tolerability and this phase II design will be performed concurrently, i.e., the first enrollees will be counted for both tolerability and efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Median Time to Neutrophil Recovery</measure>

    <description>The time to neutrophil recovery will be summarized using descriptive statistics. If there are no deaths prior to recovery of neutrophils, nonparametric confidence intervals for the median time to recovery will be computed by inverting the sign test. Otherwise, we will compute cumulative incidence curves to describe the time to platelet and neutrophil recovery while adjusting for competing events.</description>

          <description>Includes participants with AML and MDS. Participants receive chemotherapy based on diagnosis followed by infusion of donor HPC-A.
Participants with CNS disease receive weekly age-adjusted intrathecal triples therapy until the cerebrospinal fluid becomes free of leukemia (minimum of 4 doses).
Interventions:
Cycle 1: cytarabine, HPC-A donor infusion
Cycle 2: Participants who have at least a partial response to Cycle 1 are eligible to receive Cycle 2: cytarabine, HPC-A infusion
Cytarabine: Given by either intrathecal (IT) or intravenous (IV) route.
Intrathecal Triples: given IT.
HPC-A: Given IV.</description>

        <description>All patients will be counted towards this two-stage design. Therapeutic success for patients at time of enrollment is defined as:
Patients with fewer than 5% blasts, a ≥ 10-fold decrease in level of minimal residual disease after completion of 1 or 2 cycles of therapy.
Patients with greater than 5% in leukemic blasts in the marrow, achieving CR or CRi after completion of 1 or 2 cycles of therapy.
In terms of efficacy, patients who die before achieving therapeutic success will be counted as a failure, and all patients who receive ≥ 1 dose of protocol chemotherapy will be counted as a failure or success. Only subjects who withdraw or die prior to receiving the first dose of protocol chemotherapy will be considered inevaluable and replaced. The evaluation of tolerability and this phase II design will be performed concurrently, i.e., the first enrollees will be counted for both tolerability and efficacy.</description>

Participants with CNS disease receive weekly age-adjusted intrathecal triples therapy until the cerebrospinal fluid becomes free of leukemia (minimum of 4 doses).
Interventions:
Cycle 1: cytarabine, HPC-A donor infusion
Cycle 2: Participants who have at least a partial response to Cycle 1 are eligible to receive Cycle 2: cytarabine, HPC-A infusion
Cytarabine: Given by either intrathecal (IT) or intravenous (IV) route.
Intrathecal Triples: given IT.
HPC-A: Given IV.</description>
