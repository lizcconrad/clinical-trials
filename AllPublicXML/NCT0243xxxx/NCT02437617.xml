  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to collect and test tumor tissue from patients with
      advanced cancers that may be enrolled in Phase 1 studies or other treatments. Researchers
      will study if the results from genetic testing can help researchers determine which therapy
      may prove more beneficial for a patient in the future.

      If you agree to take part in this study, your tumor tissue collected previously from surgery
      or a prior biopsy (archived tissue) will be used for genetic testing. Genetic testing looks
      at whether specific genes are changed (mutated) in the tumor.

      The results of the genetic testing will be documented in your medical record. Your doctor may
      use the results of the genetic testing to help decide which treatment you will have. While
      awaiting results of the genomic profile assay, you may be enrolled in another treatment
      either at MD Anderson or near your home. This will be decided by your treating physician.

      Your samples will be given a code number when they are sent for genetic testing to Foundation
      Medicine. No identifying information will be directly linked to your samples. Only the
      researcher in charge of sending all tissue for testing will have access to the code numbers
      and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the samples
      to be updated as needed. Foundation Medicine will not be able to link this data to you.

      Researchers will also review your medical history from before and following the collection of
      tissue, to learn if the use of genetic testing had any effect on the outcome of your
      treatment.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 300 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patients with advanced cancer.

          2. Consent for use of archival tissue from primary or metastatic cancer diagnosis. Note:
             Patients may currently be enrolled in other investigational protocol including
             treatment protocols.

          3. Control Group #2 only: Control Group #2 will consist of 100 patients from MDACC/Phase
             I historical archives. Patients (cases no older than 2 years) will be selected based
             on clinical characteristics and genomic alterations similar to matched targeted
             therapy group.

          4. Patients may have received prior 'matched' therapies; however, at the time of
             enrollment, patients may not currently be on a known 'matched' therapy, and may not
             have received a 'matched' therapy as the last treatment if not receiving treatment at
             the time of consent.

          5. Patients who have a life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with advanced cancer who are NOT likely to meet the additional enrollment
             criteria in matched targeted therapy protocols or treatments.

          2. Patients who do not have archival tissue available.

          3. Patients are excluded if their last treatment before enrollment included a targeted
             agent matched to a genomic alteration in the patient's tumor.
