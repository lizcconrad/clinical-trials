      This is a Phase 3 study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RVL-1201 Ophthalmic
      Solution in the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis (ptosis) and to assess the safety and
      comfort of RVL-1201 Ophthalmic Solution for an extended dosing period of 6 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ptosis is experienced by approximately 12% of adults over the age of 50 . It is a unilateral
      or bilateral abnormal drooping of the upper eyelid that usually occurs from a partial or
      complete dysfunction of the muscle(s) that elevate the upper eyelid: the levator palpebrae
      superioris and/or Müller's muscle.

      Treatment for acquired ptosis usually involves surgery, with risks of infection, bleeding,
      over or undercorrection, reduced vision, and lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids
      completely) or mechanical treatment e.g scleral contact lenses with a bar to lift the eyelid,
      eyelid ptosis crutches attached to glasses, or adhesive tape or putty to affix the upper
      eyelid to the supraorbital structures.

      RVL-201 ophthalmic solution is being developed to provide a reversible pharmacologic option
      for patients with acquired ptosis who are not candidates for surgery or do not wish to
      undergo surgery.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RVL-1201 ophthalmic
      solution in the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis and to assess the safety and comfort of
      RVL-1201 ophthalmic solution for an extended dosing period of 6 weeks. Subjects will be
      randomized (2:1) to one of 2 treatment arms and treated for 42 days:

        -  RVL-1201 0.1% one full drop in each eye QD in the morning (N = 100)

        -  RVL-1201 vehicle (placebo) 1 full drop per eye QD in the morning (N = 50)

      Efficacy will be assessed with the LPFT, a validated visual field test using the HVF Analyzer
      and photographic measurement of MRD (the distance from the pupillary light reflex to the
      central margin of the upper lid) and PFD (the distance from the upper lid margin to the lower
      lid margin through the central visual axis). Safety assessment will include bilateral
      SLE/CFS, measurement of PD from external photographs, dilated ophthalmoscopy/fundus
      examination, tonometry, Snellen VA using recent correction, vital signs (BP/HR), and
      collection of adverse events (AEs).
