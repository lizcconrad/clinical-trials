  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study 30 adolescents with bipolar disorder, not otherwise
      specified (BD NOS) and a family history of Bipolar I Disorder (BD) at baseline with rs-fMRI
      (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and functional connectivity (FC) analyses and compare
      data with previously acquired rs-fMRI and FC data from 20 age- and gender-matched healthy
      controls (HC). Subjects will then undergo a 12-week Mindfulness based stress reduction- teen
      (MBSR-T) intervention and be reassessed and rescanned. The intervention and scanning will
      take place in groups of 6-8 subjects/group/year over the 4 years. This proposal will be a
      natural progression of past research, while extending the investigators' expertise to include
      advanced FC analyses and mindfulness based interventions in youth with mood dysregulation.
      The investigators will also integrate trainees into the imaging and therapy components of
      this study, furthering our mission of mentoring the next generation of innovative researchers
      who will push the field forward.
