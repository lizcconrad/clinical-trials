  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to determine whether the oral medication dimethyl
      fumarate is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in patients who are unable,
      unwilling, or uneager to use positive airway pressure therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder that involves collapse of the upper airway
      during sleep, leading to low blood oxygen levels and sleep disruption. Untreated OSA
      increases the risk of many health consequences, including high blood pressure, heart disease,
      stroke, diabetes, memory problems, fatigue, sleepiness, and impaired memory. Despite its
      profound public health and societal impact, there are no known medications that can
      effectively treat OSA, and up to 50% of patients cannot tolerate current treatments. The
      primary treatment for OSA, known as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), is delivered
      by a mechanical device and mask that blows air into the airway to keep it open during sleep.
      Although CPAP controls OSA, many patients can't tolerate the discomfort of the mask, and up
      to 50% of patients cannot use CPAP appropriately.

      Several recent studies of OSA patients suggest that inflammation in the airway and the
      bloodstream may worsen OSA, and that medications that control inflammation may improve OSA.
      In particular, a previous study from the researchers suggests that multiple sclerosis (MS)
      patients who are on MS therapies that control inflammation may have less severe OSA than
      those who are not. MS is an autoimmune disease that is associated with inflammation of the
      nervous system. As OSA may also be caused or worsened by inflammation, this clinical trial
      aims to study the effects of a specific MS medication known as dimethyl fumarate (brand name
      - Tecfidera®) to see if it may also be useful to treat OSA. Tecfidera® is already approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with MS. However, it is not approved
      by the FDA for the treatment of OSA and is thus considered an investigational drug in this
      study.

      Study-related activities will last for 5 months. Consenting participants will receive a
      baseline overnight sleep study to assess their current sleep apnea severity. Participants
      will then be given either oral dimethyl fumarate or placebo for a period of 4 months, and
      will be followed on a monthly basis during the course of the study. At the end of the study,
      participants will undergo a repeat overnight sleep study to monitor for changes in their
      sleep apnea severity. Treatments will be assigned at random (like flipping a coin), and
      participants will not be aware of which treatment they receive. There is a 2/3 chance that
      participants will receive dimethyl fumarate. Participants will also undergo blood draws and
      complete several surveys during their monthly study visits. Participants will be compensated
      for their travel and time throughout the course of the study.

    <description>For the 50 participants who had interpretable month 4 polysomnography (PSG) data available, mean change in sleep apnea severity, as measured by the mean change in respiratory disturbance index (RDI) between baseline (Month 0) PSG and Month 4 PSG, was calculated. The RDI represents the total number of apneas, hypopneas and respiratory-related arousals per hour of sleep.</description>

    <description>Levels of markers in the blood known as cytokines (measured in picograms per milliliter) were measured on a monthly basis from Month 0 (baseline) to Month 4. The outcome is the mean difference in cytokine level from baseline to month 4 (mean level at Month 4 - mean level at Baseline). Values were log-transformed for normality, prior to analysis.</description>

Dimethyl fumarate: Dimethyl fumarate capsules were dispensed at routine study appointments. 120 mg tablets were dispensed to facilitate dose titrations.

        <description>Levels of markers in the blood known as cytokines (measured in picograms per milliliter) were measured on a monthly basis from Month 0 (baseline) to Month 4. The outcome is the mean difference in cytokine level from baseline to month 4 (mean level at Month 4 - mean level at Baseline). Values were log-transformed for normality, prior to analysis.</description>

            <title>Dimethyl Fumarate (Tecfidera®) Capsules</title>
            <description>The starting dose for dimethyl fumarate was 120 mg twice a day orally. After 7 days, the dose was increased to the maintenance dose of 240 mg twice a day, though slower dose escalations were possible to increase tolerability, if necessary. Subjects randomized to dimethyl fumarate were instructed to take this medication twice a day with breakfast and dinner for a period of 4 months.
Dimethyl fumarate: Dimethyl fumarate capsules were dispensed at routine study appointments. 120 mg tablets were dispensed to facilitate dose titrations. Drug was dispensed in 1 month supply, so that compliance was reconciled at follow-up visits, and recorded in accountability logs. Subjects were instructed to take medication with food, (morning and at dinnertime). If subjects missed a dose, they were instructed to resume their normal dose at the next scheduled time, and not to take an extra dose at their next dosing interval if they previously miss a dose.</description>

          <description>Levels of markers in the blood known as cytokines (measured in picograms per milliliter) were measured on a monthly basis from Month 0 (baseline) to Month 4. The outcome is the mean difference in cytokine level from baseline to month 4 (mean level at Month 4 - mean level at Baseline). Values were log-transformed for normality, prior to analysis.</description>
