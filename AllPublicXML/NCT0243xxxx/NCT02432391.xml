    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a lifestyle modification program (GEM) that
      focuses on reducing after-meal blood glucose elevations can improve blood glucose control in
      people with type 2 diabetes. Half of the participants will continue their routine medical
      care, and half will receive five sessions of GEM in addition to their routine care. The two
      groups will be assessed using diabetes-relevant medical, behavioral and psychological
      measures.
