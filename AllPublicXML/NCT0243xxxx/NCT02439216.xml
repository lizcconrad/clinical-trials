  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MoveDMD study is a 3-part, Phase 1/2, multi-site study to evaluate the safety, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of edasalonexent (also known as CAT-1004) in
      pediatric patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of DMD. Male patients from ≥4 to &lt;8
      years of age will be enrolled.

      Edasalonexent is an orally administered small molecule targeted to inhibit activated NF-κB, a
      molecule that is activated from infancy in DMD and which is central to causing muscle damage
      and preventing muscle regeneration. Data on magnetic resonance imaging of the lower and upper
      leg muscles, physical function (including timed function tests) and muscle strength will be
      studied.

      Part A was a 1-week, open-label study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      biomarkers for three dose levels of edasalonexent and is now complete.

      Part B was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study to evaluate
      the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of edasalonexent over 12 weeks. Patients who participated in
      Part A also participated in Part B, along with newly enrolled patients. Patients received
      either edasalonexent 67 mg/kg/day, edasalonexent 100 mg/kg/day, or placebo in Part B. Part B
      is now complete.

      Following completion of Part B, patients receive edasalonexent for 112 weeks in Part C, the
      open-label portion of the MoveDMD study. Patients on the 67 mg/kg/day treatment moved to the
      100 mg/kg/day treatment. Patients on the 100 mg/kg/day treatment remained on the 100
      mg/kg/day treatment.

      If clinically indicated, concomitant treatment with eteplirsen (Exondys 51™) may be
      acceptable in patients with amenable gene mutations during Part C after the patient has been
      exposed to edasalonexent for 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent from parent or legal guardian prior to participation and, for
             patients who are 7 years of age, written assent from patient

          -  Diagnosis of DMD based on a clinical phenotype with increased serum CK and the
             presence of a mutation in the dystrophin gene known to be associated with a DMD
             phenotype

          -  Ability to walk independently (assistive devices are permitted)

          -  Adequate immunization for influenza and varicella

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of corticosteroids within prior 6 months of treatment initiation or planning to
             initiate steroid therapy within the next 6 months

          -  Other prior or ongoing significant medical conditions

          -  Exposure to another investigational drug (such as eteplirsen or idebenone) within 28

             therapeutic clinical trial

               -  Note: There are separate criteria for patients who participated in Part A versus
                  newly enrolling patients. New patients must meet all of the Part A entry criteria
                  to participate in Part B.

             concerns (however, patients may be ≥8 years of age)

        There are no entry criteria for Part C; all patients who complete Part B will automatically
        continue in Part C
