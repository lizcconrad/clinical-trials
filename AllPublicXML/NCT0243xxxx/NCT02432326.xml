    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase 1 study of BBI608 and BBI503 administered orally
      in combination to patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary goal is to determine the
      safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination regimen.
