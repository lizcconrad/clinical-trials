      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the short-term (up to 12 months)
      outcome of treatment by means of the self-expanding iVolution nitinol stent in symptomatic
      (Rutherford 2-4) femoropopliteal arterial stenotic or occlusive lesions.

             treatment

          2. Patient presenting with a score from 2 to 4 according to the Rutherford classification

          3. Patient is willing and able to comply with specified follow-up evaluations at the
             predefined time intervals

          4. Patient is &gt;18 years old

             prior to enrollment in the study

          6. Prior to enrollment, the target lesion was crossed with standard guidewire

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a stent in the target vessel that was placed during a previous procedure

          2. Presence of an aortic thrombosis or significant common femoral ipsilateral stenosis

          3. Previous bypass surgery in the same limb

          4. Patients contraindicated for antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants or thrombolytics

          5. Patients who exhibit persistent acute intraluminal thrombus at the target lesion site

          6. Perforation at the angioplasty site evidenced by extravasation of contrast medium

          7. Patients with known hypersensitivity to nickel-titanium or other study device
             components

          8. Patients with uncorrected bleeding disorders

          9. Female patient with child bearing potential not taking adequate contraceptives or
             currently breastfeeding

         10. Life expectancy of less than 12 months

         11. Ipsilateral iliac artery treatment before target lesion treatment with a residual
             stenosis &gt; 30%

         12. Use of thrombectomy, atherectomy or laser devices during procedure

         13. Any patient considered to be hemodynamically unstable at onset of procedure

         14. Patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study
             that has not reached the primary endpoint
