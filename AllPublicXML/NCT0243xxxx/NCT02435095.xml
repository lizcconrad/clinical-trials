    <textblock>
      Continuation of antipsychotic drug treatment for at least 12 months after remission of the
      first psychotic episode represents the gold clinical standard, and it is recommended by all
      international treatment guidelines. Numerous studies have shown that the risk of relapse is
      significantly increased, if drug treatment is terminated prematurely. However, only a
      minority of patients achieve functional remission, even if they fully comply with treatment.
      Long-term adverse effects of the currently available drugs, specifically brain grey matter
      loss and development of supersensitivity psychosis, might outweigh their benefits. Thus, the
      current standard of long-term maintenance antipsychotic treatment, which has the primary goal
      of relapse prevention, has to be questioned. Here the investigators hypothesize that
      intermittent treatment (experimental) with antipsychotics, which is directed exclusively
      against the positive symptoms of Schizophrenia, is associated with less loss in total grey
      matter volume than maintenance treatment (control). Furthermore, the investigators
      hypothesise that this targeted treatment approach is associated with better functional
      outcome (fewer negative symptoms, better cognitive performance, better quality of life) than
      continuous antipsychotic treatment,although the latter is initially associated with fewer
      relapses.The aim of the present study is to compare two different drug therapies -maintenance
      therapy versus on-demand, intermittent therapy- in terms of their treatment's success and the
      structural changes in the brain.

      Patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-5 admitted to a hospital
      participating in the consortium will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as soon as
      possible after admission. Ideally, this procedure is performed before initiation of
      antipsychotic treatment (benzodiazepines are allowed). If not possible for clinical reasons,
      antipsychotic treatment will be started and the MRI will be acquired within three days of
      initiation of drug treatment. The choice of the antipsychotic will be made by the treating
      physician. All approved antipsychotics are permitted, including first-generation
      antipsychotics such as haloperidol or flupenthixol. This is based on the recommendation of
      the British NICE guidelines: &quot;In nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of
      1,801 participants with first-episode or early schizophrenia (including people with a recent
      onset of schizophrenia and people who have never been treated with antipsychotic medication),
      the evidence suggested there were no clinically significant differences in efficacy between
      the antipsychotic drugs examined.&quot; (NICE 2009, p. 105). However, since second-generation
      antipsychotics (SGA) are now considered first-line treatment for schizophrenia according to
      the German S3 guideline, it can be assumed that more than 80% of all patients will be treated
      with an SGA.

      As soon as positive symptoms are sufficiently controlled, medication will be completely
      tapered off within four weeks. Sufficient control of positive symptoms will defined as
      follows: &quot;delusions&quot; (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) item 1), &quot;hallucinatory
      behaviour&quot; (PANSS item 3), and &quot;suspiciousness/persecution&quot; (PANSS item 6) have to be
      &quot;absent&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; (scores 1 or 2). The PANSS Positive score (7 items) must not be above 18.
      Patients in the experimental group who will not reach remission according to this definition
      will be switched to another antipsychotic according to clinical standards. Tapering of
      medication might be considered at a later time-point. Patients who cannot be tapered off
      medication will be treated with the lowest possible dose.

      Treatment of subsequent exacerbations / psychotic relapses will follow the same rules.
