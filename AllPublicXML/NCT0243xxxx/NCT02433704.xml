      To directly compare acute infection rates in patients undergoing total knee replacement with
      intraosseous regional administration or systemic intravenous administration of prophylactic
      antibiotics.

      Subjects will be prospectively enrolled into the Intraosseous Regional Administration (IORA)
      group, and the investigators will use historical controls for the Systemic Intravenous
      Administration (SIA) group, to include a matched group of patients from 6 months prior to
      enrollment. SIA group will receive systemic dosing of cefazolin within one hour of the
      incision, which is the current standard of care. IORA group will receive intraosseous dosing
      after the tourniquet is inflated to 300-350mm/Hg. Cefazolin 1 gram will be given through an
      intraosseous cannula, placed into the medial aspect of the proximal tibia, after draping and
      before skin incision. The cefazolin will be administered as a bolus in 200 mL of normal
      saline. Incision will be made immediately after infusion. Subjects in both groups will
      receive routine care following the procedure. Primary outcome will be acute surgical site
      infection, which is defined as within 3 weeks after the surgical procedure. Secondary
      outcomes will include correlation of clinical comorbidities to the primary outcome, report
      complications, and compare surgery specific information (tourniquet time, blood loss).

      Subjects with a penicillin allergy will receive a 200mg cefazolin test dose via a systemic
      intravenous route, which is the current standard of care. If no adverse reaction is observed,
      then the investigators will proceed with administration of 1g cefazolin via the intraosseus
      route.
