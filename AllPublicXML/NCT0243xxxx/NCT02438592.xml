      This is an observational study involving retrospective and prospective medical record review
      covering a total maximum of 104 weeks (24 months) per subject. An Audio Computer- Assisted
      Self-Interview (ACASI) at study entry will assess demographic and psychosocial variables of
      study subjects. Data will also be collected to assess clinic level variables. Definitions of
      engagement, prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression in the
      Continuum of Care (CoC) will utilize common definitions including those by U.S. Department of
      Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
      HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). Data will be collected in a large, simple trial design manner to
      provide all elements for both the primary and secondary outcomes.

      This is an observational study involving retrospective and prospective medical record review
      covering a total maximum of 104 weeks (24 months) per subject. Behavioral data will be
      collected via ACASI at study entry to assess demographic and psychosocial variables of study
      subjects. All other data (biomedical, ART, healthcare utilization) at subsequent study visits
      will be collected via medical record abstraction. Information about missed visits as well as
      other healthcare utilization data can be abstracted from electronic appointment systems or
      other electronic systems at the clinical sites. Subject data will be abstracted from medical
      records for up to a maximum 26 weeks prior to the baseline study visit, as well as up to a
      maximum 78 weeks after the baseline study visit or through January 31, 2017, whichever occurs
      first, for a total maximum of 104 weeks or two years per subject. Data will also be collected
      from each Adolescent Medicine Trials Unit to assess clinic level variables at baseline
      (within 30 days of protocol registration) and 48 and 96 weeks after baseline. Definitions of
      engagement, prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression in the
      Continuum of Care (CoC) will utilize common definitions including those by U.S. Department of
      Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
      HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). Data will be collected in a large, simple trial design manner to
      provide all elements for both the primary and secondary outcomes.

        This HIV medical appointment must be a non-emergency, routine condition-focused exam AND
        one or more of the following:

          -  CD4, VL lab draw and/or review of these lab results;

          -  Discussion around HIV ART options;

          -  Primary and/or secondary HIV prevention education and counseling; or

          -  Diagnosis and treatment of complications of HIV, and of AIDS-defining conditions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of serious psychiatric symptoms (e.g., active hallucinations, thought
             disorder) that would impair the individual's ability to provide true informed consent
             or participate in the baseline ACASI*;

          -  Visibly distraught (e.g., suicidal, homicidal, exhibiting violent behavior) at the
             time of consent or the baseline ACASI*; or

          -  Intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or other substances at the time of
             consent or the baseline ACASI*

               -  NOTE: If consent/assent is obtained prior to the enrollment date, assessment for
                  these exclusion criteria must be performed again prior to administration of the
                  baseline ACASI (Enrollment). If any are present, the subject cannot be enrolled;
                  do not administer the ACASI. Reassessment of eligibility and enrollment may take
                  place at a later date per the discretion of the treating clinician.
