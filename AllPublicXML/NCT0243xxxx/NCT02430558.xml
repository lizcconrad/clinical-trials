        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 55

               -  osteochondral lesions of the knee due to trauma or osteochondritis dissecans or
                  removal treatment ( lesion post autograft)

               -  Osteochondral lesion &gt; grade II- ICRS

               -  One lesion or 2 concomitant lesions (tibial plateau, patella and condyles )at
                  least one lesion has been pretreated by mosaicplasy or ACI. These treatment would
                  have to have been made at least 18 months before inclusion

               -  Presence of disabling and clinically meaningful symptoms (subjective IKDC &lt; 65,
                  no improvement for 3 months)

               -  No significant obesity (BMI &lt; 30)

               -  Accompanying ligamentous and meniscal lesions, joint malalignment and patella
                  femoral instability are authorized and corrected concurrently.

               -  Patient able to understand, sign and date the informed consent form

                  beneficiary of such as system

               -  Women of childbearing age may not be included in the clinical trial unless their
                  pregnancy test is negative. If this test is negative, they will be asked to use
                  an effective birth control method during the entire the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Pregnant or breast feeding women: Women of childbearing age will be asked to undergo
             a pregnancy test before being enrolled into the study and to use an effective birth
             control method.

          -  Presence of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, any other condition of knee joint
             that, in the surgeon's opinion, is likely to compromise the allograft's outcome

          -  Excessive laxity or recurrent instability that could affect the score evaluation
             without concomitant ligamentoplasty

          -  Presence of an ulcerative disease, heavy smoking, tuberculosis, chronic psychiatric
             disorder or disease requiring long-term treatment with a medication that would affect
             bone or joint metabolism
