    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of CF is currently based on the discovery of two CFTR gene mutations and / or a
      positive sweat test (&gt; 60mmol / l). A significant number of patients with atypical cystic
      fibrosis (chronic sino-pulmonary disease with a single mutation in the CFTR gene and / or a
      test of the intermediate sweat between 30 and 60 mmol / l) undetected by these techniques are
      behind specialized care while irreversible lung damage is already existed. Currently, the
      measurement of nasal potential difference in vivo (DPN), which evaluates the transportation
      of chlorine in the nasal epithelium with an electrode, is proposed for the diagnosis of
      atypical forms. However DPN dependent nasal local conditions when analysing do not always
      offer the possibility of concluding the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. It is necessary to
      develop new and more reliable diagnostic tests for the detection of cases of atypical cystic
      fibrosis. The authors propose to develop a new diagnostic technique based on the study of
      bioelectric properties of a preparation of nasal cells of the subject obtained by brushing
      and placed in primary culture (CCBN).

      Autosomal recessive, CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene whose nature determines the
      clinical expression and severity of the disease affecting mainly the respiratory, digestive
      and genital. Respiratory pathology is mainly responsible for the morbidity and mortality of
      patients with cystic fibrosis. CFTR, which is ion channel carrying chlorine, plays an
      essential role in respiratory disease through its involvement in the changes of surface
      liquid covering the respiratory epithelial cells.

      Currently the measurement of nasal potential difference in vivo (DPN) can cause arguments
      electrophysiological diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (chlorine transport default) for patients
      with atypical form but can be rendered difficult or non-interpretable by the lack of
      cooperation of the patient (especially in the children who do not support the presence of the
      probe into the nose) or mostly due to poor local conditions related to infectious diseases
      rhino sinus of these patients.

      It is necessary to develop new and more reliable diagnostic tests for the detection of cases
      of atypical cystic fibrosis. The study of ion transport from nasal epithelial cells collected
      by brushing (NBC) in the diagnosis of atypical forms of cystic fibrosis is tested in this
      trial as a new diagnostic test.

      This research will focus on three groups:

        1. Of patients with cystic fibrosis adults.

        2. adult patients with atypical form

        3. people who do not have cystic fibrosis

      Depending on the patient group, there will be only one CCBN or CCBN and DPN or CCBN and DPN
      and genetic analysis to verify the absence of mutation.
