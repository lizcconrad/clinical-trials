  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to develop an in vitro model of cancer for laboratory study using
      liver, biliary and pancreatic cancer tissue. The secondary objective is to study the genetic
      and cellular biology of cancer of the liver, biliary tract and the pancreas. As well the
      investigators hope to compare molecular and cellular biology of cancer cells with normal
      cells as well as potentially test the efficacy of current and future anti-cancer therapies.

      Samples will be collected from tissue that has been resected as part of the treatment for a
      patient diagnosed with liver, bile duct or pancreas cancer.
