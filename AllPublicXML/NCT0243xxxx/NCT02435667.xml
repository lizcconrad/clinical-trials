  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to determine the effect of resistance exercise training on
      locomotor muscle function, exercise capacity, exertional symptoms, and quality of life in HF
      patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled pilot study of resistance exercise training in patients with
      HFpEF, the investigators will recruit 24 HFpEF patients who will be randomized to resistance
      exercise training (RT - n=12) or no resistance exercise training (standard care control group
      [CTL] - n=12). The investigators will have baseline and follow-up measures of clinical
      characteristics, leg muscle strength, quality of life, lean muscle mass (body composition via
      DXA including segmental lean mass), maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (peak VO2, peak
      work, ventilatory efficiency), constant-load submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test with
      speckle tracking echocardiography (exertional dyspnea and fatigue at matched workloads,
      cardiac output, diastolic function, left ventricular strain, ventilation, gas exchange, and
      locomotor muscle neural feedback).

      Participants will be asked to make 4 separate study visits. Those randomized to undergo
      Resistance Training will be expected to make those visits as well.

    <description>Entails 36 supervised resistance exercise training sessions (3 sessions per week for 12 weeks). Each exercise session will be supervised by a trained, certified Exercise Physiologist specializing in Cardiac Rehabilitation. The specific resistance exercise training will include Aerobic Exercise, Resistance Exercise, and Core Strengthening Exercises. Other baseline and follow-up tests include: DEXA bone scan, Blood Draw, Cardiopulmonary Max Exercise Test, Quality of Life Questionnaire, and a Submaximal Exercise Test.</description>

    <description>No resistance exercise training. Patients will stay on their current healthcare regimen as previously assigned by their physician.

    <description>Aerobic Exercise
a. Each participant will engage in 5 minutes of aerobic based exercise on an arm/leg ergometer (NuStep Cross Trainer) at an intensity of 12-14 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale as a warm-up prior to the exercise session and again as a cool-down at the end of the exercise session.
Resistance Exercise - 2 sets of 8-12 repetitions - beginning at 60% of the initial 1 RM.
a) Leg Extension, b) Bicep Curl, c) Leg Press, d) Chest Press, e) Leg Curl, f)Seated Row (horizontal or pulldown), g) Calf Raises
Core Strengthening Exercises a. 5-10 minutes of stability ball and balance exercises</description>
