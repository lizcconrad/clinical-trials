    <textblock>
      PrEP-30 is a demonstration project to assess the feasibility of providing oral PrEP to MSM
      and other individuals at-risk for HIV in Bangkok, Thailand as a service that is funded
      entirely through user fees. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine PrEP is provided part
      of a combined HIV prevention program that includes risk-reduction counseling, regular HIV
      testing, and the provision of condoms and lubricants. PrEP-30 is implemented at the Thai Red
      Cross AIDS Research Centre, at the site of the largest HIV counseling and testing center in
      Thailand.
