  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this protocol is to evaluate the potential of PET imaging of amino acid transport
      and microglial activation to improve the differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation
      necrosis in patients with brain metastases after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery
      (SRS) who have re-growing lesions. These state-of-the-art imaging tools will be used in
      combination with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) and FDG-PET
      (fluorodeoxyglucose).

      The investigators hypothesize that by using two different PET tracers, one sensitive to tumor
      metabolic activity, and one sensitive to inflammatory processes, investigators can separately
      identify metabolically active tumor from radiation necrosis related inflammation. This can be
      accomplished with quantitative assessments of tracer uptake using kinetic modeling
      techniques, as well as by high-resolution imaging to assess the distribution of tracer uptake
      in the tumor region. All participants in the study will have the receive the same diagnostic
      tests.

    <description>[11C]Methionine [11]. This natural amino acid, and its various fluorinated derivatives, has been widely used in brain tumor studies due to a) high tumor-to-normal brain contrast, and b) its sensitivity to biological functions including amino acid transport and utilization. [11C]PBR28 [12]. This ligand is one of a series of second-generation tracers that bind to TSPO (translocator protein), a protein that is upregulated in activated microglia.</description>

        Patients who received SRS for melanoma or NSCLC brain metastases with regrowing lesions who
        are candidates for surgical intervention (biopsy or excision) at the Smilow Cancer Center
        or are candidates for monitoring by serial imaging will be screened for eligibility and
        offered enrollment

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years with brain metastases from melanoma or non-small cell lung
             cancer

          -  Patients must have had SRS and regrowth in at least one lesion &gt; 0.5 cm in greatest
             dimension and fall into one of two categories: a) patient is deemed clinically
             appropriate for surgical intervention (biopsy or craniotomy) OR b) patient is
             asymptomatic and has a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months so that serial follow-up imaging
             is appropriate

          -  Willingness to participate in imaging studies

          -  Able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with history of prior radiation exposure for research purposes within the
             past year, such that participation in this study would place them over the FDA limits
             for annual radiation exposure. This guideline is an effective dose of 5 rem received
             per year.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or currently breastfeeding

          -  Women of child-bearing age who are sexually active, unless they agree to two forms of
             contraception, and have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and on the days
             of the PET imaging

          -  Patients unable to undergo MRI with gadolinium-based contrast for standard clinical
             reasons which include:

          -  Cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clip, cochlear implants, Intra Uterine Device (IUD),
             shrapnel, neurostimulators, defibrillator, artificial heart valve, or history of metal
             fragments in eyes.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Body size too large for closed MRI

          -  Known hepatic fibrosis.

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Contraindication to MR contrast agents: eGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) &lt; 30
             by the Cockcroft- Gault formula if &gt; 60 years old or with chronic renal disease

          -  Anaphylactic allergy to gadolinium
