    <textblock>
      This study evaluates ADCT-301 in patients with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin
      lymphoma. Patients will participate in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and receive
      escalating doses of ADCT-301 every 3 weeks.

      In Part 2 of the study, patients will receive a recommended dose(s) of ADCT-301 every 3
      weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first in human clinical study with ADCT-301 to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ADCT-301 in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma.

      ADCT-301 is a human monoclonal antibody attached via a cleavable linker to a
      pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) warhead which, when internalized by antigen expressing cells,
      covalently cross links deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) preventing replication.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: In part 1 (dose escalation) up to 80 patients will
      receive an infusion of ADCT-301 on Day 1, every 3 weeks. Dose escalation will continue until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

      In Part 2 (expansion) up to 60 patients will be assigned to receive the recommended dose(s)
      of ADCT-301 as determined by a Dose Escalation Steering Committee.

      For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment
      period, and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 months
      after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be dependent on overall
      patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It is anticipated that the
      entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could last approximately 3 years from first patient treated to
      last patient completed.
