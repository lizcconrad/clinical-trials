  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy and pembrolizumab in treating
      patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be
      cured or controlled with treatment, that have failed prior therapy, and that cannot be
      removed by surgery. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,
      may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving vaccine therapy
      together with pembrolizumab may be a better treatment in patients with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of combined p53MVA vaccine (modified vaccinia
      virus Ankara vaccine expressing p53) and pembrolizumab that are well-tolerated in patients
      with refractory, tumor protein 53 (p53) over expressing cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical response and anti-p53 T cell immune responses.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes followed by
      modified vaccinia virus Ankara vaccine expressing p53 subcutaneously (SC) at least 30 minutes
      later once in weeks 1, 4, and 7.

      Patients may receive additional doses of pembrolizumab in weeks 10, 13, 16, and 19, for a
      maximum of 7 doses if there are no signs of progressive disease. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
