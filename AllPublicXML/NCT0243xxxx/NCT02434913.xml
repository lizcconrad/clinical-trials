  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This surgery involves the use of a finger joint replacement device for treatment of patients
      with certain kinds of arthritis (osteo - arthritis or post traumatic arthritis) and who
      expect to place their hands in heavy loading situations, or patients needing revision of a
      failed implant placed in the PIP joint. A joint replacement surgery is an operation where the
      arthritic joint is removed and a metal and plastic joint is inserted to replace the natural
      joint. The surgery is expected to last about 2 hours. The procedure is done in the operating
      room and requires general anesthesia or an axillary block. (General anesthesia affects the
      entire body and is accompanied by a loss of consciousness. An axillary block results in
      anesthesia of the hand and forearm only. A tourniquet is applied to the arm to prevent
      bleeding during the surgery.)
