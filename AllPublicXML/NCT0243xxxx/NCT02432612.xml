    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oromucosal
      dose of Sativex in subjects with advanced cancer currently on background Step III opioid
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multiple-centre, single dose clinical trial to assess the PK of a
      single oromucosal dose of Sativex in subjects with advanced cancer who are currently on
      background Step III opioid therapy.

      A minimum of 25 subjects ≥18 years with advanced cancer will be needed for the assessment of
      the primary objective of the trial. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) will be performed within
      -10 to -2 days prior to dosing. For the Screening Visit, subjects will attend on an
      outpatient basis.

      Subjects will be checked into the clinical research facility on Day −1 and will be confined
      to the clinical research facility for the Inpatient/Treatment Period (Day −1 to Day 3) (Visit
      2). Subjects will be administered a single oromucosal dose of Sativex on Day 1 (time [t]=0).
      Fourteen PK blood samples will be taken from Day 1 to Day 3 during Visit 2: one predose
      sample and 13 postdose samples at the following time points after dosing: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1,
      1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postdose.

      Subjects will be discharged from the clinical research facility after the 48-hour PK blood
      sample has been taken and final safety assessments are completed. Subjects who discontinue
      from the trial prior to the completion of the PK blood draws will undergo the safety
      evaluations scheduled for Day 3.

      The Safety Follow-up Call (Visit 3) will be made 7 (+2) days after dosing on Day 1. Subjects
      with any new adverse events (AEs) or clinical laboratory abnormalities will be asked to
      return for safety follow-up.

      The expected duration for trial participation (including Screening Visit, Inpatient/Treatment
      Period, and Safety Follow-up Call) for each individual subject is a maximum of 19 days.

    <description>Sativex will be administered by trained, clinical trial personnel, via a pump action oromucosal spray. Sativex will be administered as 2 actuations (sprays) under the tongue or inside the cheeks every 4 minutes until 6 sprays have been administered. Following the administration of the first and second set of 2 actuations, patients will be offered 50 mL water to drink; and following the final set of 2 actuations, 100 mL of water will be offered (i.e., a total of 200 mL water will be offered during the Sativex dosing). There must be a period of at least 2 minutes and no more than 3 minutes between Sativex administration and consumption of water. Patients will not be permitted their regular medication until 2 hours post dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) to minimize any possible drug interactions.</description>

          -  The subject has a clinical diagnosis of cancer related pain, is currently taking Step
             III opioid therapy and is willing to continue on their current dosing regimen
             throughout the Inpatient/Treatment Period of the trial.

          -  The subject is willing and able to give written informed consent.

          -  The subject is willing and able to comply with all trial requirements.

             12 months.

          -  The subject has any known or suspected history or family history of schizophrenia, or
             other psychotic illness, history of severe personality disorder or other severe
             significant psychiatric disorder other than depression associated with the underlying

          -  The subject has significant cardiac disease, or has a cardiac disorder that in the
             opinion of the investigator would put the subject at risk of a clinically relevant
             arrhythmia or myocardial infarction, or has a secondary or tertiary atrioventricular
             block, or evidence of clinically significant cardiac disease on ECG at the Screening
             Visit.

          -  The subject has significantly impaired renal function as evidenced by a creatinine
             clearance (based on measured serum creatinine level) lower than 40 mL/min at Visit 1.

          -  The subject has significantly impaired hepatic function at Visit 1 (alanine
             aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;5 upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin [TBL] &gt; 2
             ULN). If the ALT or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &gt;3 ULN and the TBL &gt;2 ULN [or
             international normalized ratio [INR] &gt;1.5]) this subject must not enter the trial.

          -  The subject is a female of childbearing potential, or a male patient whose partner is
             of childbearing potential, is unwilling to ensure that they and/or their partner use a
             highly effective method of contraception, including female sterilization (ie,
             documented bilateral tubal ligation), male sterilization, established use of hormonal
             methods of contraception (oral, implanted or transdermal), an intrauterine device or
             intrauterine system, or true abstinence.

          -  Female subject who is pregnant, lactating or planning pregnancy during the course of
             the trial and for 3 months thereafter.

          -  The subject has received a non approved IMP within 30 days or 5 times the half-life of
             the IMP (whichever is greater) prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  The subject has any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the
             trial, or may influence the result of the trial, or the patient's ability to
             participate in the trial.

          -  The subject was previously enrolled in the current trial or any other Sativex clinical
             trial for cancer pain.

          -  The subject is unwilling to abstain from the consumption of grapefruit products during
