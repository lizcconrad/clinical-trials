  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinoma (BCCA) is the most common human cancer, and frequently affects facial
      structures. While rarely fatal, facial BCCA can be disfiguring and expensive to treat.

      Vismodegib is a small molecule inhibitor of SMO developed for the treatment of tumors in
      which the Hh signaling pathway appears to contribute to the development and maintenance of
      tumorigenesis. Vismodegib was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      treatment of metastatic and locally advanced BCCA. Recent reports have suggested that
      vismodegib treatment for orbital BCCA may facilitate eye preservation even if surgery is
      eventually required

      In order to assess the potential of vismodegib to improve the ophthalmic outcomes following
      treatment for orbital and/or periocular BCCA, this study will follow patients with
      globe-threatening orbital and lacrimal-threatening periocular BCCA who are being treated with
      vismodegib as standard of care.
