    <textblock>
      To evaluate the suitability (i.e. number of tests completed and number of participants
      completing the tests, variance estimate of baseline and of the change from baseline values)
      of neurocognitive tests and functioning scales in view of their use in future multicenter,
      multinational clinical efficacy trials testing a putative cognitive enhancer for individuals
      with Down syndrome aged 6-30.
