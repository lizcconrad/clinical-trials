  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether vaccination with viagenpumatucel-L combined with strategies to
      modulate the immune response is safe for patients with non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma who
      have failed at least one prior line of therapy for incurable or metastatic disease. These
      methods collectively use the body's immune system to target the patient's own tumor.
      Immunosuppression hinders that response, and may develop in NSCLC patients in a variety of
      ways, such as activation of checkpoint pathways in the tumor microenvironment. Drugs that
      disrupt checkpoint molecule signaling like anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab, may
      release this brake on the immune system. Tumor expression of PD-L1 plays an important role in
      patient response to checkpoint inhibitors; in general, clinical response to checkpoint
      inhibitors requires tumor expression of PD-L1 and presence of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes
      (TIL). Combining viagenpumatucel-L with anti-PD-1 agents may enhance the vaccine's anti-tumor
      activity while prolonging or increasing the efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor.
