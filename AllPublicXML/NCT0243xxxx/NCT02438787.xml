  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of ustekinumab, in adult anti-TNF(alpha)
      refractory participants with active radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), as measured
      by the reduction in signs and symptoms of radiographic AxSpA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has
      a real effect) study. The study consists of 3 phases; Screening (up to 8 weeks), Treatment
      phase: placebo-controlled (Week 0 to 24) and active treatment (Week 24 to Week 52), and
      Safety Follow-up (up to 12 weeks). Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups: placebo, ustekinumab 45 mg and ustekinumab 90 mg. The total duration of study will be
      up to 64 weeks. Participants will be primarily assessed for Assessment of SpondyloArthritis
      International Society (ASAS) 40 response at Week 24. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the trial.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This study was stopped because ustekinumab did not achieve key endpoints in a related study.
    The safety profile was consistent with past ustekinumab studies.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 40 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 40 is defined as a greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 40 percent (%) improvement in 3 of 4 domains: Patient global; Total back pain; Function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI]); Inflammation (average of the last 2 questions of the BASDAI concerning morning stiffness), with an absolute improvement of at least 2 on a 0 to 10 scale, and no deterioration at all in the remaining domain.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an ASAS 20 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS 20 is an improvement of &gt;= 20% from baseline and absolute improvement from baseline of at least 1 on a 0 to 10 scale in at least 3 of the following 4 domains: Patient global; Total back pain; Function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index [BASFI]); Inflammation (average of the last 2 questions of the BASDAI concerning morning stiffness) and absence of deterioration from baseline (&gt;=20% and worsening of at least 1 on a 0 to 10 scale) in the potential remaining domain.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve at Least 50% Improvement From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is defined as participant self-assessment using a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 to 10) on the following criteria: A. Fatigue; B. Spinal pain; C. Peripheral joint pain/swelling; D. Enthesitis; E. Intensity of morning stiffness; F. Duration of morning stiffness. The BASDAI = 0.2 (A + B + C + D + 0.5[E + F]).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASFI is a participant's self-assessment represented as a mean (VAS; 0 to 10) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the participant's functional anatomy and 2 of which relate to a participant's ability to cope with everyday life. An increase along the scale indicates a worsening condition.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) (CRP) Inactive Disease at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS has developed a disease activity score (DAS) for use in AS, the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS). ASDAS (CRP) = 0.121 x Total back pain + 0.058 x Duration of morning stiffness + 0.110 x Patient global assessment + 0.073 x Peripheral joint pain/ swelling + 0.579 x Log (C-reactive protein [CRP]+1). Inactive disease is defined as an ASDAS (CRP) score less than (&lt;) 1.3.</description>
