  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a computer-assisted adaptation of SafeCare, an evidence-based home visiting
      program, will be developed and tested in child welfare. This approach will assist home
      visitors with delivery of SafeCare to families, with the goal of improving provider fidelity
      and implementation success. In the computer-assisted SafeCare sessions, a portion of the
      session will be delivered on a tablet computer that the home visitor brings to the family's
      home. The computer software will deliver the educational piece, or explain piece of each
      session, along with modeling videos of the skills. The home visitor will follow up with the
      practice and feedback portions of the session. A randomized feasibility trial will be
      conducted to test the technology-based approach against the standard SafeCare implementation
      approach in terms of feasibility of implementation, provider job demands and resources, as
      well as client outcomes such as skill acquisition and mental health.

    <measure>Feasibility of Technology-Assisted SafeCare as measured by provider satisfaction surveys and qualitative interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately six months after completing the baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine provider acceptability and feasibility of Technology-Assisted SafeCare by averaging provider satisfaction measures to impart an overall satisfaction score for this implementation approach, as well as summarizing qualitative data collected at the Tech-Assisted SafeCare providers' exit interview (approximately six months after the baseline assessment). Providers will rate items on the satisfaction survey on a scale from one to five.</description>

    <measure>Job demands and resources as measured by the Job Content Questionnaire and questions developed by the investigators - baseline measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine the effect of implementation condition on participant-reported job demands and resources. Job demands and resources will be measured using the Job Content Questionnaire (Karasek et al., 1998), specifically the skill discretion, decision authority, psychological demands, depression, and satisfaction scales. Participants will also be asked several questions developed by the investigators regarding the number of families they serve at a given time (i.e. caseload) and number of times they contact those families per week. Participants will respond to these questions in an online survey completed at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Fidelity as measured by the SafeCare fidelity checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected throughout the six months of the study - Measured for nine sessions until home visitor certification is reached and once per month thereafter (per intervention protocol)</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant's fidelity to the model will be measured using the SafeCare fidelity checklist. Per standard SafeCare protocol, all SafeCare home visitors are fidelity monitored by a coach in order to assess their adherence to the model. They receive fidelity monitoring for nine sessions (three in each of three modules) until they reach certification and once per month thereafter. All fidelity scores for the participants will be collected from baseline assessment to six-month follow-up in order to assess the effect of implementation condition on fidelity scores. The frequency of fidelity assessment will vary depending on the caseload of each home visitor participant.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase of implementation completion</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately six months after the baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will document which phase of implementation (workshop completion, certification, or fidelity maintenance) each participant has reached at the time of the six-month follow-up assessment.</description>

    <measure>Time spent on SafeCare session preparation, completion, and follow-up as documented on a time diary form</measure>
    <time_frame>Following each SafeCare session conducted during the six months of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The time spent on SafeCare session preparation, completion, and follow-up will be documented using a time diary form developed by the investigators. This form is used to document the time home visitors spend on job-related activities such as preparing for home visits, conducting home visits, and completing notes, among other activities. All participants will complete the form following each SafeCare session they complete during the six months of the study. The total number of time diaries completed will vary depending on the home visitor's caseload.</description>

    <measure>Parent child abuse potential as measured by the Brief Child Abuse Potential Inventory - Baseline Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Parent child abuse potential will be assessed during the baseline assessment using the Brief Child Abuse Potential Inventory (Ondersma, Chaffin, Simpson, &amp; LeBreton, 2003). This measure is a shorter version of the 160-item Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) (Milner, 1986), making it less time consuming and, thus, easier to administer while retaining good reliability and validity. The 34-item BCAP consists of a series of Agree/Disagree statements. These data will be collected by a research assessor in a phone interview.</description>

    <description>Parent child abuse potential will be assessed again approximately 18 weeks after the baseline assessment using the Brief Child Abuse Potential Inventory (Ondersma, Chaffin, Simpson, &amp; LeBreton, 2003) to assess change from baseline. This measure is a shorter version of the 160-item Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) (Milner, 1986), making it less time consuming and, thus, easier to administer while retaining good reliability and validity.

    <measure>Child internalizing and externalizing problems as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist - Baseline measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Child internalizing and externalizing problems will be assessed during the baseline assessment using the Child Behavior Checklist, or CBCL (Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2000). The CBCL is a 99-item instrument that asks parents to rate how often certain behaviors have been true of their child in the past two months, from not true to very true/often true. The measure consists of seven scales: emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn, attention problems, aggressive behavior, and sleep problems. These data will be collected by a research assessor in a phone interview.</description>
