  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study of ASLAN001 given in combination with
      CAPOX or mFolfox6, in patients with metastatic solid tumours, whom are suitable to receive
      CAPOX or mFolfox6, or with tumours that have dysregulated EGFR or HER2 signaling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use standard 3+3 design to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) of
      ASLAN001 in combination with fixed dose of Oxaliplatin/Capecitabine (CAPOX) or
      5-FU/leucovorin (mFolfox6).

      MTD of ASLAN001 in combination with CAPOX will first be determined followed by the
      combination with mFolfox6.

      The recommended Phase II dose will be the highest dose of the combination therapy that is
      considered to be tolerated in 6 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with metastatic solid tumours eligible for treatment with oxaliplatin in
             combination with capecitabine / 5-FU (fluorouracil) and leucovorin or who progressed
             following standard therapy or patients with EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor )
             or HER2 dysregulated tumours.

          2. Patients with a partial gastrectomy may be allowed to participate in the study as long
             as they can take oral medications and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria.
