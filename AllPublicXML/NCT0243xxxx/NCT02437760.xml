  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tumor associated CA-125antigen for diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer was well
      defined. Increased serum CA125 level may have many diagnoses other than ovarian cancer,
      including breast, colorectal and lung cancer. 80% lung cancer patients were diagnosed at
      advanced stage. Malignant pleural effusion secondary to lung cancer represented the condition
      of cancer cell involved pleura.

      The CA-125 level may reflect the extent of tumor involved in pleura (tumor burden), it could
      be correlated with the prognosis. This study was performed to examine the properties of
      CA-125 by measuring pleural and blood CA-125 levels in lung cancer with or without malignant
      pleural effusion; meanwhile to examine whether the rate of decline in CA 125 during primary
      therapy as a surrogate indicator for survival.
