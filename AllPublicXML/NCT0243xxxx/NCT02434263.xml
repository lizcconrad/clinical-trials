  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the performance, safety and efficacy of Hydra
      Aortic valve in real-world patients. Following initial implantation, all patients will have
      clinical follow up at 30 days, 3, months, 6 months and 12 months

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized investigational study designed to
      assess the safety and performance of the HYDRA Aortic valve and delivery system. Primary
      endpoint for safety is the 30 day all cause mortality rate. Primary endpoint for performance
      is the acute device success. In addition, the efficacy of the HYDRA Aortic valve and delivery
      system will be evaluated. Up to 165 patients will be enrolled in the study in order to
      achieve 150 subjects successfully implanted.

      All patients will have a clinical follow-up at 30 days, 3months, 6 months and 12 months post
      implant. The follow-up procedure table is shown in Appendix A.

      The patient is enrolled in the study as a subject only upon signature of the informed
      consent. All subjects will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator prior to undergoing the
      implant procedure for the Hydra Aortic Heart Valve.
