  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of administration of low dose of human
      chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) after use of clomiphene citrate (CC) for induction of ovulation
      in infertile women having CC resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

      Women will be randomly divided into two groups; CC-HCG group and CC group. Women in the
      CC-HCG group will receive CC (150 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of cycle) and HCG
      (200 IU/day SC from day 7 of cycle). Women in the CC group will receive CC alone (150 mg/day
      for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of cycle). Transvaginal sonography (TVS) scan will be
      performed regularly for monitoring of follicular growth (folliculometry); starting from day
      10 of the stimulation cycle and repeated every 2-3 days. When there will be at least one
      follicle ≥ 18 mm in diameter, final oocyte maturation will be induced by intramuscular
      administration of 10000 IU of HCG and timed intercourse will be advised. If there will be no
      follicle ≥ 12 mm by day 16 of the cycle, monitoring of follicular growth will be discontinued
      and the cycle will be presumed to be anovulatory. Ovulation will be documented by TVS scan
      one week after triggering of oocyte maturation and will be confirmed by assessing the
      midluteal serum progesterone level. Each woman will be subjected to ovarian stimulation for a
      maximum of 3 consecutive cycles except if she gets pregnant in the first or second cycle
