  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of basimglurant compared
      to placebo after multiple ascending oral doses for up to 22 days in healthy subjects and in
      patients with MDD on stable selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) background therapy.
