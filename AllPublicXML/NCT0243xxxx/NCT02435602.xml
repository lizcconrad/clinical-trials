      This study evaluates the role of narrow band imaging (NBI) endoscopy compared with Lugol
      chromoendoscopy in the early detection of esophageal cancer in patients with prior head and
      neck cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancers have an increased risk for developing an esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Small, superficial, curable lesions are difficult to diagnose
      using only white light endoscopy. To improve detection chromoendoscopy is recommended. In
      this project patients are divided into two groups based on received chromoendoscopy (NBI
      versus Lugol). The results of two methods will be compare regarding positive predictive value
      to establish usage of chromoendoscopy in early detection of ESCC.
