    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety of aripiprazole administered
      long-term in doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg per day as a maintenance therapy in subjects with
      chronic or first episode of schizophrenia. Information on the continued efficacy of
      aripiprazole was also gathered in this long-term trial (until 31 Dec 2012 or until
      aripiprazole was otherwise available through marketed means and/or reimbursed).

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score by Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 continuing every 12 weeks, Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items, and 16 general psychopathology scale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) by Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 continuing every 12 weeks, Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of trial medication were rated for each participant using the CGI-I scale. The study physician must rate the participant's total improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment. All responses were compared to the participant's condition at baseline. Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 =very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5
=minimally worse; 6 = much worse; and 7 = very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 continuing every 12 weeks, Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms. 1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60. The usual cut-off points are: 0 to 6 = normal/ symptom absent, 7 to 19 = mild depression, 20 to 34 = moderate depression, &gt;34 = severe depression.</description>

    <description>The SAS is composed of 10 items. This scale contains 10 items: Gait, Arm dropping, Shoulder shaking, Elbow rigidity, Wrist rigidity, Head rotation, Glabella Tap, Tremor, Salivation, Akathisia. Grade of severity of each item is rated using a 5-point scale, 1 (normal) and 5 (most severe). The total score ranges from 10 to 50. Negative changes from baseline indicate an improvement, with higher negative values indicating better improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale Score (BARS) Total Score by Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 continuing every 12 weeks, Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>BARS consisted of 4 items: objective observation of akathisia by study physician, subjective feelings of restlessness by participant, participant distress due to akathisia, global evaluation of akathisia. The first 3 items were rated on a 4-point scale: 0 = absence of symptoms to 3 = severe condition. The global clinical evaluation were made on a 6-point scale, (0=absent, 1=questionable, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, 5=severe). Participants were observed while they were seated and then stood for a minimum of 2 minutes in each position. Symptoms observed in other situations (e.g., while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity on the ward) may also be rated. Subjective phenomena were elicited by direct questioning. The BARS Global Score was derived from the global clinical assessment of akathisia from the BARS panel. Total score ranges from 0 to 14. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement, with higher negative values indicating better improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale Score (AIMS) Total Score by Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 continuing every 12 weeks, Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS assessment consisted of 10 items describing symptoms of dyskinesia. Facial and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk movements (item 7) were observed unobtrusively while the participant was at rest (e.g., in the waiting room), and the study physician would make global judgments on the participant's dyskinesia's (items 8 through 10). For this scale, the participant was seated on a hard, firm chair. These items are rated on a five-point scale: 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 40. Negative changes from baseline indicate an improvement, with higher negative values indicating better improvement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Complete a Prior Study: each patient must meet one of the following conditions for
             completion of the prior study:

               -  A patient who has completed 52 weeks of post-randomization treatment in the prior
                  double blind study (31-97-301 or 31-98-304-01) is eligible, with no further
                  qualifications.

               -  A patient who was early-terminated from the study 31-97-301 or 31-98- 304-01 for
                  either of the following two reasons is eligible to enter this open label study
                  with no minimal required duration of prior double-blind participation:

                    -  Early termination was due to a marked deterioration of clinical status and
                       no serious adverse events (SAE) other than hospitalization has occurred. The
                       marked clinical deterioration must be documented by at least a one-point
                       increase in CGI-Severity score from the baseline and a score of 6 (much
                       worse) or 7 (very much worse) in CGI-Global Improvement at the time of
                       termination, or

                    -  Early termination was due to a non-serious AE requiring discontinuation of
                       the study drug

               -  A patient who was early terminated after a minimum of 4 weeks' participation in
                  the double-blind treatment in study 31-97-301 or 31-98- 304-01 and the reason for
                  early termination was withdrawal of consent due to lack of effect but not marked
                  deterioration. This must be documented by no change from baseline in the
                  CGI-Severity score and a score of 4 (no change) or 5 (minimally worse) on the
                  CGI-Global Improvement scale.

          2. Signing of Informed Consent Form: Prior to any procedure or drug administration, each
             patient must sign an informed consent form. In addition, if required by the Ethical
             Committee, each patient's next-of-kin or responsible caregiver will co-sign the
             patient's consent form or a separate consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients suffering from any significant somatic disease or medical problem that would
             obscure the results of treatment, or that might require frequent changes of
             concomitant medication.

          2. Patients with any acute or unstable medical condition requiring pharmacotherapy, other
             than schizophrenia.

          3. Patients with an abnormal laboratory test value in the most recent analysis (from the
             study 31-97-301 or 31-98-304-01) which is considered by the investigator as presenting
             a significant risk to the patient for continuing treatment with aripiprazole.

          4. Patients who were early-terminated from the prior double-blind studies (31-97-301 or
             31-98-304-01) due to a serious adverse event (SAE) other than worsening of psychosis
             or hospitalization.

          5. Female patients of child bearing potential with a positive serum pregnancy test at the
             baseline (last visit of prior study) of this open-label follow-on study.

          6. Patients who have positive result in the urine screen for drugs of abuse (except for
             cannabis or medically-prescribed analgesics or benzodiazepines.)

For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items, and 16 general psychopathology scale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive Sub-scale Score by Week</title>
        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS positive subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 positive scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 positive symptom constructs are delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS Positive Subscale ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms).</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in PANSS Positive Sub-scale Score by Week</title>
          <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS positive subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 positive scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 positive symptom constructs are delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS Positive Subscale ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in PANSS Negative Sub-scale Score by Week</title>
        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS negative subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 negative scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 negative symptom constructs: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive apathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking. The PANSS Negative Subscale ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms).</description>

            <description>All participants began open-label treatment with 30 mg aripiprazole on the first day of participation in the current trial. Once a participant stabilized at the 30 mg per day dose, the study physician could adjust the dose within the range of 10 to 30 mg per day as needed (throughout this long-term trial), to manage adverse events.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) by Week</title>
        <description>The severity of illness for each participant was rated using the CGI-S scale. To assess CGI-S, the study physician answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not ill at all; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

            <description>All participants began open-label treatment with 30 mg aripiprazole on the first day of participation in the current trial. Once a participant stabilized at the 30 mg per day dose, the study physician could adjust the dose within the range of 10 to 30 mg per day as needed (throughout this long-term trial), to manage adverse events.</description>

        <description>The efficacy of trial medication were rated for each participant using the CGI-I scale. The study physician must rate the participant's total improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment. All responses were compared to the participant's condition at baseline. Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 =very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5
=minimally worse; 6 = much worse; and 7 = very much worse.</description>

Once a participant stabilized at the 30 mg per day dose, the study physician could adjust the dose within the range of 10 to 30 mg per day as needed (throughout this long-term trial), to manage adverse events.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in participants with mood disorders. The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms. 1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60. The usual cut-off points are: 0 to 6 = normal/ symptom absent, 7 to 19 = mild depression, 20 to 34 = moderate depression, &gt;34 = severe depression.</description>

            <description>All participants began open-label treatment with 30 mg aripiprazole on the first day of participation in the current trial. Once a participant stabilized at the 30 mg per day dose, the study physician could adjust the dose within the range of 10 to 30 mg per day as needed (throughout this long-term trial), to manage adverse events.</description>

This scale contains 10 items: Gait, Arm dropping, Shoulder shaking, Elbow rigidity, Wrist rigidity, Head rotation, Glabella Tap, Tremor, Salivation, Akathisia. Grade of severity of each item is rated using a 5-point scale, 1 (normal) and 5 (most severe). The total score ranges from 10 to 50. Negative changes from baseline indicate an improvement, with higher negative values indicating better improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale Score (BARS) Total Score by Week</title>
        <description>BARS consisted of 4 items: objective observation of akathisia by study physician, subjective feelings of restlessness by participant, participant distress due to akathisia, global evaluation of akathisia. The first 3 items were rated on a 4-point scale: 0 = absence of symptoms to 3 = severe condition. The global clinical evaluation were made on a 6-point scale, (0=absent, 1=questionable, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, 5=severe). Participants were observed while they were seated and then stood for a minimum of 2 minutes in each position. Symptoms observed in other situations (e.g., while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity on the ward) may also be rated. Subjective phenomena were elicited by direct questioning. The BARS Global Score was derived from the global clinical assessment of akathisia from the BARS panel. Total score ranges from 0 to 14. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement, with higher negative values indicating better improvement.</description>

            <description>All participants began open-label treatment with 30 mg aripiprazole on the first day of participation in the current trial. Once a participant stabilized at the 30 mg per day dose, the study physician could adjust the dose within the range of 10 to 30 mg per day as needed (throughout this long-term trial), to manage adverse events.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale Score (AIMS) Total Score by Week</title>
        <description>The AIMS assessment consisted of 10 items describing symptoms of dyskinesia. Facial and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk movements (item 7) were observed unobtrusively while the participant was at rest (e.g., in the waiting room), and the study physician would make global judgments on the participant's dyskinesia's (items 8 through 10). For this scale, the participant was seated on a hard, firm chair. These items are rated on a five-point scale: 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 40. Negative changes from baseline indicate an improvement, with higher negative values indicating better improvement.</description>

            <description>All participants began open-label treatment with 30 mg aripiprazole on the first day of participation in the current trial. Once a participant stabilized at the 30 mg per day dose, the study physician could adjust the dose within the range of 10 to 30 mg per day as needed (throughout this long-term trial), to manage adverse events.</description>
