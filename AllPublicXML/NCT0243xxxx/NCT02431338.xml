  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of remote ischemic
      conditioning as an adjunct to primary percutaneous coronary intervention from the perspective
      of a Danish healthcare system.

    <description>Data for the economic evaluation are collected from Danish nationwide registries and validated with medical record review. Charges from the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) and the Danish Ambulatory Grouping System /DAGS) are used to calculate total cardiovascular medical care costs in the two treatment groups.</description>
