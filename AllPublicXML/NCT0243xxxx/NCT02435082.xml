  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this patient registry is to collect and analyze physiological data
      associated with baseline and brain injury identified in standard clinical practice (Normal
      Values, Recovery Curves, Correlation between Symptoms and Other Tests, NCI Index), and to
      assess health economics.

      The key aims of the VARIA Registry are to determine the real-life testing patterns and
      clinical outcomes of newly diagnosed patients with brain injury.

      In accordance with the primary objective, the study will collect and analyze physiological
      data associated with brain injury identified in normal clinical practice with specific
      reference to:

        -  Patient demographics, symptoms, NCI Index, and other test results,

        -  Baseline ranges by demographic group,

        -  Post-injury patients presenting without a baseline test to be assessed in the context of
           the norms for similar patients,

        -  Recovery curves by demographic,

        -  Health Economics.

      This registry will be a prospective observational study to collect data to describe the
      real-life testing patterns and clinical outcomes of newly diagnosed patients with brain
      injury.
