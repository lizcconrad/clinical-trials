  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether nicorandil as an adjunctive therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
      reduces reperfusion injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reperfusion injury might occur in patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial
      infarction undergoing the primary percutaneous coronary intervention(P-PCI),characterized by
      myocardial stunning, reperfusion-induced arrhythmia, microvascular dysfunction and myocardial
      cellular apoptosis, etc.

      Nicorandil is an antianginal agent with a dual mechanism of action: nitrate and K+ATP channel
      opener. The nitrate action causes vasodilation of systemic veins and epicardial coronary
      arteries, while the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel opener action
      causes vasodilation of peripheral and coronary resistance arterioles. Nicorandil not only
      decreases preload and afterload but also increases coronary blood flow.

      The study will compare the effectiveness between nicorandil and placebo of preventing the
      reperfusion injury and left ventricle remodeling in patients with acute ST segment elevation
      myocardial infarction undergoing the P-PCI.It is intended that before reperfusion injury
      ,nicorandil which was early used by intracoronary injection could prevent and release the
      microcirculatory spasm, release the coronary microvascular endothelial swelling,decrease
      embolism of atherosclerotic debris and thrombus formation.So,it could decrease the phenomenon
      of no-reflow/slow reflow,reperfusion-induced arrhythmia and worsening of chest pain.

    <time_frame>24hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary composite endpoint consisted of reperfusion-induced arrhythmia, worsening of chest pain, and no-reflow/slow reflow.
In perioperative period,we will observe whether the reperfusion-induced arrhythmia including atrial or ventricular premature beats,atrial or ventricular tachycardia, atrial or ventricular fibrillation, and atrioventricular block appears;whether the severity of chest pain is aggravated,and the number of episodes of chest pain will be recorded for patients who complains of chest pain that lasted for at least 30 min within the 24 h following onset of MI;Whether the phenomenon of no-reflow/slow reflow appears.No-reflow and slow flow are diagnosed when the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction(TIMI) flow grade is 2 or lower,despite successful PCI such as balloon angioplasty or stent insertion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the combined outcome of TIMI frame count (cTFC) of CAG and ST resolution (STR) of ECG</measure>
    <time_frame>24hours</time_frame>
    <description>The cTFC was measured according to the method of Gibson et al, to determine blood flow at the time of coronary angiography. The cine frame counts derived from the injection of contrast medium to the peripheral landmark were measured .
In order to evaluate STR, the total sum of the ST segments elevation from the J point to the point reached 20ms later was calculated from the 12-lead ECG recorded before the start of reperfusion, and 90 min after the completion of reperfusion. The rate of improvement in ST elevation was classified as &quot;complete resolution&quot; (70% or more improvement) and &quot;no resolution&quot; (&lt;70%).</description>
