        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, for the evaluation of System
             Accuracy also healthy subjects

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  Signed and dated informed consent form

          -  For small modifications of the insulin doses to achieve certain blood glucose values
             (System Accuracy evaluation): Male or female subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1
             with intensified insulin therapy (intensified conventional therapy - I.C.T.) or
             insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion - C.S.I.I.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactation period

          -  Severe acute illness that, in the opinion of the investigating physician, might
             confound the results of the test or which could result in a risk to the subject caused
             by the test.

          -  Severe chronic illness besides Diabetes mellitus as assessed by the investigating
             physician that might confound the results of the test or which could result in a risk
             to the subject caused by the test.

          -  Mental incapacity or language barriers precluding adequate compliance with the test
             procedures

          -  Legal incompetence or limited legal competence

          -  Dependency from the Sponsor or the clinical Investigator (e.g. co-workers of the
             Sponsor or the clinical research centre)

          -  For User Performance evaluation: Subjects having participated in a study with
             Omnitest® 5 before.

          -  For System Accuracy evaluation: subjects intended to provide blood samples with
             glucose concentrations between 50 and 80 mg/dl must not have coronary heart disease,
             myocardial infarction in history, cerebral events in history, peripheral artery
             occlusive disease or impaired hypoglycaemia awareness

          -  Anamnestically relevant amounts of interfering substances in the blood, following
             labelling in the instructions for use as reviewed and evaluated by a physician during
             screening.
