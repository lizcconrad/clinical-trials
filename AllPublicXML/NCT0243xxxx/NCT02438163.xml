  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroplasticity is supposed to be altered in patients suffering from a Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD). Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is a medical device which measures cerebral
      plasticity. Several parameters of cortical excitability are available for that purpose. These
      parameters are altered on patients wth MDD and these modifications are corrected after
      treatment. Therefore results in the studies are very heterogeneous. Theta Burst Stimulation
      (TBS) is a type a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) protocol and can induce cerebral
      plasticity. The cerebral plasticity induced by TBS was measured on a group of patients
      suffering from Asperger's disease (ASD) versus a control group. The plasticity was
      significantly different in patients with ASD. The aim of our study is to study the
      neuroplasticity induced by TBS on a patients with MDD.

      The study is lead with patients suffering from a MDD. All patients are drug free. Patients
      are compared to a control group of healthy subjects The protocol has 2 sessions. During the
      first session, After determining the parameters of stimulation (stimulated target : part of
      the left motor cortex responsible for the contraction of the right first dorsal interosseous
      muscle ; Activity Motor Threshold (AMT) ; Intensity of Stimulation providing a Motor Evoked
      Potential (MEP) with an Amplitude of 1mV (MEP 1mV)), a Baseline consisting of 15 MEP
      (intensity MEP 1mV) is measured. Then each subjet receive a TBS protocol (cTBS or iTBS)
      (intensity of stimulation 80% of AMT). After receiving the stimulation, sets containing 10
      MEP are regularly measured by each subject.

      During a second session, the same protocol is done again with the other TBS stimulation (cTBS
      or iTBS) the subject didn't get during the first session.

      A neuronavigation device is used to determine precisely the area of stimulation.
