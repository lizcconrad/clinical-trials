    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the effectiveness of Exergaming for Health, a community-based multifaceted
      weight management program in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Primary objective: to
      assess impact of the program on BMI z-scores. Secondary objectives: to measure impact on
      cardiovascular fitness, self-worth, sedentary screen time, and the influence of exergaming
      component on attendance and participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty-four overweight pediatric subjects will be enrolled sequentially and randomized 2:1 in
      experimental and control groups for six months of weight management programming. The
      experimental group and their parents/guardians will participate in ten weekly 2-hour
      sessions, comprised of 1 hour of exergaming or exergaming combined with traditional exercise
      and 1 hour of didactic classes focusing on nutrition and psychosocial behaviors related to
      weight management. Following these 10 weeks, they will attend monthly 1-hour maintenance
      didactic classes. The control group and their parents/guardians will participate only in the
      didactic portion of the curricula for the same duration of time, 10 weeks, followed by
      monthly maintenance classes for the remainder of the 6 month period. The control group will
      then be offered participation in the Exergaming for Health program upon study completion.

      Comparisons between the two groups will be obtained through changes in the measurements of
      weight, height, BMI z-scores, shuttle run times, and responses to questionnaires about screen
      time, self-perception, and nutrition. Measurements of both groups will be obtained at
      baseline and 6 months and another set of measurements will be obtained on the experimental
      group at 12 months.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects were asked to dress in light athletic clothing and have their weight and height measured at baseline (the first group session) and at 6 months. Research assistants were trained using guidelines from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Anthropometry Procedures Manual and demonstrated accurate measures on 3 separate children. The Seca 217 portable stadiometer was used for all height measurements and the HealthOMeter 844 KL scale was used for all weight measurements. BMI z-scores were calculated using software available from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute (http://stokes.chop.edu/web/zcore).</description>

    <description>The experimental group will answer a questionnaire at the end of the 6 month study period, measuring the importance of specific components of the curriculum and motivators which influenced enrollment and compliance with participation. Of interest is measuring the influence of the exergaming curriculum as compared to these other factors.

Research assistants were trained using guidelines from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Anthropometry Procedures Manual and demonstrated accurate measures on 3 separate children. The Seca 217 portable stadiometer was used for all height measurements and the HealthOMeter 844 KL scale was used for all weight measurements. BMI z-scores were calculated using software available from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute (http://stokes.chop.edu/web/zcore).</description>

        <description>CY-PSPP questionnaire was completed by participants in both groups at baseline and at 6 months. Change in the Physical Self-worth scores, which was 1 of 6 sub-domains, is analyzed. This sub-domain contains 6 questions with responses ranging from 1-4 for each question with 1 being the minimum and 4 being the maximum (best) score. The sub-domain score is then calculated as the mean of the 6 responses (minimum to maximum of 1 to 4).The change in score from baseline to 6 months was compared.</description>

        <title>Exergaming Program Component Influence on Attendance</title>
        <description>The experimental group will answer a questionnaire at the end of the 6 month study period, measuring the importance of specific components of the curriculum and motivators which influenced enrollment and compliance with participation. Of interest is measuring the influence of the exergaming curriculum as compared to these other factors. This is a 16-item, 3-point Likert-scale (1 = least important and 3 = most important) questionnaire created specifically for this study. Results were reported based on % of participants rating &quot;3&quot; ,most important, for each curriculum component.</description>
