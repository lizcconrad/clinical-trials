    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the use of the radiofrequency-guided localization in
      patients with abnormal breast tissue undergoing lumpectomy (a type of breast-sparing
      surgery). The radiofrequency identification localization system consists of an implantable
      radiofrequency identification tag and a hand-held radiofrequency reader to mark abnormal
      breast tissue before surgery and later surgically retrieve them. Radiofrequency-guided
      localization may make it easier to find and remove abnormal breast tissue during lumpectomy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain human clinical data in order to demonstrate that the Radiofrequency
      Identification (RFID) Localization System performs as intended as a localization device for
      marking and retrieving a surgical target in the breast.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To solicit feedback from the radiologists and surgeons regarding the process and use of
      the RFID system.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiofrequency-guided localization comprising RFID tag placement before
      lumpectomy and interactive detection of tag using RFID reader during lumpectomy.
