      This trial will be conducted to further evaluate, in a controlled setting, potential cardiac
      effects of an anticipated therapeutic and supra-therapeutic dose of BI 409306 under resting
      and exercise conditions. Since the drug is being developed in part for a disease with an
      expectedly high number of elderly (AD), the characterization of cardiac safety of BI 409306
      is considered to be important for the development of this compound.

        Inclusion criteria:

        - Healthy males according to the following criteria: Based upon a complete medical history,
        including the physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG, and clinical
        laboratory tests.

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

             failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. A list of
             contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in the subject information.

        Exclusion criteria:

             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator

               -  Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or more than140 mmHg

               -  Diastolic blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg or more than 90 mmHg

               -  Pulse rate less than 45 bpm or more than 90 bpm

             suicidal thought, active suicidal thought with method, active suicidal thought with
