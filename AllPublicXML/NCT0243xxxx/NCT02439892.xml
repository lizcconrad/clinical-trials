  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC) suffer from severe side-effects such as pain
      and difficulties in swallowing, often leading to weight loss. More than 70 % of the weight
      loss is attributed to lean muscle wasting that is associated with decline in physical
      function, substantial fatigue and significantly decreased quality of life. Rehabilitation
      that includes physical exercise, nutritional counselling and oral nutritional supplements
      (ONS) can potentially reduce or prevent muscle wasting. The primary aim of this pilot
      randomised trial is to assess feasibility, evaluate patient experiences and assess
      preliminary effects on muscle mass, physical function, nutritional status and quality of life
      of rehabilitation interventions during and after radiotherapy (RT). Newly diagnosed HNC
      patients referred for curative RT with or without chemotherapy, will be randomised to a)
      rehabilitation during RT or b) rehabilitation after RT. Rehabilitation during RT will be
      carried out at an outpatient facility during the treatment period (6-7 weeks) and
      rehabilitation after RT will be carried at a rehabilitation centre and last for 3 weeks.

    <description>The intervention consists of physical exercise, nutritional counselling and supplements. The exercise sessions will be conducted twice a week for 30 minutes each time during the RT treatment period, and include a main part of progressive resistance training (PRT). The PRT will be conducted by conventional upper and lower body exercises at a load of 60 - 80 % of 1 repetition maximum (RM) in 3-4 sets of 6-12 repetitions. The patients will receive nutritional information and dietary advice, and up to 2 energy dense oral nutritional supplements (ONS) daily. A nutrition interview will be conducted at study baseline and individual goals and targets will be set during the first counselling and monitored during the intervention period.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of physical exercise, nutritional counselling and supplements and patient education. The exercise sessions will be conducted 3 times a week for 45 minutes each time during the 3 week rehabilitation programme, and include a main part of progressive resistance training (PRT). PRT will be conducted as described in the intervention during treatment. The nutritional intervention will be carried out as described in the intervention during treatment. Patient education will be run as 45-60 minutes lecture/group discussion on relevant topics, lead by health professionals.</description>
