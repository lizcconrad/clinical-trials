  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance is a major public health issue as multiresistant bacteria (MRB) are
      increasing. Among the actions to control resistance, one is an interesting lead: to prevent
      the emergence of resistant bacteria by limiting possibilities for bacteria to acquire
      resistance. Mechanisms of resistance genes acquisition are deeply studied but there are few
      data on the dynamic of acquisition over time. Among the genetic components that disseminate
      resistance genes, resistance integrons (RI) play a major role in the acquisition and
      dissemination of antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria. The digestive tract of the
      newborn (NB), which is initially sterile, is colonized by a bacterial microbiota during the
      first days of life. It thus appears to be an appropriate model to study the dynamic of
      resistance acquisition. This project intends to follow the NB of neonatology over time in
      order to study the dynamic of the digestive acquisition of RI and MRB

      The meconium or the first stool will be sampled at D0. The stool will then be sampled: at D7,
      at D21 and every 15 days until the day of discharge.

      If the NB has no stool on the given day, a period of 3 more days will be accepted from the
      day the sampling was planned. After this period, &quot;no sample&quot; will be stated.

      Meconiums and stool must be sampled in sterile jars, labelled and sent with the designation
      &quot;DAIR3N protocol&quot; to the bacteriology laboratory of each center. If the local laboratory
      cannot seed the samples 7 days a week, stool samples can be kept maximum 48h at +4°C before
      management.

      In the mother

      Vaginal sample will be taken during the delivery according to care practices of each center
      if:

      it is a preterm vaginal delivery, early membrane rupture happens, there is a threat of very
      preterm delivery. About 55% of inclusions should be subject to this type of sampling.
      Sampling of mother's stool will be asked at the inclusion.
