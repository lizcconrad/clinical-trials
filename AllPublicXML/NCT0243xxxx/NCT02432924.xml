  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to examine whether the provision of personalised
      multidimensional physical activity profiles (derived from technological advances in physical
      activity monitoring) is supported by instantaneous physical activity feedback in fostering a
      meaningful change in physical activity behaviour amongst adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advancements in monitoring technology not only permit the accurate capture of sophisticated
      physical activity information but also enable the provision of bespoke multidimensional
      feedback. Personalised feedback, self-monitoring and goal-setting are techniques that have
      been shown to be very effective in supporting a change in behaviour through improved
      motivation and awareness. To date the feedback provided in physical activity interventions
      invariably focuses on just one aspect of the behaviour and has had mixed results. Pedometers
      for example with a sole focus on the number of steps one takes has been shown to be a
      reasonably effective form of instant feedback in the short-term but its effects are rarely
      sustained after the device is removed. Tailored information about the achievement of 30
      minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activity is also only partially effective. One of
      the reasons might be that in focusing on just one aspect becomes prescriptive and doesn't
      allow individuals to explore the other important aspects that might be more aligned to their
      interests, needs and preferences. Having such narrow focused goals and information would
      likely frustrate rather than support an individual's needs for autonomy and competence, which
      is thought to be crucial in the adoption and maintenance of a new behaviour.

      In this research, we want to find out whether the provision of both instantaneous and
      multidimensional personalised feedback about the different health-harnessing aspects of
      physical activity is effective in supporting adults in making a meaningful change to their
      physical activity behaviour. The study will take a mixed methods approach which will involve
      two phases. Phase 1 will involve a 2 group randomised control trial that will examine the use
      of combined instantaneous and multidimensional feedback over a 6-week period with a further
      follow-up outcome assessment a further 6-weeks after the intervention has finished. The
      second phase will involve a short one-to-one semi structured interview with each intervention
      participant that will be designed to qualitatively explore the preferred features of the
      intervention that were most effective for motivating and supporting a change in behaviour
      and/or to understand why it wasn't effective if applicable. The qualitative interviews will
      take place after the 6-week follow-up assessments have been completed so not to influence the
      results of any outcome measures.

    <measure>Change in physical activity level (PAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean physical activity level (PAL) as calculated using the formula average daily total energy expenditure/basal metabolic rate (Kcal). Minute by minute energy expenditure (TEE) will be objective measured using the SenseWear Armband (Bodymedia, software version 8.0). For assessment, monitors will be initialised with each individual's personal information (age, gender, height, and weight) and participants will be advised on how to fit and wear the devices. Participants will be asked to wear the monitor(s) for 7 days (including while sleeping) and will be asked to remove the monitors briefly for showers or water activities. As well as PAL the energy expenditure assessment will be used to determine total and average daily minutes of light intensity activity (greater than 1.5METs) moderate intensity activity (greater than 3METs); vigorous intensity activity (greater than 6 METs), accumulated moderate to vigorous activity bouts of 10 minutes and daily sedentary time.</description>

    <description>Motivation for physical activity will be assessed using an adapted version of the behavioural regulations for exercise questionnaire (BREQ-2, Markland and Tobin, 2004).</description>

    <measure>Need satisfaction</measure>

    <measure>Vitality</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Risk of Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular disease will be calculated at http://qintervention.org/ and be ascertained from measurements of glucose and insulin control, C-Reactive Protein, fasting lipid profile (HDL:LDL ratio; total cholesterol and triglyceride) in the blood and height, weight, waist circumference, smoking status, blood pressure and familial history of CVD or diabetes. All of these measurements will be collected at the 3 assessment time points.</description>

    <description>Participants randomised into the intervention group will be invited to return to the university for a one-off 60 minute set-up session once their physical activity monitor has been returned and processed. Within this session the participant will be given detailed instructions on how to use and wear the activity monitor and real time display and upload their data to and navigate the multidimensional feedback web platform (See materials section for details). They will also be introduced to the concept of goal setting and talked through the different aspects of the instantaneous feedback display and how that might benefit them. Following this visit the participant will be given licence to wear and use the physical activity monitoring devices for a 6-week period and encouraged to self-monitor their behaviour using the combined instantaneous and multidimensional feedback.</description>

    <description>Participants who have been randomised into the control arm will be put on a 3 month waiting list to receive the intervention described above. They will still attend assessment visits at week 6 and week 12 while they are not receiving any advice or feedback. Following their 12 week assessment, participants in the control arm will be invited to attend the same 60 minute set-up session as received by the intervention group and then provided with the armband monitor and display to then receive the intervention in full. No further post-intervention or follow-up assessments will be taken from these participants.</description>
