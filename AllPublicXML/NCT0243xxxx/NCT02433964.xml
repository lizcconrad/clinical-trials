      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the LED (627 +/- 10 nm)
      with respect to the localized pain and local swelling of ankle sprains in the initial phase.

    <textblock>
      A variety of therapies for the treatment of sprains has emerged as they occur advances in
      technological applications. Therapy with coherent and non-coherent light is a treatment
      modality for a variety of musculoskeletal injuries. The main benefits certificates for
      phototherapy are the reduction of nociceptive processes, tissue remodeling, among others. The
      aim of the present paper is to analyze the changes caused by the use of LED (627 +/- 10 nm)
      with an energy density of 10 J / cm2 in 40 subjects divided into two groups (placebo and
      LED). All volunteers participating in this study had ankle inversion sprain grade II treated
      with the price technique. The study was performed in six days. And the results were verified
      by review of all individuals, through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain, McGill Pain
      Questionnaire and Titrimetry. Measurements were performed at first, third and sixth day's of
      treatment.

    <description>Treated by a device LED - LED: power 60mW, 627nm wavelength ± 10nm and 1,3cm2 beam output. The energy density used was 10J / cm2 with time of 2 minutes and 47 seconds per flash of the beam, which is unique for each ten points in the lateral region of the ankle edema. The volunteers underwent previous cleaning application points with cotton soaked in 70% alcohol, positioned for high stretcher in the supine position and wearing goggles. The LED was applied in a timely manner, wherein the skin contact surfasse at an angle of 90 °, the ten points were irradiated in a 1cm2 area selected by a single investigator. One session was performed every 24 hours for six consecutive days. Ice applications were made associated with semi-rigid compression bandage, with the patient lying supine and the affected limb in elevation under a foam wedge in the same period.</description>
