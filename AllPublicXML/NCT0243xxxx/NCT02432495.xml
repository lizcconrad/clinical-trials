  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of type II odontoid fractures in geriatric trauma victims remains a source of
      substantial controversy. The purpose of this study was to compare anterior screw fixation
      with halo-vest-immobilization in patients with type II odontoid fractures.
