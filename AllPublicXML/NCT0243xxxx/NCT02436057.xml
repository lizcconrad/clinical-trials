  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through a four-year grant awarded to the University of California at Los Angeles in 2009, Dr.
      Brennan Spiegel served as a principal investigator (PI) for a project to develop and
      initially validate a bank of items to assess gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms for the National
      Institutes of Health's (NIH's) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
      (PROMIS). By the end of the grant period in July 2013, the project team had successfully
      developed and initially validated eight scales measuring the most common GI symptoms.

      Afterwards, Dr. Spiegel's PROMIS team joined forces with the UCLA Computing Technology
      Research Laboratory (CTRL) and the University of Michigan Center for Healthcare Communication
      Research to develop the Automated Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms (AEGIS) algorithm
      which is delivered via My GI Health, an open-‐source Internet based patient-provider portal
      (P3) designed to enhance the delivery of GI health care (www.MyGIHealth.org). Through My GI
      Health and AEGIS, patients are able to complete PROMIS GI symptom measures and provide
      additional information about their GI symptoms and histories from computers, tablets or smart
      phones without the constraints of physical locale. This information is condensed into a GI
      PROMIS scores report and initial GI history that patients' providers can review prior to or
      concurrent with seeing the patient. The report, which can be incorporated into the electronic
      health record (EHR), helps busy clinicians to quickly understand the patient's complaints,
      document their symptoms and GI history, and leaves more time for conversation with the
      patient.

      Beyond focusing their interaction, My GI Health also supports both the clinician and patient
      with an individualized &quot;educational prescription&quot; which guides the patient through a library
      of multi‐media educational materials on GI symptoms, conditions, and treatments also
      contained within the website. The prescription is initially created by the website based on
      each patient's unique GI PROMIS &quot;fingerprint&quot;, and can be modified by the provider based on
      their interaction with the patient. The clinician and patient can also access the
      PROMIS-tailored education in the exam room to jointly review pertinent materials, including
      animations of normal and abnormal GI functions, further reinforcing the patients' educational
      experiences around the PROMIS symptoms.

      The aim of this current study is to validate the use of GI PROMIS in clinical practice by
      conducting a pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) comparing delivery of GI PROMIS on a novel
      e--platform vs. usual care.
