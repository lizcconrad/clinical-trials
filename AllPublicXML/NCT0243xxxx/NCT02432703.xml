  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of JNJ-42165279 during 12 weeks of
      treatment in participants with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      Investigator nor the participants know about the study intervention), placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multi-center study of JNJ-42165279 in participants with social anxiety
      disorder. Participants will receive 25 milligram (mg) JNJ-42165279 or matching placebo orally
      once-daily from Day 1 up to 12 weeks. Participants will primarily be assessed for the change
      from baseline in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) at Week 12. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A) is a 14-item scale designed to measure anxiety in individuals. Each question reflects a symptom of anxiety and physical as well as mental symptoms are represented. The answers range from 0 which signifies a complete lack of that symptom to 4, which indicates a very severe show of anxiety with that symptom. The total score ranges from 0 to 56, where higher score indicates worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAM-A6) is a 6-item subscale derived from the original Hamilton Anxiety scale (HAM-A). It comprises five psychic anxiety symptoms: anxious mood, psychic tension, fears, intellectual disturbances, and anxious behavior observed at the interview, as well as one somatic item, muscular tension, with a total score range of 0 to 24. The rating scale measures the severity of anxiety symptomatology. Higher scores represent more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
