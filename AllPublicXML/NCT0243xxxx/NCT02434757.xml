    <textblock>
      This small study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Acthar as an adjunct therapy in
      patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to disease
      modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and at least 3 biologic agents. An in adequate
      response is defined as having ≥ 6 tender joints, ≥ 6 swollen joints, plus C-Reactive Protein
      (CRP) levels and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of ≥ 1.2 times the upper limit of
      normal in spite of aggressive treatment, including ≥ 7.5 mg/d prednisone. This will be a 20
      week, prospective, multicenter, open-label study conducted at 3-4 university/medical centers
      and private practice settings in the US. A total of 20 eligible patients will be enrolled and
      other standard RA therapeutic agents, such as Methotrexate, DMARDs, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), pain medications and others will not be discontinued. The
      primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients with reduction of ≥1.2 points of the
      Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS-28) score.
