  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are

        -  to test the hypothesis that elimination or reduction of dietary animal proteins leads to
           an improved prognosis in tumor patients

        -  to estimate the effect size and thus to enable sample size calculations for further
           studies

        -  to test the feasibility and tolerance of different diets, especially a vegan diet, in
           cancer patients and to proof that a vegan diet does not lead to a deterioration of
           health, tumor progression or to malnutrition

        -  to test the online platform as a study platform

        -  to test validity of self reported and online generated data

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participating cancer patients select one of 3 defined diets
      (omnivor/lacto-ovo-vegetarian/vegan) at baseline and will continue their prescribed
      oncological therapy at their attending physician/clinic.

      Participants provide data (cancer history, tumor behavior, food frequency questionnaires,
      questionnaires referring to quality-of-life) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months with optional
      data entry points at 12 and 124 months and a follow up questionnaire at 12 and 24 months.
      Data is entered online via the study platforms www.essenundkrebs.net and
      www.foodandcancer.net in German and English language (no additional clinical visits are
      required).

    <measure>Number / percentage of remissions</measure>

    <description>Percentages of remissions as defined be complete absence of a tumor - in an ITT (intention to treat) analysis</description>

    <measure>Tumor diagnosis and tumor behaviour (complete remission / partial remission / no change / progression)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 months (optional: 12 and 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>In the fist questionnaire, tumor history (diagnosis, classification, stage, previous therapy) is entered. At months 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 tumor stage at present time is asked again. Comparing the staging between time points, tumor behaviour is categorized into four groups: complete remission / partial remission / no change / tumor progression. This will be determined for each participant by two investigator independently.</description>

    <measure>Relapse-free interval</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>

    <time_frame>0, 3 and 6 months (optional: 12 and 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The study questionnaire contains questions referring frequently occuring symptoms in cancer patients and wether they are related to a certain therapy or to other factors.

    <time_frame>0, 3 and 6 months (optional: 12 and 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The study questionnaire contains questions referring quality of live covering the Karnofsky Index, but additional dimensions, too (psychosocial wellbeing).</description>

There is a categorical question asking for dietary patterns as well a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire especially adopted for discrimination of plant an animal derived foods.
In addition to the main study questionnaires, participants are asked to report any unplanned change in their diet during study participation.</description>

    <time_frame>3 and 6 months (optional: 12 and 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The results referring to nutrition and dietary patterns are evaluated in terms of change and duration of change in dietary patterns (in months).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
