    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identification of neuropsychological, genetic and
      neuroimaging markers and treatment response predictors of attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). Participants who take the standardized pharmacotherapy (methylphenidate or
      atomoxetine) for ADHD will be observed for 52 weeks. They will do several neuropsychological,
      neuroimaging and genetic tests at visit 1~6.
