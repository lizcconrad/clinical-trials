    <textblock>
      This observational, noninterventional study is designed to further characterize the
      effectiveness and safety profile of vismodegib (Erivedge) in Argentine patients. Only
      patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) or metastatic basal cell
      carcinoma (mBCC) will be considered in the effectiveness analysis. Study duration is
      estimated to be approximately 12 months.

    <description>Patients who are prescribed vismodegib in Argentina, according to standard of care and in line with the current SPC and local labeling, are eligible for observation. Dosing and treatment duration of vismodegib are at the discretion of the physician in accordance with local clinical practice and local labeling. Only patients with laBCC or mBCC will be considered in the effectiveness analysis.</description>

        The study population is characterized by patients who are prescribed vismodegib in
        Argentina, according to standard of care and in line with the current SPC and local
        labeling. Data collection will be prospective except in the cases when a treating physician
        contacts the vendor for the first time after the patient has started treatment with
        vismodegib. In these cases the vendor will retrospectively collect data from the start of
        treatment. Only patients with laBCC or mBCC will be considered in the effectiveness
        analysis.
