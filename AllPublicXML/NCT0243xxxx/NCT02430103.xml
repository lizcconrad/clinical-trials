      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist
      (goserelin) on the preservation of ovarian reserve function in breast cancer patients of
      reproductive age treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy by serial measuring the biochemical
      marker AMH pre and post chemotherapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      6.6-12% of women with breast cancer were diagnosed before the age of 40 year and breast
      cancer accounted for 40% of all cancer in women before the age of 40 year.Attributed to
      improved treatment, of which chemotherapy plays a major role, more than 70% of breast cancer
      patients at reproductive age obtain 10-year survival rates. Consequently, the question of
      pregnancy and premature ovarian failure after breast cancer treatment are presented more
      frequently. Fortunately, most of the available literature provides good evidence that
      pregnancy after breast cancer may improve survival. Unfortunately, no therapy has been shown
      to preserve fertility in patients receiving chemotherapy so far, although chemotherapy
      induced ovarian failure ,which finally results in infertility and premature ovarian failure,
      has been reported 60 years before. The greater rate of prepubertal than of postpubertal women
      with normal ovarian function after chemotherapy supports the concept that the suppressed
      ovary has a greater tolerance during cytotoxic treatments.While inhibiting the pituitary
      ovarian axis, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is thought to block follicular
      development and reduce chemotherapy toxicity. Several studies had revealed GnRHa co-treatment
      yielded a statistically significant improvement in the proportion of spontaneous menstrual
      resumption after chemotherapy, compared to controls.It is noteworthy that menses and
      fertility are not necessarily linked. Absence of regular menses, particularly if the patient
      is taking tamoxifen(endocrine therapy for breast cancer), does not necessarily imply lack of
      fertility. Conversely, the presence of menses does not guarantee fertility.Currently,
      anti-Müllerian hormone(AMH) is considered as the best biochemical marker for assessment of
      reproductive capacity in reproductive medicine settings. Because it is produced by granulosa
      cells of growing antral follicles, AMH is significant positive correlation with both quantity
      and quality of oocytes. Moreover, it can be measured on any day for minimal fluctuation
      during the menstrual cycle.Antral follicle count (AFC) by vaginal ultrasound is also a good
      predictor of response to exogenous FSH and correlates independently with the number of
      oocytes retrieved during in vitro fertilization(IVF).This study is designed to make sure the
      effect of GnRHa on the preservation of ovarian reserve function in breast cancer patients at
      reproductive age treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy by observing the dynamic changes of
      AMH and AFC pre and post chemotherapy(1 week before chemotherapy, 2 weeks, half a year, 1
      year and 2 years following completion of chemotherapy) between two groups(one group will be
      treated with chemotherapy plus GnRHa, and the other one will be treated with chemotherapy
      merely), in order to provide more reliable evidence for GnRHa concerning preservation of
      ovarian reserve function. At present, there are few reported trials about it. This study is
      the first prospective study that focus on the premenopausal breast cancer patients who would
      like to preserve the ovarian function in China. The results will be more adaptable in China
      and other countries in Asia where breast cancer patients' age at diagnosis is younger. The
      outcome of this study may offer breast cancer patients at reproductive age hope of becoming
      mothers and possessing vigour of youth.
