  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate whether a bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV)
      manufactured by Beijing TiantanBio has a similar immunogenicity profile to a WHO
      pre-qualified bOPV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beijing TiantanBio has been one of the two suppliers of tOPV in China since 1985, with
      control of polio in China evidence of the effectiveness of its vaccine. The company plans to
      introduce a liquid formulation of bOPV (types 1 and 3) to meet increasing global demand with
      the phasing-out of tOPV. The proposed study is intended to provide data sufficient to obtain
      WHO prequalification for the TiantanBio bOPV, thus making the vaccine available to help meet
      global demand.

             before entering into the study.

          -  Parents willing to provide written informed consent.

          -  Age: infants less than 2 weeks of age at the time of enrollment (from the 1st through
             the 14th day of life, inclusive)

             product

          -  Presence of any significant systemic disorder (cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic,
             renal, gastrointestinal, hematological, endocrine, immunological, dermatological,
             neurological, cancer or autoimmune disease) as determined by medical history and/or
             physical examination which would compromise the child's health or is likely to result
             in nonconformance to the protocol

             on medical history and physical examination

          -  Previous receipt of poliovirus vaccine

          -  Household contact with a known immunosuppressed individual

          -  Unwillingness or inability of parents for active follow-up by the study staff

          -  History of any neurologic disorders or seizures

          -  Any medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would interfere with

             give informed consent

          -  Maternal HIV infection
