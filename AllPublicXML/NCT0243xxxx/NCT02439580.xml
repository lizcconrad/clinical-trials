  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annona muricata L., include the leaves, is found to contain biologically active Annonaceous
      acetogenins and plant polyphenols that are important components of human diet and a number of
      them are considered to have chemopreventive and therapeutic properties against cancer.

      To confirm previous findings in in vitro, animal study and traditionally use, a human, ex
      vivo and in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of consecutive ingestion of
      A. muricata leaves extract for eight weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive either A. muricata leaves
      extract or placebo. Dietary intakes and anthropometry were assessed with food record every
      two weeks. Blood parameters, nutritional status, quality of life, fecal butyrate level, and
      systemic inflammation of patient were assessed at the beginning and the end of study.
