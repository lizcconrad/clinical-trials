  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron) are highly effective medications for the treatment of nausea
      and vomiting. However, these medications also associated with potentially severe and
      life-threatening cardiac adverse drug reactions (ADRs), particularly QT prolongation. Data
      regarding the cardiac safety and inter-individual variability in cardiac effects of
      ondansetron when used in vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women are very
      limited. The results of this study will enable better-informed therapeutic decision-making
      regarding the use of ondansetron in children and pregnant women, with the overall goal to
      improve the safety of these commonly used antiemetic medications. Furthermore, predictive
      pharmacogenetic markers of severe 5-HT3 antagonist toxicity could be used to identify
      patients at risk of cardiac toxicity before the drug is administered.

      The specific objectives are to:

        1. Determine and compare the cardiac safety profile of ondansetron in children, when used
           for prevention and management of post-operative nausea and vomiting and chemotherapy
           induced nausea and vomiting. Identify clinical factors including pre-existing cardiac
           conditions or physiological conditions that predispose to ventricular arrhythmias,
           concomitant cardiotoxic chemotherapy or concomitant volatile anaesthetic agents and
           investigate their impact on cardiac adverse effects of ondansetron.

        2. Determine and compare the cardiac safety profile of ondansetron when used in pregnant
           women or women of a reproductive age for the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum or
           post-operative nausea and vomiting. Identify clinical factors including pre-existing
           cardiac conditions or physiological conditions, which predispose to ventricular
           arrhythmias that may support implementation of risk mitigation actions.

        3. Identify genetic variants associated with 5-HT3 antagonist-induced prolongation of QT
           interval.
