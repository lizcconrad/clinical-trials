  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uremic pruritus is a clinically significant symptom which imposes heavy impact on the quality
      of life of patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis. In order to
      investigate the clinical efficacy and mechanism, the investigators designed a multiple
      centers, randomized, assessor- and participant-blind, controlled, cross-over clinical trial.
      This trial will be conducted at Taichung branch, Feng-yuan branch and the Eastern branch of
      CMUH.

      We plan to enroll 200 volunteer patients with uremic pruritus. After the waiting period (as
      the waiting list group), you will be randomized to laser acupuncture and sham laser
      acupuncture group. Each group will include 100 patients and given intervention according to
      their hemodialysis frequency, i.e., BIW or TIW. The intervention will then be crossed over to
      the other one after 4 week of wash-our period. Outcome measurement includes questionnaires,
      biochemistry analysis, instrumental analysis and medication score.
