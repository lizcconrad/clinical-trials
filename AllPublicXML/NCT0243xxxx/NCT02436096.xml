  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of low-dose CBP dosed nightly at bedtime for FM was supported by the results of
      Tonix' TNX-CY-F202 Phase 2b study (also referred to as the BESTFIT Study). The TNX-CY-F202
      study provided strong evidence that TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg dosed nightly results in beneficial
      effects upon pain, sleep and other FM symptomatology.

      The present trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets,
      taken daily at bedtime over 12 weeks to treat fibromyalgia.
