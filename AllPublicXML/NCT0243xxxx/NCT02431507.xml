  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of the Magnap magnetic
      device in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnap is a magnet-activated treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) designed to be less
      invasive than reconstructive surgery, more tolerable than positive airway pressure, and more
      effective than non-invasive therapies for OSA. The Magnap device consists of a
      neodymium-iron-boron rare earth magnet with a ferromagnetic directional back-plate encased in
      titanium. The device will be implanted surgically on the hyoid bone. Following surgery, the
      patient is fitted with a custom, removable external neck accessory containing a second
      magnet, which is worn during sleep and prevents airway collapse by attracting the internal
      hyoid magnet with sufficient force to keep the airway open .

    <description>This is a non-randomized clinical trial.Patients 21-70 years diagnosed with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea will have the Magnap Magnetic Apnea Device surgically implanted on the subject's hyoid bone and used in conjunction with an external neck brace and magnet to open airway during sleep in treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea. We will monitor for safety, brace compliance and improvement of symptoms of sleep apnea for a total of 13 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is between 21 and â‰¤70 years of age

          -  Subject has moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (defined as apnea-hypopnea
             index of 15-50 events/hour on baseline/screening polysomnogram)

          -  Subject is intolerant of positive airway pressure therapy (defined as &lt;2 hours of
             sleep time with use per night for at least 5 nights per week as measured objectively
             by evaluation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine memory chip and
             interpreted by the study sleep medicine specialist)

          -  Subject signs and dates a written informed consent form and indicates understanding of
             the study procedures and risks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any evidence that apnea is not caused by base of tongue (i.e., central apnea,
             neurologic disorder, retropalatal collapse, nasal obstruction)

          -  Any condition likely requiring MRI or has a metal implant

          -  Any factor that, in the surgeon's judgment, would pose a risk to surgery or placement
             of a long-term implanted device

          -  Any factor that, in the surgeon's judgment, would make the subject unlikely to respond
             to Magnap treatment

          -  Congenital anomalies of the larynx, pharynx, or trachea or any other anatomical
             abnormality of the head, neck, or chest that would be a contraindication to placement
             of the Magnap device and usage of the external device

          -  There are no exclusion criteria based on gender, race or ethnicity
