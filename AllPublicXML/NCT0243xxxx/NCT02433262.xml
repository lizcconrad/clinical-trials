      Aim for this study is to measure the prevalence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) using
      World Health Organisation (WHO) versus International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy
      Study Group (IADPSG) criteria among pregnant mother in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical
      Centre (UKMMC)

      It will then be used to measure the incidence of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in
      women diagnosed with GDM using either of the criteria.

      Patients with risk factors for GDM will be recruited and randomised to either group once
      fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and agreed to join this study. Subjects will
      then undergo 75g oral glucose tolerance test and diagnosis will be established based on the
      group assigned.
