    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ramucirumab in
      participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and elevated baseline alpha-fetoprotein.
      Participants will be randomized to ramucirumab or placebo in a 2:1 ratio (Main Global Cohort
      and China Maximized Extended Enrollment {ME2} Cohort). Participants may also receive
      ramucirumab if eligible to be enrolled in Open-Label Expansion (OLE) Cohort.
