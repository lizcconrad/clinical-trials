  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine whether low‐fidelity instructor‐driven simulation can
      provide effective teaching of anesthetists' non‐technical skills in a developing world
      context. Human factors, such as communication, planning, and team working are considered
      nontechnical skills which contribute greatly to patient safety in &quot;complex hazardous systems&quot;
      such as aviation, nuclear power industry, and operating rooms. Simulation began in the
      aviation industry to train pilots in human factors. In the past two decades simulation has
      been valued in medical education as it allows the learner to rehearse skills in an
      environment that is similar to the workplace but without the threat of harm to patients. High
      Fidelity simulators involve computer driven interactive mannequins that recreate an authentic
      environment. This has been used successfully to teach anesthetists' non‐technical skills
      (ANTS) such as: decision making, team working, task management, and situation awareness.
      Anesthetists' non‐technical skills are particularly important in developing countries where
      the shortage of supplies, equipment, and qualified personnel can lead to a perilous working
      environment making team work and communication vital for patient safety. The costs of high
      fidelity simulation are prohibitive for many developing countries. This study seeks to
      examine whether low fidelity instructor driven simulation can provide an effective
      intervention to teach anesthetists' non‐technical skills in Rwanda. If found to be effective,
      this method of training could be applied to other developing countries to improve
      non‐technical skills for anesthesia providers with the goal of making surgery safer.
