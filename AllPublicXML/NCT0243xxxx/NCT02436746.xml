  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) are highly
      heterogeneous diseases. Cognitive features seem to vary widely even between family members
      carrying the same mutation. This phenotypic variability is not well understood, but is
      generally assumed to be caused by modifier genes which regulate the affected pathways.
      However, recent studies brought forward an alternative explanation for the phenotypic
      variability. Post-mortem studies showed that second hit mutations causing loss of the second
      ('healthy') allele are more widespread than previously believed. These loss of heterozygosity
      (LOH) mutations cause bi-allelic loss of the disease-linked gene and are known to cause the
      gross of somatic features in both diseases (like neurofibromas and hamartomas). Hence, it
      could be the stochastic occurrence of second-hit mutations in the brain are the cause of the
      variable cognitive phenotypes.

      To investigate to what extent these LOH mutations in the brain contribute to the phenotype
      and to what extent this variation is due to genetic modifiers factors is unknown. The
      investigators therefore propose to elucidate this variability by comparing the correlation of
      cognitive features of monozygotic twins with NF1 or TSC to healthy twins in the population.
      If modifier genes are the cause of the variability of cognitive features in NF1 and TSC the
      investigators expect that the variability in cognitive tests in monozygotic twins is the same
      as monozygotic twins in the healthy population. However, if the variability is caused by the
      occurrence of LOH mutations, the investigators expect to have a lower correlation in our
      monozygotic patients compared to the healthy twins.
