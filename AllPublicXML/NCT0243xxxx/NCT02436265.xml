  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal injection of local anesthetic is a neuraxial technique routinely performed on young
      children for postoperative analgesia after lower abdominal and lower extremity surgical
      procedures. One of the major limitations of the use of single shot neuraxial injections for
      this purpose is the limited duration of action of the injected local anesthetic. Adjuvant
      medications, such as clonidine and epinephrine, have been added to the local anesthetic to
      prolong the duration of the neuraxial block, with varying results. Dexamethasone is a
      synthetic glucocorticoid steroid commonly used in the perioperative setting for a multitude
      of indications, including the prolongation of local anesthetic based analgesia. It has been
      shown that the administration of dexamethasone either intravenously or via perineural
      injection can significantly increase the duration of analgesia derived from a local
      anesthesia based peripheral nerve block. Literature also suggests that the effect of
      dexamethasone is equivalent whether given intravenously or perineurally. Interest in
      dexamethasone enhanced caudal analgesia exists and a previous study noted that caudal
      anesthesia can be prolonged by intravenous dexamethasone. The study was criticized for using
      a higher dose of dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) than is routinely used in the pediatric population
      outside of airway procedures, which may expose patients to dose related side effects of
      dexamethasone. A large meta-analysis has suggested that 0.1 mg/kg is effective for analgesic
      prolongation, but no direct study of low dose intravenous dexamethasone in combination with
      caudal anesthesia has been performed.

      As dexamethasone is an inexpensive and commonly used medication, it would be beneficial to
      know if a similar prolongation of analgesia occurs when a local anesthetic is given
      neuraxially in combination with low dose intravenous dexamethasone. This project will
      investigate the efficacy of low dose intravenous (IV) dexamethasone in prolonging the
      duration of post operative analgesia provided by an intraoperative caudal injection of local
      anesthetic. All patients will be enrolled in the study the day of surgery, in the
      preoperative waiting area. The study will be explained by an anesthesiologist with extensive
      knowledge of the protocol. Computer randomization will occur for each patient. Randomization
      will not increase the risk to either group as all medications and techniques utilized for
      this study are commonly accepted for routine care for these patients.
