      This is an open label extension study in subjects who are 6 years of age or older with Sickle
      Cell Disease (SCD) who have completed the double blind Phase 3 study (B5201002). This study
      is designed to evaluate the safety and describe the efficacy of rivipansel as treatment for
      one or more vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) events in hospitalized subjects with SCD.

        Inclusion Criteria: Completion of Study B5201002. Documented diagnosis of SCD. At least 6
        years of age. Male and female subjects of childbearing potential and at risk for pregnancy
        must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study.
        Diagnosis of VOC necessitating IV opioids and admission to the hospital. Able to receive
        the first dose of rivipansel within 24 hours from administration of the first dose of IV
        opioids for this hospitalization.

        Exclusion Criteria: Non compliance with study procedures in the double blind study
        (B5201002). Occurrence of any severe and/or generalized cutaneous manifestation or any
        other adverse event during participation in Study B5201002 that was related to study drug
        and which would therefore make it inappropriate for the subject to receive rivipansel in
        the current study. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or
        laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
        study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results.
        Clinically significant deterioration in renal function in Study B5201002. Pregnant female
        subjects, breastfeeding female subjects and male and female subjects of childbearing
        potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception.
        Active use of illicit drugs and/or alcohol dependence.
