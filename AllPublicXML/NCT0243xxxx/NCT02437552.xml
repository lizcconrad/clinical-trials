  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of heart diseases has increased significantly in recent years and it is a
      health public problem due to an increased risk of death by several reasons. A cardiac surgery
      is an alternative of treatment for critical injuries heart valves and coronaries arteries.
      Changes in respiratory system resulting from cardiac surgery are well established and include
      a reduced functional capacity due post-surgical pain, causing increased respiratory function
      and increased oxygen consumption . The exercises with the cycle ergometer in phase I of
      cardiac rehabilitation can improve peripheral muscle strength, functional capacity and
      perception of dyspnea when used postoperatively and there are speculations if an earlier
      carried out can contribute to a better postoperative evolution of patients, but these
      benefits in phase I of the Rehabilitation Cardiac are not well defined in the literature.
      Objective: To evaluate the exercises effects with ergometer cycle in the postoperative course
      of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Method: Patients will be recruited the cardiac
      surgery service of Polyclinic Pato Branco in the city of Pato Branco in state of Paraná, of
      both sexes, appropriate for the inclusion criteria, which will be evaluated by pulmonary
      function tests (strength of respiratory muscles, submaximal exercise test, dyspnea scales,
      laboratories tests and radiological exam). All patients will be randomly assigned for one of
      two groups: the control group (Conventional treatment) and rehabilitation group (conventional
      treatment +cycle ergometer), for about 7 days at postoperative period. Patients will be
      reevaluated on the third postoperative day and at discharge. Clinical evolution data will be
      collected from the records and notes of the medical staff and monitoring physiotherapist.

      The research will be a randomized controlled clinical trial. The study will be conducted at
      the Polyclinic Pato Branco, in the city of Pato Branco Parana - Brazil and this study already
      approved by the Ethics Committee Clinical Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, University of São
      Paulo and all participants sign the consent form informed. For the implementation of research
      wil be recruited patients heart surgery who fit the inclusion criteria and do not show any
      characteristics of the exclusion criteria, which agree to participate and sign the consent
      form free and informed. The equipment and tests are already included in routine admissions of
      patients, approved by the hospital and the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of six-minute walk test (6MMWT) distance</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery ,third and seventh postoperative day</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test will be conducted with monitoring blood pressure, HR, RR and SpO2 in a hall plan, with distances previously marked. The patient will be accompanied by the researcher and encouraged by constant verbal stimulation, walking as fast as possible, if the patient stop walking the timer will keep triggered. Will use the oximeter with the sensor on the third finger of the right hand, and a certain reading after the signal stabilization and at the same time we get the heart rate. Will be used to calculate the expected value, and reference to distance in the 6MWT, the equations proposed by Enright and Sherrill (1998) determining the percentage of predicted for each test performed by patient.</description>

    <description>Manovacuometry will be performed with the patient seated with nasal clip, the display scale with intervals of 4 cmH2O and variation +/- 120 cmH2O. The highest value obtained during the two maneuvers will be compared to the table described by Neder et al (1999), which predicts expected values for the Brazilian population according to gender and age.</description>
