  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will involve a randomized trial of Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) for
      early intervention as compared against an active control in which Action Based Cognitive
      Remediation (ABCR) will be applied.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will expand knowledge of the role of compensatory and restorative
      cognitive interventions for early intervention population individuals with schizophrenia. The
      investigators will conduct a two arm randomized trial comparing the impacts of CAT and Action
      Based Cognitive Remediation (ABCR) for individuals with schizophrenia who are under the age
      of 30. The model would mirror the investigators' preliminary work at CAMH (Kidd et al., 2014)
      in which there will be 4 months of specialist-delivered treatment followed by 5 months of
      maintenance by case managers with pre, 4 month, and 9 month evaluations conducted. This study
      will be among the most rigorous examinations of such interventions to date, would be among
      the first to examine integrative approaches, and would make a substantial contribution to the
      early intervention literature.

      The questions for the purposes of this project are:

        1. Is CAT effective among individuals with schizophrenia under the age of 30?

           and

        2. Does integrating cognitive remediation with CAT enhance outcomes as compared with CAT
           alone?

    <description>A global level of social and occupational functioning will be obtained using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale from the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). The SOFAS rates global functioning on a scale from 0 to 100. The rating does not take into account level of symptomatology.</description>

    <description>The Social Functioning Scale (SFS; Birchwood et al., 1990) will be administered. This is a self-report measure that details the frequency and intensity with which the person engages in functional activities. A total score and domain scores for social withdrawal, relationships, social activity, recreational activity, independence (competence), independence (performance) and employment are generated.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the 9 months of participation.</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be determined through regular pill counts of currently prescribed psychiatric medications and pharmacy records.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the 9 months of participation.</time_frame>
    <description>Hospitalization will be tracked by (i) monitoring of electronic records through the central CAMH database and (ii) the reports of the primary Case Manager. Both frequency and duration of inpatient stays will be documented as will the frequency of emergency room visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Goal Attainment (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) will be employed as a sensitive measure of progress on individually defined goals that has demonstrated good reliability and validity with severe mental illness populations (Hurn et al., 2006). Goal attainment scaling involves the setting of 3-5 goals, each operationalized on a 5-point scale. Goals are individualized to the client and assessment of progress are determined through consensus of the clinician and case manager.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Burden (IEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver burden will be measured for the family member involved in implementing CAT using the 31-item Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ; Van Wijngaarden et al., 2000). This questionnaire, which has been validated for caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia, covers a broad domain of caregiving consequences and refers to burden experienced within the past 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognition (Digit Span Subtest of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale - III )</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short term memory will be evaluated with the digit span subtest of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale - III (The Psychological Corporation, 1997).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognition (CVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal learning and memory will be assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT -Delis et al., 1987). The CVLT involves the repeated presentation of a word list that determines acquisition ability and retention.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognition (Trail Making Test, Part B, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive symptoms (BPRS-E)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Positive symptoms will be assessed using the expanded version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-E; Ventura et al., 1993). The BPRS-E is a 24-item scale assessing multiple domains of psychopathology on a series of 7-point scales (1-7). A positive symptom factor score is composed of items assessing hallucinations, unusual thought content, conceptual disorganization and suspiciousness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Negative symptoms (NSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 months and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Negative symptoms will be assessed using the Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA; Alphs et al., 1989). The NSA is a 26-item instrument examining negative symptomatology on a series of 7-point scales (0-6).

    <description>Cognitive Adaptation Training (CAT) is a manual-driven standardized approach that uses environmental supports to improve multiple domains of adaptive functioning including adherence to medication, grooming, and activities of daily living in patients with schizophrenia. Interventions for each functional deficit are based on two dimensions 1) level of impairment in executive functions (determined by neurocognitive tests) and 2) whether the overt behavior of the individual is characterized more by apathy (poverty of speech/movement/inability to initiate and follow through on behavioral sequences), disinhibition (distractibility/behavior which is highly cue-driven) or a combination of these styles (based on the Frontal Lobe Personality Scale (FLOPS).</description>
