  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Senegal, iron deficiency affects 39% of and 82% of women and children between 12 and 50
      months indicating that iron deficiency is a major health problem. The government of Senegal
      has implemented a flour fortification program including iron and folate. Iron is a difficult
      mineral to add to foods efficiently due to its organoleptic properties and typical low
      bioavailability in man. The aim of this study is to determine iron absorption from fortified
      wheat flour consumed with a phenolic containing beverage in women and child pairs. The
      fortificants used will be Ferrous Fumarate and Ferrous Sulfate, and the effect of absorption
      inhibitors on the bioavailability from iron compounds not readily bioavailable is poorly
      investigated.

      The bioavailability of the different iron compounds will be determined using stable iron
      isotopes. Sixteen pairs of women and children (n=34, children between 3-6 years, women
      between 18-45y) will be selected for participation in the study. After a screening, each
      women and child will receive 4 test meals consisting of a bread roll fortified stable
      isotopes with and without the tisane beverage. The first two test meals will be consumed on
      consecutive days. Two weeks after the second test meal a blood sample will be taken from each
      women and child before the third meal administration. After the forth test meal
      administration, and again two weeks later, the last blood sampling will take place and the
      study will be conducted for the subjects (duration 30 days). The samples will be sent to
      Zurich on dry ice for analysis for the following parameters: isotopic composition, H pylori
      infection, B vitamin status, Vitamin A status. In all samples, hemoglobin and iron status as
      well as inflammation status (CRP) will be determined.

      In this study each subject will act as his own control and receive all interventions. Iron
      absorption data from the different test meals will be therefore compared assessing within and
      subject effects (main outcomes). Secondary outcomes will also investigate between subject
      effects and co variates of iron absorption.

    <measure>Correlation between iron absorption in mother and child pairs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 Months after study start</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation of iron absorption from the different test meals between in mother and child pairs will be assessed. A variable will be defined which will consist of the difference in iron absorption between each mother and child, within one mother child pair cluster. Determinants of this variable will be explored by linear regression, such as iron status, parity, age, gender, anthropometry, iron status, vitamin status (A, B2, B12, folate) h. pylori test and hepcidin.</description>
