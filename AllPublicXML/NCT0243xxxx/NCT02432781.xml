    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of carbohydrate-rich drink on
      postoperative nausea and vomiting in diabetic patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.
      The secondary purpose is to investigate the effects of carbohydrate-rich drink on quality of
      recovery and inflammation in diabetic patients after total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrate-rich drink has been proved to neither delay gastric emptying nor affect gastric
      acidity and is therefore considered safe to use in elective surgical patients without risk
      factors for pulmonary aspiration. It reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting and improved
      sense of well-being after surgery. Moreover, carbohydrate-rich drink was not found to be
      affected by delayed gastric emptying in patients with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes.
      Therefore, carbohydrate drink may be safely administered 3 h before anesthesia without risk
      of hyperglycemia or aspiration.
