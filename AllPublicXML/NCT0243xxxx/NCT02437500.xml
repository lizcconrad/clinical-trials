  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study for patients who have a recurrence of Clostridium difficile
      infection in the first 8 weeks of participation in the SERES-004 study. As the SERES-004
      study has completed enrollment, SERES-005 was amended to allow expanded access in accordance
      with 21 CFR 312.315 to SER-109 for patients with recurrent CDI who would have qualified for
      the SERES-004 study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of SER-109 in patients who received a dose of SER-109 or placebo
      in Study SERES-004 and experienced a CDI recurrence within 8 weeks of receipt of study drug.
      In addition, SERES-005 has been amended to expand access to treatment with SER-109 to an
      intermediate-size patient population of adults 18 years of age or older with recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) (a serious disease), who would have qualified for the
      SERES-004 study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent, indicating that the patient understands the purpose of and
             procedures required for the study. Patients who are unable to provide informed consent
             will not be included in the study.

          2. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Previously enrolled in Study SERES-004 and had CDI recurrence within 8 weeks after
             receipt of study drug, OR If not previously enrolled in Study SERES-004, a documented
             history of ≥ 3 episodes of CDI within the previous 9 months, inclusive of the current
             episode with ≥ 1 of the historical episodes having the date, test results, and
             antibiotic treatment received documented. Efforts should be made to acquire history of
             additional CDI episodes.

          4. If not previously enrolled in Study SERES-004, a qualifying episode of CDI as defined
             by:

               1. ≥ 3 unformed stools per day for 2 consecutive days

               2. A positive C. difficile stool test

               3. The requirement of CDI standard-of-care antibiotic therapy (defined as 10 to 21
                  days of treatment with vancomycin or fidaxomicin but excluding pulse-tapered
                  antibiotic regimens).

               4. An adequate clinical response defined as no evidence of diarrhea (&lt; 3 unformed
                  stools in 24 hours) for 2 or more consecutive days before randomization.

          5. If female, patient is non-lactating, and is either:

               1. Not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or

                  hysterectomy.

               2. Of childbearing potential and is practicing at least 1 highly effective method of
                  birth control including the barrier method; oral or parenteral contraceptives; a
                  vasectomized partner; or abstinence from sexual intercourse. The investigator
                  will discuss with the patient the option of practicing more than 1 of the above
                  methods for the duration of the study.

          6. If male and partner is of childbearing potential, patient agrees to practice at least
             1 highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study.

          7. Is not taking probiotics, or discontinues probiotics prior to study start and will not
             take probiotics for the duration of the study.

             enrolled.

          5. Taking antibacterial therapy other than vancomycin (non-tapered) or fidaxomicin for

             prophylactic regimen is permitted.

          6. Use of any probiotics.

          7. Major gastrointestinal surgery (e.g., significant bowel resection or diversion) within
             3 months before enrollment (this does not include appendectomy or cholecystectomy) or
             any history of total colectomy or bariatric surgery.

             Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter within the 30 days before enrollment.

         12. Known stool studies positive for ova and/or parasites within the 30 days before
             enrollment.

         13. Poor concurrent medical risks with clinically significant co-morbid disease such that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, the patient should not be enrolled.

         14. Received an investigational vaccine against C. difficile.

         15. Known active intravenous drug or alcohol abuse or other drugs of abuse.
