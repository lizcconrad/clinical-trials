  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, 24-week OLE study to assess the safety and tolerability of
      ABT-122 in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had had an inadequate response to
      methotrexate (MTX) therapy and who completed the preceding Study M12-963 randomized
      controlled trial, in which participants had been randomized to receive 1 of 3 doses of
      ABT-122 (60 mg every other week [EOW], 120 mg EOW, or 120 mg every week [EW]) or adalimumab
      40 mg EOW given on background methotrexate.

    <time_frame>from the first dose of study drug in study M12-965 until 70 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 32 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. An SAE is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 2 of Study M12-963</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit, a joint evaluator assessed whether a particular joint was &quot;tender or painful&quot; where presence of tenderness was scored as &quot;1&quot; and the absence of tenderness was scored as &quot;0,&quot; provided the joint was not replaced or could not be assessed due to other reasons. The total TJC68, which is based on 68 joints, was derived as the sum of all &quot;1s&quot; thus collected with no penalty considered for the joints not assessed or those which had been replaced. The range for TJC68 was 0 to 68, with a higher score indication a greater degree of tenderness.

        <title>Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Serious AEs (SAEs), AEs Leading to Discontinuation, and Deaths</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. An SAE is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Tender Joint Count (TJC68) at Week 2</title>
        <description>At each study visit, a joint evaluator assessed whether a particular joint was &quot;tender or painful&quot; where presence of tenderness was scored as &quot;1&quot; and the absence of tenderness was scored as &quot;0,&quot; provided the joint was not replaced or could not be assessed due to other reasons. The total TJC68, which is based on 68 joints, was derived as the sum of all &quot;1s&quot; thus collected with no penalty considered for the joints not assessed or those which had been replaced. The range for TJC68 was 0 to 68, with a higher score indication a greater degree of tenderness. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

          <description>At each study visit, a joint evaluator assessed whether a particular joint was &quot;tender or painful&quot; where presence of tenderness was scored as &quot;1&quot; and the absence of tenderness was scored as &quot;0,&quot; provided the joint was not replaced or could not be assessed due to other reasons. The total TJC68, which is based on 68 joints, was derived as the sum of all &quot;1s&quot; thus collected with no penalty considered for the joints not assessed or those which had been replaced. The range for TJC68 was 0 to 68, with a higher score indication a greater degree of tenderness. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in TJC68 at Week 24</title>
          <description>At each study visit, a joint evaluator assessed whether a particular joint was &quot;tender or painful&quot; where presence of tenderness was scored as &quot;1&quot; and the absence of tenderness was scored as &quot;0,&quot; provided the joint was not replaced or could not be assessed due to other reasons. The total TJC68, which is based on 68 joints, was derived as the sum of all &quot;1s&quot; thus collected with no penalty considered for the joints not assessed or those which had been replaced. The range for TJC68 was 0 to 68, with a higher score indication a greater degree of tenderness. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

          <description>At each study visit, a joint evaluator assessed whether a particular joint was swollen where presence of swelling was scored as &quot;1&quot; and the absence of swelling was scored as &quot;0,&quot; provided the joint was not replaced or could not be assessed due to other reasons. The total SJC66, which is based on 66 joints, was derived as the sum of all &quot;1s&quot; thus collected with no penalty considered for the joints not assessed or those which had been replaced. The range for SJC66 was 0 to 66, with a higher score indicating a greater degree of swelling. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

        <description>At each study visit, a joint evaluator assessed whether a particular joint was swollen where presence of swelling was scored as &quot;1&quot; and the absence of swelling was scored as &quot;0,&quot; provided the joint was not replaced or could not be assessed due to other reasons. The total SJC66, which is based on 66 joints, was derived as the sum of all &quot;1s&quot; thus collected with no penalty considered for the joints not assessed or those which had been replaced. The range for SJC66 was 0 to 66, with a higher score indicating a greater degree of swelling. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

The higher the score, the more likely to associate with morbidity and mortality for the participant. The minimum clinically important difference in HAQ-DI was defined as change from baseline ≤ –0.22. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 20</title>
          <description>HAQ-DI is a self-reported participant outcome measurement. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from 8 following categories with a range 0 – 3: Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. The higher the score, the more likely to associate with morbidity and mortality for the participant. The minimum clinically important difference in HAQ-DI was defined as change from baseline ≤ –0.22. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 36</title>
          <description>HAQ-DI is a self-reported participant outcome measurement. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from 8 following categories with a range 0 – 3: Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. The higher the score, the more likely to associate with morbidity and mortality for the participant. The minimum clinically important difference in HAQ-DI was defined as change from baseline ≤ –0.22. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DAS28 (hsCRP) at Week 6</title>
        <description>The DAS28 (hsCRP) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, hsCRP, and general health are included in the DAS28 (hsCRP) score. Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disease activity. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 (hsCRP) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, hsCRP, and general health are included in the DAS28 (hsCRP) score. Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disease activity. For analysis purposes, all baseline values are defined as the last measurement on or before the first dose of study drug in Study M12-963.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants achieving LDA or CR on the DAS28 (hsCRP). The DAS28 (hsCRP) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, hsCRP, and general health are included in the DAS28 (hsCRP) score. Scores range from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (highest degree of disease activity). LDA was defined as a score from 2.6 to &lt; 3.2, and CR was defined as a score &lt; 2.6. Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agrestil-Coull method.</description>

          <description>Percentage of participants achieving LDA or CR on the DAS28 (hsCRP). The DAS28 (hsCRP) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, hsCRP, and general health are included in the DAS28 (hsCRP) score. Scores range from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (highest degree of disease activity). LDA was defined as a score from 2.6 to &lt; 3.2, and CR was defined as a score &lt; 2.6. Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agrestil-Coull method.</description>

        <title>CR Response Rate Per DAS28 (hsCRP) at Week 32</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants achieving CR on the DAS28 (hsCRP). The DAS28 (hsCRP) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, hsCRP, and general health are included in the DAS28 (hsCRP) score. Scores range from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (highest degree of disease activity). LDA was defined as a score from 2.6 to &lt; 3.2, and CR was defined as a score &lt; 2.6. Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agrestil-Coull method.</description>

        <title>LDA or CR Response Rate Per CDAI at Week 6</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants achieving LDA or CR per CDAI criteria. The CDAI is a composite index for assessing disease activity based on the summation of the counts of TJC28 and SJC28, patient global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS from 0 to 10 cm, and physician global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS from 0 to 10 cm. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to 78 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. LDA was defined as a score from 2.8 to ≤ 10; CR was defined as a score ≤ 2.8. Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agrestil-Coull method.</description>

The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to 78 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. LDA was defined as a score from 2.8 to ≤ 10; CR was defined as a score ≤ 2.8. Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agrestil-Coull method.</description>

          <title>LDA or CR Response Rate Per CDAI at Week 32</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants achieving LDA or CR per CDAI criteria. The CDAI is a composite index for assessing disease activity based on the summation of the counts of TJC28 and SJC28, patient global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS from 0 to 10 cm, and physician global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS from 0 to 10 cm. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to 78 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. LDA was defined as a score from 2.8 to ≤ 10; CR was defined as a score ≤ 2.8. Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agrestil-Coull method.</description>

          <title>CR Response Rate Per CDAI Criteria at Week 6</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants achieving CR per CDAI criteria. The CDAI is a composite index for assessing disease activity based on the summation of the counts of TJC28 and SJC28, patient global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS from 0 to 10 cm, and physician global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS from 0 to 10 cm. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to 78 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. LDA was defined as a score from 2.8 to ≤ 10; CR was defined as a score ≤ 2.8. Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agrestil-Coull method.</description>

        <title>CR Response Rate Per CDAI Criteria at Week 36</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants achieving CR per CDAI criteria. The CDAI is a composite index for assessing disease activity based on the summation of the counts of TJC28 and SJC28, patient global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS from 0 to 10 cm, and physician global assessment of disease activity measured on a VAS from 0 to 10 cm. The total CDAI score ranges from 0 to 78 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. LDA was defined as a score from 2.8 to ≤ 10; CR was defined as a score ≤ 2.8. Estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the response rates for each treatment group were calculated using the Agrestil-Coull method.</description>
