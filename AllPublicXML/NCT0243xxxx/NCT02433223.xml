      The purpose of this project is to evaluate hospital utilisation, patient and service outcomes
      of a Respiratory Nursing Service to examine current clinical care of COPD. This evaluation
      aims to identify the important gaps in current clinical care of respiratory chronic disease
      nursing management. The primary outcomes of this evaluation is to determine the efficacy of
      clinical care in 2006, 2011, 2013 and 2015 and compare data to current Nursing Best practice
      guidelines for COPD through the quantification of hospital utilisation for hospital
      admission, average length of stay, readmission within 28 days, emergency service attendance,
      outpatient review, use of Hospital and Home (H@H), frequency of exacerbations, disease
      severity and progression (FEV1: GOLD Classification), number of contacts with the respiratory
      nursing service and type of contacts with the respiratory nursing service.

      Study design: This study is a retrospective observational crosssectional study conducted
      through review of medical records, internal respiratory databases and electronic hospital
      patient record (OACIS &amp; HOMER) over 3x12 blocks.

      Participants: COPD patients from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital(TQEH) Respiratory Nursing
      Service who were new patients in 2006, 2011, 2013 and 2015 (Jan 1st to Dec 31st ). Data
      collection: Demographics, clinical data, hospital service utilisation, and clinical outcomes
      such as exacerbation frequency and disease progression. All data will be extracted into a
      standardised data extraction form, which a random subset will be checked by a second
      researcher.

      Demographic data will include comparison of % without comorbidities, impact of comorbid
      conditions using Charleston Comorbidity index isolating diabetes, heart failure, anxiety and
      depression. Demographic and descriptive data will be given in means + SD and compared using a
      two-tailed Student t-test. Categorical variables will be compared using chisquared or Fisher
      exact tests, and when appropriate the MannWhitney Utest for nonparametric data. Statistical
      significance will be determined using an alpha of p &lt;0.05. All analyses will be examined
      using SPSS software (version x).

    <description>Hospital utilisation is determined by hospital admissions, emergency department presentations, length of stay, readmission within 28 days, number of Respiratory Outpatient reviews and use of Hospital at Home. Patient outcomes are frequency of exacerbations, disease severity and progression (FEV1: GOLD Classification), Quality of Life, lung function and exercise tolerance. Respiratory Nurse outcomes are the number and type of contacts performed</description>
