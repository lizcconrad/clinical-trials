    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and
      multiple intravenous (IV) infusions of Aducanumab in Japanese participants with mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The secondary objectives of this study are as follows: To
      evaluate the serum pharmacokinetics (PK) of Aducanumab after single and multiple intravenous
      (IV) infusions of Aducanumab; To evaluate the effect of single and multiple IV infusions of
      Aducanumab on immunogenicity.
