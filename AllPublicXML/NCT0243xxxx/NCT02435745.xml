  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited
      connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility,
      and tissue fragility. EDS features such as genetically related cartilage defects,
      craniofacial abnormalities and increased pharyngeal collapsibility have been proposed to
      cause obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). There is evidence from studies based on questionnaires
      that EDS patients might be more frequently affected by OSA and sleep disturbances than the
      general population. However, the actual prevalence of OSA in patients with EDS is unknown.

      Aortic root dilation and dissection are common complications of EDS and little is known about
      the underlying risk factors. Preliminary evidence suggests a link with OSA but this has not
      yet been investigated.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of OSA in EDS-patients (100)
      compared to a matched control group (100). The secondary objective of this pioneer study is
      to assess whether there is a relationship between OSA severity and aortic
      diame-ter/craniofacial abnormalities in EDS patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of OSA in EDS-patients

      diameter in EDS patients.
