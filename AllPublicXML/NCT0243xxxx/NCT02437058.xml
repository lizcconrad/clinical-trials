      The scales measuring the severity of acute decompensate heart failure (ADHF) in emergency
      departments have not achieved an adequate discriminative ability for decision making.
      Objectives: 1) Identify baseline variables, and evolutionary variables that may provide a
      good predictive ability of the model.2) Create and validate clinical predictive rules of
      mortality during admission/a week after ED visit in those discharged from ED, 30 and 60 days
      after ED visit as well as identify predicitive factors of short-term readmission (90
      days)Design: Prospective cohort study. The sociodemographics and clinical variables will be
      collected from emergency medical records to identify predictors. Outcome variables and
      evolution of variables will be collected from hospital medical records / ambulatory during
      admission and up to 90 days after the episode of ADHF. Baseline predictors and evolutionary
      variables will be identified through logistic regression models using 60% of the final
      sample. The models that best fit will be applied in 40% of the sample to assess the
      predictive validity of this scale.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  They were diagnosed as heart failure) HF is defined, clinically, as a syndrome in
             which patients have typical symptoms (e.g.breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue)
             and signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and displaced
             apex beat) resulting from an abnormality of cardiac structure or function.(8) We
             included the following presentation of acute heart failure (AHF) at ED: acute
             decompensated heart failure, hypertensive acute heart failure, pulmonary oedema,
             cardiogenic shock, and high output failure. (9;10)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose main diagnosis in the ER is different than acute heart failure and
             those not wishing to participate in the study or signing the informed consent.
