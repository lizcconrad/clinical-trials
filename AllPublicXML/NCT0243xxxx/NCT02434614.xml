  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy was
      superior to radiotherapy alone in the treatment of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma (NPC). Based on these evidences, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with/without
      sequential chemotherapy has become the standard care for locoregionally advanced NPC.
      However, most of these evidences of standard treatment for locoregionally advanced NPC were
      based on the two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy (2DCRT). As the intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) technique has been widely used in the last decades, IMRT improved
      the treatment outcomes of patients with NPC, especially the local control rate. Currently,
      more retrospective studies compared the IMRT alone vs. IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy, and
      reported that concurrent chemotherapy failed to improve survival rates for patients with
      locoregionally advanced disease, but increased the severity of acute toxicities. People
      started to reconsider the role of CCRT. Therefore, we propose this randomized phase III
      non-inferiority study to reassess the efficacy and contribution of concurrent chemotherapy in
      locoregionally advanced NPC during IMRT era.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with with previously untreated non-metastatic newly histologically-confirmed
      non-keratinizing III-IVb NPC (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) are randomly assigned to receive
      induction chemotherapy followed by IMRT alone (investigational group) or induction
      chemotherapy followed by IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy (control group). During induction
      chemotherapy, patients in both groups receive 60 mg/m2 docetaxel intravenously on day 1, 60
      mg/m2 cisplatin intravenously on day 1, and 600 mg/m2/d fluorouracil as a continuous infusion
      on days 1-5; three cycles were administered at intervals of 3 weeks. During radiotherapy,
      patients in investigational group received IMRT alone and patients in control group received
      IMRT, concurrently with weekly intravenous cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 for 6-7 weeks. IMRT is given
      as 2.0-2.3 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks, Cumulative doses
      were &gt; 66 Gy to the primary tumor and &gt; 50 Gy to the bilateral cervical lymph nodes and
      potential sites of local infiltration. The primary endpoint is failure-free survival(FFS).
      Secondary clinical endpoints include overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free
      survival (LRFFS), distant failure-free survival (DFFS) rates and toxic effects.
