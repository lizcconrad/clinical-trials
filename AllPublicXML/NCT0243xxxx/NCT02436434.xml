  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) is designed to alleviate pain by delivering an electrical field
      and heat bursts at a temperature less than 42°C to neural tissue. In contrast with
      conventional radiofrequency, PRF is controlled below 42°C without damage to nerves and many
      studies have shown its benefits in pain relief for certain kinds of chronic pain conditions.
      For lessening pain of certain joint arthropathy, the direct nerve block by application of PRF
      is difficult and complicated because the supplying nerve of joint is complex or small. Hence,
      some authors perform intra-articular PRF on the chronic painful joint for example, knee
      osteoarthritis, atlantoaxial joint, cervical facet joint sacroiliac joint, scapholunate and
      shoulder joint and the excellent long-term effects are reported.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of intra-articular PRF in
      osteoarthritis.

      shoulder joint and the excellent long-term effects are reported.

      However, the definite effect of intra-articular PRF for osteoarthritis from current published
      studies are insufficiently proved because of small patient numbers and lack of
      placebo-controlled design. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of
      intra-articular PRF in osteoarthritis.
