  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship or effect of food antigen (wheat based soy sauce) in eosinophilic
      esophagitis. It is believed that when food antigens are exposed to the esophageal tissue it
      starts an chronic allergy-based inflammation. This will be analyzed with the esophageal
      biopsies and the mucosal impedance probe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the putative mechanisms of eosinophilic esophagitis is exposure of food antigens to
      antigen recognition cells in the esophageal mucosa that initiates a chronic allergy-based
      inflammatory response . It is believed that this exposure is facilitated through dilation of
      the intercellular spaces (DIS) between esophageal epithelial cells (termed spongiosis). This
      is substantiated by several studies which have demonstrated that: first, DIS is commonly
      found in biopsies from patients with active EoE and reverses with steroid therapy; second,
      DIS correlates to physiologic demonstration of increased esophageal epithelial permeability
      as shown through transepithelial small molecule flux in mucosal biopsies appraised in Ussing
      chambers and increased conductivity of electric current as measured in a mucosal impedance
      probe (Katzka, et al., in press, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol). Although these mechanisms make
      intuitive sense, no one has shown the presence of food antigen in esophageal mucosa after
      ingestion and the correlation of this presence to dilation of intercellular spaces.

    <description>Cryosectioning of the frozen esophageal tissue will then be done for immunofluorescent staining to determine the distribution/localization of different cells and dietary proteins We will use anti-gliadin (Biorbyt catalog # orb157160)and anti-soy (LifeSpan Biosciences Catalog # LS-C132165-100)antibodies against cell surface markers as well as dietary proteins/peptides tagged with different fluorochromes to achieve this.</description>

    <description>Is graded on the basis of the worst area, using a 0-4+ scale [3]. DIS grading was assessed by the appearance of the tight junctions seen on biopsy and the degree of widening between epithelial cells . Grade 0: no intercellular space widening and intact tight junctions. Grade 1: mild widening of intercellular spaces with attenuation and prominence of tight junctions. Grade 2: Further widening of intercellular space with some disruption of tight junctions. Grade 3: complete disruption of tight junctions with further widening of intercellular spaces, forming small &quot;lakes&quot; in the epithelium. Grade 4: Coalescence of epithelial lakes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Antigen (wheat base soy sauce) spray</arm_group_label>
    <description>Ten patients with active and ten with inactive eosinophilic esophagitis (defined by consensus guidelines) undergoing clinically indicated endoscopy and esophageal biopsies will participate in this study.
During the endoscopy two biopsies will be taken from the esophageal body, 10 cm above the gastroesophageal junction.
After biopsies are taken, approximately 10 cc of wheat based soy sauce (antigen spray) will be sprayed though an endoscopic catheter onto the esophageal mucosa. The endoscopic examination will be completed and two additional endoscopic biopsies will be taken 10 cm above the gastroesophageal junction.</description>
