  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal hypothermia is associated with increased risk of mortality as well as multiple
      morbidities. The investigators objective is to determine if an increase in ambient operative
      room temperature decreases the rate of hypothermia. Operating room temperature will be
      randomized to the current institutional standard (67°F) or a temperature of 73°F on a weekly
      basis for a period of six months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All pregnant women and their neonates undergoing cesarean delivery by the Parkland
             Hospital Obstetrics Service on the Labor and Delivery &quot;West&quot; Unit (operating rooms 1,
             2, 3, and 5) during the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if cesarean delivery is planned but a
             precipitous vaginal delivery occurs, intrauterine fetal demise has been diagnosed
             prior to start of surgery, the neonate is noted to have a major congenital anomaly,
             resuscitative efforts are not performed (&quot;comfort care only&quot; provided), or a neonatal
             temperature is not available.
