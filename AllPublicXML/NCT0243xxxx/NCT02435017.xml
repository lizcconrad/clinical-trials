  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overall study design is to review National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
      data 1999-2008 for nutrition risk according to kidney function. Substudies will be performed
      to review the association of nutrients and overall dietary intake compared to biomarkers
      available in NHANES during this period.

    <textblock>
      Data from NHANES 2003-2006 were used to evaluate the relationship between estimated dietary
      phosphorus intake and the measured serum phosphorus. The following variables were used:

        1. Demographics: Age, sex, race/ethnicity

        2. Dietary variables: Foods, food groups (as reported by the United States Department of
           Agriculture (USDA) method, further standardized to the Academy of Nutrition and
           Dietetics method for portion size and then divided into groups having inorganic
           phosphate additives or no inorganic phosphate additives), food weight (g), phosphorus
           (mg), dietary supplements

        3. Socioeconomic variables: education, family income

        4. Laboratory variables: serum creatinine, phosphorus; urine albumin, creatinine

        5. Clinical assessments: hypertension (proportion having blood pressure ≥140 millimeters of
           mercury (mmHg) diastolic or ≥90 mmHg systolic or taking antihypertensive medications);
           hyperglycemia (proportion having serum glucose &gt;126 mg/dL or taking medications for
           diabetes); kidney function based on Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
           (2009) equation, evaluated in 15 milliliters/min/1.73m2 increments from &lt;15 to &gt;105;
           anthropometrics (BMI, kg/m2; obesity class I, II, III)

        Participants in the continuous NHANES program from 2003-2006 who met the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in the analysis. NHANES samples the general US
        population to determine prevalence of major diseases and health risks by combining physical
        examination with laboratory studies and questionnaires in a standardized environment using
        trained personnel. Participants are selected through a complex, multistage, probability
        sampling approach.
