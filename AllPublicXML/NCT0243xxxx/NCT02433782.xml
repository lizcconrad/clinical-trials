      Designing a treatment protocol using myofascial therapy for the treatment of pain and
      restrictions on mobility in patients with hemophilic arthropathy of the knee and ankle.

      Pilot with a small number of patients for assessment the effectiveness and safety of the
      treatment protocol created.

      Randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of treatment with myofascial therapy in
      patients with hemophilia.

      Describe the differences in terms of the dependent variables (range of motion, pain and
      flexibility) in patients with hemophilia who have carried out the treatment.

      Report the relationship between the clinical characteristics of patients and the results
      obtained after the treatment period.
