  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema syndrome (CPFE) individualized by our group in
      2005 is characterized by an often severe dyspnea, almost exclusive male predominance, and
      often major, profound impairment of gas exchange contrasting with preserved lung volumes and
      absence of airflow obstruction, and a high risk of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension
      responsible for increased mortality. Almost all patients are smokers or ex-smokers. There are
      some arguments in favor of genetic abnormalities in this syndrome of unknown etiology (other
      than smoking) including short telomeres and mutations in the telomerase complex genes. There
      are also emphysematous lesions, in patients with familial pulmonary fibrosis, with mutations
      in the SFTPC gene (surfactant protein C), and reported cases of CPFE syndrome with SFTPC
      mutation. No large genetic studies have been conducted to date in the CPFE syndrome. Our main
      hypothesis is that the proportion of subjects with short telomeres is higher among patients
      with CPFE syndrome than in subjects of similar age with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis but
      without emphysema. It has previously been shown that mutations in the telomerase TERT or TERC
      genes are mostly found in people whose telomeres are abnormally short. The investigators
      propose to use that test to identify patients most likely carrying a mutation, and to seek,
      among them, the mutations in the TERT or TERC telomerase genes. The objective of the study is
      to compare the proportion of patients with short telomeres in the group of patients with CPFE
      syndrome to that of other patients (with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis without emphysema, or
      with emphysema without fibrosis).
