  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40% of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients do not respond to conventional
      treatments (medications or behavior therapy). For some of them, a neurosurgical treatment can
      be indicated. A previous study, employing bilateral double-shot ventral capsular/ventral
      striatal (VC/VS) Gamma capsulotomy (GVC) for OCD has shown that this radiosurgical technique
      is potentially efficacious and relatively safe. However, a few patients may develop
      complications associated to radionecrosis (eg., brain cysts) in a long-term follow-up, which
      are probably associated to lesion volumes. Another study, with the preliminary results of
      smaller VC/VS Gamma capsulotomy lesions has suggested that this procedure is safe and remains
      efficacious. Our aim is to investigate the efficacy and safety profiles of smaller,
      single-shot VC/VS Gamma capsulotomy for OCD. This study will support the development of a
      future double-blind, randomized clinical trial of single-shot VC/VS Gamma capsulotomy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A DSM-V diagnosis of OCD as the main diagnostic entity. If comorbid axis I or II
             disorders are present, OCD symptoms are the most troublesome among disorders.

          -  Age range between 18 and 65 years old.

          -  At least 5 years of OCD symptoms.

          -  &quot;Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale&quot; (YBOCS) scores greater than 26 (or greater
             than 13, for isolated obsessions or compulsions).

          -  Refractoriness criteria fulfilled.

          -  To be accepted by the &quot;best estimate&quot; method as a treatment refractory patient. It
             consists in the careful examination of each patient's history by two OCD specialists,
             so as to confirm refractoriness status.

        Refractoriness criteria:

          -  At least 3 serotonin reuptake inhibitors (selective or not) have been tried before.
             One of these trials must have included clomipramine. All drugs were used for a minimum
             of 12 weeks, at the maximum doses or the maximally tolerated doses.

          -  Previous participation in a cognitive behavior therapy program (exposure and response
             prevention), for a minimum of 20 hours' time; or participation for some time, without
             subsequent adherence, due to severe OCD symptoms, and acceptance of the independent
             review board.

          -  YBOCS scores reductions after adequate drug therapy and psychotherapy not better than
             25 %, or confirmation of no clinical improvements by the mental health professionals
             who were responsible for the treatments of the patient.

          -  By the end of adequately conducted pharmacological trials, &quot;Clinical Global
             Impression&quot; (CGI) scores not better than minimal improvement.

          -  Previous use of at least two antidepressant augmentation strategies (such as the
             association of a typical or atypical antipsychotic, another serotonin reuptake
             inhibitor, a benzodiazepine, an anticonvulsant or an antiglutamatergic medication), in
             adequate doses for a sufficient period of time, without satisfactory responses.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years or more than 65 years of age.

          -  Past history of head injury, with posttraumatic amnesia.

          -  Past or general medical condition, or neurological illness with brain compromise
             (severe and in active phase)

          -  History of physiological effects of a substance, as determinant of psychopathological
             symptoms, or cumulative signs of alcohol or drug abuse in the Central Nervous System
             (such cortical atrophy), confirmed by a neuroimaging scan.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Refusal to participate in radiosurgical procedures.

          -  Refusal to sign the Patient Information and Consent Form, or refusal to take part in
             this study.

          -  History of mental retardation and/or being unable to understand the Patient
             Information and Consent Form, confirmed by poor performance on neuropsychological
             tests.
