  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations occur in up to 50% of Asian patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) confers a significant survival benefit. This study assessed the
      efficacy and safety of chemotherapy with or without icotinib in patients undergoing resection
      of stage IB to IIIA EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

    <description>patients received four cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (150 mg/m2 paclitaxel plus 80 mg/m2 nedaplatin or 30mg/m2 lobaplatin on day one of a three-week cycle).Two weeks after chemotherapy completed, patients assigned to the consolidation therapy group began oral icotinib treatment (125 mg, thrice daily). Icotinib treatment continued for four to eight months, or until the occurrence of disease relapse, metastasis or unacceptable icotinib or chemotherapy toxicity.</description>
