  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether COX-2 inhibitor is effective in the
      treatment of primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy(PHO) were diagnosed based on clinical
      manifestations and symptoms. PHO patients were treated with COX-2 inhibitor after signing
      informed consent. The extend of alleviation, the change of the markers on prostaglandin E
      metabolic pathway and the adverse event on different time points were recorded to identify
      the efficacy and safety.
