      Background:

      - Ebola is a lethal disease. A lot is still unknown about Ebola and its long-term effects.
      Researchers want to learn what ill health conditions Ebola survivors have. They want to learn
      if Ebola survivors can infect others in their household through close contact. They also want
      to learn if Ebola survivors are immune from getting Ebola again. To learn these things, they
      want to follow people in Liberia for 5 years.

      Objectives:

      - To learn how Ebola affects the health of survivors and the people they live with.

      Eligibility:

      - People in Liberia who had Ebola in the past 2 years, who share a household with someone who
      had Ebola, or who got ill and went to an Ebola Treatment Unit but were sent home because they
      did not have Ebola.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with family illness history, physical exam, and blood
           tests. They may have an eye exam.

        -  Ebola survivors and those who went to a Treatment Unit but did not have Ebola will visit
           a clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months, then every 6 months for 5 years. At each visit, they
           will repeat the screening tests.

        -  Participants who live with someone who had Ebola will have only the screening visit. But
           they may be asked to return for follow-up visits. These visits will help researchers
           learn more about the differences between those who have had Ebola and those who have
           not.

        -  Participants brought to the NIH Clinical Center will have documentation of positive
           Ebola virus PCR and a clinical syndrome compatible with acute EVD.

        -  The study will last 5 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1994 and the present, there have been several Ebola virus outbreaks affecting mostly
      countries in Central Africa. However, the 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceeds
      all previous outbreaks in geographic range and number of individuals affected. Ebola virus
      disease (EVD) is highly lethal with case fatality rates of 70-80% in the current West African
      outbreak. While the clinical manifestations of acute Ebola virus infection are well
      documented, little is known about long-term sequelae, ability to transmit Ebola, or long-term
      protective immunity in survivors from EVD. The purpose of this protocol is to study these
      questions in a cohort of EVD survivors from Liberia.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR EVD SURVIVORS

        A volunteer of any age with a diagnosis of EVD within the past 2 years who is on the
        Ministry of Health (MOH) Registry of EVD survivors is eligible to participate.

          -  Willingness to participate in examinations at one of the participating health
             facilities

          -  Willingness to provide informed consent/assent

        Individuals on the MOH Registry were PCR positive for EVD and treated at an Ebola Treatment
        Unit (ETU), Community Care Center (CCC) or holding center. Periodically, participants
        enrolled will be matched against the MOH Registry to verify that those enrolled are EVD
        survivors. If a participant enrolled is not on the registry, their antibody levels at
        baseline will be assessed. If antibody levels are present, the participant will continue to
        be followed as an EVD survivor. If antibody levels are not present, the participants will
        no longer be followed as an EVD survivor and may be withdrawn from the study. Participants
        brought to the NIH Clinical Center will have documentation of positive Ebola virus PCR and
        a clinical syndrome compatible with acute EVD.

        EXCLUSION CRITERION FOR EVD SURVIVORS

        Any condition in the judgment of the study staff that would make the volunteer unable to
        participate in the study.
