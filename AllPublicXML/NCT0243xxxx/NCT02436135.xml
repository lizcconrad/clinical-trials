    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of
      idelalisib in adults receiving ruxolitinib as therapy for intermediate to high risk primary
      myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis
      (post-PV MF or post-ET MF) with progressive or relapsed disease.

    <description>Four successive cohorts of participants will each be started on a fixed dose of idelalisib. Based on safety data after the third participant completes Day 28, the cohort may be expanded to enroll an additional 3 participants. After the sixth participant completes Day 56, the next cohort will be open to enrollment after safety and PK data at this dose have been evaluated. For the successive 3 cohorts, enrollment will be expanded based on cumulative safety and PK data. Participants will continue ruxolitinib dosing during screening and throughout the study treatment period.</description>
