  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to administer novel cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19)
      specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR19 T-cells) to patients with relapsed or
      resistant Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) to assess the safety and efficacy of this
      strategy as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) resistant to or relapsing following
      rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimens have a poor prognosis. Patients may receive
      salvage chemotherapy and possibly an autologous stem cell transplant (auto-SCT). A proportion
      of these patients, however, will not respond to the chemotherapy or may relapse after the
      auto-SCT and therefore require novel treatment options. Such patients may benefit from an
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-STC).

      In this study the investigators aim to administer CAR19 T-cells to act as a bridge to the
      transplant strategy. Specifically, (1) the feasibility of generating CD19 specific Chimeric
      Antigen Receptor T-cells called CAR19 T-cells, (2) the safety of administering the CD19 CAR
      T-cells in this setting, (3) how well the CAR19 T-cells engraft and (4) to evaluate how
      effective these cells are as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation.

      Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an
      unstimulated leucapheresis for generation of the CAR19 T cells. Whilst the cells are being
      generated, patients will proceed with a further cycle of standard salvage (recommended
      ifosfamide, epirubicin and etoposide (i.e. the IVE regime), and should not receive rituximab.
      Patients will receive pre-conditioning with intravenous fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
      prior to infusion of a single dose of CAR-modified T-cells. An escalating dose protocol will
      be employed to identify a minimum effective dose of CAR19 T-cells.
