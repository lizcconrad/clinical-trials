  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation and oxidative stress are common findings in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease
      (CKD) undergoing conservative treatment, in addition to being associated with atherosclerotic
      process, are related also to the progression of CKD. In this regard, resveratrol, a phenolic
      compound with recognized antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, can play an important
      role in the control of metabolic disorders associated with CKD, since it can modulate the
      mechanisms involved in inflammation and oxidative stress cycle. Resveratrol is capable of
      promoting the activation of the transcription-related factor-2 nuclear factor erythroid
      factor 2 (Nrf2) , a nuclear factor with anti-inflammatory properties, and SIRT-1, a protein
      also associated with the reduction of inflammation. These two factors, in their turn, are
      able to inhibit / antagonize the activity of the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-kB), a transcription
      factor that participates in the inflammatory response. Although it is a promising treatment,
      there are no studies evaluating the effects of resveratrol supplementation in patients with
      CKD. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effects of resveratrol supplementation on
      inflammation and oxidative stress in patients undergoing conservative treatment of CKD.
