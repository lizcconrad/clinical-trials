      The devices used in this observational registry are the Osprey Medical Contrast Monitoring
      System (CMS) and the Osprey Medical AVERT Reflux Reduction System. Both products have CE Mark
      designations. The purpose of this registry is to evaluate the usability characteristics of
      the combined Osprey Medical AVERT System and the Contrast Monitoring System during normal
      clinical use.

      This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, single arm, observational registry of
      the AVERT System used in combination with the Contrast Monitoring System. Patients undergoing
      manual manifold injection coronary artery imaging for diagnostic or PCI procedures that
      utilize the AVERT System and the CMS will be included in this registry. Device use
      characteristics including, measurement of contrast media volume used, contrast media volume
      saved by the use of the AVERT System, evaluation of angiographic image quality, and physician
      feedback on device features and function will be obtained. All data will be collected on the
      day of the procedure and there will be no long-term follow-up.
