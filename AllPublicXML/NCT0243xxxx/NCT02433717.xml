      Background Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone, both of which are
      antipsychotic agents for treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.
      Pharmacogenetic studies have revealed that the efficacy and side effects of antipsychotic
      agents are related to polymorphisms of specific genes, however, there are just a few related
      studies on paliperidone. The current study aims to evaluate whether pharmacogenetic markers
      related to risperidone and genetic markers associated with schizophrenia have effects on the
      clinical effectiveness of paliperidone treatment. The study also uses changes of
      event-related potentials (ERP) as indices for clinical efficacy.

      Methods It is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized and uncontrolled clinical trial to
      study the efficacy and side effects of 6-week paliperidone ER treatment for patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The first three weeks of treatment has to be
      inpatient treatment. In the first two weeks, participants will take 9 mg paliperidone ER
      daily. Then the dose of paliperidone can be adjusted to within the range of 6-12 mg per day.
      Efficacy indicators include symptom severity, global functioning, and ERP. Side effect
      indicators include common side effect evaluate, extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic profiles,
      hormonal change, and bone metabolism indices. Participants will also receive examinations for
      blood drug concentration, genetic polymorphisms, and epigenetic markers.

      A. Background Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder whose pathophysiology is not yet
      understood clearly. The treatment of schizophrenia remains suboptimal. Take risperidone for
      example, response rate of a patient is around only 60% to 80%. The second-generation or
      atypical antipsychotics are widely used. Apart from dopamine D2 receptor, they also target on
      5-HT2 receptors and receptors of other neurotransmission systems. However, these
      second-generation antipsychotics still result in other common side effects. Therefore,
      finding predictors for clinical efficacy and side effect profile is a necessary task. Up to
      date, several genetic and non-genetic factors have been suggested related to the efficacy and
      side effects of antipsychotics. Noteworthy, pharmacokinetics as indicated by the temporal
      change of antipsychotics blood levels is usually overlooked. It might be a contributing
      factor why results from pharmacogenetic studies were usually difficult to be replicated.

      Paliperidone (9-hydroxy-risperidone) is an active metabolite of the second-generation
      antipsychotics risperidone. Pharmacogenetic studies have found polymorphisms of some genes to
      be related to blood risperidone concentration, side effects and treatment response. Comparing
      to risperidone, paliperidone has less metabolic side effects, probable faster occurrence of
      efficacy, and better tolerance for subjects with hepatic insufficiency. Further, paliperidone
      is more sensitive to P-glycoprotein. There are just a few pharmacogenetic studies on
      paliperidone and P-glycoprotein. Therefore, one aim of this proposed study is to examine the
      pharmacogenetic effects on paliperidone extended release (paliperidone ER) for acute
      treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The electrophysiological
      abnormalities as measured by event-related potentials (ERP) are characteristics features of
      several neuropsychological disorders. For schizophrenia, deficits in mismatch negativity,
      P50, and auditory steady state response have been frequently reported. Therefore, besides
      from clinical improvements, the investigators are also interested whether paliperidone
      treatment can alter the deficits in mismatch negativity, P50, and ASSR.

      B. Study aims

        1. To study the association of candidate genes, which are related to pharmacodynamics and
           pharmacokinetics of risperidone, with paliperidone pharmacokinetics and clinical
           response

        2. To evaluate the impact of pharmacodynamics on the efficacy (including ERP change and
           cognitive function) and side effects of paliperidone ER for acute treatment of
           schizophrenia

        3. To evaluate whether the paliperidone pharmacodynamics is related to the metabolic,
           hormonal, and bone turnover profiles

        4. To evaluate whether paliperidone ER treatment will influence epigenetic markers

        5. To evaluate whether paliperidone ER treatment will influence event-related potentials
           and performance in neurocognitive tests

      C. Study design It is a 6-week, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and non-randomized
      trial of paliperidone ER for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in an
      acute episode. A total of 40 subjects will be recruited.

      D. Protocol overview:

      For at least the first three weeks, participants should receive inpatient treatment in the
      acute psychiatry ward (03W2) in National Taiwan University Hospital. Medication compliance,
      efficacy of treatment and side effects will be monitored and evaluated by the psychiatrists
      who are the principle investigator or sub-investigators of this study.

        1. Dosage of titration of paliperidone ER:

           Fixed dose (9 mg/day) of paliperidone ER will be given in the first two weeks of trial
           (from day 1 to day 14). Since the third week (day 15), the dosage can be adjusted in the
           range of 6 to 12 mg per day.

        2. Medication regulation:

             1. Antipsychotics other than paliperidone ER are not allowed.

             2. For benzodiazepines and sedatives/hypnotics: only lorazepam up to 4 mg per day is
                allowed to management medication withdrawal, side effects or symptoms.

             3. Anticholinergic agents: for management of extrapyramidal symptoms only biperiden up
                to 6 mg/day or trihexyphenidyl up to 15 mg/day is allowed.

      University Hospital.

      F. Trial medications Paliperidone Extended-Release Tablets (Invega): 9 mg/tab, 3 mg/tab

      G. Data collection and statistical analysis

      Since the current study is an open-labeled and single-arm trial, it is not aimed to prove the
      efficacy of paliperidone for treatment of schizophrenia. Instead, it is aimed to evaluate
      whether pharmacodynamics factors are related to the clinical response of paliperidone
      treatment. The variables of clinical response are defined as:

        1. Primary efficacy variable: response rate (the ratio of subjects who respond to
           paliperidone treatment).

           Response to paliperidone treatment is calculated as [(PANSSevaluation - PANSSbaseline)/
           (PANSSbaseline -30)]*100%

        2. Secondary efficacy variables: PSP, CGI-S, ERPs and neurocognitive tests

        3. Side effect variables: DIEPSS, UKU side effect scales, body weight, blood chemistry
           markers, metabolic markers, hormonal markers, and bone turnover markers

      Response rate and other efficacy variables were analyzed with last observation carried
      forward and intention-to-treat principles. Response rate will be calculated on day 4, 7, 14,
      28 and 42, and the impact of pharmacodynamics and genetic effects will be analyzed
      accordingly. Demographic data, blood paliperidone concentration, and the aforementioned
      variables will be compared between responder group and non-responder group on last visit
      (Pearson χ2 test or Fisher exact test will be used to compare categorical variables;
      independent t test will be used for continuous variables). The secondary efficacy and side
      effect variables on day 0 (before treatment) and day 42 (after treatment) will be compared
      with paired t-test. Relationship of the change of the aforementioned variables with blood
      paliperidone concentration will be examined by Pearson's correlation coefficient test or
      Spearman's correlation coefficient test. Multiple linear regression analysis will be applied
      for adjustments of covariates.

      The genotyping quality will be checked by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests. Association of
      the allelic effects of the genetic markers with clinical response and other outcome variables
      will be analyzed by using PLINK version 1.07 19. Other statistical analyses will be performed
      by using SAS®9.4 Software (SAS Institute Inc., USA). A p-value of less than 0.05 was
      considered statistically significant.
