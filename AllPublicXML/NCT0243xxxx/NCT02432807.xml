    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a vancomycin hydrochloride
      ophthalmic ointment dosed 4 times daily for 7 days compared to placebo (vehicle) in patients
      with moderate to severed Gram-positive bacterial conjunctivitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial conjunctivitis is common ocular disease caused by various types of bacteria
      including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). External ocular infections such as those caused by MRSA or
      MRSE frequently are not serious but in rare cases may be severe enough to threaten vision.
      When ocular infections due to resistant organisms such as MRSA/MRSE do not respond to empiric
      treatment with approved antibiotics, there are few treatment options. Vancomycin is one of
      the few treatment options that has been shown to be effective against all clinical isolates
      of MRSA/MRSE.

      This study is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a vancomycin
      hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment in patients with moderate to severed Gram-positive
      bacterial conjunctivitis including those with MRSA and MRSE. Subjects, who are adenovirus
      negative, will be dosed with vancomycin hydrochloride ophthalmic ointment or placebo
      (vehicle) 4 times daily for 7 days and evaluated for clinical and bacterial resolution of
      their infection along with an assessment of the safety of the investigational product.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 1 and older

          2. Clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial conjunctivitis with at least one eye exhibiting
             conjunctival discharge graded ≥ 2 as well as palpebral conjunctival injection graded ≥
             2 AND bulbar conjunctival injection graded ≥ 2 with onset ≤ 4 days as reported by the
             subject.

          3. Negative test result on AdenoPlus® adenovirus test.

          4. Snellen visual acuity (VA) equal to or better than 20/200 in each eye using current
             corrective lenses, if required (or if worn) and/or using pinhole if subject's
             corrective lenses are not available at the time of exam. Every attempt should be made
             to obtain a VA measurement in children and, if it is unobtainable, the decision as to
             whether the criterion is met will be at the investigator's discretion.

          5. Female subjects must be 1-year postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or women of
             childbearing potential with a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1. Women of
             childbearing potential must use an acceptable form of contraception throughout the
