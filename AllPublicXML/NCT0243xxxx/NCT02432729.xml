  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the biological and functional changes after one
      year of smoking cessation and to collect data on a broad range of biomarkers of exposure
      (BoExp).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BoExp to be measured are selected based on:

        1. HPHCs derived from the list of HPHCs recommended for lowering in cigarette smoke by the
           World Health Organization (WHO),

        2. draft guidance on &quot;Reporting Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents in Tobacco
           Products and Tobacco Smoke&quot; by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),

        3. HPHC specific to the source of exposure,

        4. BoExp to an HPHC easily detectable using reliable, reproducible, precise analytical
           methods,

        5. HPHC reflecting a specific toxic exposure or being a reliable surrogate of exposure to
           HPHCs,

        6. the list of HPHCs including HPHCs from both gas and particulate phase,

        7. the list of HPHCs including a broad variety of chemical classes and organ toxicity
           classes,

        8. representing HPHCs formed at different temperature levels.
