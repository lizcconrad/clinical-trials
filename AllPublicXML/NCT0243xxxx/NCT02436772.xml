  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the performance of a blood test for detecting biomarkers in metastatic
      breast cancer patients at one clinic against standard testing.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to detect the expression of FGFR1 and AR on
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from the peripheral blood of metastatic breast cancer
      (MBC) patients using the OncoCEE™ platform. No procedures will be associated with this study,
      as these mutations will be evaluated from the leftover blood that has already been sent for
      standard of care ER and HER2 using the same platform. Results from this testing will be
      correlated with results obtained from standard testing to calculate the rate of concordance
      between tests.
