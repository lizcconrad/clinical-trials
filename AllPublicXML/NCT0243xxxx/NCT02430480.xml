  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  There are several ways to treat prostate cancer. Researchers want to see how well a
           certain kind of imaging helps detect prostate cancer. They also want to see if a
           particular drug combination used before surgery will benefit people with prostate cancer
           that hasn t spread in the body (non-metastatic). The combination will be androgen
           deprivation therapy and enzalutamide.

        -  The combination of androgen deprivation therapy and enzalutamide has been shown to make
           patients with advanced (metastatic disease) live longer. The investigators want to see
           if using it earlier can increase cure rate of surgery and identify genetic or molecular
           characteristics that are associated with better outcomes.

      Objectives:

      - To develop better ways of detecting prostate cancer before and after pre-operative
      treatment.

      Eligibility:

      - Men at least 18 years old with non-metastatic prostate cancer. They must be candidates for
      a radical prostatectomy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They
           will have scans and X-rays.

        -  Before starting the study drugs, participants will have:

        -  Vital signs taken, medical history, and blood tests.

        -  ECG heart test, with patches stuck on the skin.

        -  Small piece of tumor removed (biopsy) using image guidance from MRI and ultrasound.

        -  3T mpMRI. Participants will lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder. A probe
           will be inserted in the &lt;TAB&gt;rectum. They will be in the scanner for about 60 minutes,
           lying still. The scanner makes loud knocking &lt;TAB&gt;sounds. Participants will get
           earplugs.

        -  Participants will take the 2 study drugs for 6 months.

        -  Enzalutamide is taken as 4 pills once a day.

        -  Androgen deprivation therapy is given by injection 2 times over 6 months.

        -  During these 6 months, participants will visit the clinic monthly. They will have
           physical exam, vital signs, and blood drawn.

        -  After finishing the study drugs, participants will have another 3T mpMRI. Then they will
           have prostate removal surgery.

      Background:

        -  Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will present with intermediate or high-risk
           disease

        -  Many develop castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as curative strategies are often

      unsuccessful

        -  Treatment options typically involve radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT)
           in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)

        -  Even when cancers are initially sensitive to ADT, resistance ultimately emerges either
           through clonal selection or through a variety of adaptive mechanisms (secondary
           resistance).

        -  The recent introduction of novel androgen pathway inhibitors offers an opportunity to
           potentially improve the cure rate of men with intermediate and high risk localized
           prostate cancer

        -  There remains a great need for improved techniques to determine mechanisms of treatment
           response and resistance.

      Objectives:

      -To test the feasibility of multi parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for the
      localization and detection of focal prostate cancer both before and after pre-operative
      treatment with ADT and enzalutamide.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with nonmetastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer with intermediate or
           high-risk features

        -  Patients with testosterone levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/dL.

        -  ECOG 0-1.

      Design:

        -  Patients will be treated with ADT and enzalutamide for 6 months

        -  Two 3T mpMRI endorectal examinations (One at screening and after 6 month of treatment)

        -  Screening biopsy (MR/US guided) samples

        -  Standard of care prostatectomy(RP) following post treatment mpMRI

        -  All tumor specimens will undergo genomic analysis

                    -  Gleason 8 and higher OR

                    -  PSA greater than 20 at the time of diagnosis OR

                    -  Seminal vesicle involvement OR

                    -  Possible (on MRI) Extra-capsular extension (T3 disease)

          -  Patients must be eligible for and must be planning to undergo radical prostatectomy

          -  Patients must have testosterone levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/dL

          -  Men age greater than or equal to 18 years.

               -  Children are excluded because prostate cancer is not common in pediatric
                  populations.

               -  Women are not eligible because this disease occurs only in men.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL

          -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL

          -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

          -  The effects of enzalutamide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because androgen receptor antagonists as well as other therapeutic agents used in
             this trial are known to be teratogenic, male participants and their female partners of
             child bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence). Male participants should use a condom if having
             intercourse with a pregnant woman. Additionally, a condom plus another effective
             method of birth control is recommended during therapy and for 3 months after treatment
             for male participants having intercourse with a woman of reproductive potential.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

             conventional imaging studies (CT, MRI or Bone Scan).

          -  Patients who have received any prior therapy for prostate cancer with surgery,
             radiation, and/or chemotherapy

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to enzalutamide or other agents used in study.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease, e.g. New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes
             III-IV; uncontrolled angina, uncontrolled arrhythmia or uncontrolled hypertension,

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with known HIV are eligible. These patients are at increased risk of lethal
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. In addition, if patients are
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, there is potential for pharmacokinetic
