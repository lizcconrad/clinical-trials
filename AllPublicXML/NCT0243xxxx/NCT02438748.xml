      The main objective of this study is to determine whether biological stress markers (Oxidized
      Phosphatidylcholines) in the blood can be used to predict the efficacy of rTMS in the
      treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). It is our goal to identify biomarkers that may
      be used to determine which patients will benefit from rTMS treatment. A second objective of
      this study is to measure any changes in stress markers that occur across the course of rTMS
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients who have been prescribed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      therapy for the treatment of major depressive disorder will be recruited for this study.
      Prior to undergoing rTMS, patients will give a small blood sample. An additional blood sample
      will be given upon completion of rTMS treatment. 30 healthy control individuals will also be
      recruited to provide a one-time blood sample for comparison. Control individuals will not
      receive rTMS treatment.

      Blood samples will be analysed for levels of Oxidized Phosphatidylcholines. The investigators
      wish to determine whether there is a difference in the pre-treatment levels of stress markers
      between individuals who ultimately respond to rTMS and those who do not. Additionally, the
      investigators wish to determine whether there is a change in stress markers as a result of
      rTMS treatment.

      10ml of blood will be extracted at each collection. Patients will give two samples. Controls
      will give one sample. Following collection, blood samples will be spun to separate and
      extract plasma. The amount of oxidized phosphatidylcholines in the plasma will then be
      quantified.

        30 patients with Major Depressive Disorder who have been deemed eligible for rTMS
        treatment. Eligible persons will be identified by a psychiatrist from amongst patients at
        the outpatient Neuromodulation and Neuropsychiatric Unit at St Boniface Hospital.
