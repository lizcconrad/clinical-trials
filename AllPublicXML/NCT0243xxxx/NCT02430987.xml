      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women with a
      diagnosis of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. CASUISTIC AND METHODS: This is a case-control
      study in postmenopausal women attend in Menopause Clinic of the Faculty of Medical Sciences
      of Santa Casa de São Paulo. The investigators will select women diagnosed with HSDD. All
      women will sign the Consentment term. Those selected will assess the prevalence of MS through
      the ATPIII criteria. Sexual function are assessed by questionnaire Female Sexual Function
      Index (FSFI). RESULTS: The investigators hope there is greater prevalence of MS in women
      after menopause with HSDD.

      The study was carried out in compliance with the protocol, the principles laid down in the
      Declaration of Helsinki (1996 Version), in accordance with the International Conference on
      Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and applicable
      regulatory requirement. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the
      Independent Ethics Committee. The diagnosis of HSDD was made by a clinician who was
      experienced and trained in the diagnosis of female sexual disorders using a structured
      clinical interview for FSD

        -  Participants had to be in a monogamous heterosexual relationship of &gt; 1 year's duration

           antiestrogens, fluoxetine or any long-acting hormonal implant in the 30 days prior to
           screening, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues and other hormones and inhibitors,
           benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine prescription sleep aids, sedatives and hypnotics,
           antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, St. John's wort, narcotics (unless
