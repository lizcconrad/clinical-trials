    <measure>Change in Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Pain will be measured by calculating the difference between the maximum pain score in the ED and the patient reported average overall pain severity in the past week using the 0-10 numeric rating scale for both measures.Change in pain will be reported as a negative number if the pain decreases (i.e. 10 -&gt; 8 = -2)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>For each of 15 common side effects, a side effect severity score will be obtained on a scale from 0 to 10.</description>
