  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that after application of MK-3475 activated PD -1 negatively regulates the
      activation of T cells through suppression of the path of PI3K / Akt.

      This study will identify the effectiveness of oral inhibitors of PI3K / Akt pathway in
      comparison with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

    <textblock>
      A humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1
      (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immunopotentiating activity.
      Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed
      on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its
      ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor
      cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells
      (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on
      APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the
      PI3K/Akt pathway.

      This study will identify the effectiveness of oral inhibitors of PI3K / Akt pathway in
      comparison with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

    <description>Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody. Information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) may be beneficial in Glioblastoma / Gliosarcoma.
Patients enrolling in phase 1 receive MK-3475 every 3 weeks, with the dose to be determined.
MK-3475 will be given intravenously over the course of 30 minutes</description>
