  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal study is to illustrate the safety and effectiveness of the
      StimGuard Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS) System in the treatment refractory urge
      incontinence. This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center, study in which 92
      subjects will receive a StimGuard SNS System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The StimGuard SNS System is utilized for the treatment of refractory urgency urinary
      incontinence as defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) Standardization of
      Terminology Committees Joint Report as the observation of involuntary leakage from the
      urethra synchronous with the sensation of a sudden, compelling desire to void that is
      difficult to defer. The system provides treatment by delivering small controlled electrical
      pulses to the sacral nerves, as these nerves have been shown to regulate the micturition
      cycle.

      In this study, subjects will be randomized into one of two groups with a 1:1 ratio after
      enrollment. Subjects will either be randomized to an immediate or a delayed activation group.
      An intraoperative test will be performed, and all subjects will receive a permanent implant
      if they have an appropriate motor nerve root response without significant discomfort at 5 mA
      amplitude or less.

    <description>The StimGuard Sacral Nerve Stimulator System is a wirelessly powered neurostimulator for urge urinary incontinence. This technology includes a quadripolar stimulator with an embedded receiver. The energy source is a small, external, rechargeable transmitter, which is worn by the patient. The transmitter sends the therapy program and power through the skin and to the receiver.</description>
