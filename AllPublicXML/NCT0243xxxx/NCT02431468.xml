  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study comparing different doses of
      bryostatin for the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease. The study is
      15 weeks in duration, including a safety and efficacy evaluation 30 days after the last dose
      of study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 150 moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease subjects. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to treatment with two different doses of bryostatin 1 or
      placebo. The primary analysis will take place after 12 weeks of treatment (7 doses).

             into study and the dose must not change during the study unless a change is required
             due to an adverse event or a clinically significant change in the patient's status.

          -  Use of a monoclonal antibody for treatment of AD within 1 year prior to screening

          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition that is likely to require initiation of
             additional medication or surgical intervention during the course of the study

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening

          -  Prior exposure to bryostatin, or known sensitivity to bryostatin or any ingredient in
             the study drug

          -  Any other concurrent medical condition, which in the opinion of the PI makes the
             subject unsuitable for the clinical study
