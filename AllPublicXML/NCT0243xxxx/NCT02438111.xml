  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether compositional and functional
      alterations of the gut metagenome may be related to AMD. The primary variable for this
      assessment is the composition of the gut metagenome which will be analyzed by shotgun
      sequencing to characterize the faecal metagenome. The secondary endpoint is to assess whether
      single nucleotide polymorphisms in CFH, ARMS2, C3, PLEKHA1, HTRA-1, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGFR and
      APOE genes which have been shown to be risk factors for the development of AMD and other
      macular diseases correlate with alterations in the gut metagenome .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most frequent cause of blindness in the
      elderly. Despite major research efforts in the last decades the etiology of AMD remains
      largely undefined and therefore treatment options are only very limited. However, there is
      evidence that nutrition and inflammation play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD . The latter
      is also corroborated by the finding that single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding
      complement factor H is associated with AMD . In addition to CHF other genes such as ARMS2,
      C3, PLEKHA1, HTRA-1, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGFR and APOE have been associated with development of
      AMD. Recent findings have implicated the gut microbiota as a contributor of metabolic
      diseases through the modulation of host metabolism and inflammation . Gut bacteria use mostly
      fermentation to generate energy, converting sugars, in part, to short-chain fatty acid, that
      are used by the host as energy source. Beyond short-chain fatty acids gut bacteria can
      provide some amino acids and contribute certain vitamins such as biotin to the host . The
      investigators propose to investigate whether compositional and functional alterations of the
      gut microbiota are a risk factor for developing AMD.
