        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject within the age limit range, is free of obvious health problems as judged by

               -  or, if of childbearing potential, must be abstinent or have used adequate
                  contraceptive precautions for 30 days prior to receiving the study vaccination,
                  have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such precautions for
                  two months after completion of the vaccination series.

          3. Subject is willing and able to comply with all required study visits and follow-up
             required by this protocol.

          4. Subject must provide written informed consent or the Subjects' legal representative
             must understand and consent to the procedure.

          1. Subjects with previous known or potential exposure to avian influenza virus H7N9 HA
             antigen and any other avian influenza including H5N1.

          2. Subjects who have had seasonal influenza vaccine within 6 months prior to enrolment or
             who will have seasonal influenza vaccine at any time during the study period

          3. Subjects administered with any other vaccine during the period within 6 weeks before
             the first administration of study vaccine.

          4. Subjects with confirmed or suspected abnormal immune function, immunosuppressive or
             immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,
             based on medical history and physical examination.

          5. Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to vaccines or a history of allergic

             immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the study
             vaccine. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          8. Known HIV, hepatitis B (HBsAg) or hepatitis C seropositivity.

             including acute pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as
             determined by medical history, physical examination and/or laboratory screening tests.

         10. The subjects would not be suitable for the vaccination if the screening laboratory
             tests show any of the follows

               -  ALT or AST &gt; upper limit of normal range (ULN);

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal range (ULN);

               -  Any significant laboratory abnormality as judged by the investigator

         11. Subjects receiving administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within
             the 3 months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or at any time during
             the study.

         12. Subjects with acute disease at the time of enrolment.

         13. Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine
             within 30 days prior to the first vaccination, or planned use of the abovementioned
             product during the entire study period.

         14. Psychiatric, addictive, or any disorder, which may compromise the ability to give a
             truly informed consent for participation of this study or adequate compliance.

         15. Any clinically relevant disease and/or abnormal laboratory findings (, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results of the study, or the patient's
             ability to participate in the study.

         16. Breast feeding or pregnant women or refusal to submit to a urine test to rule out
