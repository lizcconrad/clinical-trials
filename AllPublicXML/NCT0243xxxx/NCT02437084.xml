      There is general agreement that statin-treatment of patients with high cholesterol can
      increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in some individuals. This research proposal
      will study what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example high cholesterol or high
      triglycerides or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2DM. The
      investigators will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) works in
      regards to its effect on insulin action and insulin sensitivity to help further understand
      the possible cause of the increased occurrences of T2DM in people who are at risk for T2DM.

      Under Dr. Snyder, a Co-director of the study, samples will be collected for integrated
      Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP), a monitoring approach developed by Dr. Snyder and his
      research colleagues. The investigators propose to analyze iPOP of individuals who participate
      in this study during and after taking the statin. In this pilot study, analysis will be done
      on previously-known drug effectiveness but also untargeted drug's effectiveness, (other
      unknown benefits this medication may have) and drug effects such as those seen in some
      participants when given a statin. The hope then is to obtain a better understanding of how to
      perform a personal omics profile when taking drugs, which would lead to develop better use of
      drugs.

      1. Specific Aims There is general agreement that although statin-treatment increases
           incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in patients with elevated plasma low-density
           lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, the benefits of statin treatment
           significantly outweigh this untoward side-effect. During the last few months two
           manuscripts have been published that substantially increase understanding of the link
           between statin use and incident T2DM. Thus, Swerdlow, et al., based on evidence from
           genetic analysis and randomized trials, concluded that the increased risk of T2DM noted
           with statins is at least &quot;partially explained by HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR)
           inhibition.&quot; They also noted an association of weight gain with HMGCR variants in
           statin-treated patients, leading to the notion that decreases in insulin sensitivity
           contribute to statin-induced diabetes. In that context, Cederberg, at al. have recently
           shown in a large prospective study (n=8749 men) that participants treated with statins
           (n=2142) had a 46% increase in incident T2DM, associated with a 24% decrease in insulin
           sensitivity and a 12% decrease in insulin secretion.

           Since T2DM develops when insulin resistant individuals cannot maintain the degree of
           compensatory hyperinsulinemia needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance, the
           observations of Cederberg, et al. provide a mechanistic explanation for statin-induced
           T2DM at the most general level. However, significant fundamental questions remain. For
           example, what is the cellular/molecular link between HMGCR activity and changes in
           insulin action and secretion described by Cederberg, et al. ? In that context,
           relatively little attention has been given to the role that metabolic heterogeneity in
           patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations might
           play in statin-induced T2DM. Specifically, subjects with elevated LDL-C concentrations,
           whose plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are also elevated, are insulin resistant,
           hyperinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant as compared to those with isolated LDL-C levels
           . As such, this subset of patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations can be viewed as
           being at a &quot;tipping point,&quot; and any adverse effect of statins on insulin
           action/secretion, irrespective of how mediated, places them at enhanced risk to develop
           statin-induced diabetes.

           This proposal is based on the premise that identifying such subjects prior to statin
           treatment would have substantial clinical benefit, and the investigators primary goal is
           to demonstrate that a simple measurement of plasma TG concentration can serve this
           purpose. Consequently, the investigators propose to enroll nondiabetic volunteers,
           defined as being at high-risk for T2DM, free of known cardiovascular disease (CVD), not
           receiving statins, eligible for statin therapy according to ACC/AHA (American College
           for Cardiology/American Heart Association) 2013 guidelines [4], subdivided on the basis
           of their plasma TG concentration into those whose values are either &lt; 1.7 mmol/L
           (↓TG/↑LDL) or ≥ 1.7 mmol/L (↑TG/↑LDL).

           Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) Personalized medicine is expected to benefit from the
           combination of genomic information with the global monitoring of molecular components
           and physiological states. To further extend Dr. Snyder's previous research of integrated
           Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) by monitoring the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic,
           metabolomic, and autoantibodyomic information, over a 21-month period that included
           healthy and two virally infected states, the investigators propose to analyze iPOP of
           apparently healthy volunteers with dyslipidemia longitudinally before, during, and after
           taking drugs. In this pilot study, by performing unprecedented depth of omics analysis,
           analysis will done on the previously-known drug's efficacy but also untargeted drug's
           efficacy to obtain a better understanding of how to perform a personal omics profile
           when taking drugs, which would lead to develop better use of drugs Hypothesis: The
           results will demonstrate that: 1) individuals with ↑TG/↑LDL concentrations are insulin
           resistant/hyperinsulinemic and glucose intolerant, with a more adverse cardio-metabolic
           risk profile, compared to those with ↓TG/↑LDL concentrations; and 2) that statin
           treatment will accentuate the differences in metabolic variables and iPOP profile
           between the two experimental groups.

        2. Significance, background and Innovation i) Significance: The relationship between statin
           treatment and T2DM were initially focused on whether statin treatment increased risk of
           T2DM; and what was the clinical impact of this risk. More recently, attention has been
           given to understanding why statins increase risk of T2DM, as well as the clinical
           characteristics that help identify those at increased risk in order to mount efforts at
           minimizing this adverse effect.

      a. Statins and risk of T2DM: There is agreement that statin treatment is associated with an
      increase in incident diabetes. This adverse outcome seems to be a class effect, although Cho,
      et al. showed that the risk of new onset T2DM ranged from 7.8% (pitavastatin) to 3.4%
      (simvastatin), with intermediate rates for atorvastatin pravastatin, and rosuvastatin b.
      Mechanism of statin-induced T2DM: Swerdlow, et al have demonstrated the importance of reduced
      activity of HMGCR in the pathogenesis of statin-induced T2D, in particular the role of
      genetic variants enhancing weight gain and decreasing insulin sensitivity. However, given the
      pleiotropic effects of statins, a good deal remains to be learned concerning how changes at
      the HMGCR gene level modify insulin calorie-restricted diets, action/insulin secretion. Since
      Cederberg, et al. showed that both insulin action and insulin secretion are decreased in
      patients taking statins, it seems likely that more than one of the multiple mechanisms that
      advanced to account for T2DM in statin-treated patients contributes to this adverse effect c.
      Identifying those with high LDL-C levels at enhanced risk of stain-induced T2DM: Results of 3
      randomized clinical trials with atorvastatin demonstrated that &quot;baseline fasting glucose,
      body mass index, hypertension, and fasting triglycerides were independent predictors of
      T2DM.&quot; These abnormalities form a cluster, initially referred to as Syndrome X and attributed
      to insulin-resistance. Since insulin resistance is a predictor of developing T2DM it seems
      likely that the more insulin resistant before treatment, the greater the risk to develop
      statin-induced diabetes. Individuals with combined elevations of LDL-C and TG concentrations
      are insulin resistant and glucose intolerant and thereby at increased risk of T2DM.
      Furthermore, the investigators have demonstrated that a plasma TG concentration ≥1.7 mmol/L
      identified a subset of nondiabetic persons with elevated LDL-C concentrations, judged at
      baseline to be at high risk of T2DM, who were significantly more insulin resistant, glucose
      intolerant, and with a more adverse CVD risk profile, than those with a normal TG
      concentration.

      There are other possible approaches to identify individuals most at risk to develop T2DM when
      treated with statins, e.g., a diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome [MetS]. Thus, comparison of
      291 apparently healthy individuals in our data base, grouped together on the basis of having
      the MetS vs. a plasma TG concentration ≥ 1.7 mmol/L, revealed comparable cardio-metabolic
      risk profiles. For example, median fasting plasma insulin concentration, an excellent
      surrogate estimate of insulin resistance was almost identical in individuals with the MetS
      (13.05 µU/mL) or a plasma TG ≥ 1.7 mmol (12.5 µU/mL). Given this information, it seemed
      reasonable to continue evaluating on of the ability of a plasma TG concentration of 1.7
      mmol/L to identify those most at risk to develop T2DM when taking statins. More specifically,
      to combine our understanding of the phenotypic heterogeneity of individuals with elevated
      LDL-C concentrations with quantification of insulin action and secretion to address 2
      important unanswered questions:1) does a plasma TG concentration ≥ 1.7 mmol/L identify a
      subset at enhanced risk of T2DM and CVD; and 2) what is the impact of statin administration
      on insulin action and secretion in individuals whose plasma TG concentration is above or
      below that cut-point.

      ii) innovation: 1. The investigators believe there is not wide-spread awareness that there
      are two disparate phenotypes of individuals with elevated LDL-C concentrations, differing
      dramatically in degree of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance; rendering those with
      combined elevations of LDL-C and TG concentrations at enhanced risk of statin-induced T2DM.
      This proposal is the first prospective study of the impact of statin therapy on glucose
      tolerance, insulin action/secretion, and lipid/lipoprotein metabolism comparing these two
      phenotypes.

      2. The investigators are unaware of any previous evaluation of the adverse effect of statins
      on glucose tolerance and insulin action/secretion in individuals enrolled because they
      fulfilled predefined criteria to be at high risk of T2DM. This population was chosen because
      a retrospective analysis indicated that a plasma TG concentration ≥ 1.7 mmol/L identified
      them as glucose intolerant and insulin resistant. Thus, all volunteers enrolled in the study
      will be classified as being at high-risk by criteria outlined by ADA (American Diabetes
      Association) criteria.

      3. As indicated above, the investigators believe the phenotypic heterogeneity in subjects
      with elevated LDL-C concentrations is not well-recognized. Not only will the results of our
      study emphasize that point, the iPOP profiles obtained before, during and after statin
      treatment may give us some potential genetic modulations responsible for these differences,
      as well as the impact at the gene expression level of mechanisms potentially involved in the
      adverse effects of statin on carbohydrate metabolism.

      c) Research Approach

      1. Overview: This pilot study will be an open-label, parallel group, 2-arm study, to evaluate
      the diabetogenic effect of atorvastatin ( 40 mg/day for 8 weeks) in nondiabetic individuals
      with isolated increases in LDL-C concentration (↓TG/↑LDL) vs. combined increases in LDL-C and
      TG concentrations (↑TG/↑LDL). The experimental population will consist of 20 apparently
      healthy volunteers, selected because they satisfy 2 fundamental criteria: 1) Increased risk
      of T2DM by ADA Standards of Care [15], and 2) LDL-C concentration ≥ 3.4 mmol/L. The
      experimental population will be further subdivided into groups of 10 each on the basis of a
      TG concentration &lt;1.7 mmol/L (↓TG/↑LDL) or ≥ 1.7 mmol/L (↑TG/↑LDL). Following baseline
      comparisons of the two groups, participants will be placed on a weight maintenance diet,
      treated with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin, and all baseline measurements repeated 8 weeks later
      with iPOP measurements done at baseline, week 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 and one month off
      atorvastatin. The goals of this study are to: 1) compare a number of cardio-metabolic
      characteristics in the 2 groups before administration of atorvastatin; 2) demonstrate that
      significant deterioration of insulin action and/or secretion as well as cardio-metabolic risk
      factors following statin treatment will be confined to those with combined ↑TG/↑LDL
      concentrations at baseline; and 3) correlate baseline and post-statin changes in
      cardio-metabolic characteristics. 4) Perform Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) in these 2
      groups before and after taking statins to compare the two groups in terms of
      treatment-associated changes in all baseline variables within each group and across groups
      and analyze not only previously-known drug's efficacy but also untargeted drug's efficacy.
