    <textblock>
      This project aims at investigating the genetic, genomic and proteomic basis of hypertension
      and susceptibility to hypertension-related end organ damage (renal damage and heart failure).
      It will include cross sectional as well as follow-up studies with a large number of subjects
      and variety of phenotypes, to explore the pathophysiology of hypertension and
      hypertension-related disease.

               -  Definition of hypertension for the index patient:

                    -  If untreated: Systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood
                       pressure &gt; 95 mmHg.

                    -  If already on treatment: Treatment with more of 2 different antihypertensive
