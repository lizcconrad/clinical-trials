  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the test toothpaste containing 1150
      parts per million (ppm) of fluoride (F) on the mineral content of demineralized enamel
      specimens, in an in situ caries model system, by comparing the differences in net
      remineralization change (ΔM) following use of the test toothpaste with a fluoride free (0 ppm
      F) reference control toothpaste.
