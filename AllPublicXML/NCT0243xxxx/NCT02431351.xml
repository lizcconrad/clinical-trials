    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the selective
      inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound, Selinexor given orally to patients with
      transfusion-dependent, EPO-refractory lower-risk MDS (Low risk and Intermediate-1 as defined
      by IPSS).

      This is a single-arm, open-label, study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound, Selinexor given orally to patients
      with transfusion-dependent, EPO-refractory lower-risk MDS (Low risk and Intermediate-1 as
      defined by IPSS). Patients will be dosed at the clinic on clinic visit days and received
      Selinexor for dosing at home on additional days.

      Patients will be evaluated for disease response according to the 2006 IWG response criteria
      for MDS. This includes evaluation for altering the natural history of disease, cytogenic
      response hematologic improvement, and quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Low risk or Intermediate-1 risk MDS with any cytogenetic abnormalities
             (according to the IPSS criteria); patients must have bone marrow biopsy/aspiration or
             tumor tissue available from within 1 month prior to first dose or collected during the
             Screening period.

          -  Patients &gt;18 years at Screening who are not candidates for hematopoietic cell
             transplantation.

          -  Received 1 prior line of treatment; typically erythroid-stimulating agents (ESAs).

          -  Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent anemia while treated with or after
             discontinuation of EPO. Transfusion dependence is defined as the requirement for at
             least 2 units of RBCs transfused during the 8 weeks prior to study initiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of recombinant EPO within 8 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Patient has a concurrent active malignancy or prior history of malignancy other than
             MDS (except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ of the
             cervix) unless free of disease for at least 1 year.

          -  Unstable cardiovascular function:

               -  Symptomatic ischemia,

               -  Uncontrolled clinically significant conduction abnormalities (i.e., ventricular
                  tachycardia on anti-arrhythmic agents are excluded; 1st degree atrioventricular
                  (AV) block or asymptomatic Left anterior fascicular block/Right bundle branch
                  block (LAFB/RBBB) will not be excluded), or

               -  Congestive heart failure (CHF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class ≥3, or
                  myocardial infarction (MI) within 3 months.

          -  Uncontrolled infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals
             within 1 week prior to first dose. Infections controlled on concurrent anti-microbial
             agents are acceptable, and anti-microbial prophylaxis per institutional guidelines is
             acceptable.

          -  Active bleeding Grade 3-4, in the last 4 weeks prior to enrollment.
