    <textblock>
      Prior studies have shown surgical excision of endometriomas are associated with a decline in
      ovarian reserve as assessed by serum anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels. However, the
      natural history of serum AMH levels in the presence of untreated endometriomas are unknown.
      Purpose of this study is to determine whether the presence of endometriomas cause a faster
      decline in serum AMH levels than in healthy women over a six months period.

      The study is a prospective cohort study. Women diagnosed with endometriomas by transvaginal
      or transabdominal ultrasound or MRI will be recruited from a tertiary care endometriosis
      clinic. Age matched healthy controls will be recruited from the staff of the same hospital. A
      priorly published historical group of women who underwent endometrioma excision will be a
      second comparator.

        The decision to include a healthy control group was taken five months after starting
        recruitment of women with endometrioma. Only 12 women with endometriomas had been recruited
        until then and none of them had six month serum AMH level measured.

        Since healthy controls were reluctant to undergo transvaginal ultrasound examination,
        antral follicle counts were not measured as another marker of ovarian reserve for healthy
        controls and some women in the endometrioma group.
