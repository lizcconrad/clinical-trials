  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency is an increasing trend in the United States. According to the NHANES
      data collection there was a near doubling of patients with vitamin D deficiency in 10 years.
      Vitamin D deficiency is associated with several adverse outcomes such as increased fractures,
      certain microbial diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic dysfunction. The
      increasing prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been attributed to the increasing
      prevalence of obesity. Several studies have shown that obese patients have lower 25-OH
      vitamin D (25-OHD) levels compared to nonobese patients and obese patients require more
      vitamin D compared to nonobese patients. The most commonly prescribed medication to replete
      vitamin D deficiency is oral ergocalciferol. To date, no prospective trials have been
      published to evaluate a standard protocol in the treatment of vitamin D insufficiency in
      adults.
