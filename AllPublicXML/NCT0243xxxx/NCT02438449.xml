    <textblock>
      It is estimated that about 25% and 40% of health care expenditures in Canada and USA
      respectively are wasted because of inefficiencies and not practicing evidence-based medicine.
      As health care resources are scarce it behooves all of us to use these in a cost-effective
      manner. The term &quot;cost-effective&quot; is used in the health care literature often but
      erroneously. Investigators compare a &quot;novel' intervention to a &quot;prevailing&quot; one and if the
      novel intervention is less costly it is labeled &quot;cost-effective&quot;. In a methodologically
      correct cost-effectiveness study however, investigators need to integrate both the
      effectiveness and costs of the competing interventions and calculate an incremental
      cost-effective ratio. If this ratio falls within acceptability thresholds, the novel
      intervention is labeled cost-effective. There are many techniques of breast reconstruction.
      The two most common approaches are the Autologous Abdominal Tissue (AAT) and the Tissue
      Expansion / Implant reconstructions. In this study these two most common breast
      reconstruction approaches after mastectomy due to cancer performed in the
      Hamilton/Niagara/Haldimand/Brant and Waterloo/Wellington LHINs will be investigated with a
      cost-effectiveness analysis coupled with a methodologically robust observational study.

      As a result of the recent advances in the treatment of breast cancer carried out by dedicated
      researchers and made possible through breast cancer research, its mortality has been
      gradually declining. Naturally, the quality of survivorship has taken an important role in
      the last 3 decades. Unfortunately, for most women with breast cancer, their concerns about
      survival are followed closely with concerns about body image, sexuality, self-esteem and
      social life. Mastectomy, a mainstay in the treatment of breast cancer, is the primary cause
      of these latter concerns. The investigators are therefore charged with looking at the disease
      and the respective treatment of breast cancer holistically. Providing a comprehensive
      management of breast cancer today requires attention to both oncologic principles and to the
      patient's quality of life. A large part of the patient's quality of life comes from improved
      reconstructive and aesthetic outcomes following mastectomy. In short, breast reconstruction
      after mastectomy for cancer aims to improve body image and quality of life by reducing the
      negative psychological impact of the deformity. Multiple techniques exist to accomplish this
      goal. They include breast implants, autologous tissues, or occasionally, a combination
      thereof. Although the ultimate goal is to recreate an aesthetically pleasing breast that
      attempts to match the missing one, the decision to use a particular technique is
      multi-factorial. It may be influenced by the surgeon's skills, the patient's preferences,
      inherent contraindications with a patient, or the resources available in a particular
      setting. Breast reconstructions can be costly to patients (indirect costs), third party
      payers and society, especially as new technologies are introduced in clinical practice. In
      the last 2 decades third party payers and governments in different jurisdictions have been
      advocating for production of evidence that shows &quot;value for money&quot; germane to these different
      procedures.Presently, the two most common approaches to breast reconstruction are the AAT
      method and the TE/I method. These two approaches to breast reconstruction have yet to be
      submitted to an economic evaluation using state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis.

    <description>The AAT-based breast reconstruction surgery will include any of the following techniques: pedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, Free TRAM, muscle-sparting TRAM flap, deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap, superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) flap, and Rubens flap.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Tissue Expander-Implants (TE/I)</arm_group_label>
    <description>The TE/I approach will include two-stage breast reconstruction surgery. In the initial stage, immediately after mastectomy and with or without sentinel node biopsy, an expander will be placed in the subpectoral plane and the defect closed. Two weeks after the surgery, the expansion of the TE will commence until the desired volume of the respective expander is achieved. The second stage will include removal of the TE and the placement of a permanent implant which may be either saline or gel. The delayed method will be similar to the immediate reconstruction with the exception of the incision, which will be relatively smaller as the mastectomy was performed previously with breast cavity being fully closed.</description>
