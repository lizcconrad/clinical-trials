  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limiting brain death-induced organ injury through a systemic anti- inflammatory medical
      management should allow for improvement in the quality of transplanted organs, and as a
      result, clinical improvement in post-transplant outcomes represented by a decrease in the
      incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) after transplantation.

      The specific aim is to evaluate the effect of C1INH (CINRYZE) as a donor pre-treatment
      strategy to decrease systemic inflammation and decrease the incidence of DGF in Expanded
      Criteria Donors (ECD), currently identified as donors with Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI)
      over 85%.

      This is a randomized, single-center double-blinded study.

      Donor Pre-treatment Strategy:

      The main objective is to identify the lowest dose that will allow an at least 80% decrease in
      the activity of classic pathway and Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) pathway of complement. The
      main objectives parallel observations in non-human primates in which animals receiving
      kidneys from donors in which activity of both classic and MBL pathways of complement were
      reduced by at least 50% with the use of C1 inhibitors displayed very mild or no delayed graft
      function after transplantation.

      This trial has specifically been designed to evaluate the beneficial effect of C1INH in
      kidneys with a high rate of delayed graft function (donors meeting the criteria for expanded
      criteria kidneys). The nomenclature of Expanded Criteria Donors (ECD) donors has now been
      replaced using the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI). Kidneys with a KDPI over 85% are
      considered equivalent to the old nomenclature of ECD donors. The selection of potential
      donors to be part of this study will be limited to the population of donors with a KDPI over
      85%. Participation in each group will be randomly assigned. C1INH or vehicle treatment will
      be administered within 6 hours of brain death declaration.

      A total of 36 brain dead donors will be randomized into 3 groups:

      Group 1: Control group: standard donor management + vehicle treatment (n=12) Group 2:
      Standard donor management + C1INH at a dose of 200 U/Kg IV single dose (n=12) Group 3:
      Standard donor management + C1INH at a dose of 200 units/kg IV single dose and heparin at 20
      units/kg/h IV maintenance until organ recovery (n=12).

      (Heparin and other glycosaminoglycans have been shown to have a profound effect on the
      regulation of complement activity in vitro and in vivo when combined with C1INH. For that
      purpose, C1INH 200 units/kg of C1INH in combination with heparin will be used to potentially
      reduce the cost of intervention. Based on preliminary data obtained in animal models, heparin
      dosed at 20units/kg will be administered in combination with C1INH. This dose represents
      approximately 0.25 units/ml, which has been tested to minimally alter partial thromboplastin
      time when a combination of the two drugs is used. When both drugs were used in a preclinical
      model (pig), an increased and synergistic inhibition of the classic pathway (approximately
      50% greater) was observed when compared to animals in which the C1INH was used alone.)
