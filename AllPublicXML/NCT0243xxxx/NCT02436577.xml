    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomised, three-period, three-treatment, crossover study
      in healthy Japanese male and female of non-childbearing potential subjects, performed at a
      single study centre.

      The objective of the study is to assess the bioequivalence of ticagrelor orodispersible (OD)
      tablets when administered with water and without water and ticagrelor immediate-release (IR)
      tablets.

             investigator.

          -  History of a clinically significant non-traumatic bleed or clinically significant
             bleeding risk, as judged by the investigator.

          -  Use of aspirin, ibuprofen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or any
             other drug known to increase the propensity for bleeding for 2 weeks before

Of the 44 subjects who were determined eligible, 1 withdrew consent and 1 was not needed as the study was filled. Hence, only 42 subjects were randomized and received treatment.</population>

        <description>An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. The term AE is used generally to include any AE whether serious or non-serious. A serious AE (SAE) is an AE that fulfills one or more of the following criteria: results in death, is immediately life-threatening; requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; is a congenital abnormality or birth defect; is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

          <description>Comparison of kel (elimination rate constant) of ticagrelor and its active metabolite AR-C124910XX following single doses of the OD tablet - when administered with and without water - and ticagrelor IR tablet. Blood samples for the determination of plasma concentrations of both ticagrelor and its active metabolite AR-C124910XX will be collected for each treatment period: 0 hours (pre-dose) and post-dose at 0.5 (30 minutes), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours (14 samples per treatment period).</description>
          <population>The PK analysis set consisted of all participants for whom at least 1 of the primary PK parameters, for a given analyte, was calculated for at least 2 treatment periods (where 1 of the treatment periods was the period in which the participant received the reference product [Treatment C]) and who had no major protocol deviations.</population>

          <description>Participants were assessed through each laboratory variables for any significant abnormalities. Hematology assessments included white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and others. Clinical chemistry assessment included testing levels of sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, albumin, calcium, glucose (fasting) and others. Urinalysis assessment included glucose, protein, blood and microscopy (if positive for blood or protein).</description>
