      It is hypothesized, that local retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis is functionally involved in the
      pathophysiology of depression. In a cross-sectional (and partly longitudinal) analysis, serum
      RA status will be assessed in healthy controls and subjects with Major Depression,
      Alzheimer's disease, alcoholism and in subjects with schizophrenia.

      Retinoids comprise of a group of small-molecule derivatives of Vitamin A with retinoic acid
      (RA) representing the biologically most active endogenous form. RA has multiple functions
      central nervous system (CNS). It is hypothesized, that local RA homeostasis is functionally
      involved in the pathophysiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases.
