    <textblock>
      PRO 140 2102 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial
      of observed systemic, long-acting, anti-HIV treatment with a monoclonal CCR5 antibody (PRO
      140) as an adjunct to a new, optimized, oral antiretroviral regimen in HIV-infected injection
      drug users with viral rebound and documented poor adherence to the previous antiretroviral
      regimen. Eligible subjects (approximately 76) will be randomized 1:1 to receive an optimized
      background antiretroviral regimen (OBR) plus supervised weekly subcutaneous treatment with
      either PRO 140 or placebo. Blood samples for safety and efficacy variables will be obtained
      over the 24 week duration of the study. Safety will be monitored throughout the course of the
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Exclusive CCR5-tropic virus as determined by as determined by the Enhanced Sensitivity
             Trofile™ HIV Tropism Assay

          2. Males and females, age ≥ 18 years

          3. Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL confirmed by second test while on the
             current antiretroviral regimen

          4. History of non-prescription injection and/or non-injection recreational drug use

          5. CD4 lymphocyte cell counts &gt; 100 cells/mm3

          6. Clinically normal resting 12-lead ECG at screening visit

          7. Women of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Late
             Screening Visit. Within hours prior to receiving the first dose of study drug, women
             of reproductive potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test. Male and female
             subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process and agree to use one
             barrier method of contraception plus one other highly reliable contraceptive method
             from the early screening visit through week 24.

          8. Non-adherent, history of poor adherence to a previous antiretroviral regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CXCR4-tropic virus, dual/mixed tropic (R5X4) virus as determined by the Enhanced
             Sensitivity Trofile™ HIV Tropism Assay

          2. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding, or who plan to become pregnant
             during the study

          3. Diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis (defined as any active infection with hepatitis A
             or a new diagnosis of hepatitis B or C within 24 weeks of dosing)

          4. Prior use of any entry, attachment, CCR5 coreceptor, or fusion inhibitor, including
             PRO 140, experimental or approved

          5. Participation in an experimental drug trial(s) within 30 days of the early screening
             visit or during the study
