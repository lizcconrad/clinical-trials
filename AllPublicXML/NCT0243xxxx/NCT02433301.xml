  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of malignity in the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is rising in Denmark, 400
      new cases annually 1. 60% of the patients with GEJ cancer have disseminated disease
      (M1-stage) at time of diagnosis and are consequently unable to undergo curative intended
      surgery. The prognosis is poor, with 5-year survival rates of approximately 2 % for these 60%
      and the treatment only consists of palliative therapy 1. For the remaining approximately 40 %
      who are assessed as candidates for curative intended surgery, the 5-year survival rate is 33
      % 1. This emphasizes the need for further research and knowledge concerning tumour biology
      and spontaneous course of the disease.

      In Denmark, all cancer patients are enrolled in a specific cancer program. The primary
      diagnostic work-up for GEJ cancers includes gastroscopy with biopsy, blood samples,
      ultrasonography scan, Positronemissionstomography (PET) and Computed tomography (CT) alone or
      PET/CT in combination 2. From these parameters physicians determine resectability and
      TNM-stage (tumour staging), which is substantial for the prognosis and future treatment. The
      primary goal is to achieve a macroscopically resection of tumour and lymphnodes in relation
      to the stomach and oesophagus (Esophagectomi a.m. Ivor Lewis and D1+ lymphadenectomy in the
      abdomen and thorax). In addition to surgery, patients receive perioperative chemotherapy,
      which consist of three series of chemotherapy preoperative and three series postoperative
      approximately 21-28 days after surgery.

      Approximately 12.6 % of patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy prior to surgery will
      have disease progression due to chemotherapy resistance during the therapy 3. This
      unintentionally leads to shifting these patients from the resectable group to non-resectable
      group (palliative treatment). Thus, the possibility for detecting response to perioperative
      chemotherapy is of great interest. A paradigm shift towards an individualised tailored
      therapy form has emerged in recent years, which potentially require a higher need for
      diagnosis on molecular level. Today most molecular biological methods apply tissue samples
      for in-vitro analyses, but new radiological tools provide opportunity for non-invasive
      examinations; for example PET can with a radioactive sugar compound: Flour-18 deoxyglucose
      (18F-FDG). This compound is injected through a catheter in a larger vein (media cubiti vein)
      and absorbed in cells with increased metabolism - especially cancer cells. A PET scanner
      registers the absorption; this radiology modality can provide valid information, which is
      essential for non-invasive tumour staging and monitoring response under a specific therapy.

      A new diagnostic modality is PET scan combinated with magnetic resonance (PET/MR)
      simultaneously. So far, no studies have conducted an evaluation of simultaneous PET/MR scan
      to assess the perioperative chemotherapy response in patients with GEJ cancer. However, some
      studies suggest that commercially available PET/MR scanner might contribute in a diagnostic
      elucidation 6. Simultaneous PET/MR scan might in theory minimize the misinterpretations of
      potential response changes after chemotherapy, which can appear in the interval between
      separate PET, CT and MR scans 4,5,7. Studies have found PET scan of GEJ cancer could be
      helpful as a prognostic tool to differentiate between responders and non-responders during
      chemotherapy 9. Standardized uptake value (SUV) is a unit that display the absorption of
      18F-FDG and is used routinely to quantify tumour glucose metabolism in PET scan 8. A change
      of more than 35 % in SUV measurements before and after the induction of chemotherapy is
      considered as the definition of responders and non-responders in earlier studies 9.

      The MR technique is based on magnetic fields and radio waves. Diffusion Weighted Imaging
      (DWI) is a non-invasive MR-modality, which measures the changes in water diffusion (Brownian
      movements) throughout tissue. These changes are measured in Apparent Diffusion Coefficient
      (ADC), a parameter derived from DWI and reflects the change in diffusion 7. ADC and DWI can
      be used to differentiate between benign and malignant tumours, due to a larger cell density
      in malignant tumours. Consequently, malignant tissue has a decreased diffusion relative to
      normal tissue. ADC has been used as a factor in some studies to predict the response to
      chemotherapy 10. A single study has shown a rise in ADC-value two weeks after initiation of
      chemotherapy in patients with GEJ cancer, and demonstrated that the percentage change in
      ADC-value between the groups (responders and non-responders) is significantly different 11.
      Simultaneous PET- and MR scan might be very useful to evaluate the response to chemotherapy
      in patients with GEJ cancer compared with these parameters alone. The opportunity for a more
      individualised tailored treatment in future might be possible with PET/MR.
