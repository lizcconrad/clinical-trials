      Phase II open-label single-arm prospective multicentric clinical trial of PF-05212384
      (PKI-587) delivered by intravenous route. A 2-stage Fleming design will be employed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment is administered in cycles of 28 days for a period of 4 cycles. Patients will be
      treated on a weekly basis continuously during 112 days or until progression.

      Blood tests (hemogram) are assessed weekly before each injection of PF-05212384 (PKI-587).
      Bone marrow aspiration (myelogram) is performed to evaluate the response before starting
      treatment and before the start of cycle 3 (after two cycles) and at the end of the study
      (after four cycles). Good responders who continue treatment after four cycles will be
      evaluated by bone marrow aspiration (myelogram) every two cycles and after the end of
      treatment
