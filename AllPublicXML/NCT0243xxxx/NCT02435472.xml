  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a PI initiated, randomized clinical trial of exercise vs. usual care among men opting
      for active surveillance for prostate cancer. The AS RCT study is a randomized controlled
      trial of 16-weeks aerobic exercise (e.g., brisk walking) vs. usual care among 150 men with
      prostate cancer on active surveillance. After obtaining written informed consent, enrolled
      subjects will be scheduled for the baseline assessments. The men randomized to the
      Intervention Arm will engage in an individually tailored aerobic exercise program (home-based
      walking) following the principles of aerobic exercise training guidelines for adults as
      recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). The men in the Control Arm
      will be asked to continue their typical exercise practices for 16 weeks. Men in both arms
      will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline and at week 16, months 12 &amp; 24.
      Specimens from biopsy will be reviewed by the investigators' collaborator, GenomeDx, for RNA
      characterization and assessment of the genomic risk scores.

      There is also a non-randomized observational component to the study where we will collect
      biospecimens, survey, data, and administer one CPET. Individuals who will be enrolled to this
      group include those who do not meet all eligibility criteria for the RCT, or those who do not
      wish to be in a RCT, but are interested to participate in some lifestyle research. This group
      also provides us with a larger more heterogeneous population to follow long term to examine
      associations between exercise, biomarkers, fitness metrics, and clinical and psychosocial
      outcomes.

    <description>Arm A will engage in up to 4 walking sessions per week at 55% to 75% of the individually determined exercise capacity (VO2peak; determined from the cardiopulmonary exercise test performed at baseline) for 16 weeks. This exercise prescription will be achieved through ~ 4 sessions / week. Men are provided with a heart rate monitor to help ensure they exercise in their target zone. At baseline &amp; week 16(-7, +7 days), all patients will complete: (1) lifestyle and quality-of-life questionnaires, (2) measurement of weight and waist circumference (3) collection of research fasting blood sample, (4) transrectal ultrasound-guided clinical biopsy, and (5) cardiorespiratory fitness testing.</description>
