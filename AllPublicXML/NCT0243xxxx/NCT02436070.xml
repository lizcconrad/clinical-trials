      BACKGROUND Asthma is a prevalent and troublesome pediatric condition. In 2013, Emergency
      Department (ED) providers treated over 3,500 cases of asthma-related complaints at Children's
      Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota. Pediatric ED visits for asthma exceeds billions of
      dollars annually when including direct cost and lost productivity. Many of these visits and
      resultant costs are avoidable. Patients with well-controlled asthma do not typically exhibit
      these patterns, while patients with poorly controlled asthma show patterns of increased
      utilization of healthcare resources and lower quality of life. Evidence suggests that a text
      message reminder and educational program might positively influence pediatric asthma care
      practices.

      RESEARCH QUESTION Does a targeted ED based text message intervention program improve
      outpatient follow-up and routine preventive care in pediatric asthma patients?

      METHODS Study subjects will be block randomized based on age and insurance group. The
      experimental group will receive text messages with guidance towards follow-up care with their
      PCP and the importance of the flu vaccine for children with asthma. The control group will
      receive a series of educational self-care and health based text messages unrelated to asthma
      or the flu vaccine. Some self-report of behaviors will be captured via text message response.

      ANALYSIS Primary outcomes for the educational versus targeted text message groups will be
      compared use Chi-square tests. Additional adjustments may be applied for missing data or if,
      despite randomization, there is substantial imbalance between group in key covariates (eg
      race/ethnicity, insurance type or asthma severity.)
