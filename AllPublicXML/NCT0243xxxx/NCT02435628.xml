    <description>After enrollment, subjects will be given baseline measures to assess demographics, psychosocial factors, and health literacy. This assessment will occur online via Computerized Assessment Center. Participants will complete the PROMIS battery of measures assessing: depression, anxiety, anger, fatigue, pain behavior and interference, physical function, satisfaction with discretionary social activities, satisfaction with social roles, and health literacy. Participants will also complete the FFFHL scale.
Upon completion of the baseline assessments, the participant will meet with their doctor at the NF clinic for a routine appointment. Post-treatment assessments will be administered immediately after completion of the medical visit. This assessment will evaluate the participant's satisfaction with the appointment in the NF clinic using the MISS and CAHPS surveys. This will be done online via REDCap.</description>
