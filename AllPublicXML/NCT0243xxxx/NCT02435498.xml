    <textblock>
      This study's objectives are as follows:

      1. To evaluate the utility of a website to provide information and guidance about pain
      management in children 2. To educate parents about the pathophysiology of pain, proper use of
      analgesic medications and signs of pain in children 3. To reduce the functional impact of
      pain in children following treatment for fracture 4. To endow parents with confidence to
      manage their child's pain at home 5. To dispel misconceptions about the use and safety of
      analgesics in children 6. To increase awareness of complications of fractures such as
      compartment syndrome

      This study will compare the effectiveness of three mediums of parental education among
      parents of children treated for non-operative fractures in the emergency department (ED): 1)
      A novel website entitled, &quot;Online User-Centered Home Pain Management for Fractures&quot; (OUCH
      PMF) 2) An online educational video (OV) and 3) standard discharge instructions (SOC). The
      investigators primary goal is to see which modality results in a greater improvement in
      scores on a on a knowledge questionnaire. The investigators secondary goals are to see which
      modality results in better parental satisfaction, confidence in managing pain, and lower
      impact of injury on the child and family. As participants will receive the standard-of-care
      that includes a pamphlet on how to take care of the cast. During their stay in the ED,
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three aforementioned groups.
      Participants will then be given the pre-intervention knowledge questionnaire, followed by the
      intervention and then the post-intervention knowledge questionnaire, prior to being
      discharged. At 120 hours post-discharge, participants will be asked to access an online
      survey to obtain information about the functional impact of the injury on their child. The
      investigators goal is to compare online and video education tools in their ability to improve
      parental knowledge, confidence, and satisfaction regarding the treatment of fracture pain.
