  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In high perioperative risk patients, guidelines suggest intraoperative haemodynamic
      optimization by measurement of stroke volume (SV) to guide fluid resucitation.This strategy
      requires an invasive monitoring and learning. Some studies tried to find SV surrogates based
      on haemodynamic usual parameters. In an experimental hemorrhagic shock, SV was correlated to
      the pulse pressure (PP) / heart rate (HR) ratio.

      The investigators hypothesized that SV variations (ΔSV) would be correlated to the PP/HR
      ratio variations (ΔPP / HR) during fluid challenge, and ΔPP / HR would be able to detect a
      ΔSV greater than 10%.
