  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decisions about ICU beds allocations are made everyday, specially in countries with scarcity
      of ICU beds, such as Brazil. ICU triage, most of the time, is not structured, which may lead
      to faulty decision making, possibly leading to bad clinical outcomes. It has been shown that
      external factors may influence the decision making process. The investigators intend to
      evaluate the impact of bed availability and cognitive load on the ICU bed allocation process
      by submitting groups of individuals to a vignette based randomized controlled trial
      simulating conditions with or without increased cognitive load and conditions with or without
      scarcity of ICU beds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vignettes will be constructed based on consecutive patients for whom ICU bed was solicited.
      Vignettes will be validated through the evaluation of 8 experts in situations with or without
      bed scarcity. Vignettes with more than 80% concordance on ICU disposition (admission or
      refusion) will be used in the trial.

      Intensive care doctors in Brazil will be asked to answer an online questionnaire with
      demographic characteristics and randomized to one of two groups. The experimental group will
      be submitted to increased cognitive load conditions, meaning that they will be encouraged to
      give their first impression on the vignettes, will have a time limit to answer the questions
      and will have popups with sound and videos, with the purpose to distract the respondents. The
      control group will be encouraged to think thoroughly and will have no time limit or
      distractions.

      Vignettes will be presented, randomly, in conditions with or without scarcity of ICU beds to
      both groups. So, respondents with and without increased cognitive load will evaluate
      vignettes in conditions with and without scarcity of ICU beds.
