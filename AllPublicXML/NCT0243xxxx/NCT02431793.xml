  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of an electronic health record based
      strategy in promoting safe use of opioid medications after an Emergency Department visit. The
      EHR-based strategy was designed to enhance provider counseling about opioids and to
      standardize and simplify the information that patients receive.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that patients frequently leave the emergency department without sufficient
      knowledge about how to safely use their newly prescribed opioid pain relievers. Additionally,
      educational interventions have the ability to increase patient knowledge about medications.
      In this study, education interventions will be implemented at the level of the EHR and prompt
      increased provider counseling with a goal of improving patient knowledge and safe use of
      opioids after ED discharge.

      The investigators will conduct a three-arm provider randomized controlled trial among
      English-speaking adults prescribed hydrocodone-acetaminophen to evaluate the effectiveness of
      the EMC2 strategy, with and without SMS text reminders, to improve patient understanding and
      safe use of their medication compared to usual care. This study will be conducted at an
      urban, academic emergency department (annual volume &gt;85,000 patient visits) in Chicago, IL.
      English speaking patients will be recruited and assessed in person at baseline, and by phone
      at 2-4 days, 7-14 days, and 1 month after recruitment.

    <time_frame>7-14 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's ability to demonstrate correctly dosing their prescription opioid-acetaminophen pain reliever will be assessed through a series of questions. Correct dosing will be scored for each medication as yes/no reflecting having demonstrated all of the following: proper dose (# of pills), appropriate spacing (hours between doses), and total daily dose (not exceeding recommended daily dose).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4, 7-14, and 30 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The identification of the medications purpose, side effects, risks, warnings and benefits will be assessed through a structured questionnaire. Patients will be asked about each of the above via structured, open-ended items. Additionally, select questions from the validated Patient Opioid Education Measure and patient satisfaction questions will be included.</description>

    <measure>Medication Use</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4, 7-14, and 30 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients medication use will be assessed through a combination of a home medication diary (collected at 7-14 days post enrollment), pill count, and patient report of medication use, refills and pain scores through structured questions about use in the past 24 hours (at 2-4, 7-14 and 30 days). Additionally, select questions from the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) and Beliefs about Medications (BMQ) will be used.</description>

    <description>Patients of providers randomized to EMC2 arm will received educational tool from the ED to support the understanding and safe use of opioids.
A single-page medication information sheet with content from a patients perspective and following health literacy best practices.
Prescribing instructions will be adapted to the Universal Medication Scheduled Take-Wait-Stop regimen for both the prescribing and dispensing of the medicine. This format uses simplified text and numeric characters to detail dose.
Provider counseling prompts: The providers for patients in this arm will be prompted to encourage counseling both in the ED and at follow-up time points. These prompts include: 1) An automated prompt to the ED physician upon signing the order; 2) an automated inbox message to the PCP (if an in-system PCP) notifying them of the ED visit, new prescription, and counseling request; and 3) a request for the pharmacist to counsel patient printed automatically on the prescription.</description>
