  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess the esophageal muscle (swallowing tube) in patients with
      and without achalasia to further understand and help direct the treatment for patients with
      achalasia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is currently defined solely on the basis of esophageal manometry. However, this
      fails to assess sensory function which may relate more to symptoms such as chest pain and
      heartburn. To date, the importance of sensory dysfunction in achalasia is poorly understood.
      The investigators want to define the relationship between esophageal sensory and motor
      dysfunction and symptoms in achalasia.

      Following standard diagnostic evaluation including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), barium
      esophagram, and esophageal manometry, symptoms will be assessed utilizing a standardized
      questionnaire. The subjects will then undergo transoral placement of an esophageal barostat.
      Following a standard protocol of esophageal distension, esophageal body compliance will be
      recorded with esophageal body pressure and volume. Mechanosensitivity will then be assessed
      utilizing a stepwise esophageal distension, with patients reporting symptoms utilizing a
      Likert scale. Patients will then undergo conventional achalasia treatment with either
      pneumatic dilation or Heller myotomy at the discretion of the treating gastroenterologist.
      Thereafter patients will be followed via a standardized phone survey at 3 months, 6 months, 2
      years, and 4 years after treatment to assess symptoms and treatment response. Patients will
      have standard clinical follow ups, including barium esophagram, at 1 year, 3 years, and 5
      years following treatment. Outcomes: From 100 new patients with achalasia seen yearly at
      Mayo, the investigators anticipate recruitment of 40 eligible patients over 12 months and 10
      healthy volunteers. The correlation between mechanosensitivity and esophageal body compliance
      with symptoms such as dysphagia, chest pain, and heartburn will be measured in Types I, II
      and III achalasia. The association of these parameters with conventional manometrically
      defined achalasia subtypes will also be measured. Finally, the relationship between
      sensorimotor dysfunction in achalasia and therapeutic outcomes will be assessed with
      development of predictive models to assess symptomatic outcome by barostat measurements.

    <description>The barostat (a thin tube, with a deflated balloon attached at the end) will be placed through your mouth down your esophagus (swallowing tube) to where your stomach and esophagus meet. The 10-cm long balloon will then be inflated with step by step pressure increases of 4mmHg for 30 seconds each to a maximum pressure of 50mmHg. The patient will rate discomfort during each step of inflation</description>

    <description>During this study, the investigators will ask you to fill out questionnaires about your swallowing, chest pain, and heartburn. The investigators hope the patient will answer all of the questions, but patients can skip any questions they do not want to answer. The questionnaires will take about 15 minutes to complete.
A urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing years.
Patients will be asked to fast overnight (nothing to eat or drink for 8 hours) prior to the barostat test.
At this point healthy controls have completed the study.
Patients with achalasia will then undergo treatment for achalasia at the discretion of the primary clinician managing their case.
Patients will be contacted to complete a phone survey 3 &amp; 6 months and 2 &amp; 4 years after treatment.</description>
