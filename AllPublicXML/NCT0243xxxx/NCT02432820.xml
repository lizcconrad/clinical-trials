      SPECIFIC STUDY AIMS

        1. To evaluate congruence between pelvic anatomical structures segmented on MRI and/or CT
           scans co-registered with transperineal US scans acquired with an optically and/or
           electromagnetically tracked matrix array ultrasound transducer.

        2. To estimate the achievable accuracy of anatomy tracking based on 3D US matrix-array
           transducer imaging and grey-level based image registration algorithms.

    <description>The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of 3D ultrasound (US) to visualize the prostate with sufficient clarity and reliability to monitor and model anatomy motion and deformation. If this research study is successful in its findings, this mode of ultrasound imaging will have the ability to be adapted for the purposes of cost-efficient prostate radiotherapy.</description>
