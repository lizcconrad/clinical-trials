  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study utilizes microEEG (a novel miniaturized, FDA approved EEG device) to prospectively
      investigate the cerebral electrical activity of infants with Apnea, Bradycardia and
      Desaturation events. This project will also assess the feasibility of using the microEEG
      device in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) setting and the feasibility of remote
      centralized interpretation in this setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most preterm infants have episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing), bradycardia (low heart
      rate), and desaturations (low levels of oxygen in the blood) (ABD events). The resolution of
      ABD episodes depends to a large extent on the maturation of the central nervous system (CNS).
      The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a reliable and noninvasive tool for recording the
      electrical activity of the CNS. The relationship between ABD events and cerebral electrical
      activity has not been well investigated. The investigators seek to examine the relationship
      between EEG findings and the resolution of ABD events in the developing premature infant.

      To investigate this relationship and obtain findings which are relevant to clinical care, a
      variety of obstacles need to be overcome. Among these obstacles is the high cost of standard
      EEG machines, inability of most standard machines to operate in electrically-noisy
      environments such as the NICU, and the absence of full-time coverage neurologists for prompt
      EEG interpretation. The investigators seek to determine the feasibility of obtaining an
      artifact-free EEG in the NICU with accurate detection of background rhythm abnormalities. The
      investigators will utilize an existing digital wireless telemetry unit, the &quot;microEEG&quot; for
      the NICU for this purpose. The microEEG device is specifically designed to overcome obstacles
      to standard EEG recording.

      To address the shortage of trained pediatric neurophysiologists, the investigators will
      investigate the feasibility of a case management system for centralized EEG interpretation
      using off-site neurologists.

      Finally, the investigators will examine the inter-rater reliability of EEG interpretation in
      the developing premature infant. This will allow the development of consensus guidelines for
      EEG interpretations.

    <description>microEEG is a miniature, wireless, and battery-powered EEG device used to obtain EEG recording in challenging environment. All infants have an initial EEG at study enrollment. Follow up microEEGs will be performed at approximately 2-4 week intervals, depending on the Corrected Gestational Age (CGA).
If ABD events have not resolved at 34 weeks, an 8 hour recording will be performed prior to discharge or at 42 weeks CGA, whichever comes first. EEG will be assessed in 3 hour epochs. The EEG will be reviewed off line by two blinded neurologists and classified as normal or abnormal based on CGA and other findings. Follow up EEGs will be scored similarly, with emphasis on maturation.</description>
