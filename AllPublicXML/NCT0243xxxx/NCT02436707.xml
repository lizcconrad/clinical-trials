  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects new combinations of treatment will have
      this disease. In this clinical trial, the study treatment options currently are ibrutinib
      plus R-GDP, or R-GDP alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      R-GDP has been used to treat many people with lymphoma. Ibrutinib has been shown to benefit
      people with certain types of lymphoma. They have not previously been given together.

      This research is being done to try to find new combinations of treatment that may be better
      for treating patients with this disease. It is not clear however if these treatments can
      offer better results than standard treatment.

      The standard or usual treatment of this disease is treatment with rituximab plus gemcitabine,
      dexamethasone, and cisplatin (R-GDP).

             Gault formula).

        Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile or use reliable forms of contraception
        while on study. Women of child bearing potential and men who are sexually active must be
        practicing a highly effective method of birth control during and after the study consistent
        with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods for subjects
        participating in clinical trials. Men must agree to not donate sperm during and after the
        study. These restrictions apply for 12 months (1 year) after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test taken (either by serum
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG]) or urine) and proven negative within 14

        regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the
        trial to document their willingness to participate.

        Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients randomized on this trial
        must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there must be
        reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance) placed on
        patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure themselves the patients
        randomized on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment,
        response assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.

             suggestive of infection are eligible if they are HBV DNA negative and concurrently
             treated with anti-viral therapy. Patients with a past history of hepatitis C who have
             eradicated the virus are eligible.

          -  Patients who have been vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of
             randomization.

          -  Any other serious intercurrent illness, life threatening condition, organ system
             dysfunction, or medical condition judged by the local investigator to compromise the
             subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of ibrutinib capsules,
             or preclude safe administration of the planned protocol treatment or required
             follow-up, including (for example):

               -  active, uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, or viral infection;

               -  clinically significant cardiac dysfunction or cardiovascular disease.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females, or women of childbearing potential not willing to use
