  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The radiation therapy or ablation that the patient received as standard therapy treated only
      the tumors that were radiated or ablated. Radiation therapy or ablation plus pembrolizumab
      might lead to a stronger immune response that may control or destroy tumors that did not
      receive radiation therapy or ablation. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects,
      good and/or bad, pembrolizumab has on the patient, and the cancer that did not receive
      radiation therapy or ablation.

             or checkpoint pathways).

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
