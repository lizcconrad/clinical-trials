  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies the effects of black raspberry compounds
      (phytochemicals) on the bacteria in the mouth (oral microbiome) of current smokers and
      non-smokers. The oral microbiome protects the body from pathogenic bacteria. Smoking alters
      the oral microbiome and may increase the susceptibility to cancer by modulating normal
      host-bacteria interactions. Black raspberry phytochemicals may protect the oral microbiome of
      smokers and may lower their risk of developing oral cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of black raspberry phytochemicals on community dynamics within oral
      biofilms.

      II. Examine the effect of oral bacterial communities on metabolism of black raspberry
      phytochemicals in current and never smokers.

      III. Evaluate the efficacy of black raspberry phytochemicals and their metabolites in
      reversing the effect of smoking on oral host-microbial interactions.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive bioactivity of black raspberry phytochemical-rich delivery
      vehicle (BRB nectar) orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Participants receive placebo nectar PO QD for 12 weeks.

    <description>The analyses of the microbial shift data will use a two-factor (smoking and berry treatment) ANOVA model with interaction on the post-treatment minus baseline differences between appropriately transformed data. Unifrac distances and community similarity and diversity will be computed from the sequence data. The sensitivity of the Unifrac analysis to the uncertain knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships will be examined using draws from the posterior distribution of trees in a Mr. Bayes analysis.</description>

    <description>The analyses of the metabolite endpoint will use a two-factor (smoking and berry treatment) analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with interaction on the post-treatment minus baseline differences between appropriately transformed data. The number of transcripts as well as the level of each transcript (transformed values) will be used to compute a Bray-Curtis similarity Index between the community profile post-treatment and the baseline profile.</description>

    <measure>Gene expression levels using next generation sequencing (NGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The presence and abundance of mucosal messenger ribonucleic acid transcripts will be computed from the NGD sequence data. Variance stabilizing transformation will be applied to gene expression levels. The significance of differences between the two groups over time is then studied as changes in this contrast for smokers versus non-smokers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be periodontally healthy; this is defined as all sites with attachment
             levels =&lt; 2 mm and probing depths =&lt; 3 mm) and caries-free, as evidenced by a DMF
             (decayed, missing, filled teeth) Index of less than 5

          -  Subject must be either a current smoker or a never smoker; to define a smoker, we will

             as a current smoker; smoking status will be assessed by a questionnaire; since only
             current and never smokers are included, it is not necessary to measure cotinine
             levels; the number of cigarettes smoked per day and years of smoking will be used to
             calculate pack-years, which will be used as a measure of tobacco exposure; a never
             smoker is defined as a person who never smoked, or smoked less than 100 cigarettes in
             their lifetime, and who has not had a cigarette in over ten years
