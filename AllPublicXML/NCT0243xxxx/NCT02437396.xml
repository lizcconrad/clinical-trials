  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate oxidative stress and/or inflammation in patients
      with Gaucher disease type I using a series of biomarkers and correlate with measurements of
      currently used diagnostic biomarkers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will determine oxidative stress and/or inflammation related biomarkers in whole blood
      and/or plasma in adult subjects with Gaucher disease. Fifteen milliliter blood sample will be
      collected during three independent visits over a period of approximately 3 months. These
      samples will be processed to separate plasma from red blood cells and frozen until assays are
      performed. Standardized immunoassay methods and LC/MS based methods will be adopted to assay
      a series of biomarkers in these samples. These data will be correlated with currently used
      diagnostic biomarkers.
