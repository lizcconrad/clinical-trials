  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retro-prospective, single arm, sequential enrolment study to collect relevant
      clinical and radiological data in at least 156 subjects, at up to 10 sites in Australia, who
      have been implanted with the EMPERION™ Modular Hip System in primary THA procedures to assess
      its safety and efficacy over 5 years post-surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to demonstrate that there is no significant difference in
      survivorship at 5 years in the EMPERION™ primary stem compared to other primary stems for
      total hip arthroplasty.

      Investigational site personnel will review and screen clinical records for potential subjects
      to be included in the study. Eligible patients will be contacted and follow-up status and
      implant revision status will be assessed at this initial contact. The subject will be given
      the option to participate in a prospective 5-year on-site follow-up visit for which they will
      provide written informed consent. An HREC waiver of informed consent for study participation
      will be obtained for subjects who are lost to follow-up, deceased or are unwilling/unable to
      participate in a prospective on-site 5-year follow-up visit, allowing the inclusion of data
      from all patients implanted with the study device regardless of follow-up status and
      therefore eliminate selection bias.

      Data will be collected retrospectively from the subject pre-surgery, during surgery, at
      discharge and at 1-year follow-up found in their medical files and prospective data will be
      collected from the subject's 5-year Follow-up visit and documented on specially designed Case
      Report Forms (CRFs).

      Data to be collected include:

        -  Subject demographics

        -  Primary diagnosis for THA

        -  Additional relevant history and physical findings

        -  Post-operative follow-up findings at 1 and 5 years

        -  Radiological Assessment

        -  Revision by time points

        -  Adverse Events
