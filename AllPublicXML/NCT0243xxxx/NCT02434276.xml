    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active comparator controlled study in which
      up to 450 healthy adults age 18-64 years will be administered either one of two dose levels
      of VAX2012Q or a licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccine. The subjects will be randomized at
      a 1:1:1 ratio.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active comparator controlled study in which
      up to 450 healthy adults age 18-64 years will be administered either VAX2012Q or Fluzone.
      Four hundred fifty (450) subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 ratio of either 8 or 12 mcg
      VAX2012Q dose levels or to Fluzone® Quadrivalent vaccine.

      Randomization will be stratified for age (18-49 and 50-64 years). Subjects will be stratified
      by two age groups (18-49 and 50-64) and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either 8 or 12 mcg
      VAX2012Q dose levels or to Fluzone® Quadrivalent vaccine. 25-35% of the total study
      population will be recruited into the 50-64 age group.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the seroconversion rates at Day 21 for both
      dose levels of VAX2012Q.
