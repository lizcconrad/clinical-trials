    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether usual walking speed, measured by the 4 metre gait speed test
      (4MGS), and change in usual walking speed over 6 months predicts death and hospital
      admissions in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

    <textblock>
      This observational study is investigating a simple test of usual walking speed, measured
      using the 4 metre gait speed (4MGS) test in patients with a lung disease called Idiopathic
      Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Drug development for this disease is slow in part because there is
      a lack of reliable measurements that can assess the effectiveness of treatment. Death and
      hospital admissions are currently considered meaningful endpoints in research trials due to
      the lack of fully validated surrogate endpoints in IPF. Using surrogate endpoints could
      reduce the sample size, cost and duration of clinical trials in IPF perhaps permitting more
      rapid drug development. Slow walking speed has been shown to be consistently associated with
      survival and a risk factor for disability, institutionalisation and hospitalisation in older
      adults and people with another lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD). We are interested to see whether usual walking speed and change in usual walking
      speed over 6 months predicts death and hospital admissions in IPF patients. This will help
      inform us of the potential use of 4MGS as a surrogate endpoint. To do this, participants who
      consent to taking part in the study will be timed walking at their usual walking speed over a
      distance of 4 metres (13.12 feet) at one time point and then six months later. Incidence of
      mortality and non-elective hospital admissions will be assessed at 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  IPF diagnosis according to NICE guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant co-morbidities that would limit walking ability, exercise capacity or make
             exercise unsafe (e.g. unstable ischaemic heart disease, neuromuscular disease, severe
             hip/lower limb joint pain, peripheral vascular disease, lower limb amputation)

          -  Any patient whom the chief investigator feels it is unsafe to exercise (e.g. unstable
             cardiovascular disease)

          -  Any condition that precludes providing informed consent e.g. cognitive impairment or
             poor English
