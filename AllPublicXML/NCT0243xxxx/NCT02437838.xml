      The primary objectives of this study are to examine whether augmented renal clearance (ARC)
      compromises renally eliminated drug therapeutic serum concentrations in patients with
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to estimate the optimal dose needed to achieve therapeutic
      serum concentrations of the probe medication levetiracetam in patients with TBI.

      Purpose: The primary objectives of this study are to examine whether augmented renal
      clearance compromises renally eliminated drug therapeutic serum concentrations in patients
      with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to estimate the optimal dose needed to achieve
      therapeutic serum concentrations of the probe medication levetiracetam in patients with TBI.

      Participants: The population will be comprised of patients with traumatic brain injury
      requiring levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis admitted to the neurosciences intensive care
      unit

      Procedures (methods): This is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized pharmacokinetic
      study in patients with TBI. In patients who meet the inclusion criteria, a 12-hour urine
      collection for measuring creatinine clearance levetiracetam urine concentrations will be
      performed daily for 7 days. Serum levetiracetam concentrations will be obtained twice daily
      for 7 days.
