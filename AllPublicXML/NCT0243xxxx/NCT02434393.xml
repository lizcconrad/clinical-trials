    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to characterize the mechanisms contributing to
      cognitive impairment and accelerated cognitive decline in Late Life Depression (LLD).

      This is a non-randomized, observational, non-treatment study. One hundred and twenty (120)
      subjects who meet criteria for Major Depression or LLD will be enrolled for a period of 30
      months. Data from an additional 300 non-depressed subjects will be used from ADNI studies for
      comparison.

      Depression history, symptom severity and health information will be collected at the initial
      psychiatric visit to determine eligibility. A 3 Tesla (3T) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scan and florbetapir (18F-AV-45) amyloid imaging will be conducted at the ADNI clinic site
      visits. Collection of plasma and serum for biomarkers, clinical assessments and cognitive
      assessments will be conducted at two time points. Blood samples will also be collected for
      genetic analysis.

    <measure>Rate of Change in neuropsychological measures of executive function as measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test using total correct.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Digit Symbol subtest is a measure of attention, working memory, and information processing speed. Participants are presented with a stimulus sheet, and asked to write in the correct symbol that corresponds with a number keyed at the top of the page. A scaled score is calculated based on the number of total correct responses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Change in expressive language as measured by the Boston Naming Test using total correct.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Boston Naming Test is a measure of visual confrontation naming requires the subject to name objects depicted in outline drawings. The drawings are graded in difficulty, with the easiest drawings presented first. If a subject encounters difficulty in naming an object, a stimulus cue and/or a phonemic cue is provided. The number of spontaneous correct responses (maximum score = 30) and spontaneous plus semantically-cued correct responses (maximum score = 30) are recorded. The number of perceptual errors, circumlocutions, paraphasic errors, and perseverations can also be used to evaluate the subjects' language performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of change in learning and memory as measured by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test using total correct and delayed recall.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) is a list learning task which assesses multiple cognitive parameters associated with learning and memory. On each of 5 learning trials, 15 unrelated words (all nouns) are presented orally at the rate of one word per second and immediate free recall of the words is elicited. The number of correctly recalled words on each trial is recorded. Following a 20-minute delay filled with unrelated testing, free recall of the original 15 word list is elicited. Finally, a yes/no recognition test is administered which consists of the original 15 words and 15 randomly interspersed distracter words. The number of target &quot;hits&quot; and false positive responses are recorded.</description>
