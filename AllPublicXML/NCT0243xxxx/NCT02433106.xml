      A randomized control trial examining the effects of an exercise based injury prevention
      programme on postural control and jump landing mechanics. Randomization of 4 teams, 2 Gaelic
      football and 2 hurling teams to exercise intervention and control groups. Participants are
      tested using Y Balance test and Landing Error Scoring System (LESS).

      Gaelic football and hurling, a stick and ball game, are Irish amateur games components of
      explosiveness with the multi-directional nature of both games, in addition to the overhead
      activities and the high level of contact involved; makes it a high risk of injury, especially
      during match-play. Recent systematic reviews found that injury prevention exercise programmes
      can significantly reduce the relative risk of lower extremity injuries. Several studies have
      successfully incorporated exercise components including balance, plyometrics, strength,
      neuromuscular training, running and cutting movement patterns to prevent injuries in sports
      such as soccer, basketball, and handball.

      This study examines the effect of an injury prevention programme on 2 recognized risk factors
      for lower limb injury balance and jump landing mechanics.
