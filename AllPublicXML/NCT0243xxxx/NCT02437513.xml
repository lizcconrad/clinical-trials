  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal dysfunction is a problem that affects many patients after laryngeal cancer therapy
      (surgery or radio/chemotherapy). Laryngeal dysfunction is associated with higher incidences
      of aspiration and respiratory tract complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Current
      standard of care treatment to reduce the consequences of aspiration is often a tracheostomy
      which has its own risks and complications. The proposed study aims to describe the
      performance of a new CE marked medical implant, the NewBreez, in protecting the patient's
      airways from aspiration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspiration is associated with respiratory tract infections, reduced quality of life and
      increased mortality in patients. For chronic or unresolved aspiration, patients are often
      given a tracheostomy for safer breathing and greater protection of the airways from aspirated
      material. However tracheostomies are associated with risks and complications and do not give
      a 100% guarantee of aspiration protection to the patient. They also impact the quality of
      life in a negative way for many patients. The current study will evaluate the performance of
      a new intralaryngeal device for airway protection in a small group of patients who have
      chronic aspiration. The study will look at the overall performance of this device in
      preventing aspiration in this specific group of patients as well as determine any unforeseen
      risks of using this device in the identified group of patients. The outcomes will form the
      basis of future studies with larger groups of patients.

        Recruitment of patients will primarily be from the department of Ear, Nose and Throat at
        the hospitals participating in the study. Secondary recruitment could also include
        associated clinics that treat patients with laryngeal dysfunction and aspiration, such as
        swallowing therapy clinics, speech language therapy clinics, and linguistics clinics.
