  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label clinical trial to assess the
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of miltefosine using an allometric dose algorithm in the
      treatment of children with primary Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in eastern Africa. Efficacy
      and Pharmacodynamics (PD) will be assessed as secondary outcomes.

      The proposed study aims to assess whether drug exposure in children can be increased to
      equivalent adult drug exposure by using the miltefosine allometric dose given BID for 28 days
      in paediatric VL patients aged 4-12y and whether this dose is tolerable. The present study is
      also expected to provide the basis for minimum time to reach sufficient drug exposure for
      miltefosine activity to guide optimal treatment duration to be used in combination therapy
      for visceral leishmaniasis. The PK data will be assessed in this trial using a compartmental
      population PK approach.
