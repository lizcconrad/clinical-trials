  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the previous study, the investigators obtained the cutoff value of Bispectral Index to
      detect early deep sedation in patients with mechanical ventilation. Bispectral Index
      monitoring can be used as an adjunct tool in screening and confirming deep sedation during
      the early period of mechanical ventilation. In present study, validation test will be carried
      out to clarify the sensitivity and specificity of obtained cutoff value in screening deep
      sedation in patients with mechanical ventilation.

    <description>According to RASS evaluation, observations in each time point will be stratified into 2 situations: light sedation (RASS= 0 to -2) and deep sedation (RASS= -3 to -5). Diagnostic test analysis will be applied to determine the accuracy of BIS values in predicting deep sedation.</description>
