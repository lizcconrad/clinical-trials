      This project pilot tests an innovative clinical guideline translation and physician coaching
      model to promote adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the prescribing of opioid pain
      medications in primary care settings.

    <textblock>
      This project addresses the urgent need to promote the adoption of evidence-based practices in
      healthcare by pilot-testing an innovative implementation strategy. The implementation
      strategy aims primarily to reduce variation in opioid prescribing practices for chronic pain
      in primary care settings.

      The standard approach to improving medical practice involves groups of clinical experts
      reviewing the literature to produce clinical guidelines based on scientific evidence, and
      disseminating those guidelines by publishing them in medical journals. A clinical guideline
      has been developed for opioid prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain using this type of
      approach. The implementation strategy for promoting uptake of the guideline in primary care
      settings tested in this study consists of three innovations: (1) a process for translating
      clinical guidelines into a checklist-based implementation guide for clinicians, (2) a
      physician peer coaching model, and (3) implementation support using tools from systems
      engineering. This project teams the experts who developed the guideline for opioid
      prescribing with experts in implementation science and primary care to translate the
      guideline into an actionable, checklist-based implementation guide. If the implementation
      strategy is effective in this pilot test, it will be used in a larger cluster-randomized
      trial to test it against other approaches to evidence-based practice adoption.The long-term
      goal of this research is to improve the adoption of evidence-based practices in primary care
      by producing a generalizable model of change.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Physician coaching</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group includes 4 intervention primary care clinics that are part of the University of Wisconsin's Department of Family Medicine. These clinics will receive an organizational coaching intervention that includes in-person site visits and phone/email communication. Each participating clinic will designate one primary care physician to act as a clinic lead in working with the coach to coordinate an initial site visit (during project month 13, July 2015), a follow-up site visit (month 15, October, 2015), and communicating with the coach throughout the 6-month follow-up period via phone and email.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Control Group</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group includes 4 control primary care clinics that will not receive any intervention. A de-identified dataset will be created to examine differences in outcome variables between intervention and control clinics.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physician coaching</intervention_name>
    <description>The coach will present the latest research on the benefits and risks of long-term opioid use. The presentation will be followed by a brainstorming exercise where the coach joins the clinic team in experiencing clinical practices from the perspective of a patient with chronic pain. The coach will help the clinic team flowchart clinical workflows and determine the best course for implementing aspects of a checklist-based implementation guide developed to support adoption of the guidelines for opioid prescribing.
The coach will help the team implement ideas using Plan-Do-Study-Act change cycles. The coach will maintain monthly email and phone contact with the clinic lead and clinic team after the initial site visit to monitor implementation progress and offer advice.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        At each of the 4 coaching intervention sites, we aim to recruit between 3-7 clinical care
        providers with prescribing authority (e.g., primary care physicians, mid-level
        practitioners, etc.) to participate in interviews and focus groups. All clinic staff (e.g.,
        medical assistants, office staff) are welcome to participate in coaching site visits and
        follow up correspondence, but only staff with prescribing authority will be considered
        research participants.
