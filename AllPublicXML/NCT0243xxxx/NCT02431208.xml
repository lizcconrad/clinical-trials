    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and
      pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab alone or in combination with daratumumab and/or various
      immunomodulatory agents in participants with MM who have relapsed or who have undergone
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The planned duration of this study is
      approximately 36 months. Cycle length will be 21 days in Cohorts A to C and 28 days in
      Cohorts D to F.
