      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of CTL019 in pediatric patients with r/r B-cell ALL. The study will have the following
      sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation &amp; Lymphodepleting
      Chemotherapy), Treatment and Primary Follow-up, Secondary Follow-up (if applicable) and
      Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the study is 5 years from CTL019 cell infusion.

               4. Chemotherapy:

                  The following drugs must be stopped &gt; 1 week prior to CTL019 infusion and should
                  not be administered concomitantly or following lymphodepleting chemotherapy:
                  hydroxyurea, vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, methotrexate &lt; 25
                  mg/m2, cytosine arabinoside &lt; 100 mg/m2/day, asparaginase (non-pegylated)

                  The following drugs must be stopped &gt;2 weeks prior to CTL019 infusion:

                  salvage chemotherapy (e.g. clofarabine, cytosine arabinoside &gt; 100 mg/m2,
                  anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide), excluding the required lymphodepleting
                  chemotherapy drugs Pegylated-asparaginase must be stopped &gt; 4 weeks prior to

          -  Anti T-cell therapy: Administration of any T cell or toxic agent is strongly
             discouraged since residual lytic levels may destroy the infused CTL019 cell or prevent
             their in vivo expansion.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion may apply.
