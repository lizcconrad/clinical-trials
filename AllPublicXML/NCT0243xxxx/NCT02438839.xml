      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether curative chemoradiation of low rectal
      cancer is feasible, safe and effective in a multicenter study with results comparable to
      those of single center studies.

      Results from previous studies indicate that a considerable fraction of patients with low
      rectal cancer can be cured by a combination of radiation and chemotherapy alone and thus be
      spared from operation.
