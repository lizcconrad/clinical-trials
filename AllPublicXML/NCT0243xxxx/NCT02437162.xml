  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of ustekinumab, in adult participants
      with active radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), who are naive to anti-TNF alpha
      agents, as measured by the reduction in signs and symptoms of radiographic AxSpA.

      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has
      a real effect) study. The study consists of 3 phases; Screening (up to 8 weeks), Treatment
      phase: placebo-controlled (Week 0 to 24) and active treatment (Week 24 to Week 100), and
      Safety Follow-up (12 weeks after last dose). Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3
      treatment groups: placebo, ustekinumab 45 mg and ustekinumab 90 mg. The total duration of
      study will be up to 112 weeks. Participants will be primarily assessed for Assessment of
      SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 40 response at Week 24. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the trial.
