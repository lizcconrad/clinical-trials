  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AcceleDent速 device has been introduced to the specialty of orthodontics in order to
      reduce treatment time. The theory behind AcceleDent速 is that high frequency vibratory forces
      (30Hz) delivered to the teeth will stimulate the bone remodeling that is necessary for tooth
      movement to occur more quickly.

      Additionally, one claim of the AcceleDent速 product is that it may reduce pain and discomfort
      during orthodontic treatment.

      This study will be a parallel group, triple-blind randomized clinical trial comparing two
      groups of subjects with 12 participants in each group. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      one of two vibrational units, which will differ in frequency and/or amplitude of vibration.
      The subjects will be asked to change their aligners every week instead of every 2 weeks,
      which is common with Invisalign.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with malocclusions that require minor or no anterior-posterior or transverse

             treatment.

          2. Treatment must be dual arch in order for patients to qualify for this study.

          3. Patients must be 18 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with systematic diseases or syndromes

          3. Patients with current use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDs)prostaglandin inhibitors.

          4. Patients with generalized moderate to severe periodontitis
