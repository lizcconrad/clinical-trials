  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSIs) is one of the most common complications of upper abdominal
      surgery. Previous studies found that type of surgical incision, emergency operation or not,
      surgical duration, age of patient, body mass index, malignance duration, malnutrition,
      complications (diabetes, shock, anemia et al) and drug (Long-term use of corticosteroids) are
      closely associated with the incidence of SSIs. The general incidence rate of SSIs was about
      5% to 40%, although using the preoperative skin disinfectant and other methods to prevent and
      reduce the SSIs. And for the gastrointestinal surgery, due to the potential risk of
      infection, SSIs is an important problem which cannot be ignored. On the other hand, gastric
      cancer is one of the most common digestive system tumors, and gastrectomy is the primary
      therapeutic options. Therefore, it is important to compare the whether the different liquid
      (1% povidone-iodine solution or the 0.9% normal saline) wash the incision can influent the
      incidence of the SSIs.

      Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

        1. Preoperative evaluation Patients satisfied with inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
           informed to join in the clinical study and signature the inform consent.

        2. Randomization: Preoperative evaluation found that total or subtotal gastrectomy can be
           performed, the case will entrance into the Randomization period. Random numbers are
           computer-generated, with the third party applications.

        3. Procedures: The surgical treatments is adopted the conventional open total or subtotal
           gastrectomy according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer treatments guidelines, 2010,
           Version 3. Patients in the Group A using the mixed solution with 400ml,0.9% normal
           saline and 100 ml，5%, povidone-iodine solution， and patients in the Group B with 500ml
           0.9% normal saline solution to wash the abdominal surgical incision.

        4. Postoperative recovery: Postoperative recovery period need to collect those relevant
           parameters of all the patients. All the relevant parameters had definitely definition in
           the Case Report Form of this study which included the preoperative, intraoperative and
           postoperative clinicopathologic characteristics.

        5. Follow-up: Follow-up will last to the 30-day of the postoperative period. The
           postoperative complications is graded by the Clavien-Dindo classification. And the
           surgical site infections are the focus of this study.
