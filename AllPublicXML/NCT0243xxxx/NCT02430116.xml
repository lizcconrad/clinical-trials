      Background: The cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion(I/R) is one of the
      most important factors in the myocardial I/R injury(MIRI) undergoing cardiac valve
      replacement with cardiopulmonary bypass(CVRCPB),and Ischemic postconditioning (I-postC) can
      inhibit apoptosis of myocardial cells. Consequently, this study investigated the key genes
      and apoptosis signaling pathways of myocardium in patients undergoing CVRCPB.

      Methods: A total of 36 New York Heart Association class II or III patients with rheumatic
      heart disease (RHD) of both sexes, aged 21-59 years, who were scheduled for first cardiac
      valve replacement with CPB in the investigators' hospital from February 2014 to May 2015,
      were randomly divided into the following three groups (n=12 each): negative control group
      (NEG group); I/R group (POS group); and I-postC group (Treat group). In the Treat group, the
      procedure involved 5 min before opening the ascending aorta, aortic unclamping for 30 s, and
      cross-clamping for 30 s for three cycles, after which the ascending aorta was completely
      opened. The NEG and Treat groups were not treated. Thirty-six patients were assessed for
      arrhythmia and recovery of myocardial contractile function after reperfusion by
      electrocardiograms and degree of dependence on vasoactive drugs. The myocardial tissues of
      the right atrial appendage were obtained at 3 min before CPB was established in the NEG
      group, and at 45 min after opening the aorta in the POS and Treat groups. In all three
      groups, the myocardial tissues of the right atrial appendage were obtained and preserved at
      −80°C for further experiments. The right atrial appendage of three patients randomly selected
      in each group was fixed with RNA later (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a centrifuge tube
      overnight at 4°C, and then preserved at −20°C for RNA extraction. Human 12×135K Gene Array
      profiling of mRNA expressions was undertaken in human cardiac muscle cells. Differentially
      expressed mRNAs verified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR were subjected to pathway analysis.
      The mRNA expressions of AIF, APAF1, CYCS, Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-6, caspase-7,
      BCL2, BAG1, and PI3K were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The levels
      of myocardial apoptosis induced by I/R were investigated by TUNEL assays. The changes in MIRI
      induced by myocardial apoptosis were investigated by pathologic examination of the
      myocardium.
