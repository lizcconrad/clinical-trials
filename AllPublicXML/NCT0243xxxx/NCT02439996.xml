      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of different doses of intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) (1g/kg once, 1g/kg twice, 2g/kg once) for Kawasaki disease (KD) in a
      multicentre, prospective,randomised trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness recognized most often in young children.
      Coronary abnormality is the most serious complication preventable with intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration. Various treatment regimens of IVIG have been
      reported.The optimal administrative doses of IVIG deserves more observations.We will conduct
      a multicenter, randomized, prospective trial to determine the effect of different doses of
      IVIG (1g/kg once, 1g/kg twice, 2g/kg once) for Kawasaki disease. The KD children will be
      randomly assigned to three groups and were given different IVIG regimen (1g/kg once, 1g/kg
      twice, 2g/kg once)as initial treatment. Patient age, gender, white blood cell count,
      hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), red blood cell
      specific volume (HCT) , serum albumin, the fever days,and the cost of hospital stay will be
      analyzed among the three groups. The primary outcome is the duration of fever subsided and
      the incidence of coronary artery lesions .

    <description>Group C patients received IVIG 1g/kg per day once. The IVIG was started on the fifth to tenth day of illness. In combination with IVIG, the patients were administered aspirin at a dose of 30 mg/kg per day; this dose was reduced to 3-5 mg/kg per day after the fever disappeared for 3 days and the CRP value was ≤8mg/L. Patients who were admitted before the fourth day of illness were treated only with aspirin. Each immunoglobulin was administered at a dose of 1 g/kg for 10h.
Patients who did not respond to initial IVIG therapy were given a second dose of IVIG 24-36 hours after the initial dose at 2g/kg. Patients who did not respond to second dose IVIG were given methylprednisolone 10mg/kg for 3 days or infliximab 5mg/kg once.</description>
