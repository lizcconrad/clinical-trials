  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study has the following objectives:

        1. To determine predictors of time 2 and 3 (3 and 6 months post-ICU admission) depression,
           PTSD, satisfaction with life and quality of life in both patients and caregivers, after
           controlling for injury severity and impairment.

        2. To determine factors associated with patient and caregiver satisfaction with medical
           care at time 2 and time 3.

      The investigators would thus be able to identify the best time point for intervention
      delivery, intervention targets, and risk factors for chronic psychological distress.
