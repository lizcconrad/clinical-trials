      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when given
      together with docetaxel or gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with previously
      treated urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be
      cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or that has spread from the primary site (place
      where it started) to other places in the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with docetaxel or
      gemcitabine hydrochloride may be a better treatment for urothelial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) when given in
      combination with docetaxel or gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with
      advanced or metastatic platinum-treated urothelial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess in a preliminary manner the efficacy of this combination (overall response rate
      and progression free survival).

      II. To determine in an exploratory manner programmed death (PD)-ligand (L)1 expression in
      archival tumor specimens and to correlate this with patient outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms. (Patients who had received prior gemcitabine hydrochloride/cisplatin or
      gemcitabine hydrochloride/carboplatin [GC] or methotrexate, vinblastine sulfate, adriamycin,
      and cisplatin [MVAC] therapy are assigned to Arm A).

      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1.

      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV as in Arm A and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 8.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.
