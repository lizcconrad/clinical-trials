    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a systematic approach to
      pain assessment in the critically ill patients' outcome The investigators hypothesize that,
      patients who will undergo systematic pain assessment and they will have their results
      notified to physicians and nurses, will demonstrate favorable effects on pain intensity, more
      efficient use of sedatives and analgesics, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU
      stay, mortality, adverse events and complications, in relation to patients who will receive
      standard care alone. Moreover it is expected that they will demonstrate altered levels of
      plasma neuropeptides and biochemical markers in peripheral blood.

      Appropriate pain management depends on the systematic and comprehensive assessment of pain.
      Inaccurate pain assessment and the resulting inadequate treatment of pain in critically ill
      adults can have significant physiological and psychological consequences.

      The investigators will examine whether a systematic pain assessment approach can improve
      patients outcomes.

      120 ICU patients will be randomized either to control or intervention group. The control
      group will receive standard care plus pain assessments but nurses and physicians will be
      blind of these results. The intervention group will receive standard care plus systematic
      pain assessment and the results will be notified to nurses and physicians.
