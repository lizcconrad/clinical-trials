  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is a common and serious disease, the leading cause of death
      worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common and often under-diagnosed in
      coronary artery disease where it could be involved in the pathophysiology and perhaps
      prognosis. The entanglement of the two pathologies is actually quite well known, in
      particular the consequences of one over the other just beginning to be studied. Understanding
      the pathophysiology through new imaging modalities should improve the management of patients
      to propose new approaches.

      &quot;SAS-IDM&quot; is an interventional and prospective study conducted at the University Hospital of
      Montpellier. Patients will be divided in three groups depending of the results of the
      polysomnography: 1/ AHI &lt; 5/h: normal, without OSA ; 2/ 5/h ≤ AHI &lt; 30/h: mild or moderate
      OSA ; 3/ IAH ≥ 30/h: severe OSA. A treatment by CPAP will be proposed to patients of the
      group &quot;severe OSA&quot;.
