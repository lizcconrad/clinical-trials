  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Predictive equations are the main clinical tool for determining resting energy expenditure
      (REE). Thus, it is important to investigate the accuracy and agreement of these equations in
      different populations and context of diseases. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      the accuracy and agreement of predictive equations of REE in overweight women with polycystic
      ovary syndrome (PCOS). The REE of all participants was measured (mREE) by means of indirect
      calorimetry and predicted (pREE) through ten equations basing on the anthropometric
      parameters (Harris &amp; Benedict, WHO/FAO/UNU including weight, WHO/FAO/UNU including weight and
      height, Owen, Mifflin-St. Jeor, Institute of Medicine, Ireton-Jones, Müeller, De Luis and
      Lazzer).
