    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel group, multiple dose study, in subjects over 18
      years, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of one-hour intravenous
      infusion of MTP-131 administered for 7 consecutive days. Twenty-four subjects are planned to
      be enrolled into 4 cohorts of varying renal function, with each cohort consisting of 6
      subjects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is ≥18 years-of-age at the Screening Visit.

          -  Subject has signed an ICF before any study specific procedures are performed.

          -  Subjects selected for each cohort must satisfy the following creatinine clearance
             (CLCR) criteria (as determined by 24 hour urine collection and analysis):

               -  Cohort 1 - Normal Renal Function, 24 hour CLCR ≥ 90 mL/min

               -  Cohort 2 - Mild renal impairment, 24 hour CLCR ≥ 60-89 mL/min

               -  Cohort 3 - Moderate renal impairment, 24 hour CLCR ≥ 30-59 mL/min

               -  Cohort 4 - Severe renal impairment, 24 hour CLCR &lt;30 not requiring dialysis

          -  Have a history of stable renal impairment as determined by standard estimated
             creatinine clearance methodology (at least 1 month within the same descriptive cohort)
             and be in a stable physical condition based on findings of medical history.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use 1 of the following methods of birth
             control from the date they sign the ICF until two months after the last dose of study
             drug:

               1. Abstinence, when it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  subject. Subject agrees to use an acceptable method of contraception should they
                  become sexually active.

               2. Maintenance of a monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been
                  surgically sterilized by vasectomy (the vasectomy procedure must have been
                  conducted at least 60 days prior to the Screening Visit or confirmed via sperm
                  analysis).

               3. Barrier method (e.g., condom or occlusive cap) with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream AND either hormonal contraception (oral, implanted, or
                  injectable) or an intrauterine device or system.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has history of any concurrent medical condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, significantly increases the potential risks associated with
             administration of MTP-131 or any other aspect of study participation, with the
             exception of renal impairment.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating.

          -  Subject has history of cancer (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer), unless
             the subject has documentation of completed curative treatment

          -  Subject has history of renal transplantation.

          -  Subject has active inflammatory renal disease.

          -  Subject has a history of histamine intolerance (e.g., a known deficiency of endogenous
             or exogenous histamine degradation).

          -  Subject is currently receiving treatment with chemotherapeutic agents or
             immunosuppressant agents.

          -  Subject has positive serology for HIV 1, HIV 2, HBsAg or HCV.

          -  Subject has donated or received blood or blood products within the past 30 days.

          -  Subject participated in a clinical study involving investigational product within 30
             days prior to the planned date of study drug administration.

          -  Subject has a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity or allergy to any of
             the excipients contained in the study drug.

          -  Subject has a history of active alcoholism or drug addiction during the year before
             the Screening Visit.

               -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
