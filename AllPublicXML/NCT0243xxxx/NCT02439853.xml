  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study on Internet-based video-practice speech and language therapy for persons with
      primary progressive aphasia (PPA), behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), or
      related conditions.

      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of speech and language therapy on a person's ability to
           communicate immediately after treatment, 6-months after treatment, and 12-months after
           treatment.

        2. To identify the most effective speech and language therapy strategies for persons with
           these conditions.

        3. To determine the feasibility of Internet-based video-practice of speech and language
           therapy for persons with these conditions.

      The study will involve 12 to 15 session over the course of 12 months. Some of these sessions
      will be in-person at the Northwestern Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center
      (Chicago, IL), while others will take place over the Internet, using an online study portal.
