        -  Criteria: • Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has persistent asthma.

          -  To meet current asthma therapy requirements patients must be currently treated with
             inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) at a dose that has been stable for at least 30 days
             before the SV.

          -  Written informed consent/assent is obtained. For adult patients (aged 18 years and
             older, or as applicable per local regulations), the written ICF must be signed and
             dated by the patient before conducting any study-related procedure. For minor patients
             (aged 12 to 17 years, or as applicable per local regulations), the written ICF must be
             signed and dated by the parent/legal guardian and the written assent form must be
             signed and dated by the patient (if applicable) before conducting any study related
             procedure. Note: Age requirements are as specified by local regulations.

          -  The patient is a male or female 12 years of age or older, as of the visit when the
             ICF/assent form is signed (SV).

          -  Asthma diagnosis: The patient has a diagnosis of asthma as defined by the NIH. The
             asthma diagnosis has been present for a minimum of 3 months and has been stable
             (defined as no exacerbations and no changes in asthma medication) for at least 30 days
             before providing informed consent.

          -  The patient is able to demonstrate acceptable and reproducible inhalation technique
             with the DISKUS device and the Teva MDPI device.

          -  The patient is able to withhold (as judged by the investigator) his or her rescue
             medication for at least 6 hours before the SV and before all treatment visits where
             spirometry is performed.

          -  The patient has a body mass index (BMI = weight [kg] ÷ height2 [m]) within the 5th and
             97thpercentiles for the patient's age and gender. The patient must have a weight of
             115 pounds or higher.

          -  The patient/parent/legal guardian/caregiver is capable of understanding the
             requirements, risks, and benefits of study participation, and, as judged by the
             investigator, capable of giving informed consent/assent and being compliant with all
             study requirements (eg, dose schedules, visit schedules, blood draws, procedures, and
             record keeping).

               -  Other criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information.

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a history of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation that is defined
             for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated
             with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures.

          -  The patient is pregnant or lactating, or plans to become pregnant during the study
             period or for 30 days after the patient's last study-related visit (for eligible
             patients only, if applicable). Eligible female patients unwilling to employ
             appropriate contraceptive measures to ensure that pregnancy will not occur during the
             study will be excluded. Any patient becoming pregnant during the study will be
             withdrawn from the study.

          -  The patient has participated as a randomized patient in any investigational drug study
             within 30 days (starting from the final follow-up visit of that study) preceding the
             SV or plans to participate in another investigational drug study at any time during
             this study.

          -  The patient has previously participated in an Fp MDPI or FS MDPI study. Participation
             is defined as randomization to treatment.

          -  The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid, salmeterol, or any of
             the excipients in the study drug (ie, lactose).

          -  The patient has been treated with any known cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (eg,
             azole antifungals, ritonavir, or clarithromycin) within 30 days before the SV or plans
             to be treated with any CYP3A4 inhibitor during the study.The patient has been treated
             with any of the prohibited medications during the prescribed (per protocol) washout
             periods before the SV.

          -  The patient has either lost or donated ≥500 mL of whole blood within the 60 days
             before the first dose of study drug or the patient has received or donated plasma,
             white blood cells, or platelets within the 14 days before the first dose of study
             drug. Patients that have plans to donate blood or blood products during the study or
             within the 90 days after completion of the study are also excluded.

          -  The patient currently smokes or has a smoking history of 10 pack years or more (a pack
             year is defined as smoking 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 1 year). The patient may not
             have used tobacco products within the past year (eg, cigarettes, cigars, chewing
             tobacco, or pipe tobacco).

          -  The patient has a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral upper respiratory
             tract infection (URTI) or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI),

          -  The patient has a history of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years preceding the SV.

          -  The patient has had an asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids within
             30 days before the SV, or has had any hospitalization for asthma within 2 months
             before the SV.

          -  The patient has untreated oral candidiasis at the SV. Patients with clinical visual
             evidence of oral candidiasis who agree to receive treatment and comply with
             appropriate medical monitoring may enter the study. Note: Azole antifungals are
             prohibited.

          -  The patient is either an employee or an immediate relative of an employee of the
             investigational center.

          -  A member of the patient's household is participating in the study at the same time.
             However, after the enrolled patient completes or discontinues participation in the
             study, another patient from the same household may be screened.

          -  The patient has a disease/condition that in the medical judgment of the investigator
             would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation or that could affect
             the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition worsened during the study.

               -  Other criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information.
