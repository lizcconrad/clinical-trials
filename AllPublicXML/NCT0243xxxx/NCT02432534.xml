      Condition:

      Non segmental and active vitiligo of adulthood.

      Main objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of a daily treatment with atorvastatin 80mg/d combined to UVB
      compared to UVB alone in active vitiligo after 6 months of treatment.

      Methods:

      Prospective interventional bicentric study with evaluation blinded to the treatment received.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients from 18 to 75 year-old with active non segmental vitiligo. Active is defined by the
      apparition or the modification of vitiligo lesions with the past 3 months and under Wood's
      lamp examination hypochromic borders and/or spotty depigmentation.

      Interventions:

      After central randomization

        -  Arm A : atorvastatin 40mg/d for 1 months then 80mg/d for 5 months combined with twice
           weekly narrowband UVB treatment for 6 months.

        -  Arm B: with twice weekly narrowband UVB treatment for 6 months.

      Evaluation:

      Main criteria: Decrease of VASI score expressed in percentage Secondary criteria: Decrease of
      VETF score expressed in percentage. Variation of PGA and DLQI scores. Clinical and biological
      tolerance. Variation of CXCL10 levels in the serum.

      Length of the study:

      Inclusion period: 12 months. Length of treatment: 6 months. Statistical analyses and drafting
      the article: 6 months. Total length: 24 months.

    <description>Percentage of decrease in Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) score between baseline and 6 months after commencement of the study. In the VASI assessment, the body is separated into five sites: hands, upper extremities, trunk, lower extremities and feet. The extent of residual depigmentation is expressed by the following percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%. The VASI score is then derived by multiplying the values assessed for the vitiligo involvement by the percentage of affected skin for each body site and summing the surface of the lesions of all body sites together.</description>
