  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During lung surgery, mechanical one-lung ventilation is usually mandatory to provide
      appropriate surgical condition. However, not only mechanical ventilation is associated with
      inflammatory response, but also one lung ventilation will result in detrimental effects such
      as ischemia and reperfusion injury, and systemic inflammatory responses.

      Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 selective agonist. It was reported that dexmedetomidine
      decreased reperfusion injury, reduce the release of proinflammatory mediator and protected
      lungs from reperfusion injury in esophageal cancer patients who undergoing one lung
      ventilation from reducing oxidative stress metabolites. However, other details of protective
      effects is still unknown.

      High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an important proinflammatory factor. It was found to be
      related to ventilator induced lung injury in several condition. Animal studies also showed
      that dexmedetomidine reduces the expression of messenger ribonucleic acid in
      lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophage so that decrease the amount of HMGB1 release.
      However, clinical trials about these are still lacking.

      In this study, we will investigate the protective effects of dexmedetomidine to patients
      undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, especially on the specific inflammatory
      markers- plasma HMGB1 and other inflammatory cytokines (eg. interleukin-1. interleukin-6).
      This will let us to know the role of HMGB1 during one-lung ventilation injury and the effect
      of dexmedetomidine in regulating the release of HMGB1. This study will become a basis of
      further medical therapy in treating inflammation.
