  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to test a new computer program that reduces the blurring
      in the cone-beam CT scan and helps the doctor to better locate the tumor. The investigators
      want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, that this has on the patient and the way we
      treat the cancer in the lungs.

      The second purpose of this study is to test how well this computer program tracks markers in
      the images, compared to using radio signals to follow the markers.

    <description>Physician evaluation of patient setup accuracy will be performed using all available images and adjustments will be made as per standard practice. In addition, a respiration motion-corrected CBCT (daily for SBRT, weekly for standard fractionation) will be used to confirm the accuracy of Calypso-based setup. Patients will return for follow up at 3,6 and 12 months (+/- 4 weeks) following completion of radiation therapy. The following assessments will be performed at these visits: history and physical exam, diagnostic CT chest, and toxicity assessment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic proof of malignancy suitable for thoracic radiation therapy

          -  Patient is planning to undergo radiation therapy for primary or recurrent carcinomas
             of the lung or oligo-metastatic carcinoma to the lung.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%

          -  At least part of the tumor must be visible as observed in a diagnostic or planning CT.

          -  Able to have bronchoscopic placement of Calypso transponders as confirmed on a recent
             (within the past 8 weeks) CT scan.

          -  Able to breathe regularly for gated treatment, as measured with the Varian RPM system.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically significant active infections.

          -  Bronchiectasis in the region of the intended implantation.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to nickel.

          -  Other medical condition or laboratory value that would, at the discretion of the
             investigator, preclude the patient from participation in this clinical study.

          -  Deemed unable to safely undergo or tolerate flexible bronchoscopy as per institutional
             guidelines

          -  Unable to tolerate anesthesia or sedation

          -  Enrolled in any other clinical studies the investigator believes to be in conflict
             with this investigation.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or nursing

        Exclusion criteria for Calypso transponders:

          -  Implants in the chest region that contain metal or conductive materials (e.g., metal
             implants, rods, or plates) which Calypso Medical considers will interfere with the
             Calypso System's electromagnetic localization.

          -  Active implanted devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and drug infusion pumps
             since the effects of the Calypso System operation on these devices are unknown.

          -  Patients whose lung tumors are being monitored by MR imaging as part of standard
             clinical care. Implantation of transponders will degrade MR images.

          -  Posterior lesions that would be &gt;19 cm distance from Calypso detector plate.
