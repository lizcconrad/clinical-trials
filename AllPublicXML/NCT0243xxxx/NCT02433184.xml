  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to determine whether TNFi instituted as first-line therapy in
      early RA confers better outcomes (clinical, structural and immunological) compared to delayed
      TNFi start; implying particular dominance of TNF in early disease, a changing role of TNF
      with disease duration and hence, confirmation of a biological window of opportunity.

          -  Symptom onset within the preceding 12 months.

          -  Patients with active RA at baseline: clinical evidence of synovitis (or imaging
             evidence of synovitis in cases of uncertainty/subclinical disease) in hand and/or
             wrist joints evaluable by ultrasound and MRI, and DAS28-ESR&gt;3.2.

          -  Seropositivity for anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) and/or rheumatoid
             factor. If ACPA and rheumatoid factor are both negative, presence of power Doppler in
             at least 1 joint on ultrasound imaging.

          -  DMARD-naive (with the exception of previous exposure to hydroxychloroquine for an
             indication other than RA).

             a reliable method of contraception for the duration of the study and 24 weeks after
             the end of the study period. Acceptable methods of contraception are surgical
             sterilisation, oral, implantable or injectable hormonal methods, intrauterine devices
             or barrier contraceptives.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with DMARDs for the management of RA.

          -  Intramuscular or intra-articular (of non-target joint) corticosteroid within 28 days
             of the screening visit; intra-articular steroid of the chosen target joint within 12
             weeks of screening.

          -  Oral steroid of greater than 10mg prednisolone daily, or change in oral steroid dose
             within 28 days of study drug initiation at the baseline visit.

          -  Use (including use as required) of more than one NSAID, change in NSAID or change in
             dose of NSAID within 28 days of the baseline visit.

             imaging assessments. In patients with previous penetrating trauma to the eye, or
             patients at high risk of previous metal foreign body injury to the eye (e.g. welding),
             skull x-ray will be performed; these patients may be included in the absence of
             residual metal fragments on x-ray.

                  on chest x-ray/TB testing (in the latter event, a patient may be included if
                  treated with isoniazid and pyridoxine one month before starting the study and for
                  a further 6 months whilst on study treatments).

          -  History of other significant medical conditions, including:

               -  Severe pulmonary disease, defined as requiring previous hospital admission or
                  supplemental oxygen.

               -  Active or severe cardiovascular disease: uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial
                  infarction within 12 months of screening, unstable angina within 6 months of
                  screening.

               -  Other immunodeficiency disorders.

               -  Psoriasis.

               -  Renal impairment (creatinine ≥ 175µmol/L).

               -  Blood disorders: neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 2.0 x 109/L), thrombocytopenia
                  (platelets &lt; 125 x 109/L), or anaemia (haemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL).

               -  Abnormal liver function (alanine transaminase, ALT &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal).

          -  Planned surgery within the study period which is expected to require omission of any
             study medication of 28 days or more.
