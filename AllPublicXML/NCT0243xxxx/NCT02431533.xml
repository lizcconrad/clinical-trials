  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBS is a disorder of movement in the gut. People who have IBS may have diarrhea,
      constipation, or alternating bouts of both. IBS is not caused by injury or illness. Often the
      only way doctors can diagnose it is to rule out other conditions through testing.

  <detailed_description>

      Probiotics, particularly Bifidobacterium infantis, Sacchromyces boulardii, Lactobacillus
      plantarum and combination probiotics may help regulate how often people with IBS have bowel
      movements. Probiotics may also help relieve bloating from gas. Research is continuing to
      determine which probiotics are best to treat IBS.

      PX0612

      PX0612 is a probiotic which is composed of the following ingredients contained in a veggie
      capsule, being one dose:

      Bacillus coagulans 200 million colony forming units 16.0mg Bacillus subtilis 100 million
      colony forming units 4.8mg Enterococcus faecium 100 million colony forming units 0.6mg
      Fructo-oligosacharride a nutrient for the packaged product 600.0mg Total 621.4 mg Bacillus
      coagulans is a non-pathogenic, Gram positive, spore forming bacteria that produces lactic
      acid. Though not normally found in the gut. Bacillus coagulans strains have been used as
      general nutritional supplements and agents to control constipation and diarrhea in humans and
      animals.

    <description>All analysis will be conducted on 'Intention to Treat' basis. A comparison of baseline characteristics will be performed using t-tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon for continuous variables and chi-squared test for categorical variables. In order to account for any imbalance in baseline characteristics, test for differences in change in bowel movements between the 'intervention' group and the 'placebo' group will be adjusted for using multiple regression models (or analysis of covariance models). The problem of missing values will be checked for non-randomness and appropriate imputation methods will be applied when needed.</description>
