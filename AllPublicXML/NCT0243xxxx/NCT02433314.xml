    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, expanded access protocol, designed to offer treatment with SAGE-547 to
      subjects in SRSE, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SAGE-547 administered as a
      continuous intravenous infusion to these subjects

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects six (6) months of age and older

          -  Subjects who have:

               -  Failed to respond to the administration of at least one first-line agent (e.g.,
                  benzodiazepine or other emergent initial AED treatment), according to the
                  institution's standard of care, and;

               -  Failed to respond to at least one second-line agent (e.g., phenytoin,
                  fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, levetiracetam or other urgent control
                  AEDs), according to the institution's standard of care, and;

               -  Not previously been administered a third-line agent but have been admitted to an
                  intensive care unit with the intent of administering at least one third-line
                  agent for at least 24 hours; or who have previously failed zero, one or more wean
                  attempts from third-line agents and are now on continuous intravenous infusions
                  of one or more third-line agents and in an EEG burst or seizure suppression
                  pattern; or who have previously failed one or more wean attempts from third-line
                  agents and are now either not on at least one continuous infusion of a third-line
                  agent or are on one or more continuous infusions of third-line agents but not in
                  an EEG burst or seizure suppression pattern.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy with highly malignant/
             malignant EEG features

          -  Children (subjects aged less than 18 years) with an encephalopathy due to an
             underlying progressive neurological disorder

          -  Subjects who have any of the following:

               1. a GFR low enough to warrant dialysis for whatever reason, but dialysis is not
                  planned or non-continuous dialysis is planned;

               2. severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory shock requiring two or more pressors that is
                  not related to third-line agent use;

               3. fulminant hepatic failure;

               4. no reasonable expectation of recovery or life-expectancy of less than 30 days.

          -  Subjects who are being administered more than three third-line agents concomitantly or
             in whom the qualifying wean cannot be completed per protocol
