  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can result in a greater risk of adverse outcomes in
      HIV-infected individuals, including more rapid progression to cirrhosis and associated
      complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma. For this reason, as well as the shared routes
      of transmission between the two viruses, UK and International guidance recommends that all
      HBV-negative HIV-infected individuals be offered vaccination against HBV. Unfortunately,
      response rates in this population can be as low as 17.5 - 40% to standard vaccination
      courses. To improve this response, strategies such as the use of double dose of standard
      vaccines (e.g. Engerix B) is recommended in several guidelines for previous non-responders,
      although there is currently limited evidence for this approach. An alternative strategy is to
      use vaccines with novel adjuvants such as Fendrix and observational clinical data in the
      Investigators HIV cohort suggests that response rates can be as high as 81% of individuals
      achieving HBV surface antibody (HBsAb) levels &gt;100 in a group that did not respond to
      previous standard HBV vaccine courses. However, the cost of Fendrix is considerably higher
      than Engerix B and controlled trials are required to confirm whether this approach is
      warranted. Furthermore, insights into the potential mechanisms by which Fendrix may elicit
      better responses would be valuable in optimising future vaccine strategies in this
      population.

      The Investigators propose to conduct a randomised, open label, active-controlled pilot study
      comparing double dose Engerix B and Fendrix in HIV-infected non-responders to standard HBV
      vaccine courses, which will provide the necessary data to design and power a larger
      multicentre randomised controlled trial. Outcome measures will include the proportion of
      individuals seroconverting with HBsAb levels &gt;100 following each vaccination course, the
      magnitude and quality of the HBV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses elicited by each vaccine and
      the durability of the HBsAb response at 1 year following the end of vaccination.

      To compare the immunological responses in HIV-infected non-responders to standard hepatitis B
      vaccination courses to immunization with either double-dose Engerix B or Fendrix:

        1. Investigators will measure the proportion of individuals seroconverting with Hepatitis B
           surface antibody titres of &gt;100 (and ≥10) IU/ml at 8 weeks after the immunisation
           course, as well as the durability of this response at 1 year following the completion of
           the course. The primary aim will be to provide some preliminary data from a head to head
           study of these two approaches with which to power a larger multi-centre randomized
           controlled trial.

        2. Investigators will define the magnitude and quality of the Hepatitis B-specific CD4+
           T-cell response following vaccination, thus obtaining key immunological data to fill the
           knowledge gap in T-cell responses to Hepatitis B vaccination, required to support the
           rationale design of future multi-centre, randomized study comparing vaccination
           strategies in HIV-infected non-responders to standard Hepatitis B vaccine courses.

      The research is original. There is only one published study to date looking at the efficacy
      of double-dose Engerix B in HIV-infected non-responders to standard courses1. There is
      currently anecdotal experience of the use of Fendrix in this group from the Investigators
      cohort and others. There are no head-to-head comparisons of these two strategies.
