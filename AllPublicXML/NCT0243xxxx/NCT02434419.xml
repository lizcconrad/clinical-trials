  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

      Patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: those patients undergoing percutaneous
      electrostimulation (PENS) of the pectoral muscle combined with specific training (Group 1),
      those patients doing the specific training alone (Group 2) and those patients without any
      specific treatment (Group 3).

      The assigned treatment began 15 days after surgery and was maintained during 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) during 2014 was performed.

      Patients were randomly assigned using a random-number table into 3 groups: those patients
      undergoing percutaneous electrostimulation (PENS) of the pectoral muscle combined with
      specific training (Group 1), those patients doing the specific training alone (Group 2) and
      those patients without any specific treatment (Group 3).

      The assigned treatment began 15 days after surgery and was maintained during 12 weeks.

    <description>The participants underwent one 30-min session every week for 12 consecutive weeks. PENS was delivered by a needle electrode inserted in the medioclavicular line, 2 cm below the clavicle at a 90Â° angle towards the skin at a depth of approximately 1 cm. PENS was undertaken at frequency of 20 Hz at the highest amplify (0-20 mA) without causing pain. PENS was delivered simultaneously in both pectoral muscles.</description>
