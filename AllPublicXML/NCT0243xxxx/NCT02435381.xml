  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of treatment with carisbamate compared
      to treatment with placebo, on alcohol-induced stimulant and subjective effects in
      non-treatment seeking alcohol-dependent human volunteers.

      This within-subjects placebo-controlled experimental protocol will assess the effects of
      carisbamate (600mg qd) on the positive subjective effects of alcohol in non-treatment-seeking
      alcohol-dependent volunteers. Participants will receive study drug (carisbamate or placebo)
      from days 2- 4. On day 4, study drug will be followed by alcohol (0.8g/kg; 16% by volume) and
      a placebo beverage (1% by volume as a mask), both separated by 2 hours. Physiologic,
      subjective effects and BAL will be obtained after the alcohol challenges. Participants will
      be discharged on day 4 and asked to return a week later to repeat the study under the
      alternate study drug condition (active carisbamate vs. placebo).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be an English-speaking volunteer who is not seeking treatment at the time of the study

          2. Be between 18-55 years of age

          3. Meet DSM-IV TR criteria for alcohol abuse; participants may or may not meet criteria
             for nicotine dependence. Nicotine dependence is allowed but not required because most
             alcohol users smoke cigarettes.

          4. Have a self-reported history of using alcohol.

          5. Have vital signs as follows: resting pulse must be &lt; 90 bpm and the blood pressure
             must be &lt; 150 mmHg systolic and &lt; 90 mmHg diastolic.

          6. Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within normal (+/- 10%) limits
             with the following exceptions:

               -  liver function tests (total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) &lt; 3 x
                  the upper limit of normal, and b) kidney function tests (creatinine and BUN)
                  within normal limits

          7. Have a baseline EKG that demonstrates clinically normal sinus rhythm, clinically
             normal conduction, and no clinically significant arrhythmias

          8. Have a medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no clinically
             significant contraindications for study participation, in the judgment of the
             admitting physician and the principal investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet DSM IV TR criteria for dependence on drugs other than alcohol or nicotine.

          2. Have any history or evidence suggestive of seizure disorder or brain injury

          3. Have any previous medically adverse reaction to alcohol, including loss of
             consciousness, chest pain, or epileptic seizure

          4. Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as:

               -  psychosis, bipolar illness or major depression as assessed by SCID

               -  organic brain disease or dementia assessed by clinical interview

               -  history of any psychiatric disorder which would require ongoing treatment or
                  which would make study compliance difficult

               -  history of suicide attempts within the past year and/or current suicidal
                  ideation/plan

          5. Have evidence of clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined
             by the PI

          6. Have evidence of untreated or unstable medical illness including: neuroendocrine,
             autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or active infectious disease

          7. Have symptomatic HIV or are taking antiretroviral medication

          8. Be pregnant or nursing. Other females must either be unable to conceive (i.e.,
             surgically sterilized, sterile, or post-menopausal) or be using a reliable form of
             contraception (e.g., abstinence, birth control pills, intrauterine device, condoms, or
             spermicide). All females must provide negative pregnancy urine tests before study
             entry, upon hospital admission, and at the end of study participation

          9. Have any other illness, condition, or use of psychotropic medications, which in the
             opinion of the PI and/or the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or successful
             completion of the study.

         10. Currently seeking help for alcohol dependence.

         11. Subjects with or prone to clinically significant alcohol withdrawal.

             mL/min.

         15. Use of inhibitors/substrates for renal cationic transporters, or medications
             contraindicated with ethanol.

         16. A history of violence or aggression, assessed as part of the clinical interview at
             screening visit.
