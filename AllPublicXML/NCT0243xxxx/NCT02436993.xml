      The purpose of this phase II is to study the efficacy and toxicity of carboplatin and
      paclitaxel with pertuzumab and trastuzumab in HER2 positive and carboplatin and paclitaxel
      with bevacizumab in HER2 negative in the neoadjuvant setting for the treatment of breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES There are two study components, 1) to evaluate the treatment response and toxicity
      of the protocol, and 2) to investigate the role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to
      monitor and predict the final pathological response.

      Objectives for treatment study component:

      1.1 To estimate 2-year progression-free survival in patients with breast cancer with tumor
      more than 1 cm and/or with clinically detected lymph node treated with neoadjuvant weekly
      Carboplatin and Paclitaxel combined with Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab in HER2-positive disease or
      with Bevacizumab in HER2-negative disease.

      1.2 To measure the microscopic complete pathological response (pCR) rates defined as ypT0 or
      Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCis) tumors in patients treated with this regimen in the
      neoadjuvant setting.

      1.3 To assess complete clinical response (cCR) rates after treatment by physical exam and
      imaging tests (ultrasonography, mammography, or magnetic resonance imaging) clinical
      objective response rate (by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)) 1.4 To
      determine the toxicity of this regimen. 1.5 To determine treatment adherence and delivered
      dose intensity of this regimen.

      1.6 To assess the correlation between pCR and cCR. 1.7 To determine the rate of breast
      conservation following neoadjuvant therapy. 1.8 Determine treatment efficacy according to
      subgroups defined according to stage and receptor status.

      Objectives for MRI response monitoring study component:

      1.9 Develop quantitative analysis methods to obtain pre-treatment tumor characteristics in
      breast cancer (including morphological and enhancement kinetic parameters) and select an
      optimal set of features using the logistic regression analysis and the Artificial Neural
      Network (ANN) to predict pathologic complete remission (pCR) in HER2-positive and negative
      arms.

      1.10 Investigate whether the early response patterns in tumor (changes in percent tumor size
      or other tumor characteristic parameters) can be used to predict pathologic complete
      remission (pCR) in HER2 positive and negative arms.

      1.11 Investigate whether combining the pre-treatment characteristic parameters and the early
      response patterns can achieve a higher AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
      (ROC) curve) in prediction of pCR than those based on pre-treatment MRI characteristics or
      tumor response patterns alone.
