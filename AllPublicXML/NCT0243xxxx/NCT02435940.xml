      My Retina TrackerÂ® is a registry for people affected by an inherited retinal degenerative
      disease. It is a patient-initiated registry accessible via a secure on-line portal at
      www.MyRetinaTracker.org. Affected individuals and genetically related, unaffected, family
      members who create entries are guided to create a profile that captures the participants'
      perspective on their disease and its progress; family history; genetic testing results;
      preventive measures; and interest in participation in research studies. The participants may
      also choose to ask their clinician to add clinical measurements and results at each clinical
      visit. Participants are urged to update the information regularly to create longitudinal
      records of their disease, from their own perspective, and their clinical progress. The
      overall goals are: to better understand the heterogeneity of the inherited retinal
      degenerative diseases; to understand the prevalence of the different diseases and gene
      mutations; to assist in the establishment of genotype-phenotype relationships; to help
      understand the natural history of the diseases; to help accelerate research and development
      of clinical trials for treatments; and to provide a mechanism that facilitates more rapid
      recruitment for research studies and clinical trials.

      My Retina Tracker provides three different portals for data entry and review. An entry in My
      Retina Tracker is initiated by a participant, not a clinician. Using the Participant Portal,
      the participant establishes a username and password, is guided through on-line informed
      consent, and can then use an interactive guide to record their ophthalmic and family history,
      genotype and other subjective diagnosis-related information. Drop-down menus and standardized
      vocabulary are used for database consistency. They may also attach documents, such as medical
      records, to maintain personal files on their disease. Participants are encouraged to update
      their profiles regularly to create a longitudinal history of their disease. Participants can
      see aggregated data for all other participants in the registry and compare their own disease
      and status to others.

      Once a participant profile has been established, participants may ask their clinician or
      genetic counselor to add specific ophthalmic exam and measurement results to the profile.
      This is done through the Clinical Portal which also uses a series of drop-down menus to
      expedite entry and standardize data. Clinicians cannot see the participant data when adding
      the clinical exam data. Participants are encouraged to collect this data at each medical
      exam, to create a longitudinal clinical data set.

      Access to de-identified data is available through the Research Portal. Investigators may
      apply through the site for research access username and password. This access allows
      searching of both participant provided and clinical data and may also be used to pre-screen
      registrants as potential participants for research studies or clinical trials. A process that
      maintains patient anonymity and privacy protection, exists for researchers with Institutional
      Review Board-approved projects who wish to contact registry participants of interest.
