  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some premature babies develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of
      prematurity (ROP). BPD and ROP are long-term chronic diseases of the lungs and eyes,
      respectively. BPD is associated with receiving mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory
      distress syndrome, and causes lung inflammation and scarring. ROP is caused by poor
      development of blood vessels in the eyes, and may lead to blindness. Because not all
      premature babies develop BPD or ROP, researchers want to study the genes that could be
      associated with these diseases. They will look at both premature infants and their parents to
      see if there is a genetic component to BPD and ROP.

      Objectives:

      - To study genes that may be associated with BPD and ROP.

      Eligibility:

        -  Premature babies born with a weight less than or equal to 1,250 grams.

        -  Parents of the premature babies.

      Design:

        -  Parents will answer questions about the mother s health and pregnancy.

        -  Delivery and medical information will be collected during the baby s hospitalization for
           the first month after birth.

        -  Parents will provide a saliva sample from the inside of the cheek.

        -  A saliva sample will also be collected from the baby within 28 days of birth. If the
           baby needs tracheal aspiration (removal of fluid from the throat), tracheal fluid
           samples will also be collected.

        -  Parents will have followup interviews about their child s health 6 months, 12 months,
           and yearly for up to 6 years after birth.

        -  This is a genetic study only. Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      Understanding the role of susceptibility genes for risk of BPD and ROP may lead to immediate
      identification of populations who require personalized medical care, and to the assessment of
      innovative prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the future. Our purpose is to
      establish in our hospital network a prospective cohort of triads composed of premature
      newborns with a birth weight less than or equal to 1250 g and their parents, to examine the
      role of candidate susceptibility genes in the development of BPD and ROP. Our hypothesis is
      that the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes is associated with
      differential susceptibility to BPD and ROP. As an initial model, a loss-of-function
      substitution at position -617 of the NRF2 promoter region is hypothesized to be associated
      with a greater risk of severe BPD and prethreshold ROP in premature infants with a birth
      weight less than or equal to 1250 g.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Premature newborns with a birth weight less than or equal to 1250 g and their parents from
        the participating institutions that comprise the Fundacion Infant hospital network will be
        enrolled in this study after signing the informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Premature newborns with a birth weight less than or equal to 1250 g with cyanotic
        congenital heart disease, congenital anomalies of the respiratory tract (for example,
        tracheoesophageal fistula, pulmonary hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia), eye malformations,
        or congenital immunodeficiencies. Newborns from parents (mother and/or father) who used in
        vitro fertilization products from donor banks will also be excluded from participating in
        the study.
