      Urge urinary incontinence, characterized by unpredictable and embarrassing large volume urine
      leakage, is a major health issue for elderly women, as it is incredibly common and
      significantly impairs quality of life. Although anticholinergic medications are the most
      common therapy, the investigators are unable to predict an individual's response to a
      particular drug in terms of both effectiveness and side effects. Through genetic evaluation,
      the investigators have the potential to personalize and optimize drug therapy for millions of
      elderly women suffering from urge incontinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urge urinary incontinence (UUI), characterized by unpredictable and embarrassing large volume
      urine leakage, is a major public health burden to elderly women, given its high prevalence,
      impairment of quality of life, associated caregiver burden, and substantial economic costs.
      UUI is significantly more prevalent in older adults and disproportionately affects women,
      with a prevalence of 19% in community-dwelling women over 65 and 60-78% in long-term care
      female residents.

      Anticholinergic medications are the most common first-line therapy for UUI. Although numerous
      trials have demonstrated that anticholinergics are efficacious for UUI, the response to these
      medications is variable, as their effectiveness is often limited by poor response or adverse
      events (AEs), such as cognitive impairment or constipation, which are particularly
      problematic in older adults. Furthermore, a comprehensive systematic review concluded that no
      one drug is definitively superior, leaving clinicians without any evidence to guide
      decision-making regarding drug choice. As a result, UUI pharmacotherapy is empiric and not
      personalized, even though it is clear that individual variations exist in both response and
      toxicity. The treatment of UUI is especially challenging in the geriatric population, given
      their higher risk for AEs, polypharmacy, and pharmacokinetic changes that occur with age. The
      ability to predict which elderly women with UUI will experience low efficacy or develop
      significant adverse events from anticholinergic medications would be a paradigm shift in the
      therapeutic practice to this highly prevalent and bothersome condition.

      Pharmacogenetics may provide insight into how to predict response to anticholinergic UUI
      therapy. Research has already shown that genetic differences in drug metabolism impact a
      patient's drug response. For example, &quot;fast metabolizers&quot; may metabolize the drug so rapidly
      that therapeutic levels are never reached, limiting effectiveness. In contrast, &quot;slow
      metabolizers&quot; may develop high drug concentrations, resulting in significantly more AEs.
      While pharmacogenetic research exists for numerous classes of drugs, including
      anticoagulants, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors,14 beta-blockers, immunosuppressants
      and opioids, this type of translational research does not exist for anticholinergics for UUI.
      Thus, this proposed project represents a novel concept and unique opportunity to dramatically
      change UUI pharmacotherapy.

      Fesoterodine is an ideal anticholinergic medication to launch a pharmacogenetic study in this
      field. Fesoterodine's active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), is metabolized
      by a well-characterized cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme, CYP2D6. The CYP2D6 gene has several
      genetic variants, which result in different metabolizer statuses ranging from poor
      metabolizers (PM), intermediate metabolizers (IM), extensive metabolizers (EM), to ultrarapid
      metabolizers (UM). These different CYP2D6 profiles may be clinically important, as they may
      contribute to the variability in efficacy and AEs. In fact, pharmaceutical company data for
      fesoterodine demonstrated that PMs have a two-fold higher plasma concentration than EMs;
      however, no published data exist on how CYP2D6 metabolizer status correlates with clinical
      outcomes such as efficacy or AEs. The ability to use CYP2D6 metabolizer status to predict
      which individuals will experience low efficacy or develop AEs to fesoterodine, and to utilize
      alternative therapies in these women, would challenge existing therapeutic paradigms and
      would significantly advance clinical practice via a pharmacogenetic approach.

      Specific Aim 1: To explore whether CYP2D6 metabolizer status can predict efficacy during 4
      weeks of fesoterodine fumarate therapy in elderly women with UUI. All subjects will be
      started on fesoterodine 4mg for 2 weeks followed by 8mg for 2 weeks. The primary outcome will
      be patient-reported treatment response based on a 4-point scale utilized in phase III
      clinical trials.8,9 We hypothesize that women who rapidly metabolize fesoterodine based on
      CYP2D6 metabolizer status are more likely to have low efficacy.

      Specific Aim 2: To explore whether CYP2D6 metabolizer status can predict moderate to severe
      adverse events during 4 weeks of fesoterodine fumarate therapy in elderly women with UUI. In
      the same study design as Aim #1, we will identify subjects with moderate to severe
      fesoterodine-related AEs. We hypothesize that women who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers are more
      likely to have moderate to severe AEs.

      Specific Aim 3: To utilize preliminary data from this pilot, proof-of-concept study to plan a
      future large-scale trial to predict outcomes of anticholinergic UUI therapy based on CYP2D6
      metabolizer status. Data regarding efficacy rates, risk of moderate-severe AEs, and the
      impact of CYP2D6 metabolizer status on efficacy and AEs, in addition to information regarding
      recruitment, drop-out, and questionnaire burden, will critically inform the study design,
      outcome measures and sample size of future, definitive trials.

      This proposal represents an innovative approach to pharmacotherapy for UUI, a highly
      prevalent condition with significant morbidity. Pharmacogenetics has tremendous potential to
      identify ideal candidates for anticholinergic UUI therapy and to distinguish individuals who
      may benefit from alternative treatment options. This pioneering pharmacogenetic research has
      the potential to lay the necessary groundwork for future long-term research which would
      optimize and personalize UUI therapy for millions of elderly women.

      Design &amp; Procedures:

      Patient Population: All women aged 50 years or older who desire treatment for bothersome UUI
      will be approached for enrollment. Women with â‰¥ 3 UUI episodes on a 3-day voiding diary will
      be included. Although women who have previously failed fesoterodine will be excluded, those
      who have failed other UUI anticholinergics remain eligible after a 2-week washout period.

      Subjects with auditory or visual sensory impairment will be included. If visual impairment
      exists, the research coordinator will provide assistance to complete the necessary documents.
      However, those who are unable to complete the study-related items and visits, such as women
      with cognitive impairment, based on the Mini-Cog validated questionnaire will be excluded.
