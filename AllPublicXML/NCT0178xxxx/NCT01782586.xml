    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if certain genes found in a kidney biopsy performed
      at one-year post transplant can predict which transplanted kidneys will have decreased kidney
      function within five years post-transplant.

      Gene expression profiling is used to study the activity of genes. Each gene has an &quot;on/off&quot;
      switch that controls how they are expressed in a cell, as well as a &quot;volume control&quot; that
      increases or decreases the level of expression of a particular gene as necessary. Researchers
      want to see if the presence and abundance of certain transcripts in a kidney biopsy at one
      year after transplant can predict which kidneys will have reduced function over time.

    <description>The primary endpoint for this study is defined as a progressive decline in renal function in participants with good function at 1 year. These &quot;Progressors&quot; are defined by all of the following criteria:
1 year estimated GFR (eGFR) by MDRD equation of &gt;40 ml/min.
Decline in eGFR beyond 1 year during the time frame of this study (minimum 2.6 years after transplant and up to 5 years after transplant) with a slope of &lt;-6.1% (i.e. slope of decline of renal function is &gt;6.1%).
&gt;20% decline in eGFR from 1 year post-transplant to latest follow-up point.
At least one eGFR (MDRD) interval &lt; 60 ml/min.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (â‰¥18 years) conventional renal transplant recipient.

          -  Patients who have given informed consent and are willing to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ABO incompatible kidney transplants.

          -  Positive crossmatch kidney transplants (T cell crossmatch &gt;100, B flow cytometric
             crossmatch &gt;150).

          -  Simultaneous kidney and extra-renal organ transplants including pancreas, liver,
             heart, lung, etc. Subjects who had previous extra renal transplants may be included in
             the study.

          -  Patients taking chronic anticoagulation, which includes Coumadin, Plavix and any type
             of heparin. Aspirin is acceptable but must be stopped 5 days prior to the renal
             biopsy.

          -  An inability to have the 1-year renal biopsy performed within the acceptable protocol
             window (Months 11-14 [Days 301-420] post-transplant).
