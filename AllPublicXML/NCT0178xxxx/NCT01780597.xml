  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main question to be asked in this study is what is the potential for human hearts that
      have been deemed unacceptable for transplant, to be explanted and re-animated in a
      controlled, external environment to be assessed? Furthermore would the reanimated hearts be
      able to undergo improvement in their function in this external environment.

      Ultimately this may lead to an increase the number of hearts available for transplantation.

    <textblock>
      Year on year with improvement in road safety and improvement in neurosurgery the number of
      ideal young brain dead donors have been declining whilst the number of more marginal donors
      have been increasing. The consequence of this is the number of heart transplants being
      performed have steadily declined.

      At present there are 600 hearts from brain dead donors offered for transplant every year in
      the United Kingdom (UK). Of these 200 have anatomical reasons why they cannot be used for
      transplant such as ischaemic heart disease. 100 are transplanted and the remaining 300 hearts
      are judged to have inferior function which probably occurs as a direct result of brain death
      (Dark).

      Ex vivo 'rig' testing has been developed for lungs that were judged unsuitable for
      transplantation. As a result several donor lungs have been 'improved' by warm perfusion on
      the rig to the extent that they became suitable for transplantation and so national lung
      transplant rates are increasing (Dark). The aim would be to develop a similar approach for
      the heart.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The investigators aim to measure an improvement in cardiac function (ie contractility) by measuring the Pressure Change/Time max (dP/dT), in mmHg/second, of the heart once it has achieved reanimation on the ex vivo circuit.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Can human hearts that have been deemed unacceptable for transplant be re-animated in a controlled, external environment to be assessed? Furthermore, can their function (contractility) be improved by ex vivo reperfusion? This will be measured using conductance catheters to measure the dP/dT max (mmHg/second) at various time intervals.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Can their function (contractility measured in mmHg/second) of the hearts be improved by an additional re-oxygenation step during the cold phase of heart preservation?</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Can these hearts be improved during the cold phase of transportation by either continuous circulation of preservation solution or oxygen gas through the heart? Hearts will be reperfused on the ex vivo circuit having been subjected to either method of preservation and their contractility measurements (mmHg/sec) once reanimated will be compared.</description>
