  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study aims to measure the impact of cognitive rehabilitation workshops on the development
      of cognitive functions and quality of life of patients expressing a cognitive complaint
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of our study was to evaluate, in patients treated for cancer expressing
      the cognitive complaint during or after treatment, interest workshops on improving cognitive
      rehabilitation felt their cognitive functions and their quality of life.

      The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients showing an improvement in the score of
      perceived deficiencies (score ranging from 0 to 72) of the FACT-Cog after treatment. The
      FACT-Cog is a self-administered questionnaire assessing the patients felt their cognitive
      difficulties (memory, attention, concentration) and the impact of these difficulties on their
      quality of life. The improvement is defined as an increase of 7 points &gt;= cognitive score won
      by the (a) patient (e) after the treatment
