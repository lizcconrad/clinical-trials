  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients are the fastest growing surgical population and present with increased risk
      of postoperative cardiac problems, especially congestive heart failure. Diastolic dysfunction
      is common in the elderly population and increases the risk of major adverse cardiac events
      after surgery. This project will use dynamic measurements of diastolic filling pressures by
      echocardiography for goal-directed fluid and drug management during surgery to determine
      whether this reduces serious cardiac events related to diastolic dysfunction after surgery in
      this high-risk population.

    <description>We will test the hypothesis that Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction (LVDD) undergoes dynamic changes perioperatively.
A. We will preoperatively identify 200 elderly subjects to provide 80% power to detect a change in LVDD undergoing noncardiac surgery using a 0.01 level two-sided paired t-test.
B. We will assess changes in LVDD in these subjects based on hourly intraoperative echocardiography data points.</description>

    <description>We will test the hypothesis that goal-directed Echocardiography Guided Hemodynamic Management (EGHEM) used in elderly subjects with LVDD improves postoperative clinical outcomes.
A. We will determine the ability of goal-directed EGHEM to maintain or improve intraoperative LVDD.
B. We will determine the ability of goal-directed EGHEM to reduce postoperative Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE)</description>
