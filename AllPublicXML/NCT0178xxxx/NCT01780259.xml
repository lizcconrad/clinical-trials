  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to
      the medication) of intranasally (through the nose) administered esketamine in healthy
      participants.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study with 3 cohorts (groups). Approximately 58 participants will be
      enrolled in this study. In Cohort 1, approximately 16 participants will be enrolled for up to
      78 days and they will receive 4 different single-dose regimens (Treatment A, B, C and D) of
      intranasal spray of esketamine solution in a crossover manner (participants will be switched
      from one single-dose regimen to another) and in an open label manner (both the investigator
      and the participant know the intervention received by the participant). In Cohort 2,
      approximately 14 participants will be enrolled for up to 35 days and they will receive 1
      regimen of intranasal esketamine (Treatment D) in an open label manner. In Cohort 3,
      approximately 28 participants will be enrolled and they will be randomly assigned to receive
      either Treatment E (intranasal esketamine spray) or Treatment F (intranasal placebo spray) in
      a double blind manner (both the investigator and the participant do not know the intervention
      received by the participant). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events,
      targeted nasal examinations, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, physical examination, pulse
      oximetery, and vital signs.
