  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are three main cycle regimens used for endometrial preparation for frozen embryo
      transfer（FET）: natural cycles (NC) with/without ovulation triggering, hormone replacement
      therapy cycles (HRT) in which the endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen and
      progesterone hormones with/without a gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) down
      regulation, and ovulation induced cycles (OI) in which follicular development is supported
      with increasing doses of gonadotrophin hormones and ovulation is induced. At present, there
      is still no sufficient evidence that which kind of FET cycle regimen to plan more advantage.
      The purpose of this study was to compare the pregnancy outcome of NC-FET to that of HRT-FET
      in women with regular cycles.

      This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients with regular cycles
      undergoing FET in reproductive medicine renter of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital will be
      recruited，who should not be elder than 40 and had more than 3 frozen embryos. They will be
      randomized to receive either the NC-FET cycle (group NC-A) or the HRT-FET cycle (group
      HRT-B). In group NC-A, the ovulation is monitored spontaneously or induced by human chorionic
      gonadotropin(HCG) when the dominant follicle is larger than 18mm without luteinizing hormone
      surge(LH). Transfer of thawed embryos will be performed 4 days after LH /HCG administration
      or 3 days after ovulation is observed. In group HRT-B, oral estradiol, 2 mg, once daily, is
      introduced on cycle day 3 with an increasing doses protocol. If the endometrial thickness is
      greater than 7mm, progesterone 40-60 mg in oil will be administered via intramuscular
      injection. Transfer of thawed embryos will be performed 3 days later. This study was approved
      by the reproductive medicine ethics committee of Sun Yet-sen Memorial Hospital.
