             whose disease is not currently amenable to surgery, radiation, or other modality
             therapy with curative intent. If different histologic classification schemes are used,

          -  Prior treatment with embolization or ablative therapies is allowed if measurable
             disease remains outside of the treated area or if there is definite progression of the
             treated lesions. There is no limit on the number of prior procedures.

          -  Concomitant use of any drug which is a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or strong
             CYP3A4 inducer.

          -  Active or severe liver disease (acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis).

          -  Positive anti-HBV. HBV seropositive patients (HBsAg positive) are eligible if they are
             closely monitored for evidence of active HBV infection by HBV DNA testing, and they
             must agree to receive suppressive therapy with lamivudine or other HBV-suppressive
             therapy until at least 4 weeks after the last dose of everolimus. Patients who are
             anti-HCV positive are eligible provided that hepatitis C viral load (hepatitis C RNA)
             is undetectable.

          -  Clinical evidence of brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  History of GI perforation within 12 months prior to registration or presence of active
             gastrointestinal (GI) disease or other condition that will interfere significantly
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drugs.

          -  History of clinically significant bleeding episodes.

          -  Current NYHA class II, III, or IV congestive heart failure (see Appendix C) or
             symptomatic heart failure within 60 days prior to the start of study drugs.

          -  Symptomatic arterial peripheral vascular disease.

          -  History of aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, or other arterial thrombotic events within 6 months of
             registration. Patients on therapeutic non-coumarin anticoagulation are eligible
             provided that they are on a stable dose of anticoagulants.

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or inadequately controlled hypertension.

          -  Receiving any other investigational agent(s) within 21 days or 5 half-lives (whichever
             is shorter) prior to the first dose of study drug. A minimum of 10 days between
             termination of the investigational drug and administration of study drug is required.

          -  History of allergic reactions or intolerance of, or other significant toxicity with,
             attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to X-82 or
             everolimus.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures outlined
             in the protocol

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with X-82 or everolimus. In addition, these patients are
             at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
