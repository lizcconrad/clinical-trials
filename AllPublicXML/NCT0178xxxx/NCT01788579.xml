      This study aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial that will test the feasibility and
      preliminary effect of a multimedia version of a computerized multimedia intimate partner
      violence (IPV) prevention service tool designed to increase identification of IPV
      victimization and to improve linkages to IPV-related services among female offenders under
      court supervision or probation, compared to a non-media version of the same IPV screening,
      brief intervention and referral service delivered by a case manager. The study addresses the
      following: Primary study aims

        1. To design and beta-test a Computerized Multimedia IPV Screening, Brief Intervention and
           Referral Service tool for female offenders under court supervision or probation.

        2. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effects of the Computerized Multimedia versus the
           Case Manager IPV service conditions on identification of different types of IPV during
           the service session and on access to and utilization of IPV services over the
           three-month follow-up period.

        3. To examine and enhance the feasibility (recruitment, enrollment, fidelity of service
           delivery, client satisfaction, safety, and retention) for a future larger scale R01
           study.

           Secondary study aim

        4. To obtain estimates of the effects of the Computerized Multimedia versus the Case
           Manager IPV service conditions on recidivism, adherence to drug treatment (e.g.,
           attendance, completion) and abstinence of substance use over the follow-up period,
           controlling for baseline outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence is a serious public health problem that disproportionately affects
      drug-involved female offenders under community supervision. Moreover, accumulating research
      has found strong associations linking experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and
      continued drug use among women in drug treatment. This research suggests that failure to
      prevent IPV among drug-involved female offenders under community supervision likely to result
      in higher rates of relapse, treatment attrition and recidivism and underscores the need to
      address the IPV service needs among the rapidly growing population of female offenders under
      community supervision. Computerized multimedia IPV prevention service tools have been shown
      to be feasible and effective in conducting screening, brief intervention and referral for IPV
      in medical care settings. The proposed services research addresses the significant public
      health problem of IPV victimization and a co-occurring risk for relapse and recidivism among
      drug-involved female offenders under court supervision or probation. The proposed
      computerized tool employs a self-paced, multimedia format to conduct IPV screening, brief
      intervention and IPV-related service referrals that is informed by best IPV screening and
      referral practices and previous intervention research. This innovative tool represents a
      cost-effective option that may implemented with greater fidelity and result in better client
      satisfaction and IPV prevention outcomes. Furthermore, if found to be effective in
      identifying IPV and improving linkage to IPV services, this cost effective computerized
      service tool may be scaled up with ease and speed in court and probation settings in New York
      State and nationwide.

    <description>If participants score a 20 or higher on the Women's Experience with Battering (WEB) survey, if they indicate yes to any of the Partner Abuse Interview or Partner Violence Screen (PVS), the tool will inform participants that they are at risk of IPV. If participants indicate yes to any severe IPV items, the tool will indicate that they are at risk of life-threatening IPV and should consider taking immediate steps to reduce their risks for IPV. All other participants will be informed that based on the answers, they do not appear to be at risk for IPV at present, but that they may learn strategies to prevent IPV in the session.</description>

    <description>This one-hour computerized multimedia IPV prevention service tool features the same activities as the comparison condition, but these core elements are translated into interactive tools and culturally tailored video vignettes designed to enhance learning and provide individualized feedback. Thus, the multimedia service tool acts as a roadmap for this service session, prompting participants through the IPV screening, providing psycho-educational content on IPV and how IPV may interact with their substance misuse, providing individualized feedback on their IPV risks based on the screening e, creating a safety plan, defining relationship safety goals and identifying IPV-related service needs, and generating a personal plan for accessing services and contacting agency representative.</description>

It also contains brief psycho-educational content on recognizing IPV and how IPV may contribute to drug use and recidivism drawn from previous interventions and demonstrated to have promising effects in reducing rates of both IPV and drug use.</description>
