  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two main cycle regimens used for endometrial preparation for frozen embryo transfer
      （FET) in women with irregular cycles: hormone replacement therapy cycles (HRT) in which the
      endometrium is artificially prepared by estrogen and progesterone hormones with/without a
      gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) down regulation, and ovulation induced
      cycles (OI) in which follicular development is supported with increasing doses of
      gonadotrophin hormones and ovulation is induced. At present, there is still no sufficient
      evidence that which kind of frozen embryo transfer cycle regimen to plan more advantage. The
      purpose of this study was to compare the pregnancy outcome of hormone replacement therapy
      cycles (HRT) and ovulation induced cycles (OI) in women with irregular cycles.

      This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients with irregular cycles
      undergoing FET in reproductive medicine renter of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital will be
      recruited who should not be elder than 40 and had more than 3 frozen embryos. They will be
      randomized to receive either the OI-FET cycle (group OI-A) or the HRT-FET cycle (group
      HRT-B). In group OI-A, the follicular development is supported by Letrozole(LE) 2.5mg,once
      daily,is introduced on cycle day 3 .And on cycle day 10 , a Vagina ultrasound is introduced
      to monitor the development of the follicular ,following by intramuscular gonadotrophin
      37.5~75 IU/d until there is a Luteinizing Hormone(LH) surge or ovulation .On the day
      appearing Luteinizing Hormone surge，patient is always introduced intramuscular human
      chorionic gonadotrophin(HCG) 10000 IU.If there is sill no Luteinizing Hormone surge when the
      follicle is 20-24mm ,the ovulation will be induced by HCG.Then the luteum is supported by HCG
      2000-2500 IU/3d.Transfer of thawed embryos will be performed 3 days after ovulation is
      observed. In group HRT-B, oral estradiol, 2 mg, once daily, is introduced on cycle day 3 with
      an increasing doses protocol. If the endometrial thickness is greater than 7mm, progesterone
      40-60 mg in oil will be administered via intramuscular injection. Transfer of thawed embryos
      will be performed 3 days later.
