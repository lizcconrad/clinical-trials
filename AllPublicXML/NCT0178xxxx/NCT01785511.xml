      Endothelium derived nitric oxide (NO) regulates vascular tone and blood pressure in man. NO
      also inhibits platelet aggregation and mediates a variety of beneficial anti-inflammatory and
      repair mechanisms. NO may also be a mediator in the release of the endogenous fibrinolytic
      factor, tissue-plasminogen activating factor (t-PA) from the endothelium.1 Via these actions
      it plays a very important role in protection of the vasculature from atherothrombosis and
      clinical sequelae such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

      Visible and ultraviolet (UV) light relax vascular smooth muscles by producing NO in a
      phenomenon known as photorelaxation.2 The investigators have demonstrated significant stores
      of pre-formed, bound NO and other nitrosospecies in human skin, which are rapidly released
      upon exposure to UVA.3 The investigators have demonstrated recently that serum nitrite and
      nitroso-species are increased after standing in a UVA phototherapy cabinet and that local UVA
      exposure is associated with increased forearm arterial blood flow that is independent of skin
      temperature. The investigators have also demonstrated a fall in mean arterial blood pressure
      in subjects exposed UVA.

      Cardiovascular morbidity and the prevalence of hypertension vary with latitude. The
      investigators hypothesise that some of this geographical variation may be explained by a
      diminished sunlight/UVA exposure with attendant negative effects upon NO bio-availability.4
      To further examine the potential beneficial effects of UVA exposure we will examine the
      effects of whole-body UVA upon platelet activation and upon myocardial/coronary arterial flow
      reserve. The investigators will correlate these measures with systemic nitrate, nitrite and
      nitroso-species content in healthy volunteers.

      HYPOTHESES

        1. UVA irradiation enhances coronary flow reserve in healthy volunteers.

        2. UVA irradiation suppresses platelet activation in healthy volunteers.

        3. UVA irradiation enhances the release of endogenous fibrinolytic factors in healthy
           volunteers.
