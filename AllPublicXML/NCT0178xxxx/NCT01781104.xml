          -  Diagnosis of chronic IDIOPATHIC constipation, including experiencing constipation for
             12 or more weeks in the preceding 12 months (defined by Rome III criteria for
             Functional Constipation, but all patients must meet the modified criterion of a
             history of â‰¤4 average defecations per week)

          -  Stable concomitant medications (no changes in regimen for at least 2 weeks prior to
             baseline period)

          -  Body mass index of 18-40 kg/m2

          -  Females must not be lactating or pregnant

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Unable/unwilling to provide informed consent or to comply with study procedures

          -  Diagnosis of secondary constipation e.g. underlying general neurological disease such
             as Parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, diseases associated with peripheral neuropathy,
             iatrogenic constipation

          -  Structural or metabolic diseases that affect the GI system NOTE: Patients with
             clinical suspicion of upper or lower GI obstruction must have been evaluated per
             standard of care and obstruction ruled out before screening

          -  Unable to withdraw the following medications 48 hours prior to baseline period and
             throughout the study (except as protocol defined rescue medications):

               -  Medications that alter GI transit including laxatives, magnesium and aluminum
                  containing antacids, prokinetics, erythromycin, narcotics, anti-cholinergics,
                  tricyclic antidepressants, SNRI and newer antidepressants

               -  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are permissible at
                  low, stable doses

               -  Analgesic drugs including opiates, NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors

               -  GABAnergic agents

               -  Benzodiazepines

          -  NOTE: stable doses of thyroid replacement, estrogen replacement, low dose aspirin for
             cardioprotection, and birth control (but with adequate backup contraception as
             drug-interactions with birth control have not been conducted) are permissible

          -  Drugs with a low therapeutic index, such as warfarin, digoxin, anti-seizure
             medications

          -  History of surgery within 60 days of screening

          -  Acute or chronic illness or history of illness, which in the opinion of Investigator,
             could pose threat/harm to the patient or obscure interpretation of laboratory test
             results or interpretation of study data such as frequent angina, Class III or IV
             congestive heart failure, moderate impairment of renal or hepatic function, poorly
             controlled diabetes, etc

          -  History of hypersensitivity to mannitol (an ingredient of both active and placebo
             study medications)

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratories or physical examination
             as determined by Investigator

          -  Abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), including evidence of acute myocardial or
             subendocardial ischemia and clinically significant arrhythmias or conduction
             abnormalities (including prolonged QTc &gt; 500 msec) or abnormal blood pressure at
             screening except minor deviations deemed to be of no clinical significance by
             Investigator

          -  Acute GI illness within 48 hours of initiation of the baseline period

          -  ALT or AST &gt; 1.2 X upper limit of normal during screening

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  History of excessive alcohol use or substance abuse

          -  Participation in an investigational clinical study within 30 days prior to dosing in
             the present study

          -  Any other reason, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would confound proper
             interpretation of the study

        Exclusion criteria at the end of the baseline period

          -  In addition, patients will not be randomized into the double-blind treatment
             comparison if during the baseline period they:

          -  used rescue medications such as laxatives, beyond those allowed by protocol

          -  demonstrated lack of compliance

          -  averaged more than 4 spontaneous bowel movements per week

          -  Substudy patients only: did not demonstrate slow colonic transit at end of baseline
             period (GC 24 &gt;2.4)
