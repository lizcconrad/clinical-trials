    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies glutamine in preventing peripheral neuropathy in
      patients with multiple myeloma who are receiving bortezomib. Glutamine may help prevent
      peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving chemotherapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the objective effect size of glutamine compared to placebo as a prophylactic
      intervention to prevent bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy in multiple myeloma patients
      4 months after their first dose of study drug.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate whether glutamine delays or prevents the onset or worsening of any neuropathy as
      determined by National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) v4.03 criteria.

      II. Determine if glutamine may improve adherence to bortezomib therapy.

      III. Assess response rate (RR) and clinical benefit response rate (CBR) according to uniform
      international response criteria and modified European Group for Blood and Marrow
      Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.

      IV. Determine if glutamine may improve quality of life (QOL) at 4 months.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive glutamine orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days
      for 4 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID. Courses repeat every 28 days for 4 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <measure>Degree of Peripheral Neuropathy (PNP)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4 months (after 4 courses)</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathy Impairment Score -Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) is the objective measurement of PNP symptoms. The degree of PNP will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.03. The CTCAE is a 0-5 scale that assesses severity of neuropathy related to cancer therapy with higher scores meaning more symptoms A difference of 2 points between groups is considered significant. This measure will be performed at baseline and at 4 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to bortezomib treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of every month (course) for 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to bortezomib treatment will be assessed by comparing cumulative body surface area adjusted doses administered during the first 4 cycles between placebo and glutamine groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>RR (complete remission [sCR+CR+very good partial remission [VGPR]+partial remission [PR])</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning of each month and at the end of month 4</time_frame>
    <description>RR (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) according to uniform international response criteria and CBR (RR+MR according to modified EBMT criteria) will be assessed with SPEP, 24h UPEP, serum urine immunofixation, and serum free light chain assay at the start of each cycle and after completion of the 4th cycle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at the end of month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured on the 27-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) plus the 11-item neurotoxicity sub-scale (FACT/GOG-Ntx) at the start of each cycle and after completion of the 4th cycle. Higher scores represent better quality of life.</description>
