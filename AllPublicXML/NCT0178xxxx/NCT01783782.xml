  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this prospective, randomized and controlled study was to evaluate the
      effect of five bowel preparation regimens on small-bowel cleansing in a pediatric population.
      The secondary endpoints were to evaluate the safety and the effects of preparation on
      diagnostic yield of CE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a well-known, non-invasive, diagnostic tool to evaluate small bowel
      diseases in adults and children. Unfortunately, because CE does not have functions which
      allow suctioning of fluid or washing the small bowel mucosa during the examination, its
      diagnostic yield can be limited by presence of debris, biliary secretion, bubbles and blood
      in the gut lumen that may hide relevant findings especially in the distal small bowel. In
      addition, CE sometimes fails to reach the cecum within the battery life of the capsule,
      resulting in a failure to visualize the distal small intestine. However, in children this
      problem is less frequent for the increased intestinal motility, which reduces the transit
      time of the capsule.

      It was believed that cleaning the small intestine prior to examination would improve mucosal
      visibility during the endoscopy and, as a result, the diagnostic yield of the technique.
      Therefore, proposals were put forward based on preparations for other types of explorations,
      such as colonoscopies (2).

      Some authors have already studied in adults the effect of bowel preparation on small-bowel
      visualization using different agents; the results of the published series are contradictory.
      To date, while there is evidence for a benefit from bowel preparation for CE, there is so far
      no consensus on an optimal preparation regimen. In addition, in children there are not
      studies on this topic. Therefore, overnight fasting before the examination still remains the
      proposed preparation for capsule endoscopy.

    <description>Preparation efficacy was evaluated by the blinded endoscopist according to a visibility score.
There is no standardized or validated scoring system for the quality of small-bowel cleanliness. The visibility of the mucosal surface was assessed as the percentage of visualized bowel surface area as follows: 1: &lt; 25%; 2: 25%-49%; 3: 50%-74%; 4: 75%-89%; 5: &gt; 90%.</description>

    <description>the number of positive findings and the overall diagnostic yield.
A positive finding was defined as the presence of a visible finding, whether incidental or clinically relevant. A positive yield at CE was assumed if the visible finding was considered relevant to the indication for CE. Where appropriate, this was confirmed by further evaluation (repeated upper-GI or lower-GI endoscopy, single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE), laparotomy, or cross-sectional imaging).</description>

    <measure>Safety</measure>

    <time_frame>On the morning of colonoscopy, immediately before the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability assessment was based on the recording of occurrence and severity of GI symptoms such as nausea, bloating, abdominal, pain/cramps and anal discomfort.
All patients were tested with a questionnaire, based on a numerical scale between 0 and 10 (with 10 being no burden at all and 0 indicating an intolerable procedure), about the impact of the bowel preparation (Van Tuyl Endoscopy 2007) and their level of satisfaction.</description>
