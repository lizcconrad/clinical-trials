  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently medications injected intravitreally in previously vitrectomized eyes have a very
      short half-life due to enhanced clearance of the drug. The use of the Ozurdex implant may
      allow sustained levels of steroid delivery to patients with diabetic macular edema that have
      undergone prior vitrectomy. The sustained steroid levels may lead to improved central retinal
      thickness measurements and improved visual acuity.

      A total of 15 patients will be enrolled into the study. This is a 3 year randomized
      controlled study with the primary endpoint at 1 year. Secondary safety and efficacy endpoints
      will be evaluated in year 2 and year 3.

      Patients will be randomly enrolled into 1 of 3 groups:

      Group 1: Ozurdex administered up to every 3 months Group 2: Ozurdex administered up to every
      6 months Group 3: Sham Ozurdex

      Patients will be evaluated on a monthly basis with ETDRS visual acuity, intraocular pressure,
      fundus examination and OCT.

      Ozurdex or Sham Procedure will be performed on Day 0. All patients will be evaluated monthly
      thereafter. One month following initial injection/sham, patients will be evaluated for focal
      or grid laser treatment if the investigator feels the patient will benefit.

      Re-implantation of Ozurdex may occur at any time &gt; 3 months following last injection in group
      1 and &gt; 6 months following last injection in group 2 if any of the following conditions are
      met:

        1. Increase of &gt; 50 microns from the best previous CRT measurement

        2. Recurrence of intraretinal cystic edema

        3. Persistent intraretinal cystic edema

      At 13 months, patients in the sham group will be eligible for Ozurdex implantation if initial
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. These patients would follow re-implantation guidelines
      of group 2 (up to every 6 months).
