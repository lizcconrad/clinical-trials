  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess factors mediating the changes in insulin
      sensitivity and glucose tolerance before and after 10 lbs ± or 2% weight loss reduction as
      well as 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after initiation of a low calorie diet.

      The investigators will also study the following:

        1. The impact of diet induced weight loss on hormones/adipokine levels

        2. The impact of diet induced weight loss on leptin tolerance

Weight loss group (Full meal replacement products): In the intervention arm of this non randomized, open label study to assess the effects of weight loss on insulin sensitivity and leptin tolerance subjects will use full meal replacement products (1280-1320kcal/day). Subjects will be on the full meal replacement products only, for the first 12 weeks, between 13 to 19 weeks they will be transitioned to regular food, from 19 weeks and going forward they will be on chronic maintenance phase</description>
