  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the hypothesis that community health workers providing home visits to
      provide education and support for self-management of asthma, assessment of the home for
      environmental triggers, resources for asthma control, and assistance in effective
      communication with medical providers over the course of one year would reduce asthma
      morbidity, asthma-related urgent health care use and exposure to indoor asthma triggers among
      low income adults with not well controlled asthma.

      We used a randomized controlled parallel group design to compare the intervention to a
      usual-care control group. We attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in
      the &quot;real world,&quot; rather than its ideal efficacy.

      The CHWs used protocols that specified education content, participant skill development and
      participant and CHW actions. The CHWs modified their approach to meet the priorities of
      participants using motivational interviewing techniques. They addressed asthma
      patho-physiology, reliever and controller medication use, self-monitoring, use of an asthma
      action plan, environmental assessment, trigger avoidance, effective use of the health care
      system, successful communication with health care providers, and weight control (obesity is
      associated with increased asthma symptoms). Participants also received low-literacy
      educational materials, in English or Spanish. The education concepts and environmental
      assessment activities were based on our prior healthy homes work modified for adults.

    <description>Asthma symptoms are evaluated using the following questions:
During the past 14 days (that is, during the past fourteen 24 hour periods that include daytime and nighttime), on how many DAYS did you have any asthma symptoms, such as wheezing, coughing, tightness in the chest, shortness of breath, waking up at night because of asthma symptoms, or slowing down of usual activities because of asthma?
During the DAYTIME in the past 14 days, how many DAYS did you have asthma symptoms, such as wheezing, cough, tightness in the chest, or shortness of breath?
During the past 14 days, how many days did you have to slow down or stop your usual activities because of asthma, wheezing or tightness in the chest, or cough?
During the NIGHTTIME in the past 14 nights, how many NIGHTS did you WAKE UP because of asthma, wheezing, cough, tightness in the chest, or shortness of breath?.</description>

    <description>For the intervention group, a trained Community Health Worker (CHW) provided education, support and service coordination through home visits. The CHW first made an in home assessment visit. At the assessment visit, the participant had the opportunity to ask questions and sign written consent. During this visit, the CHW assessed the participant's knowledge of asthma, current status of asthma control, challenges with controlling asthma, self-management practices and exposure to asthma triggers. After enrollment, the participant received up to four follow-up educational visits 0.5, 1.5, 3.5 and 7 months later. In addition to scheduled visits, the CHWs worked with their participants on an as-needed basis via telephone, email, or additional home visits.</description>
