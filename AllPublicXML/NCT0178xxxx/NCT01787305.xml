  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore if certain commensals within the gut microbiota (the
      collection of all microbes that live inside the gut) correlate with autoantibodies in the
      autoimmune clotting disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome. The study hypothesis is that
      particular commensals induce the autoantibodies (immune molecules that bind to self
      structures) and thus correlate with the level of immune cells and antibodies that are
      self-reactive. Participants are patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and individuals who
      have tested positive on a prior blood test for anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies or those
      that have tested negative for antiphospholipid antibodies in their blood, but had a clotting
      event or a health problem that puts them at risk to form blood clots.

    <textblock>
      Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder in which people are at risk to form
      blood clots. Having a positive antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) test does not mean the person
      has APS; but a small number of people do develop APS. These antibodies can also occur in
      otherwise healthy people. We believe certain bacteria in the gut may cause these antibodies
      to be produced.

      Current treatments in APS target the blood clotting system and the goal is to prevent future
      blood clots. Many patients require this therapy for their entire life. If an persistent
      trigger can be found within the gut microbiota, it may help in developing other treatments.
      This study is being conducted at two centers, Yale University School of Medicine in New
      Haven, CT, and The Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, New York. We expect to enroll a
      total of 40 subjects in this study at these study sites.

      Visits will be as follows:

      Visit 1: Initial screening visit: Review of medical records and questionnaire completion.

      Visit 2 (one month after initial visit) &amp; Visit 3 (2 months after initial visit):
      Questionnaire relating to any changes that may have taken place since recruitment. Brief
      physical examination by the study doctor.

      Overall participation: Over a period of 8 weeks.

      Sample Collection:

      At each study visit, a sample of blood will be obtained (approximately 6.5 tablespoons of
      whole blood) via one needle stick.

      A take-home stool sample collection kit will be provided. Stool samples will be obtained
      within 24 hours before or after blood collection and delivered (or mailed) to a study site. 2
      kits will be provided at the initial visit, 1 kit will be provided at the follow up visit at
      month 1.
