  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1) ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) and
      thymidylate synthase(TS) are molecular determinants that predict sensitivity or resistance to
      platinum agents 、 gemcitabine and pemetrexed respectively.

      Tailored therapy using these molecular determinants suggested patient benefit in a previously
      reported phase 2 trial. Here, we designed a study for an individual patient analysis of
      prospectively accrued patients who were treated with the &quot;personalized therapy&quot; approach
      versus other standard approaches.

      Patients who had nonsmall- cell lung cancer (NSCLC) performance status of 0/1 were accrued to
      2 phase 2 clinical trials Trial A (carboplatin and chemotherapy individuation based on
      sensitivity marker ), Trial B (carboplatin non-individuation or chemotherapy
      non-individuation ).

      Patients who were treated on Trials B were analyzed as the &quot;standard therapy&quot; group. Patients
      accrued to Trial A were called the &quot;personalized therapy&quot; group. disease free survival (DFS)
      was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

    <description>A.individual therapy :enrolled patients with ERCC1 negative tumors who received carboplatin and a third-generation agent (gemcitabine or pametrexed) based on RRM1 or TS expression. If RRM1 protein was negatively expressed in the tumor tissues, gemcitabine was used, whereas pemetrexed was used if RRM1 was positively expressed and TS was negatively expressed.
B.non-individualized therapy :enrolled patients who received carboplatin and a third-generation agent but were not based on ERCC1, RRM1, or TS expression.</description>
