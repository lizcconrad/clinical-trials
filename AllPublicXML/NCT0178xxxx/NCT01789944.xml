      To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of peers as interventionists in delivering
      family-based behavioral pediatric weight control intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new model of delivering family-based pediatric overweight treatment that decreases costs
      but sustains short- and long-term efficacy is needed. One possible opportunity for this is a
      peer intervention model in which families receiving professionally-led intervention then
      subsequently providing intervention to other families. In addition, peer interventionists'
      continued engagement in the behavior change process through providing intervention to others
      could improve their own long-term efficacy. The project begins with the standard approach of
      having professional interventionists provide family-based behavioral pediatric overweight
      treatment to overweight children and their parent (1st generation families; n=30).
      Subsequently, half of 1st generation families will be randomly assigned to serve as peer
      interventionists to other overweight parents and children (2nd generation families; n=30).
      The remaining 1st generation families will neither receive nor provide any additional
      treatment. This project aims to develop the peer intervention training and delivery and then
      to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the peer intervention. This project also aims
      to derive an estimate of the efficacy of peer intervention (receiving and providing) both at
      the end of receiving treatment and 6 months later, as well as the impact of providing
      intervention on peer interventionists' weight outcomes.
