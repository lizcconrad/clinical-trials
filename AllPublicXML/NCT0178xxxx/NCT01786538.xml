  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib has been proved to improved survival in patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer who have been failed to all of known standard chemotherapy (The CORRECT study). The
      phase Ib study of regorafenib plus FOLFOX or FOLFIRI was performed and the dose of
      regorafenib was fixed; 160 mg/day on days 4 to 10 (7 days per cycle when combined with FOLFOX
      or FOLFIRI). Regorafenib plus FOLFOX as second-line chemotherapy in mCRC patients who
      progressed after first-line irinotecan-based chemotherapy has not been studied yet, and
      because there have been unmet needs for the discovery of valid targeted agent combination for
      the second-line FOLFOX as above reasons, the investigators planned this study of regorafenib
      plus FOLFOX as second-line chemotherapy in mCRC patients who progressed after first-line
      irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limited active drugs are available for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer (mCRC) at present and upfront doublet combination of fluoropyrimidines plus either
      oxaliplatin or irinotecan is regarded as reference strategy for patients appropriate for
      intensive therapy. Before the era of targeted agents, the treatment strategies in terms of
      either combination or sequence of cytotoxic agents were rather simple; survival outcomes did
      not differ according to either the administration sequence of oxaliplatin or irinotecan, or
      the sequential versus combination chemotherapy in the treatment continuum. However, the
      treatment strategies have become more complicated in the era of targeted agents.

      In case of failure to first-line oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidines (FOLFOX or CapeOX) with
      or without bevacizumab, second-line chemotherapy with FOLFIRI would be administered for
      treatment continuum, and more various targeted agents can be combined in these setting;
      bevacizumab beyond progression only in patients who have been treated with first-line
      bevacizumab plus FOLFOX or CapeOX (TML and BRiTE), cetuximab (only for patients with
      wild-type KRAS), panitumumab (only for patients with wild-type KRAS), and aflibercept
      (VELOUR). However, there have been a few valid targeted agents which could be combined in the
      second line FOLFOX or CapeOX in those progressed after first-line FOLFIRI with or without
      targeted agents; bevacizumab beyond progression could be a valid treatment strategy only in
      those received first-line bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI. Higher dose of bevacizumab (10
      mg/kg/2-week) could be combined to FOLFOX as second-line chemotherapy; however, it is not
      recommended at present in terms of cost effectiveness and higher adverse events, and
      cetuximab plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is neither recommended by current consensus.
      Thus, there have been unmet needs for the discovery of valid targeted agent combination for
      the second-line FOLFOX as above reasons.
