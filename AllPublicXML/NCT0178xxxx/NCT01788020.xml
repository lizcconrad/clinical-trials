  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) conventional chemotherapy induces only low CR rates and
      responses of short duration compared to other indolent lymphomas. Thus innovative approaches
      are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in patients with WM, who are
      mostly of advanced age. The immunochemotherapy DRC (dexamethasone, rituximab,
      cyclophosphamide) was shown to be highly effective in patients with WM without inducing major
      hematological toxicities. On the other hand the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib showed
      substantial activity as a single agent in WM with only very few side effects when given in a
      weekly schedule. Based on these observations it is the aim of this study to test whether the
      efficacy of the well tolerated DRC regime can further improved by adding Bortezomib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) is defined by a bone marrow infiltration by
      lymphoplasmacytic cells and the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) M gammopathy in
      the peripheral blood 1. The clinical understanding of the disease has been greatly improved
      by the identification of internationally recognized criteria for initiating therapy 2, the
      description of an international prognostic index for patients requiring a first-line therapy3
      and the definition of response criteria. These criteria are mainly based on the evolution of
      serum IgM concentration4. However, delayed IgM monoclonal protein responses may cause
      important difficulties in response assessment4. In addition, discrepancies between the
      kinetics of serum M protein reduction and the clearance of monoclonal B-cells from the bone
      marrow have been reported 5. Despite continuing advances in the therapy of WM, the disease
      remains incurable with a median survival of 5 to 8 years from the time of diagnosis thereby
      necessitating the development and evaluation of novel treatment approaches.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Clinicopathological diagnosis of WM as defined by consensus panel one of the Second
        International Workshop on WM. Pathological diagnosis has to occur before study inclusion
        and randomization. In addition, pathological specimens have to be sent to the national
        pathological reference center at study inclusion and randomization. The positivity for CD20
        can be assumed from any previous bone marrow immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry
        analysis performed up to 6 months prior to enrollment. Inclusion in the study will be based
        on morphological and immunological criteria. Immunophenotyping will be performed in each
        center and saved locally. Flow cytometry of bone marrow and blood cells will include at
        least one double staining and assess the expression of the following antigens: surface
        immunoglobulin, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD10 and CD23. Patients are eligible if tumor cells
        express the following antigens: CD19, CD20, and if they are negative for CD5, CD10 and CD23
        expression. Patients with tumor cells positive for CD5 and/or CD23 and morphologically
        similar to WM cells may be included after ruling out other low grade B-cell malignancies.
