  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how cancer treatment affects sexual and reproductive
      function. The patient will also be asked to participate in blood draws to see if and how
      cancer treatment affects the ovaries and the ability to have children (fertility). These
      blood draws are optional and the patient can still participate in the questionnaire portion
      of the study even if they choose not to have their blood drawn.

    <description>This study is a prospective, observational, longitudinal study assessing the prevalence of sexual dysfunction and distress in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer. This study will also evaluate the severity, time course, and predictors of sexual dysfunction. Breast cancer patients and survivors will be administered surveys of comprehensive questionnaires related to sexual function. In the case that participants miss the follow up questionnaires, study staff may contact the patient by phone to request and record the patients‟ responses. The study staff may also mail the missed questionnaires to each patient.</description>

    <description>This study is a prospective, observational, longitudinal study assessing the prevalence of sexual dysfunction and distress in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma or Hodgkin's Lymphoma. This study will also evaluate the severity, time course, and predictors of sexual dysfunction. Lymphoma patients and survivors will be administered surveys of comprehensive questionnaires related to sexual function. In the case that participants miss the follow up questionnaires, study staff may contact the patient by phone to request and record the patients‟ responses. The study staff may also mail the missed questionnaires to each patient.</description>

    <description>A survey including the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Modified Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI-M), the Modified Female Sexual Function Index Follow-Up (FSFI-M Follow-Up) the Sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ), the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS-R), the Menopausal Symptom Check List (MSCL), Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sexual Function Instrument (PROMIS-SF), Abbreviated Dyadic Adjustment Scale for Relationships (ADAS), Reproductive Health Survey-baseline (RHS-B). Reproductive Health Survey-followup and (RHS-F1)Reproductive Health Survey-followup (RHS-F2) will be conducted at the following intervals: baseline/before chemotherapy +/- 1 month, 3 months after baseline +/- 1 month, 6 months after baseline +/- 1 month, 1 year after baseline +/- 1 month, and at intervals during survivorship that include yearly for 5 years +/- 2 months.</description>

    <description>Those patients receiving chemotherapy who consent to the optional blood draw will provide blood at baseline (before start of chemotherapy), 12 months after baseline (+/-1 month) and 24 months after baseline (+/-2 months). All patients in the subset of the premenopausal cohort receiving tamoxifen only will have required blood draws at baseline (before they begin taking tamoxifen), at 6 months post-baseline/start of tamoxifen (+/- 2 weeks), 12 months post-start of tamoxifen (+/-1 month) and 24 months post-start of tamoxifen (+/-2 months). We will ask these participants for blood draws on day 1, 2, 3 or 4 of their menses at baseline and 6 months post-baseline/start of tamoxifen and during months 1 through 5 post-baseline/start of tamoxifen.</description>

    <description>Transvaginal ultrasounds are used to determine the number of antral follicles in each ovary. They will be performed to evaluate both the number and size of antral follicles of premenopausal women on Tamoxifen as antral follicle count is a good predictor of ovarian reserve and response. All patients in the subset of the premenopausal cohort receiving tamoxifen only will also have required transvaginal ultrasounds at baseline (before they begin taking tamoxifen) and at 6 months post-start of tamoxifen (+/- 2 weeks).</description>
