    <textblock>
      This study tested whether inhaled budesonide and formoterol were able to alleviate or prevent
      pulmonary injury when administered early in hospital course to the patients at risk for
      developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The FDA has approved many uses for
      budesonide and formoterol, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      but the use of these two drugs is experimental for ARDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomized to either placebo or combined standard aerosolized doses of
      budesonide (0.5 mg) and formoterol (20 mcg) twice daily, with at least 6 hours between doses,
      for 5 calendar days for a total of 10 doses or until hospital discharge or death. Local
      hospital pharmacies prepared identical appearing solutions and drug was delivered by
      respiratory therapists blinded to randomization by using standard jet nebulizers that produce
      aerosol particle size within the respirable range (&lt;5.5 microns). The first dose was
      administered within 4 hours after randomization.

    <measure>Change in Oxygen Saturation to Fraction of Inspired Oxygen Concentration (SpO2/FiO2) Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to day 5 after the first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured by pulse oximetry. FiO2 is the assumed proportion of oxygen concentration participating in gas exchange in the alveoli. All S/F measurements were performed per standard operating protocol using a Venturi mask titrated to obtain an oxygen saturation of 94 ± 2% unless the patient met this goal on room air or clinical status dictated an alternative delivery mode. This outcome measure was analyzed as a longitudinal continuous variable by a mixed effect model. The formula for the calculation of SpO2/FiO2 (or S/F ratio) is %saturation/proportion of FiO2 concentration.</description>

    <description>ARDS was defined per Berlin definition. Chest radiographs of all ventilated (non-invasive or invasive) patients were reviewed as consistent or not consistent with ARDS by the site investigator. A second adjudication was performed by an alternate principal investigator blinded to subject identification and clinical data. Final diagnosis of ARDS was determined centrally after chest radiograph adjudication was considered together with other relevant clinical data.</description>

        <title>Change in Oxygen Saturation to Fraction of Inspired Oxygen Concentration (SpO2/FiO2) Ratio</title>
        <description>Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured by pulse oximetry. FiO2 is the assumed proportion of oxygen concentration participating in gas exchange in the alveoli. All S/F measurements were performed per standard operating protocol using a Venturi mask titrated to obtain an oxygen saturation of 94 ± 2% unless the patient met this goal on room air or clinical status dictated an alternative delivery mode. This outcome measure was analyzed as a longitudinal continuous variable by a mixed effect model. The formula for the calculation of SpO2/FiO2 (or S/F ratio) is %saturation/proportion of FiO2 concentration.</description>
