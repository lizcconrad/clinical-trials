  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether height-adjustable desks change
      sitting and standing time at work and away from work, engery expenditure, dietary intake, and
      body composition. Intermittent peroids of standing made possible by height-adjustable desks
      may help to impart long-term health benefits.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Workplace sitting time to be reduced</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Workplace sitting time will be reduced by 60 minutes across an 8 hour work day and this time will be replaced by standing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total sitting time will be reduced</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total sitting time will be reduced by 30 minutes across a 16 hour day. Decreased sitting during the weekday will not be fully compensated for by increased sitting during nonwork hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy expenditure will increase</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Energy expenditure will increase across an 8 hour workday and a 16 hour day.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health behavior change of consuming a lower fat diet</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The non-targeted health behavior of consuming a lower fat diet will co-occur with standing behavior. Increases in standing behavior will be inversely correlated with changes in total dietary fat intake.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body weight, BMI, and fat mass reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight, BMI, and fast mass will be reduced by 6 months.</description>
