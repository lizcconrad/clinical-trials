      NOTE: This study has stopped enrolling new participants, and all study vaccinations for
      currently enrolled participants have been stopped.

      Currently, there are no vaccines approved for the prevention of HIV infection, but there are
      many clinical trials taking place that are studying experimental HIV vaccines. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of three different HIV vaccine
      schedules in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      NOTE: This study has stopped enrolling new participants, and all study vaccinations for
      currently enrolled participants have been stopped.

      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to three different vaccine schedules
      of a DNA HIV vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123) followed by a NYVAC HIV vaccine boost (NYVAC-HIV-PT1 and
      NYVAC-HIV-PT4) in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Study researchers will also evaluate the
      safety of administering the HIV vaccine on a shorter administration schedule.

      This study will take place in two parts. Participants in Part A of the study will receive the
      DNA HIV vaccine on a faster schedule than usual: at Days 0, 14, and 28. At study entry,
      participants will undergo a physical examination, HIV risk reduction counseling, and
      interviews and questionnaires. Female participants will take a pregnancy test. Study visits
      will occur at Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 140, and 224. These study visits will include some of the
      same procedures performed at study entry, as well as blood collection, urine collection, and
      HIV testing.

      Study researchers will evaluate participant data from Part A of the study, and if there are
      no safety concerns, they will enroll participants into Part B of the study. Participants in
      Part B of the study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, and within each group,
      some participants will be randomly assigned to receive placebo vaccine. Participants will
      receive DNA HIV vaccine or placebo on Days 0, 14, and 28 (Group 2); or Days 0 and 28 (Group
      3); or Days 0, 28, and 56 (Group 4). The NYVAC HIV vaccine boost will be administered at Day
      84 (Groups 2 and 3) or 140 (Group 4). Participants in Part B of the study, in Groups 2 and 3,
      will attend study visits at Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 84, 98, 168, and 273. Participants in Part B
      in Group 4 will attend study visits at Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 140, 154, 224, and 334.
      Participants in Part B of the study will undergo the same study procedures that occurred in
      Part A of the study, with the addition of a cardiac symptoms assessment performed at some
      study visits. Participants in Part B who received the NYVAC vaccine or its placebo prior to
      study vaccinations being stopped will be contacted by phone or e-mail once a year for 5 years
      after they enrolled into the study for follow-up health monitoring.

          -  Hypertension: If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or
             hypertension during screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not
             well controlled. Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than
             or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or
             without medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must
             be less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
             diastolic. For these participants, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140 mm
             Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment. If a person
             has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during screening or
             previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 150 mm Hg at
             enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg at
             enrollment.

          -  BMI greater than or equal to 40; less than or equal to 18; or BMI greater than or
             equal to 35 with two or more of the following: age greater than 45, systolic blood
             pressure greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg,
             current smoker, or known hyperlipidemia

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (e.g., factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded: participant who has had malignancy excised surgically and
             who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of sustained cure,
             or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the period of the
             study.)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past 3 years. Also exclude if
             participant has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
