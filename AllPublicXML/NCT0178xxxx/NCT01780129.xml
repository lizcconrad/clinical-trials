  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HW6 can prolong animal's survival time and increase the survival rate. HW6 enhances cardiac
      function, improves microcirculation, and increases blood pressure and pulse pressure, and
      improves blood perfusion of important organs; HW6's anti-shock activity comes from a combined
      multiple target pharmacological effects.

      Based on a completed phase II trial conducted in China, HW6 can effectively treatment shock
      patient.

      This is a phase II clinical study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of Polydatin
      Injectable 100mg/5mL/via (HW6) in the treatment of shock in the United States. Patients with
      traumatic/hemorrhagic shock or septic shock admitted to the emergency room or ICU with
      systolic blood pressure &lt; 90mmHg, or is on vasopressor(s) for systolic blood pressure
      stabilization, regardless the types of completed, on-going, or projected Standard of Care or
      surgery will be recruited to participant in the trial. A total of 120 patients with
      traumatic/hemorrhagic shock and 120 patients with septic shock will be enrolled. For each
      type of shock, sixty patients each will be in test group and control group. Both adult males
      and females aged 18-80 years are eligible. The primary clinical endpoint is the time length
      (TL) between the start of HW6 administration to the onset of the first treatment success,
      that is: the systolic blood pressure is stabilized at ≥90mmHg and MAP≥65mmHg for 1 hour
      without the use of vasopressors. Several secondary endpoints and biomarkers will be measured.

      Efficacy data will be compared using group t-test or Wilcoxon log-rank test between treatment
      groups and placebo groups. Safety data will also be reported accordingly.

Blood pressure will be recorded every 10 min. Treatment success is considered to have been achieved when 7 consecutive systolic blood pressure to be≥90mmHg and MAP≥65mmHg.
The TL is the time from the start of drug administration to the onset of TS (OTS) where the first systolic blood pressure≥90mmHg and MAP≥65mmHg is observed in the 7 consecutive measures.
Blood pressure will be measured every hour after the TS. If blood pressure become unstable, standard care will be in practice.</description>
