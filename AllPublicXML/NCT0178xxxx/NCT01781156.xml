  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphosphatemia and elevated cardiac biomarkers are two key characteristics of patients in
      end stage renal diseases(ESRD),however the majority of whom are in the absence of acute
      coronary syndrome(ACS). And it is still unclear why cardiac biomarkers would increase in
      those patients. We hypothesized that excessive phosphorus is account for that phenomenon.To
      confirm that hypothesis,we used one phosphorus binder to reduce phosphorus absorption in
      hemodialysis patients for some time and observed the change of cardiac biomarkers of those
      patients.

      Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patient
      with chronic kidney disease(CKD), accounting for more than 50% of all deaths.When myocardial
      cells get injured, cardiac biomarkers will be released into the circulation. Elevated cardiac
      biomarkers have been observed in patients with various degrees of renal failure. However, the
      majority of those CKD patients are in the absence of acute coronary syndrome. So far, it is
      still unclear the mechanisms of the increased biomarkers in CKD patients. Meanwhile,
      hyperphosphatemia is one of the major features of CKD, particularly of end stage renal
      disease(ESRD). Lots of evidences have shown that high levels of serum phosphorus and an
      elevation of the serum calcium Ã— phosphorus product can lead to cardiovascular calcifications
      and subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD.it is tempting to
      hypothesize that hyperphosphatemia may be responsible for the rise of cardiac biomarkers in
      CKD patients.So we use one phosphate binder to reduce phosphorus absorption in hemodialysis
      patients for one year and observe the change of cardiac biomarkers of those patients.
