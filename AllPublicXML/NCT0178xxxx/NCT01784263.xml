    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of individual cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) relative to a standard community treatment, in youngsters with
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The individual CBT program has been tailored over the last
      five years to the clinical needs of high-functioning youth with ASD.

    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is among the most common childhood developmental disorders. A
      key goal in the field is the discovery of methods that reduce core autism symptoms. Core
      autism symptoms include social-cognitive impairments, pragmatic language deficits, and
      repetitive and rigid behaviors. The core symptoms tend to be stable and resistant to
      intervention. Most treatments involve group-based social skills training (SST), with limited
      effects. No treatment for core autism symptoms in school-aged children with ASD meets
      American Psychological Association guidelines for possible efficacy. Cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) offers a novel approach for addressing core autism symptoms in higher
      functioning school-age youngsters. Initial results suggest that individual CBT may also be
      promising for reducing core autism symptoms (Wood et al., 2009b; Drahota, Wood et al., 2011).
      The treatment is based on a contemporary model of memory retrieval competition, employing
      strategies for enhancing the retention of adaptive conceptual and behavioral responses and
      the suppression of idiosyncratic beliefs and behaviors in daily social contexts, emphasizing
      the use of deep semantic processing to enhance memory retrieval. We are proposing a
      randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of individual CBT relative to a standard
      community treatment in youngsters with ASD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             and ADOS tests.

          -  If taking medication, have maintained a stable dose for 1 month prior to baseline
             assessment.

          -  Between the ages of 9-13 years.

          -  The child's teacher consents to participate in the study to play a modest role in

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  IQ less than 85.

          -  The child starts taking new medication(s) or current medication dose changes either
             (a) less than 1 month prior to the diagnostic evaluation, or (b) during the study
             period.

          -  The child is participating in an intensive early intervention program for autism such
             as applied behavior analysis or floortime.

          -  For any reason the child or parents appear unable to participate in the treatment
             program.
