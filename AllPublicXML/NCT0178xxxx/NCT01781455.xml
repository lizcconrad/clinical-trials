        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed written informed consent must be obtained and documented according to

             accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) prior
             to study-specific screening procedures

          2. A histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic,
             unresectable, or recurrent and for which standard curative or palliative therapies do
             not exist or are no longer effective.

          3. ≥ 18 years of age

          4. Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)

          6. Male or female patients of child-producing potential must agree to use contraception
             or avoidance of pregnancy measures during the study and for 30 days after the last
             BBI503 dose

          7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test

          8. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; or equal to 1.5 × upper
