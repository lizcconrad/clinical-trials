  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      xTAG RPP assay is a PCR-based assay to detect the presence or absence of viral and bacterial
      DNA / RNA in clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs).

      The objective of this study is to establish diagnostic accuracy of the xTAG RPP.

    <description>Accuracy determinations (diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative agreement) were based on the fraction of comparator positive (or negative) results which were also positive (or negative) by xTAG RPP.</description>
