    <textblock>
      This study examines the long term safety and efficacy of the Fixed Dose combination
      BAY98-7106 (nifedipine plus candesartan primarily at the highest dose in development) in
      patients with moderate to severe hypertension.

      Patients meeting the entry criteria, will receive the Fixed Dose combination for 28 weeks,
      including 8 weeks with stepwise dose increase up to the high target dose. The first 200
      subjects completing 28 weeks will continue treatment for additional 24 weeks (52 weeks in
      total).

      Subjects who do not tolerate an increased dose will be treated at their highest tolerable
      dose.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (that is, any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (that is, any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. AEs were considered to be treatment-emergent if they had started or worsened after first application of study medication. TEAEs of special interest included the incidence of symptomatic hypotension and the incidence and severity of vasodilatory adverse events (such as oedema, headache, and flushing). Only subjects who had TEAEs of special interest as mild, moderate or severe were reported.</description>

    <description>Laboratory evaluations of blood and urine samples were performed, including hematology (hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cells count, white blood cells count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelets), blood chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, uric acid, total protein, albumin, calcium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose), urinalysis (pH, blood, specific gravity, glucose, protein, cells/sediment). A laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant, for example, causing withdrawal by subject, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by the investigator, were reported as AEs.</description>

    <description>Subjects received nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) / candesartan cilexetil fixed dose combination (FDC) (BAY98-7106) tablet orally, once daily in the morning of Visit 1 (Week 0) for 28 or 52 weeks. The starting dose (30/8 milligram [mg] or 30/16 mg) was determined based on local practice and clinical judgment by the investigator. Based on the experience of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypotension, peripheral edema or significant tolerability, the doses were up-titrated to the highest target dose (60/32 mg).</description>

          <title>Nifedipine GITS/Candesartan Cilexetil FDC (BAY98-7106)</title>
          <description>Subjects received nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) / candesartan cilexetil fixed dose combination (FDC) (BAY98-7106) tablet orally, once daily in the morning of Visit 1 (Week 0) for 28 or 52 weeks. The starting dose (30/8 milligram [mg] or 30/16 mg) was determined based on local practice and clinical judgment by the investigator. Based on the experience of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypotension, peripheral edema or significant tolerability, the doses were up-titrated to the highest target dose (60/32 mg).</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) of Special Interest up to Week 52/End of Study (EOS)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (that is, any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. AEs were considered to be treatment-emergent if they had started or worsened after first application of study medication. TEAEs of special interest included the incidence of symptomatic hypotension and the incidence and severity of vasodilatory adverse events (such as oedema, headache, and flushing). Only subjects who had TEAEs of special interest as mild, moderate or severe were reported.</description>

The starting dose (30/8 milligram [mg] or 30/16 mg) was determined based on local practice and clinical judgment by the investigator. Based on the experience of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypotension, peripheral edema or significant tolerability, the doses were up-titrated to the highest target dose (60/32 mg).</description>

        <description>Response rate was defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved a systolic blood pressure response (MSSBP of &lt;140 mmHg or a reduction of MSSBP of more than (&gt;) 20 mmHg from baseline value), or a diastolic blood pressure response (MSDBP of &lt;90 mmHg or a reduction of MSDBP of &gt;10 mmHg from baseline value).</description>

            <description>Subjects received nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) / candesartan cilexetil fixed dose combination (FDC) (BAY98-7106) tablet orally, once daily in the morning of Visit 1 (Week 0) for 28 or 52 weeks. The starting dose (30/8 milligram [mg] or 30/16 mg) was determined based on local practice and clinical judgment by the investigator. Based on the experience of symptomatic and asymptomatic hypotension, peripheral edema or significant tolerability, the doses were up-titrated to the highest target dose (60/32 mg).</description>
