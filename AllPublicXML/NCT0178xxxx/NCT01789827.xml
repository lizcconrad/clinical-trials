      This pilot clinical trial studies aldesleukin imaging in viewing tumor growth in patients
      with stage IV melanoma receiving ipilimumab or pembrolizumab therapy. Diagnostic procedures,
      such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), uses radioactive drugs and a
      scanner to make detailed pictures of areas inside the body and may be a less invasive way to
      check for stage IV melanoma. Radioactive drugs, such as technetium Tc 99
      hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2, carry radiation directly to cancer cells
      and may be able to differentiate between tumor growth due to inflammation versus tumor
      progression in patients with stage IV melanoma receiving therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility/biodistribution of 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 (technetium Tc 99
      hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin 2) scintigraphy in patients with metastatic
      melanoma undergoing immunotherapy with either ipilimumab (commercial source) or
      pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) invasion (scintigraphy/histology) with
      tumor burden; and description of any clinical side effects associated with imaging.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of TIL invasion assessed by 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 scintigraphy vs. histology (total
      and subsets of TIL), as well as screen for peripheral blood correlates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. COHORT I: Patients undergo technetium Tc 99
      hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2 scintigraphy prior to receiving ipilimumab
      or pembrolizumab and at 12 weeks.

      COHORT II: Patients undergo technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked
      interleukin-2 scintigraphy prior to receiving ipilimumab or pembrolizumab, at 3-4 weeks, and
      at 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-45 days.

A 95% binomial confidence interval of the proportion of patients who develop a grade 2+ allergic reaction, grade 3+ anaphylaxis, or grade 2+ injection site reaction will be constructed.</description>

    <description>Spearman rank correlation coefficients will be used to examine the association between T/B ratio and the pre-treatment tumor biomarkers. Spearman rank correlation coefficients will be used to examine the association between changes in T/B ratio, changes in TIL percentages, and changes in peripheral blood concentrations of T, B, and NK cell subsets.</description>
