    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Successful allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is often limited by
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Migration of donor cells into tissues plays a major role in
      GVHD. Drugs that block chemokine receptors such as CCR5, can potentially decrease the
      migration of donor cells into tissues. Blocking CCR5 after allogeneic stem-cell
      transplantation may therefore reduce the rates of GVHD.

      PURPOSE: This study explores the efficacy of pharmacologic inhibition of CCR5 in prevention
      of GVHDby administering maraviroc during allogeneic stem-cell transplantation with reduced
      intensity conditioning.

      Detailed Description:

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To estimate the cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD by day 180 with the addition of
      maraviroc to a standard prophylaxis regimen in patients with hematologic malignancies
      undergoing reduced intensity allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (RIC SCT) from unrelated
      donors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the toxicity of a prolonged administration of maraviroc in patients undergoing
           RIC SCT.

        2. To estimate the rates of severe (grade 3-4) acute GVHD by day 100 and 180, grade 2-4
           acute GVHD by day 100, organ-specific acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, infections,
           non-relapse mortality, use of immunosuppressive therapies and 1-year survival in
           patients treated with maraviroc after RIC SCT.

        3. To assess the effect of treatment with maraviroc on immune recovery, engraftment and
           donor T-cell chimerism in peripheral blood and in target organs.

        4. To assess the effect of donor and recipient CCR5 genotype on the incidence of acute GVHD
           in patients receiving maraviroc as part of a GVHD prophylaxis regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a standard conditioning regimen with fludarabine and busulfan
      followed by a peripheral blood stem cell infusion from an unrelated donor, standard GVHD
      prophylaxis and standard antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis. In addition, all patients
      receive maraviroc from day -3 to d+ 90.

      Patients are followed for 1 year after the stem-cell infusion.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ≥18 years of age with a hematologic malignancy other than aplastic anemia or
             primary myelofibrosis, scheduled to undergo RIC allogeneic SCT with a peripheral blood
             stem cell graft from an unrelated donor, using Flu/Bu conditioning and Tac/MTX GVHD
             prophylaxis. The following diagnoses are included:

               -  Acute leukemia - AML, ALL or acute biphenotypic leukemia. Patients will have
                  documentation of complete remission within 6 weeks prior to their transplant.
                  Complete remission is defined as &lt;5% blasts on a bone marrow biopsy and absence
                  of any known extramedullary disease.

               -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia in any stage, but with documentation of &lt;5% blasts
                  on a bone marrow biopsy within 6 weeks prior to transplant.

               -  Myelodysplastic syndrome of any subtype, but with documentation of &lt;5% blasts on
                  a bone marrow biopsy within 6 weeks prior to transplant.
