  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the study medication blood levels after administration
      of a repeat oral capsules (one capsule each day for seven days) of Bendavia at one of two
      dose levels. The effects of Bendavia on the volunteers will also be assessed.
