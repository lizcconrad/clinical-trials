  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of raltegravir (RAL) given to
      HIV-1-exposed newborn infants at risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. (Pharmacokinetics are the
      various interactions between a drug and the body.) This study will also evaluate the
      appropriate dose of RAL to give to an infant to prevent the infant from getting HIV infection
      from its mother.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and PKs of RAL given to HIV-1-exposed newborn infants at
      risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. The study also seeks to determine the appropriate dosing
      regimen of RAL that can be safely given to infants in the first 6 weeks of life.

      The study will enroll 50 mother-infant pairs. Mothers will be followed until discharge from
      the labor and delivery unit, and infants will be followed for 24 weeks after birth. Infants
      will be assigned non-randomly to 1 of 2 cohorts. Each cohort will include two groups of
      infants: a RAL-naïve group including infants born to mothers who did not receive RAL before
      delivery, and a RAL-exposed group including infants born to mothers who received at least one
      dose of RAL within 2 to 24 hours before delivery.

      A minimum of 12 infants will be enrolled into Cohort 1. All infants in Cohort 1 will receive
      RAL as oral granules for suspension as a single dose within 48 hours of birth, in addition to
      standard of care ARV drugs for PMTCT, and a second dose of RAL at 7 to 10 days of life.

      A minimum of 20 infants will be enrolled into Cohort 2. Within Cohort 2, RAL will be started
      within 48 hours of birth in the RAL-naïve infants and between 12 and 60 hours of birth in the
      RAL-exposed infants. Both the RAL-naïve and the RAL-exposed infants in Cohort 2 will receive
      RAL for 6 weeks, in addition to standard of care ARV for PMTCT. Dosing will be determined
      based on analyses of data generated from Cohort 1 and from other studies.

      Study visits for infants in Cohorts 1 and 2 will occur at study entry through Week 24 and
      include a medical history, physical exam, blood draw, and, at select study visits, PK
      samplings.

      Note: As of January 2017, enrollment and follow-up to Cohort 1 (RAL-exposed and RAL-naïve
      groups) and enrollment to Cohort 2 (RAL-naïve group) are complete.
