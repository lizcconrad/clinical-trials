  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective pilot study will examine whether the previously reported effects of NSAIDs
      on colorectal cancer may be modulated through alterations in tissue gene expression, up
      regulation of local immune cell infiltrates or down-regulation of the systemic inflammatory
      response.

    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer is the second commonest cause of death from cancer in the UK. Of patients who
      have an apparently curative operation, half unfortunately suffer disease recurrence and die
      before 5 years. Clearly more research is required to improve outcomes in this condition. Most
      current research focuses on antitumour strategies, however the reaction of the patient (host)
      to the tumour is also important. The host inflammatory responses to the cancer are likely to
      represent part of this host-tumour relationship. Inflammation plays an important role in
      predicting patients who will die. Currently it is not known whether antiinflammatory drugs
      have any effect on cancer related inflammation detected in the blood or in/around the tumour.

      Aims: We hope to demonstrate that tumour related inflammation in bowel cancer can be altered
      using anti- inflammatory drugs. This may form the rationale for the use of antiinflammatory
      drugs to improve prognosis in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery.

      Methods: This pilot study will investigate whether simple antiinflammatory drugs can alter
      markers of inflammation both in the blood and in/around the tumour. Patients having bowel
      cancer surgery will be prescribed one of two anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin 75mg once daily
      or ibuprofen 400mg three times daily) for 2 to 3 weeks prior to their operation. Blood and
      tumour samples before and after the treatment will be analysed.

      If the study's aims are met and cancer-related inflammation can be altered prior to surgery,
      then a larger scale drug trial will be proposed to demonstrate reduced cancer recurrence and
      improved survival.
