      Description of logistics, learning curve and radiological results in 70 patients treated with
      patient specific instrumentation in total knee arthroplasty as a standard procedure

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Orthopaedic Clinic Gersthof is a teaching hospital, where the entire spectrum of joint
      replacements with emphasis on hips and knees is performed. Twenty surgeons perform TKAs at
      our institution, with approximately 400 TKAs implanted per year.

      The PSI system of Smith &amp;Nephew® (Patient-Matched Cutting Blocks [PMCB]; the VISIONAIRE®
      technology) is applied. The preoperative image modality is based on a long leg standing X-ray
      as well as an MRI of the knee. The Genesis II® Endoprosthesis (Smith &amp; Nephew®) is used as
      the TKA implant.

      This study is a observational monocentric prospective study.

      Estimated enrollment: 70 Enrollment time: September 2011-October 2012 Primary outcome:
      Alignment

      The postoperative X-rays (AP, lateral view, and long leg standing), taken 7-to-10 days after
      surgery are evaluated in terms of component position and restoration of the mechanical
      alignment. X-rays are routinely monitor-guided but not calibrated at our institution.

      As a secondary outcome the learning curve is evaluated using the following parameters
      collected during surgery: the fit of the cutting blocks, changes of the implant size, bony
      recuts, soft tissue releases, and changes in inlay size. Gap balancing was subjectively
      judged by the operating surgeon. Operation time, number of blood transfusions, and early
      postoperative complications were recorded within the first 14 days after surgery.

    <description>In order to evaluate the learning curve associated with using VISIONAIRE® technology for TKA, the following parameters are registered during surgery: the fit of the cutting blocks[subjective grading by the surgeon], changes of the implant size[number of changes], bony recuts[number of recuts], soft tissue releases[number of releases, kind of release], and changes in inlay size [number of inlay changes]. Gap balancing is subjectively judged by the operating surgeon. Operation time[minutes], number of blood transfusions[units], and early postoperative complications associated with the treatment [kind and number] within the first 14 days after surgery are recorded.</description>
