      The current study examines the effects of milnacipran in patients who have chronic persistent
      knee pain one year or longer after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to evaluate for a
      pain-relieving effect.

      The current study proposes to collect pilot data on the utility of open-label milnacipran for
      the treatment of pain and other outcomes in this unfortunate group of patients with chronic
      persistent pain after TKA. Among marketed serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
      (SNRIs), milnacipran has a unique property in that it blocks serotonin and norepinephrine
      reuptake equally. It is plausible that equipotent reuptake inhibition may confer greater
      analgesic benefit compared to other agents, and in preclinical animal models milnacipran has
      shown superior effects of ameliorating hyperalgesia and allodynia compared to some other
      antidepressant drugs. Additionally, milnacipran does not have inhibitory effects on
      cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes, no binding affinity to neurotransmitter receptors liable to
      cause adverse events, and simple pharmacokinetics.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Visual Analogue Scale(VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and endpoint 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is change in pain VAS from baseline to 12 weeks (baseline score minus 12 week or endpoint score; positive number reflects reduction in pain score). The effect size was calculated using the VAS scores measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm:
0= absence of pain or no pain noted 100 = worst imaginable pain/as bad as can be The higher the score the greater the over all pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Society Score (KSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and endpoint (12 weeks or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>KSS measures subjective pain and objective function by joint physical exam. This secondary outcome was the change in Knee Society Score(KSS)from baseline through 12 weeks.
KSS scores measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm:
0 = absence of pain or no pain noted 100= worst imaginable pain/as bad as can be The higher the score the greater the over all pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Score of Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to endpoint (12 weeks or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Measures subjective fatigue.20-item self-report instrument consisting of five scales: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Reduced Activity, Reduced Motivation, and Mental Fatigue.
Each scale contains four items rated on a scale of one to 5 with the scale score of one having the anchor of entirely true and the scale score of 5 having the anchor of no, not true. The five scales were identified through factor analysis and are assumed to measure different aspects of fatigue. Lowest possible total score = 20 (absent fatigue) Highest possible total score = 100 (maximum fatigue) Total mean cumulative scores were reported</description>

    <measure>Change in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to endpoint (12 weeks or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure is change in Beck Depression Inventory. The scale for this inventory is:
0-9: indicates minimal depression 10-18: indicates mild depression 19-29: indicates moderate depression 30-63: indicates severe depression. The higher the score the degree of depression.</description>

    <description>Staff-rated assessment of depressive symptoms. Scale is as follows:
0 to 6 - normal /symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20 to 34 - moderate depression &gt;34 - severe depression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Score of State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and endpoint (12 weeks or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of subjective symptoms of current anxiety and chronic anxiety. There are 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. State anxiety items include: &quot;I am tense; I am worried&quot; and &quot;I feel calm; I feel secure.&quot; Trait anxiety items include: &quot;I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter&quot; and &quot;I am content; I am a steady person.&quot; All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.
Lowest total score is 40 (absent anxiety) Highest total score is 160 (maximum anxiety) Total mean cumulative scores were reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Score of Short Form-36 (SF-36), Measuring Perceived Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and endpoint (12 weeks or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective measure of perceived quality of life.The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight.
The eight sections are:
vitality,
physical functioning,
bodily pain,
general health perceptions,
physical role functioning,
emotional role functioning,
social role functioning,
mental health
Scale:
0= lowest quality of life 100= high quality of life Higher scores reflect higher quality of life. Total mean cumulative scores were reported.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome is change in pain VAS from baseline to 12 weeks (baseline score minus 12 week or endpoint score; positive number reflects reduction in pain score). The effect size was calculated using the VAS scores measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm:
0= absence of pain or no pain noted 100 = worst imaginable pain/as bad as can be The higher the score the greater the over all pain intensity.</description>
