                       with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of
                       vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to
                       enrolling. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment
                       is she considered not of child bearing potential.

        If a study patient becomes pregnant or suspects being pregnant during the study or within
        30 days after the final dose of nilotinib, the Study Doctor needs to be informed
        immediately and ongoing study treatment with nilotinib has to be stopped immediately.
