      The specific aims of the proposed study are to:

        1. Develop the innovative depression care management technology, including the speech
           recognition technology for automated monitoring and patient prompts over time, automatic
           integration of the responses into the patient registry, and evidence-based
           decision-support algorithms for care actions;

        2. Conduct the quasi-experiment in eight Los Angeles County Department of Health Services
           (LAC-DHS) clinics to test the interventions;

        3. Use mixed-method evaluation to assess the extent of the implementation of the
           interventions, the acceptance to the providers and to the patients, and the impact on
           adoption of depression screening and treatment management over time, utilization, and
           cost of healthcare services, and patient health outcomes; and

        4. Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the three study arms. Successful completion of
           the study will demonstrate which Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) adoption
           strategies are successful and why, their comparative cost-effectiveness, as well as
           which strategies are successful under which circumstances to inform system-wide
           implementation of same.

      Hypotheses of the Proposed Study

      The following are the main hypotheses of the study:

        1. There will be statistically significant difference in the adoption of depression care
           screening and management over time among the three study groups.

           1.1. The adoption rate will be Technology-supported care (TC) &gt; Supported Care (SC) &gt;
           Usual Care (UC).

        2. There will be statistically significant difference in the depression symptom reduction,
           and better functional status, and quality of life among the three study groups.

           2.1. The difference between the TC and the SC will not be statistically significant, but
           both will be greater than the UC group.

        3. There will be statistically significant difference in the diabetes care process and
           outcomes among the three study groups.

           3.1. The difference between the TC and the SC will not be statistically significant, but
           both will be greater than the UC group.

        4. There will also be statistically significant differences in healthcare utilization among
           the three study groups, with least utilization in the TC group where the greatest level
           of technology is applied.

        5. Of the three groups compared, the TC group will be the most cost-effective approach for
           accelerating adoption of the CER depression care results.

      In addition, the study will aim to answer the secondary research questions listed below:

        1. What is medical provider satisfaction with the technology used in the TC (Technology
           Care) group?

        2. What is patient acceptance with the technology used in the TC group?

        3. What factors are identified by medical providers and clinic administrators as related to
           satisfaction, barriers, and sustaining the intervention post-trial?

        4. What are patients' reported satisfaction and facilitating factors and barriers to
           receipt and acceptance of depression care?

    <description>The depression care-management technology that will interact with patients is the Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) for remote monitoring data collection. The ASR will use automated telephone calls to reach out to patients to repeat depression screening using PHQ-9, triggered either by calendar date or upcoming appointments, and to remind patients of their appointments in pre-determined time. In addition, the ASR will apply a structured script to conduct automatic follow-up with patients regarding their depression treatment adherence and side effects in order to provide data to help primary medical providers promptly and optimally adapt treatment. The ASR script will also include structured relapse prevention prompts. For providers and administrators, the depression care-management technology aimed to improve their workflow regarding depression care is Enhanced Disease Registry (EDR)..</description>
