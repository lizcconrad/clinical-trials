  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding speech is essential for good communication. Individuals with hearing loss and
      poor speech discrimination often have little success with hearing aids because amplifying
      sound improves audibility, but not clarity of the speech signal. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the relative importance of the sensory cells of the inner ear and auditory
      neurons on speech discrimination performance in quiet and in noise. This information may be
      used as a predictor of hearing aid benefit. The investigators expect to find decreased speech
      understanding ability resulting from both loss of sensory cells and the loss of auditory
      neurons.
