    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient and treating physician agree on a treatment plan at visit 3. Patient adherence to medications will be evaluated based on pill count at each follow-up study visit. Additionally, each patient will record their adherence to therapy on the Patient Expectations and Disease-related Questionnaire (PEDQ) at each follow-up study visit, allowing the study team to track compliance with pharmacologic therapy as well as treatments including therapy exercise plans.</description>
