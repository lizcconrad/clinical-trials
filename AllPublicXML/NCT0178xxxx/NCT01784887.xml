    <textblock>
      Utilizing wound healing trajectory analysis, patient-reported pain and QOL assessment,
      quantitative bacteriology, and inflammatory infiltrate quantification, an improvement in
      wound healing will be observed on a cellular, histomorphological and clinical level in the
      presence of a bioelectric dressing applied in conjunction with SOC.

      The PROCELLERA Antimicrobial Wound Dressing is considered a non-interactive wound dressing
      containing silver and zinc, classification product code MGP. Non-interactive wound dressings
      are considered by FDA to be non-significant risk, as per their Investigational Device
      Exemptions Manual (publication FDA 96-4159).

      Procellera is FDA cleared under K081977 for professional use as a wound dressing for partial
      and full-thickness wounds.

      Selection of Subjects

      Type of the Subject Population

        -  At least 18 years old

        -  Male or female

        -  All ethnic groups

      As a military-civilian cooperative Phase II prospective randomized trial, the study
      population will include chronic wound patients from both military and civilian backgrounds.

      As incidence of complex non-healing wounds remains high in both military and civilian
      hospital settings, it is estimated that recruitment rate will be sufficiently rapid at each
      research site. While unanticipated delays (e.g. slow accrual) may occur, the limited patient
      population and length of time allotted for the clinical study (2 years) is assumed to offset
      any delays. A total of 60 participants will be enrolled studywide to obtain 50 evaluable
      participants from both sites combined. Up to 16 patients will be screened each day. A
      consecutive series of patients who meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria and agree
      to participate will be recruited.

      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

    <description>Assessment of the clinical efficacy of a bioelectric dressing in conjunction with standard-of-care on the healing rate of chronic soft tissue wounds compared with standard-of-care alone. In this 50-subject study, the primary endpoint for efficacy will be the rate of healing (healing trajectory) in the treatment group compared to that of the control group, during the 12-week treatment study period. It is hypothesized that a bioelectric dressing will reduce wound healing time when compared to SOC treatment, thereby accelerating wound healing trajectory.</description>

    <measure>Dressing Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate the efficacy of a bioelectric dressing in the areas of enhanced and accelerated wound healing on a clinical, histomorphological and cellular level studied through wound healing with decreased incidence of bacterial infection, decreased pain levels for chronic non healing wounds studied through standard validated pain assessment tools, and improved quality of life (QOL), using complex non-healing wounds as a model for tissue response. Secondary endpoints for efficacy will be study wound inflammatory infiltrate, bacterial load, and patient reported pain and quality of life (QOL) by means of visual acuity score (VAS) and SF-12, respectively.</description>
