  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the relapse free survival and overall survival of
      Imatinib (Gleevec) or high dose Interferon (Intron) in treating melanoma which has primary
      tumor and regional lymphonode (if have) removed in patients whose disease carries a c-kit
      mutation. It is assumed that Gleevec may be more effective on relapse free survival as the
      adjuvant treatment compared with Interferon.

      If mutation tests show that the patient is eligible and they choose to participate in the
      study, they will be randomized and receive imatinib/Interferon. Each imatinib pill will be
      100mg and the participants will take 4 pills once daily (400mg).Participants randomized to
      the interferon arm will receive Interferon 1500wiu/m2 d1-5 for 4 weeks followed by 900wiu IH
      TIW for 11 months. The following study procedures will also be performed at routine intervals
      throughout the course of treatment including blood tests, medical history updates, physical
      exams and Chest/Abdomen/Pelvic CT examinations.Participants will be on this study for one
      year and then be followed up to relapse or distal metastasis.
