  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the signs of nephronic reduction in preterm infants who
      have presented neonatal acute renal failure. The investigators hypothesize that signs of
      nephronic reduction would appear earlier in former preterm with neonatal acute renal failure
      than in control preterm infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 former preterm infants who presented acute renal failure will be evaluated between 3 to 10
      years.

      They will be compared to 25 control former preterm infants without renal dysfunction for
      signs of nephronic reduction.

      At inclusion, in order to analyse renal function, all infants will have blood sampling, renal
      echography and blood pressure measurement. Urine sample will also be collected.

      Two months later, parents will be informed on the results.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is to prove that former preterm infants with neonatal acute renal failure are at higher risk of nephronic reduction than control former preterm infants and that they will present microalbuminuria as earlier sign of nephronic reduction. Precisely, if microalbuminuria divided by creatinuria is above 20mg/g or 2mg/mmol, it will be considered as pathologic.</description>
