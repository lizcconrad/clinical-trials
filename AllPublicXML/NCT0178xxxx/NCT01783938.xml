      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sequential combination
      therapy of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the potential synergistic activity of nivolumab and ipilimumab and also
      because there may be differences in biology between tumors which are stable or responding to
      therapy and those that are clinically progressing, this study, CA209064, looked at two
      sequential combination regimens in which the second agent is administered immediately after a
      pre-specified duration of therapy with the first agent and not delayed until the time of
      progression after the first agent. This sequential study design looked at pharmacodynamic
      changes during treatment with one agent which may predict clinical activity to subsequent
      treatment with the alternate agent. This was done because it has not been scientifically
      proven whether or not the order in which nivolumab and ipilimumab are given is clinically
      important.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-related Grade 3-5 Adverse Events (AEs) During the Induction Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The rate or percentage of participants with treatment-related grade 3-5 AEs is defined as the number of participants who experienced at least 1 treatment related Grade 3 - 5 adverse event (AE) per NCI CTCAE version 4.0 criteria, any preferred term with an onset date after or on first day of Induction Period #1 and not later than discontinuation date from Induction Period #2, divided by the total number of treated participants. AEs with an onset date after start date of Continuation Period or start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy were not included. Adverse Event (AE)=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may or may not have a causal relationship with treatment. Treatment-related=having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4=Potentially Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-assessed Response Rate at Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate is defined as the number of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at Week 25 per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria, with confirmation on the scheduled scan at Week 33 (or any subsequent scan performed at least 4 weeks after the Week 25 scan), divided by the total number of treated participants. Results of the tumor assessment at Week 13 or any unscheduled tumor assessment obtained prior to Week 25, except for baseline/screening tumor assessment, were not considered in the assessment of response rate at Week 25. Any treated participant without an evaluable Week 25 time point response (per modified RECIST 1.1) was considered a non-responder for primary analysis of response rate at Week 25. Evaluations occurring after the dates of subsequent anticancer therapy were not included when determining or confirming response at Week 25. Confidence interval based on the Clopper and Pearson method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-assessed Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 25 up to date of disease progression or death, up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) was performed to further characterize the response rate at Week 25. Duration of response is defined as the time between the Week 25 date of response and the date of objectively documented disease progression as defined by modified RECIST 1.1 criteria or death, whichever occurs first. DOR was assessed for participants with confirmed response at Week 25. Median computed using Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-assessed Rate of Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 13; Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The progression rate at a specific timepoint is defined as the number of participants who have Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at that specific timepoint divided by the total number of randomized participants. As specified by modified RECIST 1.1, the evaluation of PD at Week 13 and Week 25 used the baseline tumor assessment as reference. For purposes of the primary analysis of progression rates, if a treated participant were missing his/her tumor assessment at the specified study week, then the results of the previous tumor response evaluation were to be carried forward. Both clinical and radiological progressions were counted as a progression outcome. A participant who died without a reported prior progression was considered to have progressed on the date of his/her death. Deaths before or at Week 13 are counted as progression outcome. Confidence interval based on the Clopper and Pearson method.</description>

          <description>Participants received nivolumab solution at 3 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously every 2 weeks for up to 6 doses during Weeks 1 to 13 in Induction Period 1, followed by ipilimumab solution at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses during Weeks 13 to 25 in Induction Period 2. Per protocol, a participant was allowed to permanently discontinue one agent and then receive the other agent. Participants received nivolumab solution at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, starting at week 25 in the continuation period, for a maximum of 2 years from 1st study treatment in Induction Period 1. At end of 2 years, participants who had investigator-assessed benefit and were tolerating therapy were allowed to continue nivolumab therapy in the Extension Period. Regimen followed until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Treatment Period includes induction period 1, 2, continuation, and extension period.</description>

        <title>Investigator-assessed Response Rate at Week 25</title>
        <description>Response rate is defined as the number of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at Week 25 per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria, with confirmation on the scheduled scan at Week 33 (or any subsequent scan performed at least 4 weeks after the Week 25 scan), divided by the total number of treated participants. Results of the tumor assessment at Week 13 or any unscheduled tumor assessment obtained prior to Week 25, except for baseline/screening tumor assessment, were not considered in the assessment of response rate at Week 25. Any treated participant without an evaluable Week 25 time point response (per modified RECIST 1.1) was considered a non-responder for primary analysis of response rate at Week 25. Evaluations occurring after the dates of subsequent anticancer therapy were not included when determining or confirming response at Week 25. Confidence interval based on the Clopper and Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Investigator-assessed Rate of Progression</title>
        <description>The progression rate at a specific timepoint is defined as the number of participants who have Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at that specific timepoint divided by the total number of randomized participants. As specified by modified RECIST 1.1, the evaluation of PD at Week 13 and Week 25 used the baseline tumor assessment as reference. For purposes of the primary analysis of progression rates, if a treated participant were missing his/her tumor assessment at the specified study week, then the results of the previous tumor response evaluation were to be carried forward. Both clinical and radiological progressions were counted as a progression outcome. A participant who died without a reported prior progression was considered to have progressed on the date of his/her death. Deaths before or at Week 13 are counted as progression outcome. Confidence interval based on the Clopper and Pearson method.</description>

Per protocol, a participant was allowed to permanently discontinue one agent and then receive the other agent. Participants received nivolumab solution at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, starting at week 25 in the continuation period, for a maximum of 2 years from 1st study treatment in Induction Period 1. At end of 2 years, participants who had investigator-assessed benefit and were tolerating therapy were allowed to continue nivolumab therapy in the Extension Period. Regimen followed until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Treatment Period includes induction period 1, 2, continuation, and extension period.</description>
