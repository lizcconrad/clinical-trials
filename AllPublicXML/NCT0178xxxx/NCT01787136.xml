      Dextromethorphan added on methylphenidate for the patients with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder

      Background: The disruptive symptoms of ADHD caused academic, interpersonal functions
      impairments and affects about 5% of children. Dysregulation in immunological functions were
      reported either in the patients with ADHD and other often comorbid neuropsychiatric
      disorders. Our study is designed to investigate the novel agent, dextromethorphan, with its
      antiinflammation by neuroprotection in the way to reduce ADHD symptoms and the concurrent
      conditions like tics, or autistic features.

      Methods: In the first year, we will correlate the cytokine level between the ADHD severity
      (N=30) and the level of proinflammatory cytokines will be measured with the cytokine protein
      array. The level of cytokines will be correlated with the severity of symptoms. In the second
      year,. the patients with ADHD will be randomly divided into two groups treated with
      dextromethorphan added on methylphenidate (MPH) (N=30) or MPH only (N=30) for 8 weeks. The
      difference of the presence of good responders between two groups will be analyzed. In
      addition, we will investigated the correlation between the reduction of cytokine and
      improvement of severity of ADHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 6 to 25 who have ADHD symptoms will be recruited. They will be screened
             for the ADHD symptoms with SNAP 4th version. They then will be referred to a
             psychiatrist to make a final diagnosis of ADHD by the American Diagnostic Statistical
             Manual 4th version (DSM-IV).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not willing to participate in the study after detailed explanation.

          -  Patients who could not follow the investigator's instructions

          -  Patients who have severe neurological or mental illness like epileptic disorder,
             history of stroke, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mental retardation or uncontrolled
             suicide risk.

          -  Patients who have severe medical illness or surgical conditions like uncontrolled
             abnormal thyroid function, history of heart attack, uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Patients who are taking antidepressants, psychotropic medicines within two months
             prior to the evaluation for entering our study.

          -  Patients who are allergic to methylphenidate or dextromethorphan.

          -  Patients with autoimmune disorders

          -  Patients with asthma or severe infection disorder currently or in the previous two
             months to avoid the influence of the level of cytokines.
