      Two - four 6MWT performed according to ATS standards. Each walk however had specifically
      altered wording and coaching performed in random order to determine differences in outcomes.
      One walk was done in the standard ATS fashion. One was done coaching to walk as fast as the
      patient can walk. One was coached to walk at the patients normal walking pace. One was
      coached to walk at the patient's leisure walking pace.

      Alternate 6MWT where subjects will be asked to walk as fast as they can, walk as normal as
      they can and walk leisurely as they can in 6 minutes compared to standard of care 6MWT which
      is walk as far as you can in 6 minutes.

    <ipd_description>We found that when the instruction was given to walk as fast as they can in six minutes, the distance was statistically greater than when the instruction was to walk as far as they can in six minutes. THe other instructions given yielded no difference in outcome. Other measures such are heart rate, Borg dyspnea score and saturation were not as statistically significant.</ipd_description>
