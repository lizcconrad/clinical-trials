  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at conducting a medium-intense walking program called Walk With Ease with
      cancer patients age 60 and above who are starting chemotherapy treatment. We will measure how
      many of these patients complete their participation in this program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a
      moderate-intensity walking program (Walk With Ease/WWE) among cancer patients, age ≥60 years,
      as they undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment. Feasibility will be determined based on the
      rate of participation in the WWE program. As secondary objectives, we will also establish the
      rate of completion of a number of instruments, including a Geriatric Assessment tool, and
      other instruments that measure self-reported quality of life (e.g., fatigue, depression, and
      pain), and self-reported physical activity (PA). Data from these instruments, as well as from
      serial measurements of a biomarker of aging (p16INK4a) will be explored and used to inform
      future studies designed to evaluate any relationship between these variables and
      participation in the WWE program.

      We propose a sample (n=30) of cancer patients ≥60 years of age with potentially curable
      cancer and a diagnosis of Stage I-III breast cancer, Stage I-III lung cancer, or Stage II-III
      colon cancer, who are about to begin chemotherapy. Participation will be defined as
      completing the 6-week WWE program. Results from this study will be used in an RO1 application
      to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) pertaining to PA interventions among cancer patients
      and the effects of biomarkers on prognosis and survival.

    <description>The primary activity required of study subjects is a 6-week self-directed (non-group) WWE walking program that study participants do at a place and time that is convenient for them. To start the intervention/program, we schedule a brief baseline meeting with study participants to discuss the program, provide the WWE workbook, secure printed informed consent, and complete various questionnaires. Study participants are also asked to maintain a daily walking diary that is provided to them.
The WWE program includes a workbook with strengthening and stretching exercises, basic facts about arthritis and PA, and information on how to individualize the program.</description>
