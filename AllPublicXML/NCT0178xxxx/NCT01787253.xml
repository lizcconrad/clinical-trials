      Objective: This study aims elucidate the pathophysiological link between the environment in
      the colon (mainly the microbiota), the local immune system and activation of the enteric
      nervous system in patients with post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) and microscopic colitis (MC)
      with special emphasis on microbial-mucosa interactions and evaluation of the effect on the
      immune activation/response as well as how afferent gut-brain signalling leads to abdominal
      discomfort.

      Method: The project is based on data from three cohorts of patients, one with PI-IBS and one
      with MC as well as a gender- and age-matched cohort of healthy individuals. Measurement of
      perceived sensitivity in the gut will be evaluated by pain-response under mechanical stress
      using a barostat. The HIT (Human intestinal Tissue)-Chip array will be used to characterize
      the diversity, stability and functionality of the intestinal microbiota on mucosa level,
      giving a clue to the interactions with the host and insight to changes leading to the
      development of the two diseases.

      Immunohistochemistry and flowcytometry will be used to analyse the location, frequency and
      phenotype characteristics of lymphoid- and mast cells. Functional analysis of mucosal
      lymphocytes activated in vitro by products from the intestinal microbiota will be examined by
      cytokine production using the LuminexTM system. The Ussing chamber technique will allow
      investigation of the impact of the microbiota and its metabolites on intestinal barrier
      functions. In this method the sample has access to stressors under standard conditions.

      We will make a characterization of lymphocytes, mast cells and gut microflora. Depending on
      these results we will make stimulations of patient biopsies to find if tissue from patients
      react differently then patients from healthy.

    <description>LPLs and IELs stained with the following flourochrome-conjugated antibodies: anti-CD3-FITC (clone-HIT3a), anti-CD4-FITC/PECy5 (clone-RPA-T4), anti-CD45RA-PE (clone-HI 100), anti-CD45RO-PECy5 (clone-UCHL1), anti-CD19-PE (clone-HIB19) and anti-CD138-FITC (clone-MI15), all from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA, USA). Anti-CD8α-ECD (clone-SFCI21Thy2D3) and anti-CD8β-PECy5 (clone-2ST8.5 H7) were purchased from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA, USA) whereas anti-CD38-PECy5 (clone-HIT2), anti-αβTCR-PECy5 (clone-IP26) and anti-γδTCR-PE (clone-B1) were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA). Fluorochrome-conjugated isotype matched control antibodies were used as controls for non-specific staining, and were purchased from BD Pharmingen or Beckman Coulter (IgGκ-FITC, IgG2bκ-PE, IgG1-ECD, IgG2bκ-PECy5, IgG2κ-FITC, IgG1κ-PE, IgG1κ-PECy5, and IgG2a-PECy5).</description>
