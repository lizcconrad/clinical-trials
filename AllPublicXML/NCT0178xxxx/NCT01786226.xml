  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: to evaluate the efficacy, safety and quality of life by using 2.5 and
      mifepristone 5 mg daily doses to treat uterine fibroids over 3 months with a 9 months
      follow-up period.

      The hypothesis of the study is that the 2.5 mg dosage resulted in a lesser reduction in
      fibroid size but a similar improvement in quality of life when compared to the 5 mg dose.

      Women, in fertile age or in premenopausal status, presenting symptomatic uterine fibroids
      were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg or 10 of mifepristone.

      The diminishing of prevalence of symptoms attributable to uterine fibroids is the most
      important goal to achieve under both treatments. The possible side effects of mifepristone
      are slight and women's adherence to treatment is remarkable. Also the reduction of the
      volumes of the uterus and fibroids contribute to enhance the wellbeing of subjects.
