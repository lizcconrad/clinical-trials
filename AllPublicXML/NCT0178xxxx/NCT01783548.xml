    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) Subject-Reported Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) Over The First 6 Weeks Of Treatment In Subjects 6 To 11 Years Of Age</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -4 to Day 1 predose), Day 1 (postdose) to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Reflective TNSS is an evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours prior to the recording of the score. Participants (with assistance from parents/guardians/caregivers, as needed) assessed and recorded four nasal symptoms (runny nose, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) twice daily (AM and PM) using the following scale:
0 = absent (no sign/symptom present)
1 = mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)
2 = moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable)
3 = severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping) The total TNSS scale was 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms.
Baseline and the during study rTNSS values were defined as the average AM and PM subject-reported rTNSS during each time period.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) Subject-Reported Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) Over The First 6 Weeks Of Treatment In Subjects 6 To 11 Years Of Age</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -4 to Day 1 predose), Days 1 (postdose) to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Instantaneous TNSS is an evaluation of symptom severity over the last 10 minutes prior to the recording of the score. Participants (with assistance from parents/guardians/caregivers, as needed) assessed and recorded four nasal symptoms (runny nose, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) twice daily (AM and PM) using the following scale:
0 = absent (no sign/symptom present)
1 = mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)

3 = severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping) The total TNSS scale was 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms.

          -  A documented history of PAR to a relevant perennial allergen for a minimum of 12
             months (6 months for subjects 4 to 5 years of age) immediately preceding the study
             Screening Visit (SV).

          -  A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR through a
             standard skin prick test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps or other
             clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent nasal biopsy, nasal
             trauma (e.g., nasal piercing) or surgery, atrophic rhinitis, or rhinitis medicamentosa
             (all within the last 60 days prior to the Screening Visit [SV]).

          -  History of a respiratory infection or disorder (including, but not limited to

             Period.

          -  Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or
             routine use of beta-agonists and any controller drug (e.g., theophylline, leukotriene
             antagonists). History of intermittent use (less than or equal to 3 uses per week) of
             inhaled short acting beta-agonists prior to the Screening Visit (SV) is acceptable.

          -  Have any of the following conditions that are judged by the investigator to be
             clinically significant and/or affect the subject's ability to participate in the

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) Subject-Reported Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) Over The First 6 Weeks Of Treatment In Subjects 6 To 11 Years Of Age</title>
        <description>Reflective TNSS is an evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours prior to the recording of the score. Participants (with assistance from parents/guardians/caregivers, as needed) assessed and recorded four nasal symptoms (runny nose, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) twice daily (AM and PM) using the following scale:
0 = absent (no sign/symptom present)
1 = mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)
2 = moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable)
3 = severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping) The total TNSS scale was 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms.
Baseline and the during study rTNSS values were defined as the average AM and PM subject-reported rTNSS during each time period.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) Subject-Reported Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) Over The First 6 Weeks Of Treatment In Subjects 4 To 11 Years Of Age</title>
          <description>Reflective TNSS is an evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours prior to the recording of the score. Participants (with assistance from parents/guardians/caregivers, as needed) assessed and recorded four nasal symptoms (runny nose, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) twice daily (AM and PM) using the following scale:
0 = absent (no sign/symptom present)
1 = mild (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)
2 = moderate (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable)
3 = severe (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping) The total TNSS scale was 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms.
Baseline and the during study rTNSS values were defined as the average AM and PM subject-reported rTNSS during each time period.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set (FAS) included all participants in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of randomized study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline subject-reported rTNSS assessment.</population>
