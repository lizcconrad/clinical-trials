      To confirm the safety and performance of the Medtronic Engager™ Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Implantation System via direct aortic approach in patients with symptomatic severe aortic
      valve stenosis at high or extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement for which
      treatment via direct aortic access is preferred.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe aortic stenosis as defined by Doppler echocardiography: aortic valve area ≤ 0.8
             cm2 (or AVA index ≤ 0.5 cm2/m2), or mean gradient ≥ 40 mmHg, or max velocity ≥ 4m/s

          -  NYHA Functional Class II or greater;

          -  Logistic EuroSCORE I ≥ 20%, or comorbidity judged by the heart team to pose an
             absolute or relative contraindication for conventional aortic valve replacement;

          -  Age ≥ 18 years;

          -  The patient has been informed of the nature of the study and has consented to
             participate, authorizing the collection and release of his/her medical information by
             signing a consent form (&quot;Patient Informed Consent Form&quot;). Patient should understand
             the implications of participating in the study and should be legally competent to
             provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve;

          -  Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation;

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 25%;

          -  Left ventricular outflow obstruction, such as Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy
             and severe septal hypertrophy;

          -  Mitral or tricuspid regurgitation greater than 2+ by angiography or moderate by
             echocardiography;

          -  Patients with life expectancy less than 12 months due to an underlying non-cardiac
             co-morbid disease;

          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine,
             clopidogrel, Nitinol or contrast medium that cannot be adequately controlled with
             pre-medication;

          -  Sepsis or acute endocarditis;

          -  Blood dyscrasia such as acute anemia, leucopenia, or thrombocytopenia; bleeding
             diathesis, or coagulopathy;

          -  Renal insufficiency assessed by creatinine clearance &lt; 20 ml/min and/or end-stage
             renal disease requiring chronic dialysis;

          -  Active peptic ulcer or GI bleeding within 3 months from the planned index procedure;

          -  Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization;

          -  Cardiogenic shock, suspected cardiogenic shock, or hemodynamic instability requiring
             inotropic support or mechanical heart assistance;

          -  Significant aortic disease, including abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm, defined
             as maximal luminal diameter of 5 cm or greater;

          -  Need for emergency surgery, cardiac or non-cardiac;

          -  History of myocardial infarction in the last 6 weeks;

          -  History of TIA or CVA in the last 6 months;

          -  Therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure, with the exception of BAV, performed within 30
             days of the planned date of valve implantation, or 6 months in the case of
             drug-eluting stents;

          -  Pre-existing prosthetic heart valve or prosthetic ring in any position;

          -  Patient refuses a blood transfusion;

          -  Patient is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial that may
             influence the outcome of this trial.
