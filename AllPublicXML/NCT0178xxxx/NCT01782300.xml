      Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and other more severe forms of disease. This study will
      evaluate the safety and immune response to two doses of a dengue virus vaccine given 12
      months apart in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses are a major health concern, particularly in the tropical and subtropical
      regions of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has made the development of a
      dengue vaccine a top priority. There are four types of dengue viruses (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, and
      DEN4), each of which can cause various illnesses, including dengue fever, or the more severe
      disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). This study will evaluate the
      safety and immune response to two doses of a dengue virus vaccine (TV003) when administered
      12 months apart in healthy adults. The study will also evaluate whether the candidate vaccine
      may protect against all four types of dengue viruses.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the TV003 study vaccine or placebo vaccine.
      At study entry, participants will undergo a blood collection and physical examination, and
      female participants will take a pregnancy test. Participants will then receive an injection
      of their assigned vaccine. They will take their temperature three times a day for 16 days
      after each vaccination and record the results on a diary card, which research staff will
      review during participants' study visits. Additional study visits will occur on Days 3, 10,
      14, 21, 28, 56, 90, 180, 270, and 330. All study visits will include blood collection and a
      physical examination; select visits will include a pregnancy test for female participants. At
      a study visit on Day 360, all participants will receive an injection of the same vaccine they
      received at study entry. Additional study visits will occur on Days 363, 370, 374, 381, 388,
      416, 450, and 540, and will include the same study procedures as previously performed.
