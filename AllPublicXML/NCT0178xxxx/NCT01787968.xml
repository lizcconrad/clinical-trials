  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T. cruzi has been divided into two main lineages: T. cruzi I (TcI) and T. cruzi II (TcII,
      including all non-TcI). TcI is predominant in Mexico and Central America, while TcII
      (non-TcI) is predominant in most of South America, including Argentina. In recent studies
      from Argentina, the risk of congenital transmission has been estimated to vary between 2.6
      percent and 7.9 percent. By contrast, we know very little about the congenital transmission
      of TcI. It has been suggested that congenital transmission of T. cruzi is strain related, and
      there is an urgent need to know if TcI transmits differently than TcII (non-TcI). Our primary
      hypothesis is that congenital transmission rates are different for TcI versus TcII. Our
      secondary hypothesis is that the characteristics of T. cruzi infected mothers (e.g., age,
      parity, transmission in previous pregnancies) and their exposure to vectors are different in
      regions where TcI is predominant versus regions where TcII (non-TcI) is predominant. To test
      these hypotheses, we propose to conduct a prospective study to enroll at delivery 13,000
      women in Mexico, 7,500 women in Honduras, and 10,000 women in Argentina. We will measure
      transmitted maternal T. cruzi antibodies in cord blood, and, if the results are positive, we
      will identify infants who are congenitally infected by performing parasitological
      examinations on cord blood and at 4-8 weeks, and serological follow-up at 10 months. We will
      also perform standard PCR, real-time quantitative PCR, and T. cruzi genotyping on maternal
      blood, standard PCR and T. cruzi genotyping on the cord blood of congenitally infected
      newborns, and serological examinations on siblings. We will estimate the exposure to vectors
      in the household. In addition, we will measure prenatal outcomes among infected and
      uninfected infants with seropositive mothers, and the birth weight of their siblings. The
      specific aims of this study are: 1) To determine the rate of congenital transmission of TcI
      compared to TcII (non-TcI); 2) To compare the T. cruzi infected mothers' characteristics and
      exposure to vectors in regions where TcI is predominant and regions where TcII (non-TcI) is
      predominant; and 3) To describe the birth outcomes of infected and uninfected infants born to
      TcI and TcII seropositive women.
