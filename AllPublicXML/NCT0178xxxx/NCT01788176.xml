    <textblock>
      Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a disorder of the extremities that is characterized
      by spontaneous unexplained disproportionate pain, hyperalgesia, swelling, limited range of
      motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patchy bone demineralization.The incidence
      of CRPS was estimated to be 5.46 per 100,000 person years at risk in Olmsted County,
      Minnesota (US), with a prevalence of 20.57 per 100,000, while its incidence in the general
      population of the Netherlands was estimated to be much higher, at 26.2 per 100,000
      person-years. The adverse effects were not serious and lasted just a few days. The beneficial
      effects of other bisphosphonates have been already documented in several placebo-controlled
      trials; however, there are no reports on the use of zoledronic acid to reduce pain in CRPS
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients over 18 years of age of both genders, with continuing pain that is
             disproportionate to any inciting event, with cardinal features of CRPS.

          2. Pain - after initial injury with signs and symptoms present at first visit

          3. History of previous unsuccessful treatment for pain, with a minimum of two drug
             therapies, such as non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, antidepressants,
             central acting analgesics, calcitonin or sympathetic blocks, (not bisphosphonates) for
             at least six months.

          4. Must report at least one symptom in three of the four following categories:

               1. Sensory: Reports of hyperesthesia and/or allodynia

               2. Vasomotor: Reports of temperature asymmetry and/or skin color changes and/or skin
                  color asymmetry

               3. Sudomotor/Edema: Reports of edema and/or sweating changes and/or sweating
                  asymmetry

               4. Motor/Trophic: Reports of decreased range of motion and/or motor dysfunction
                  (weakness, tremor, dystonia) and/or trophic changes (hair, nail, skin).

                  and/or deep somatic pressure and/or joint movement)
