    <textblock>
      This is an experiment that will compare the effect of recommending breakfast consumption, or
      breakfast skipping, on body weight. Our objective is to determine if breakfast consumption
      recommendations can produce weight loss, and if that weight loss is dependent on typical
      breakfast eating habits.

    <description>Participants will be provided with a free USDA nutrition pamphlet describing general good nutrition habits. They will also receive an instruction handout to emphasize some of the points in the dietary guidelines in the handout. The clinician will go through both documents with participants in detail by reading them aloud and answering any questions, and it will be recommended that they incorporate the suggestions as best they can into their daily life.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the breakfast group will be instructed to consume breakfast before 10:00 a.m. every day, and will be asked to not eat again until after 11:00 a.m. Participants will be counseled on what a healthy breakfast is using an instruction handout. No specific restrictions will be given on types of foods that can be consumed for the breakfast meal. They will be instructed to keep track of their breakfast consumption (yes/no) using a calendar diary that will be provided to them. Participants will also be provided with a free USDA nutrition pamphlet describing general good nutrition habits. The clinician will go through both documents with participants in detail by reading them aloud and answering any questions, and it will be recommended that they incorporate the recommendations into their daily life as much as they can.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the no breakfast group will receive a detailed handout with instructions to not consume any calories before 11:00 a.m. every day. Only water or 0 calorie beverages may be consumed from the time of waking until 11:00 a.m. They will be instructed to keep track of their breakfast consumption (yes/no) using a calendar diary that will be provided to them. Participants will also provided with a free USDA nutrition pamphlet describing general good nutrition habits.
