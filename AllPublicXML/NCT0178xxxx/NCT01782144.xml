  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a serious medical, social, and economic problem and is becoming even greater
      concern, as the prevalence of overweight and obese individuals has steadily increased over
      the years. Excessive body weight can have a profound influence on lower extremities,
      including pain, degenerative disease, and compromised quality of life. However, no study
      to-date has examined the effects of weight change on foot structure and function in
      individuals over time. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of weight
      reduction on foot structure and function in obese adults. Improved understanding of the
      relationship between body weight and foot biomechanics is needed to promote health and
      healthier lifestyles.
