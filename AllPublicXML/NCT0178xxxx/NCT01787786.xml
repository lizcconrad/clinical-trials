    <textblock>
      The use of pharmacokinetic analyses incorporating relevant determinants of the infliximab
      serum concentration can be used to develop a predictive model that will allow optimized
      dosing for individual patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a diagnosis of CD or UC by usual criteria,

          -  moderate to severely active CD defined by a CDAI ≥ 220, with confirmed endoscopic
             activity (CDEIS ≥ 6) or moderate to severely active UC, defined by a Mayo Score ≥ 6,
             with a Mayo endoscopic subscore ≥ 2,

          -  a need for treatment with IFX for induction of remission as clinically indicated

          -  patients previously exposed to adalimumab and/or certolizumab who are naïve to
             infliximab will be allowed to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  perianal CD exclusively

          -  disease limited to the rectum in patients with UC (i.e., disease must extend ≥ 15 cm
             from the anal verge)

          -  patients with known antibodies to IFX (ADAs) at baseline

          -  a contraindication to infliximab therapy

          -  a contraindication to endoscopy

          -  an ostomy

          -  planned surgery

          -  evidence of severe or unstable hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory,
             neurological, psychiatric, hematological or renal disease at the discretion of the
             investigator,

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding,

          -  treatment with any investigational drug in the past 30 days, or 5 half lives
             (whichever is longer).
