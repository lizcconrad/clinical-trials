      This study involves completion of questionnaires, computer-based cognitive tasks and an
      alcohol drinking session. Participation in this study consists of an initial, in-person
      screening appointment, 4 brief daily appointments at the research office, an alcohol drinking
      session at a local bar and a follow-up appointment 1-3 days after the alcohol drinking
      session.

      Participants who are found to be eligible in the screening phase will then complete a daily
      appointment for 4 days out of a 5-day period (i.e., there will be 1 day out of the 5 on which
      they will not attend an appointment). Each appointment will last 20 minutes, on average and
      consist of a questionnaire and computer-based cognitive task. On the day of the fourth
      appointment, participants will complete an alcohol drinking session. The alcohol drinking
      session begins at 4pm and lasts until at least midnight.

      Participants in this study will be young adults between the ages of 21-25, who regularly
      drink alcohol and are not currently seeking treatment for alcohol use. Seventy-two
      participants will complete this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be between the ages of 21-25.

          -  Be able to read English and complete study evaluations.

          -  Drink alcohol on a regular basis

        Exclusion Criteria:

        No participant may:

          -  Be seeking treatment for alcohol or other addictive behaviors or have been in
             inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment within the past 12 months.

          -  Provide two positive breath alcohol concentration (BAC) readings (i.e., &gt; 0.00%) at
             any of the following times: in-person screening, a pre-session screening, or at the
             outset of an alcohol self-administration session. After participants blow their first
             positive BAC, they will be allowed to reschedule and participate at another time,
             however if they blow a second positive BAC, they will be excluded from this study and
             offered referrals for alcohol treatment.

          -  Have positive urine screen results at the in-person screening or pre-session screening
             on the day of an alcohol self-administration session for opiates, cocaine,
             phencyclidine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, barbiturates, methadone or
             benzodiazepines.

             psychomotor tasks administered in this study. Participants must perform within two
             standard deviations of the mean from the samples in relevant prior studies

          -  Perform computer tasks initially administered at baseline in either a random or
             inordinately slow fashion

          -  A body mass index lower than 18.5 or greater than 35.
