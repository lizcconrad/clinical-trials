  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will result in a software application compatible with the Apple iPad,
      iPhone and iPod Touch (hereafter termed &quot;iOS devices&quot;) which addresses several aspects of
      prosodic deficits common in speakers with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and other
      communication disorders, using a developmentally appropriate, intuitive interface that
      requires little technical skill and which can be managed by educators and parents. The
      program will contain elements that aid in tracking and maintaining individual student
      progress records, and will be designed for use in the classroom, at home, and in other
      environments. This study's intended focus is on the feasibility and usability of the software
      application.

    <description>A specialized iPad application, entitled SpeechPrompts, has been developed to treat prosodic difficulties commonly seen in ASDs. SpeechPrompts provides the SLPs that work with students with ASDs an additional tool to treat prosody. The SpeechPrompts software offers visual support and biofeedback to change prosody. These two tools are not typically available for school-based SLPs.</description>
