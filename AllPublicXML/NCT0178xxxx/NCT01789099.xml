    <textblock>
      In this study, up to 21 patients with lung cancer will receive UV1 (a therapeutic synthetic
      peptide vaccine) at different dose levels. The safety and tolerability of UV1 as well as
      immunological response will be assessed. The purpose of this study is to select a biological
      dose of peptides for further clinical trials. Study recruitment completed at 6 patients in
      every dose level.

      The main study treatment phase of this study is completed and will be reported separately.

      Follow-up is ongoing

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label dose-escalating phase I/IIa study of UV1 peptide vaccination in
      patients with NSCLC after completion of radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Patients will
      be enrolled in this study if they have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR)
      or stable disease (SD) at least 4 weeks after completion of standard first line therapy.

      The following 2-step design will be used:

        1. Conventional dose escalation with at least 3 patients per dose level (3 selected dose
           levels).

        2. Expansion of each dose level to a total of 6 patients for assessment of immune response
           levels.

      13 UV1 vaccinations will be given during the first 6 months (week 26) of treatment, unless
      clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Leukine ®) will be used as adjuvant for 11 of the 13
      doses of UV1.

      After completion of the main study treatment period at week 26, if the patient agrees,
      additional vaccinations may be considered for the following patients:

        -  Immune responders within first 6 months

        -  Immune non-responders providing they have at least SD

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who has been treated with palliative
             radiotherapy and/or at least three courses of chemotherapy, and has achieved stable
             disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) confirmed by CT scan at
             least 4 weeks after end of treatment. Previous curative radiotherapy is allowed as
