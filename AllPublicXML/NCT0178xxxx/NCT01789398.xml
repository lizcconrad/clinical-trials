             the investigator's opinion would preclude the patient's participation and completion
             of this trial or comprise reliable representation of subjective symptoms.

             study participation.

          -  Patient with a known history of long QTc syndrome (e.g. syncope or arythmia) or
             presenting any significant serious abnormality of the ECG (e.g. recent myocardial
             infarction), or QTc interval strictly higher than 450 ms (electrocardiogram Bazett's
             corrected).

          -  Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment or with Severe Renal Impairment, or with any
             other significant abnormality in the physical examination or clinical laboratory
             results.
