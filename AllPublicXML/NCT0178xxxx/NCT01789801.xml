  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that an experienced ultrasound operator is able to
      efficiently perform radial arterial puncture on patients where an initial operator failed to
      puncture arteries via simple palpation.

      The objective of this study is to compare &quot;difficult-to-puncture&quot; patients randomized into
      two groups: one group where ultrasound is used to aid artery localisation, and one group
      where only palpation is used.
