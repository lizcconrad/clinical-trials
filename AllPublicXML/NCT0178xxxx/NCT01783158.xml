    <textblock>
      Patients with HNSCC represent a high-risk group for the development of SESCC. Thus,
      esophagogastrofibroscopy should be performed to detect possible synchronous esophageal
      carcinomas in these patients.

      Although only two patients with synchronous primary carcinomas were found among the patients
      with newly diagnosed HNSCC in this study, esophagoscopy and better some of advanced
      endoscopic methods should be recommended after detection of HNSCC to exclude secondary
      esophageal carcinoma or dysplasia. Staining of the esophagus with Lugol's solution is an easy
      and inexpensive option and can be done in most of gastroenterology offices.

      ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the use of flexible esophagoscopy and chromoendoscopy with
      Lugol's solution in the detection of early esophageal carcinomas (second primary carcinomas)
      in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC).

      Methods: All patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC underwent office-based Lugol
      chromoendoscopy. After flexible esophagoscopy with white light, 3.0% Lugol iodine solution
      was sprayed over the entire esophageal mucosa. Areas with less-intense staining (LVLs) were
      evaluated and biopsies taken.

    <description>A total of 132 patients with HNSCC were enrolled in this study. The patients underwent esophagoscopy and chromoendoscopy. The most frequent primary tumors were oropharyngeal (49/132), tumors of the oral cavity (36/132) and larynx (35/132). The majority of subjects (107/132 patients, 81.1%) had advanced HNSCC carcinomas (stages III and IV). Multiple LVLs were discovered in 24 subjects (18.2%), and no LVLs in 108 (81.8%) subjects. Fifty-five LVL biopsy specimens were obtained and assessed. Squamous cell carcinomas were detected in two patients, peptic esophagitis in 11 patients, gastric heterotopic mucosa in two patients, hyperplasia in two patients, and low- and high-grade dysplasia in three patients.</description>
