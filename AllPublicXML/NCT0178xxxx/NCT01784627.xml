  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of a computer-facilitated alcohol
      screening and brief intervention (c-ASBI) system for 12- to 18-year-old primary care patients
      in a multi-site, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. The investigators hypothesize
      that, among 12- to 18-year olds patients coming for annual well-care, those receiving c-ASBI
      will have lower rates of any alcohol use at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups compared to
      Treatment As Usual (TAU).

      The Specific Aims are to 1) Test the effects of c-ASBI on any alcohol use; 2) Test the
      effects of c-ASBI separately as a prevention, therapeutic, and risk-reduction intervention;
      3) Test the effects of c-ASBI separately on cannabis and tobacco use; explore its effects on
      other drug use; and 4) Assess potential moderators (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity,
      substance use history +/-, parent/sibling/peer substance use), mediators (e.g., Youth to
      Provider Connectedness,20 perceived harmfulness of alcohol and drug use), and explore
      c-ASBI's mechanism of action.

    <description>Participants in the c-ASBI group will complete a computerized screen for alcohol, cannabis, tobacco and other drugs, then view their screen score and 10 pages of information about the health effects of substance use and true-life stories on the computer. Their provider will see a report of their screen results and provide advice to stop or decrease their use, or, for those at high risk, referral to complete a computerized motivational enhancement therapy intervention.</description>
