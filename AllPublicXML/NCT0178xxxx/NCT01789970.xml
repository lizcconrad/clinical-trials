  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydrocodone bitartrate
      extended-release tablets at doses of 30 to 90 mg every 12 hours compared with placebo in
      alleviating moderate to severe pain in patients with chronic low back pain. Patients may be
      opioid-naïve or opioid-experienced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of a screening period of approximately 7 to 14 days, an open label
      titration period of up to 6 weeks, and a double blind treatment period of 12 weeks.

      The objective of the open label titration period was to find the successful dose of
      hydrocodone extended release (ER) tablets that produced stable pain relief without
      unacceptable adverse events (AEs). Stable pain relief was defined as an average pain
      intensity (API) score over the previous 24 hours of 4 or less and a worst pain intensity
      (WPI) score of 6 or less on the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS-11) (0=no pain to
      10=worst pain imaginable) for either 4 consecutive days or 4 out of 7 consecutive days, while
      the same dose of study drug was maintained for up to 7 days. Scores for WPI and API were
      recorded daily in individual patient electronic diaries. Patients returned to the study
      center prior to each dose adjustment.

      The starting dose of hydrocodone ER tablets depended on whether the subject was opioid-naïve
      or opioid-experienced. Opioid-naïve participants started at a 15-mg dose of hydrocodone ER
      tablets every 12 hours. For opioid-experienced participants, the starting dose of hydrocodone
      ER tablets was to be approximately equivalent to 50% of the dose of opioid analgesic that
      they were receiving at screening and administered every 12 hours. Investigators switched
      participants from previous opioid therapy to hydrocodone ER tablets on the basis of
      predefined dose equivalents.

      Participants who met the criterion of a stabilized dose were randomly assigned into the 12
      week, double-blind, placebo controlled treatment period on the final day of the open label
      titration period (baseline visit). Participants began treatment with double blind study drug
      at the effective dose of hydrocodone ER tablets achieved during the titration period or
      matching placebo. Rescue medication was permitted in addition to the study drug during the
      double blind treatment period.

      Participants who participated in the study in compliance with the protocol and complete 12
      weeks of double-blind treatment with study drug, were considered to have completed the study
      and could have been eligible to enroll in a 6-month open-label study (study C32337/3104,
      NCT01922739).

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 of the Treatment Period in Weekly Average of Daily Worst Pain Intensity (WPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days -6 to 0 of Treatment Period (baseline), Week 12 of Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The WPI was recorded daily by participants in an electronic diary using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS-11), a Likert-type scale in which 0=no pain and 10=the worst pain imaginable. Participants selected the number that best described their worst pain intensity over the last 24 hours. Weekly WPI scores averaged daily scores collected over the previous 7 days for each analysis visit. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain control.
The analysis included WPI data observed before discontinuation of study drug and was based on the multiple imputations (MI) method to handle missing scores at week 12. Consistent with the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report (Panel on Handling Missing Data in Clinical Trials 2010), the MI method includes an assumption of missing at random (MAR) and takes into account a potential bias toward the active-drug treatment group for patients who discontinued study drug because of adverse events.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 of Titration Period up to Week 12 of Treatment Period (maximum treatment duration was 127 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Clinically Significant Hearing Changes From Baseline to Final Assessment in Pure Tone Audiometry Test Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 7-14 of Titration Period (baseline), Day 0 of Treatment Period (last day of Titration Period), Week 12 or end of study visit during the Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>Pure tone audiometry was performed by a qualified audiologist and was not done at the study center. During the test, the patient wore headphones and was seated in a quiet room; trained personnel manipulated the audiometry equipment to test the patient's hearing. For serial audiograms, the criteria for a clinically significant (CS) hearing change were based on the guidance from the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) 1994 (Konrad-Martin et al 2005). These criteria included the following: greater than 20 decibels (dB) pure tone threshold shift at 1 frequency; greater than 10 dB shift at 2 consecutive test frequencies; or threshold response shifting to &quot;no response&quot; at 3 consecutive test frequencies.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scales (SOWS) Total Scores During the Double-Blind Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 4 and Endpoint of the Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The results of the SOWS were collected in the e-diary daily during the first 4 weeks of the double blind treatment period and then during clinic visits at week 12 or early termination. The SOWS was a self-administered questionnaire used to measure a participant's signs and symptoms of withdrawal from opiates. The scale contained 16 symptoms (such as my nose is running; I feel restless), the participant rated the intensity on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) for a total score of 0-64. The daily total score for the first 4 weeks was the largest score observed during the time period preceding that visit. For example, the week 1 score for each participant was the largest total score on any day between baseline and the night before the week 1 visit; the week 4 score for each participant was the largest score observed between the week 2 visit and the night before the week 4 visit.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scales (COWS) Total Scores During the Double-Blind Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 4 and Endpoint of the Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>COWS is a clinician-rated scale used to measure a participant's signs and symptoms of withdrawal from opiates, with ratings based only on apparent relationship to withdrawal. The COWS was performed at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12 (double blind treatment period) or early termination. The scale contained 11 signs/symptoms whose intensity the clinician rated on a scale of 0 to 4 or 5.
A total score was calculated as the sum of the responses to the 11 signs/symptoms for a total range of 0-48. Withdrawal severity was classified, based on the total score, as follows:
0 to 4=normal
5 to 12=mild
13 to 24=moderate
25 to 36=moderately severe
36=severe</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 845 patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain were screened at 78 centers in the U.S.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 625 patients enrolled, 2 patients withdrew consent before taking any study drug. Of 623 patients who were enrolled and received study drug, 371 patients achieved a successful dose of hydrocodone extended-release (ER) tablets and were randomly assigned to receive hydrocodone ER or placebo during the double-blind treatment period</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Hydrocodone ER (Open-Label Titration Period)</title>
          <description>All participants were administered hydrocodone ER tablets at dosages of 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90 mg every 12 hours to identify a dosage deemed successful for managing their pain.</description>

A step wise, double-blind tapering schedule was implemented during the first 2 weeks of the 12 week, double blind, placebo controlled treatment period to reduce the risk of withdrawal effects in patients randomly assigned to placebo.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 of the Treatment Period in Weekly Average of Daily Worst Pain Intensity (WPI)</title>
        <description>The WPI was recorded daily by participants in an electronic diary using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS-11), a Likert-type scale in which 0=no pain and 10=the worst pain imaginable. Participants selected the number that best described their worst pain intensity over the last 24 hours. Weekly WPI scores averaged daily scores collected over the previous 7 days for each analysis visit. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain control.
The analysis included WPI data observed before discontinuation of study drug and was based on the multiple imputations (MI) method to handle missing scores at week 12. Consistent with the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report (Panel on Handling Missing Data in Clinical Trials 2010), the MI method includes an assumption of missing at random (MAR) and takes into account a potential bias toward the active-drug treatment group for patients who discontinued study drug because of adverse events.</description>

        <description>The RMDQ is a patient-rated, 24-question evaluation used to assess acute disability associated with low back pain. Each question is answered with a YES or NO response, and each YES response is given 1 point. Scores on the RMDQ range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater disability. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in level of disability.</description>

        <title>Participants With Adverse Events During Open-Label Titration and Double-Blind Treatment Periods</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

        <description>Pure tone audiometry was performed by a qualified audiologist and was not done at the study center. During the test, the patient wore headphones and was seated in a quiet room; trained personnel manipulated the audiometry equipment to test the patient’s hearing. For serial audiograms, the criteria for a clinically significant (CS) hearing change were based on the guidance from the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) 1994 (Konrad-Martin et al 2005). These criteria included the following: greater than 20 decibels (dB) pure tone threshold shift at 1 frequency; greater than 10 dB shift at 2 consecutive test frequencies; or threshold response shifting to “no response” at 3 consecutive test frequencies.</description>

        <title>Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scales (SOWS) Total Scores During the Double-Blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The results of the SOWS were collected in the e-diary daily during the first 4 weeks of the double blind treatment period and then during clinic visits at week 12 or early termination. The SOWS was a self-administered questionnaire used to measure a participant's signs and symptoms of withdrawal from opiates. The scale contained 16 symptoms (such as my nose is running; I feel restless), the participant rated the intensity on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) for a total score of 0-64. The daily total score for the first 4 weeks was the largest score observed during the time period preceding that visit. For example, the week 1 score for each participant was the largest total score on any day between baseline and the night before the week 1 visit; the week 4 score for each participant was the largest score observed between the week 2 visit and the night before the week 4 visit.</description>

        <title>Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scales (COWS) Total Scores During the Double-Blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>COWS is a clinician-rated scale used to measure a participant's signs and symptoms of withdrawal from opiates, with ratings based only on apparent relationship to withdrawal. The COWS was performed at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12 (double blind treatment period) or early termination. The scale contained 11 signs/symptoms whose intensity the clinician rated on a scale of 0 to 4 or 5.
A total score was calculated as the sum of the responses to the 11 signs/symptoms for a total range of 0-48. Withdrawal severity was classified, based on the total score, as follows:
0 to 4=normal
5 to 12=mild
13 to 24=moderate
25 to 36=moderately severe
36=severe</description>
