  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the typical motor and sensory impairments, individuals with multiple sclerosis
      (MS) often experience cognitive dysfunction and sleep disturbances. Cognitive impairment
      occurs in 40 % - 70% of patients with MS. In addition, sleep problems in individuals with MS
      are very common, and approximately 50% of patients with MS have a diagnosable sleep disorder.
      The research believes that aerobic exercise improve cognitive function and improve sleep
      quality.
