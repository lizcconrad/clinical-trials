  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
      neurocognitive therapeutic exercise in subjects affected by shoulder impingement syndrome in
      comparison with traditional therapeutic exercise. The traditional exercise protocol contains
      mainly strengthening exercises, stretching exercises, Codman's pendulum exercises and
      exercises against elastic band resistance. The neurocognitive exercise protocol contains ten
      exercises involving specific instruments (e.g., table inclined with a board with five
      concentric circles, sponges of various texture). Each subject, randomly assigned to either
      neurocognitive therapeutic exercise (group 1) or traditional therapeutic exercise (group 2),
      will be submitted to one-hour session for three times a week for five weeks. The outcome
      measures used will be the Quick-DASH questionnaire, the Constant-Murley shoulder outcome
      score, the ASES score, a visual analogic scale (VAS) and the assessment will be performed at
      baseline (T0), at the end of treatment protocol (T1), at 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3) from
      the end of treatment.
