    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study will
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO6811135 in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients will be randomized to receive either
      RO6811135 or placebo daily for 2 weeks, with a follow-up examination 2 to 3 weeks after the
      last dose of study drug.
