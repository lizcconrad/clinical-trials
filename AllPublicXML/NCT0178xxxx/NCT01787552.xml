  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase Ib/II clinical trial is to: a) evaluate the safety of the
      co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 in myelofibrosis patients and establish a maximum
      tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase II dose of the combination and b) to assess the
      efficacy of the co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 on spleen volume reduction.

      The purpose of this phase Ib/II clinical trial is to: a) evaluate the safety of the
      co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 in myelofibrosis patients and establish a maximum
      tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase II dose of the combination and b) to assess the
      efficacy of the co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 on spleen volume reduction. Adult
      patients, aged ≥ 18 years, with myelofibrosis that meet intermediate or high risk prognostic
      criteria and exhibit palpable splenomegaly ≥ 5 cm below the left costal margin that have not
      been previously treated with a JAK or Smo inhibitor will be eligible for this study.
      Approximately 36 patients will participate in the Phase Ib dose escalation and safety
      expansion part of the study. Dose escalation will be dependent on the available toxicity
      information (including adverse events that are not DLTs), PK, PD, and efficacy information,
      as well as the recommendations from the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM). In the
      Phase II part of the study approximately 46 patients will be enrolled: 18 patients will be
      enrolled into Stage 1, if following an interim analysis the minimum number of responders are
      observed, 28 additional patients will be enrolled into stage 2. If less than the minimum
      number of responders are observed in Stage 1 then further enrollment will be halted.
      Approximately 82 patients will be enrolled in the entire study.
