  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is reported that more than 90,000 patients died of lung cancer and more than 20% of them
      were older than 80 years in North America. Therefore a less invasive but effective treatment
      is required for patients with lung cancer of advanced age, diminished pulmonary functions,
      and chronic diseases. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an effective and
      well-tolerated treatment for early stage lung cancer in medically inoperable patients. On the
      other hand, accurate mediastinal and hilar lymph node staging is one of the most important
      factors that determine the outcome and indications for SBRT. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided
      transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a novel, minimally invasive modality that
      enables the assessment of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with a high sensitivity. Accurate
      lymph node staging by EBUS-TBNA will allow opportunities for high-risk patients with lung
      cancer to undergo minimally invasive treatment.

      Patients with radiologically early stage lung cancer who are candidates for SBRT will be
      enrolled in this study. Prior to enrollment, patients are required to be evaluated by an
      experienced thoracic surgeon, radiation oncologist or medical oncologist to determine
      operability. Patients will udergo computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography
      (PET) prior to EBUS- TBNA. EBUS-TBNA will be performed at the Interventional Thoracic Surgery
      Suite (ITSS) located at Toronto General Hospital by a Thoracic Surgeon. The procedure will be
      performed under local anesthesia with conscious sedation. Mediastinal as well as hilar lymph
      nodes will be assessed by EBUS-TBNA. The result of pathological diagnosis using EBUS-TBNA
      will be compared with the result of radiological staging (CT and PET-CT). Patients who are
      negative for mediastinal lymph node metastasis by EBUS-TBNA will undergo SBRT. In addition,
      the treatment outcome will be evaluated based on the clinical chart review.

    <description>Primary objective: To test whether or not there is a difference in accuracy between CT/PET and the minimally invasive technique of EBUS-TBNA for mediastinal staging in patients with non-small cell lung cancer prior to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).
In comparing EBUS-TBNA vs. CT/PET the primary outcome measures will be:
1) Sensitivity, 2) Specificity, 3) Positive predictive value, 4) Negative predictive value, 5) Accuracy in detecting malignancy</description>

    <description>Currently EBUS-TBNA is performed in patients with CT and/or PET positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum or hilum. In this study, all patients being considered for SBRT will undergo EBUS-TBNA for the lymph node staging prior to SBRT.</description>
