      The purpose of this study is to evaluate progression free survival, transplant-related
      morbidity (TRM) at day +100 and at +365, overall survival and incidence of acute and chronic
      GVHD in refractory/early relapsed aggressive B-cell non Hodgkin lymphomas patients treated
      with allogeneic Transplantation after a conditioning with Thiotepa, Busulfan and fludarabin.

      In the present study, it is hypothesised that patients with aggressive B cell lymphomas
      refractory to or relapsed early (within 12 months) after the completion of standard
      first-line immunoProtocol TBF2012 Version 1, 20 Nov 2012 9 chemotherapy can benefit from
      de-bulking salvage therapy (i.e. R-DHAP + bortezomib) followed by an allograft to improve
      progression-free survival.

      Patient inclusion criteria

        -  Patients with refractory/relapsed aggressive B-cell non Hodgkin lymphomas after
           frontline therapy.

        -  Patients with stable disease or partial or complete remission (PET-negative) after
           salvage therapy

        -  Patients younger than 65 years old

        -  A fully HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor is available. Patients with one
           antigen mismatched donors can be considered

        -  Patient must be competent to give consent

      Patient exclusion criteria

        -  Patients treated with an autologous transplant as salvage therapy

        -  Patients with progressive lymphomas despite conventional therapies

        -  Patients with progressive lymphomas despite conventional therapies

        -  Uncontrolled CNS involvement with disease

        -  Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12 months
           following treatment

        -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding

        -  Organ dysfunction defined as follows:

             -  Cardiac function: ejection fraction &lt;30% or uncontrolled cardiac failure

             -  Pulmonary: DLCO &lt;40% predicted

             -  Liver function abnormalities: elevation of bilirubin to &gt; 3 mg/dl and/or
                transaminases &gt;4 the upper limit of normal

             -  Renal: creatinine clearance &lt;50 cc/min (24 hour urine Protocol TBF2012 Version 1,

           addition, if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a HBV
           DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded.

        -  Positive serology for hepatitis C (HC) defined as a positive test for HCAb, in which
           case reflexively perform a HC RIBA immunoblot assay on the same sample to confirm the
           result

        -  Psychiatric disorders or psychosocial problems which in the opinion of the primary
           physician or Principal Investigator would place the patient at unacceptable risk from
           this regimen.

        -  Patients with a history of non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin
           cancers) currently in a complete remission, who are less than 5 years from the time of
           complete remission, and have a &gt;20% risk of disease recurrence. Donor inclusion
           criteria:

        -  Related or unrelated HLA identical donors who are in good health and have no
           contra-indication to donation. One antigen HLAmismatched (9/10 match) donors will also
