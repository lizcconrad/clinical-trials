  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized clinical trial comparing surgical and conservative (physical therapy)
      treatments for women with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The purpose of the study is to
      determine the efficacy of physical therapy versus endoscopic surgery in pain and disability
      in women with carpal tunnel syndrome at medium and long-term follow-up periods. We
      hypothesized that proper physical therapy approach can be equally effective than surgical
      intervention for improving pain and function in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scientific evidence for the management of CTS has exhibited conflicting results. The Cochrane
      review concluded that surgical treatment relieves symptoms significantly better than
      splinting but further research is needed. A systematic review focused on physical therapy for
      the management of CTS included 6 studies and found weak to strong effect of neural gliding
      exercises. Recent studies have revealed complex nociceptive mechanisms involved in CTS which
      should be carefully considered during the management of these patients. Proper physical
      therapy interventions can modulate nociceptive processes found in CTS. We will perform a
      randomized clinical trial nested within a prospective cohort as our study design to determine
      if proper physical therapy approach targeted to modulate sensitization processes is equally
      effective than surgical intervention for improving pain and function in patients with carpal
      tunnel syndrome.

    <description>Patients self-perceived improvement will be assessed using a Global Rating of Change (GROC) consisting of a 15-point scale ranging from -7 (a very great deal worse) to +7 (a very great deal better).

    <description>The Spanish version of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) will be used. This questionnaire evaluates two domains: a) the functional status scale assesses ability to perform 8 common hand-related tasks; b) the symptom severity scale includes 11 items assessing pain severity, numbness, and weakness at night and during the day. Each question is answered on a 5 point scale (1: no complaint; 5: severe complaint), with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>
