  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomized, phase Ⅳ study, to investigate the extensive efficacy and
      safety of Recombinant Human Granulocyte/Macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor Hydro-gel for
      Topical Application (rhGM-CSF Gel) on deep 2nd burn.

      There are two parts of the phase Ⅳstudy, the first part was a multicenter, randomized,
      reference controlled study, all the subjects were randomized into two groups, test group
      (rhGM-CSF Gel) and control group (iodophor gauze), totally 358 deep 2nd burned patients were
      enrolled in first part of the study, 177 cases were enrolled in test group and 181 cases were
      enrolled in reference control group. In the test group, after the patients were enrolled in
      the group, clean the wound surface regularly and wash with normal saline, spread the test
      drug on the wound surface, bandaging with sterilized vaseline gauze, change the drug product
      every two or one day according to the effusion. In the reference control group, after the
      patients were enrolled in the group, clean the wound surface regularly and wash with normal
      saline, bandaging with iodophor gauze, change the drug product every two or one day according
      to the effusion. Whole treatment were lasted till the wound surface was healing completely,
      if it is not recovered in 4 weeks, calculate and record the healing rate. The secondary part
      of the study was a multicenter, open study, to investigate the safety of rhGM-CSF on deep 2nd
      burn patients. Totally 2329 patients were enrolled in this part of the study.
