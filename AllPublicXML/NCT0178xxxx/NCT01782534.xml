      The relevant predictive hospital risk factors for 5-year mortality of patients with aortic
      dissection is untill unlear. The aim of this study is to collect the clinical data of 111
      hospitalized patients admitted to hospital from Aug. 2001 to Aug. 2007, and statistically
      analyze the hospital risk factors related to 5-year mortality by univariate and multivariate
      binary logistic regression.

      Clinical data were collected from 111 hospitalized patients admitted to hospital from Aug.
      2001 to Aug.2007, and the related factors for death within 5 years after the onset of
      dissection, which include Gender, age, history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, renal
      insufficiency (azotemia), low admission diastolic blood pressure (&lt;70mmHg), Stanford typing
      (Stanford A or B), long-acting calcium channel blocker treatment,ACEI /ARB treatment,
      endovascular stent and surgical aortic replacement,were statistically analyzed by univariate
      and multivariate binary logistic regression.
