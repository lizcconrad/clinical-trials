  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      70% of breast cancers that occur in postmenopausal women rely on the hormone oestrogen to
      grow and are likely to respond to hormone treatment. This type of treatment reduces the
      amount of oestrogen in the body, slowing the growth of cancer or stopping it altogether. One
      type of hormone treatment, aromatase inhibitors (AIs), works by stopping the body from making
      oestrogen. Currently, women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is not
      being controlled by one class of AI are switched to the other class of AI. The reason for
      this is that some cancer cells can become resistant to one class but are still sensitive to
      the other class. However, oestrogen can be made in the body by two pathways and AIs block
      only one of these pathways. A new drug called Irosustat can reduce the production of
      oestrogen in the body by blocking the second pathway. This study is investigating whether
      adding Irosustat to AI treatment i.e. blocking both pathways at the same time, can further
      reduce the amount of oestrogen in the body and therefore control the breast cancer better.

      27 postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer that is not being controlled by their current AI treatment will be recruited in
      this study from 9 United Kingdom (UK) hospitals. Eligible patients will receive 40mg of
      Irosustat once daily in addition to the AI on which they progressed. Patients will receive
      Irosustat for as long as it controls their cancer or until they have side effects that stop
      them from taking treatment. Patients will be seen monthly for the first 6 months and every 3
      months thereafter. Participating patients will also be given the option to take part in the
      exploratory part of this study by donating tissue and blood samples.

               2. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of
                  resting ECG e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block

               3. Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age or
                  any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval.

         14. Uncontrolled abnormalities of serum potassium, sodium, calcium (corrected) phosphate
             or magnesium levels.

         15. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to
             swallow the formulated investigational medicinal product (IMP) or previous significant
             bowel resection that would preclude absorption of Irosustat or the AI.
