  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inhaled route of delivery has always been associated with the considerable challenge of
      getting the drug to its target. The lungs are a highly complex organ designed to filter
      inspired air, with many different cell types contributing to their function. Furthermore, the
      lungs may change dramatically when afflicted by disease resulting in an internal environment
      that works against the drug reaching and interacting successfully with the target. For
      targets in the upper airways this will have lesser significance, but drug delivery to the
      deep lung may be impeded by changes such as mucus hyper-secretion or thickening or airway
      narrowing.

      In order to interpret toxicology findings it is necessary to reconcile test sensitivity,
      background biological variation, normal responses to inhaled materials and drug or
      medicine-specific adverse effects. Identification of adverse end-points is an area where
      better control data sets might help discern true adverse effects from a normal physiological
      lung response. The lung responds acutely to inhalation of irritant materials by
      hyper-secretion of mucus, chemokine release, inflammatory cell recruitment and cough and
      collectively these may be characterized as non-specific irritancy.

      Four formulations of antituberculosis drug (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and
      levofloxacin) will be administered to each patient by randomization. Each formulation will be
      assigned the code, such as A, B, C, or D, and the treatment sequences will be generated as
      ABCD (sequence 1), BCDA (sequence 2), CDAB (sequence 3) and DABC (sequence 4). On the first
      day of drug dosing in period I, volunteers will be randomly assigned to a sequence of
      treatments as indicated in a pre-printed randomization scheme, which was generated using
      block randomization with block sizes of 4 and 6, and the allocation ratio of 1:1. Subjects
      will be stratified by sex. Subjects in sequence 1 will receive treatment A during the first
      study period and will then cross over to receive treatment B, C, and D at the second, third
      and fourth periods, respectively (each after a 7-day washout period).
