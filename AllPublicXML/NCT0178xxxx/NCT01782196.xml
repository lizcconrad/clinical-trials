  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain research and innovation projects require an assessment of the adhesive properties of
      adhesives, which cannot be established from in-vitro testing. The most valuable data for
      assessments of this type comes from adhesion and wear time studies involving application to
      living human skin on volunteers. The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and
      performance of an enhanced one piece drainable pouch with a mouldable skin barrier wafer in a
      group of subjects with an ileostomy.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>59 days</time_frame>
    <description>Performance will be evaluated by comparing the following categories to the subject's usual pouching system
Wear time Adhesion Ease of Use Mouldability Comfort and flexibility Security Skin protection Wafer seal integrity Undermining Filter performance Accessory usage
At the end of the study a comparative assessment of the subject's usual pouching system and the study pouch will be made.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who provide written informed consent.

          -  Subjects who have an ileostomy and be over 18 years of age.

          -  Subjects who are currently using a one piece drainable pouch.

          -  Subjects who have unbroken peri-stomal skin (healthy normal skin defined as &quot;normal
             unbroken skin with certain variations normal for this subject&quot; to L1 on the SACs
             Instrument Scale).

          -  Subjects with a stoma considered 'normal' in appearance in accordance with the stoma,
             colour, moisture and structure rating scales.

          -  Subjects who are willing to attend clinic for a maximum of 5 separate occasions for
             scheduled visits.

          -  Subjects who are willing to discontinue the use of pastes, adhesive strips and
             rings/seals used to seal the area between the skin barrier wafer and stoma during the
             use of the study device.

          -  Subjects who other than their ileostomy considered to have a healthy/stable health
             status.

          -  Subjects who have good manual dexterity and be able to take care of their stoma
             independently, or have a consistent care provider.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to complete a diary card for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of sensitivity to any one of the ostomy products or the
             components being studied.

          -  Subjects with stoma duration of less than 3 months.

          -  Subjects who currently use a belt with their usual appliance.

          -  Subjects who have been entered into the study before, or who have previously taken
             part in a study in the last month.

          -  Subjects who require convexity or other skin fillers (pastes, rings, seals) to even
             undulations of the skin.

          -  Subjects undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

          -  Subjects who have any other medical condition which, according to the investigator
             justifies exclusion from the study.
