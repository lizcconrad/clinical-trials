    <textblock>
      This research study designed to look at how well adolescents' and young adults' blood sugars
      can be controlled with a &quot;closed loop artificial pancreas&quot; using a continuous glucose sensor,
      an insulin pump, and a computer program that automatically determines how much insulin to
      give based on the glucose level. The investigators will also study the effect of wearing a
      small heating patch, the InsuPatch, at the site of insulin infusion, on the ability of the
      closed loop system to control the blood sugar levels and to reduce the rise in glucose levels
      after meals.

      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized crossover study evaluating the performance
      of a closed-loop (CL) insulin delivery system using a subcutaneous glucose sensor and an
      external insulin pump comparing the peak post-prandial glucose levels and the post-prandial
      glucose AUC during either CL control alone or CL control with the InsuPatch in an inpatient
      hospital research unit (HRU) setting. The closed loop visit consists of approximately 67
      hours over 4 days and 3 nights.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age 12-40 years

          2. clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes

          3. duration of type 1 diabetes ≥ 1 year

          4. HbA1c ≤ 9 %

          5. Treated with pump therapy for at least 3 months

          6. Body weight &gt; 40 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Insulin resistant (defined as requiring &gt; 1.5 units/kg/day at time of study enrollment

          2. Presence of any medical or psychiatric disorder that may interfere with subject safety
             or study conduct

          3. Use of any medications (besides insulin) known to blood glucose levels, including oral
             or other systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Inhaled, intranasal, or rectal
             corticosteroid use is allowed along as not given within 4 weeks of admission. Use of
             topical glucocorticoids is allowable as long as affected skin area does not overlap
             with study device sites. Subjects using herbal supplements will be excluded, due to
             the unknown effects of these supplements on glucose control

          4. History of poor wound healing, heat sensitivity, or diminished skin integrity.

          5. History of hypoglycemic seizure within last 3 months

          6. Anemic (low hematocrit), or evidence of renal insufficiency (elevated serum
             creatinine)

          7. Female subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or unwilling to be tested for pregnancy
