  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy Lifestyles for Children with Complex Heart Problems is a planning and resource
      development project. The goal of the project is to develop an implementation plan that would
      enable children with complex heart problems to lead healthy, active lives within their own
      community. The primary goal of the project is to promote physical activity, because the
      physical and mental health benefits of activity are very important for these children.
      Children with complex heart problems have a higher risk for obesity, diabetes, acquired heart
      disease and mental health problems than their healthy peers. The physical health benefits of
      physical activity are well known, but physical activity is also key for children's mental
      health. Physical activity enables children to socialize with peers and create bonds and
      friendships. Physical activity participation also directly elevates mood through the release
      of brain chemicals. Children with complex heart problems are also known to experience fear
      and anxiety related to physical activity. This project will also develop strategies to
      promote healthy eating and the prevention of physical activity-related injuries to these
      children and their families. Children with complex heart problems are at higher risk of
      overweight and obesity and face unique injury risks related to pacemakers or their
      medications.

      Extensive consultations with families and caregivers have identified needed supports for
      physical activity lifestyles, mental health, healthy eating and injury prevention for these
      children. The goal of the interviews was to understand the positive and negative influences
      on physical activity and healthy lifestyles for these children. Analyses of the interview
      content was used to develop a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan to provide the
      supports necessary for children with complex heart problems to lead active, healthy lives in
      their own community, with their family and friends. The implementation plan specifies changes
      to family education and counselling resources, clinical care routines, and communication
      among professionals and families.

      The clinical trial will evaluate the impact of implementing the family supports and changes
      to practice previously developed. Surveys will be completed by families attending the cardiac
      clinic before and after the changes to practice and additional resources are made available.
      Interviews will be utilized to gather additional feedback from professionals and families
      that receive counselling utilizing the supplementary materials.
