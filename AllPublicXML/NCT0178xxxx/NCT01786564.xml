      The purpose of this study is to determine if deficient sleep and/or disruption with the
      body's internal clock (&quot;circadian rhythms&quot;) are associated with diabetes risk. This study is
      being done to look at the possible relationships between sleep and risk of diabetes by
      examining sleep in the home and diabetes risk in the laboratory.
