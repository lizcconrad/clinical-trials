      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV-1 infection, as documented by a rapid HIV test or any FDA-approved HIV-1 enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit and confirmed by Western blot at any
             time prior to study entry. Alternatively, if a rapid HIV test or any FDA-approved
             HIV-1 enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit is not available, two
             HIV-1 RNA values &gt;2000 copies/mL at least 24 hours apart performed by any laboratory
             that has CLIA certification, or its equivalent, may be used to document infection.

          2. Antiretroviral medication

               -  Cohort 1: Subjects on HAART (no changes to treatment within 4 weeks of study
                  entry) for at least 3 months.

               -  Subjects on HAART (no changes to treatment within 4 weeks of study entry) for at
                  least 3 months.

          3. Plasma HIV viremia

               -  Cohort 1: HIV‐1‐positive men and women &gt;18 years of age with HIV‐1‐RNA levels
                  undetectable by ultrasensitive HIV PCR Abbott assay at screening. Also eligible
                  are subjects with HIV‐1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL; however, the HIV‐1 RNA must be &lt; 50
                  copies/mL within 60 days prior to study entry based on the Abbott assay. Subjects
                  with intermittent isolated episodes of detectable low level viremia (&gt; 50 but
                  &lt;1,000 copies RNA/mL; blips) will be eligible. There should be at least 2
                  documented HIV‐1 RNA assays, one drawn &gt;3 months before study entry, one drawn &lt;3
                  months before study entry.

               -  Cohort 2: HIV-1-positive men and women &gt;18 years of age with HIV-1-RNA levels
                  undetectable by ultrasensitive HIV PCR assay at screening. Note: Due to
                  sensitivity issues using the Roche Assay and the fact that we cannot control the
                  HIV testing technique prior to enrollment, we decided to consider subjects with
                  HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL; however, the HIV-1 RNA must be undetectable within 60
                  days prior to study entry based on the ultrasensitive HIV PCR assay. Subjects
                  with intermittent isolated episodes of detectable low level viremia (&gt; 50 but
                  &lt;1,000 copies RNA/mL; blips) will be eligible. There should be at least 2
                  documented HIV-1 RNA assays: one drawn &gt;3 months before study entry, one drawn &lt;3
                  months before study entry.

          4. CD4 counts

               -  Cohort 1: Subjects with CD4 counts &gt;350 cells/mm3.

               -  Cohort 2: Subjects with CD4 counts of at least 450 cells/mm3 at screening. Note:
                  CD4 nadir in Cohort 2 must be above 200 cells/mm3.

          5. Adequate venous access and no other contraindications for leukapheresis.

          6. Laboratory values obtained within 60 days prior to entry.

               -  Serum creatinine: ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (133μ mol/L)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT): ≤ 2.5 times
                  the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          7. Subjects must be willing to comply with study‐mandated evaluations. Rectal biopsy
             procedures are optional.

          8. Be male or female, 18 years of age and older.

          9. Ability and willingness of subject to provide informed consent.

         10. Have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 70 or higher.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No history of opportunistic infections or neoplasm.

          2. Concomitant acute or chronic hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) or hepatitis C
             infection. If HCV antibody test is positive, an HCV RNA test will be performed. If
             both HCV tests (antibody and RNA) are positive, the subjects will be excluded from
             study. If HCV antibody test is positive, but HCV RNA test is negative, subject can
             enroll. Results should be obtained no more than 30 days prior to screening.

          3. History of cancer or malignancy, with the exception of successfully treated basal cell
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          4. 4.2.4 History or any features on physical examination indicative of active or unstable
             cardiac disease or hemodynamic instability.

          5. History or any features on physical examination indicative of a bleeding diathesis.

          6. Have been previously treated with any HIV experimental vaccine within 6 months prior
             to screening, or any previous gene therapy using an integrating vector.

          7. Use of chronic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or immunomodulating agents (e.g.,
             interleukin‐2, interferon‐alpha or ‐gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating factors,
             etc.) within 30 days prior to study entry.

          8. Breast-feeding, pregnant, or unwilling to use acceptable methods of birth control.

          9. Use of aspirin, dipyrdamole, warfarin or any other medication that is likely to affect
             platelet function or other aspects of blood coagulation during the 2-week period prior
             to leukapheresis.

         10. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

         11. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days
             prior to study entry.

         12. Asymptomatic abnormal baseline serum chemistry elevations. Note: Asymptomatic baseline
             serum chemistry elevations in total or indirect bilirubin in subjects receiving
             atazanavir or indinavir is not exclusionary. Asymptomatic baseline serum chemistry
             elevations in LFTs, lipase and creatinine due to HAART medication are not
             exclusionary, when in the opinion of the investigator, the abnormalities are not
             attributable to intrinsic hepatorenal disease. Such elevations must be due to HAART.

         13. Receipt of a vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry.

         14. Have an allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin,
             DMSO and Dextran 40).

         15. For Cohort 2: CD4 nadir below 200 cells/mm3.
