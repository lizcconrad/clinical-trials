  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the effects of Privigen (intravenous immunoglobulin)
      on the skin in patients with scleroderma. Approximately 24 subjects will take part in this
      investigator-initiated study at Georgetown University Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital.
      This study will last for one year (12 months). This research is being done because systemic
      sclerosis can cause severe, progressive organ involvement. The investigators hope this study
      treatment will improve the outcomes in this disease, including skin, muscle, joint,
      gastrointestinal, and lung involvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a double-blind controlled trial of 24 patients with Privigen速
      (Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% liquid treatment) with 3:1 randomization. Subjects
      with scleroderma will be given 2 g/kg/mo of Privigen速 or placebo (Albuminar速-5) for 6 months.
      Scleroderma is generally a progressive disease, and while the skin does improve with time in
      some patients, others have progressive disease in spite of aggressive treatment. Also,
      spontaneous improvement in other organ systems is even less likely. Patients entered into the
      trial will have failed to respond to standard of care treatment over the past 4 months. Thus,
      the investigators feel that any actual improvement observed can be attributed to the IVIG
      treatment. Since this is a pilot study, future larger controlled trials will be necessary to
      clearly demonstrate the effectiveness, but the investigators are hoping that this study will
      give us signals that will guide the future clinical trial.
