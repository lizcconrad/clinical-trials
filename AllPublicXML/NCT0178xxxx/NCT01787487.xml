    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have myelofibrosis or
      myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of ruxolitinib and
      azacytidine can help to control myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative
      neoplasm.

      Ruxolitinib is designed to block a pathway that has been found to be overactive in human
      cancers and myelofibrosis.

      Azacytidine is designed to block certain proteins in cancer cells that stop the function of
      the tumor-fighting proteins. By blocking the &quot;bad&quot; proteins, the tumor-fighting genes may be
      able to work better.

      This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat myelofibrosis. Azacytidine is FDA approved and commercially available for
      myelodysplastic syndrome. The combination of ruxolitinib and azacytidine to treat
      myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm is investigational.

      Up to 125 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Treatment:

      A. For patients with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take ruxolitinib 2 times
      every day by mouth. If you miss or vomit your dose of ruxolitinib, do not make up the dose.

      Beginning with Cycle 4, on Days 1-5 (+/-6 days), you will receive azacytidine either under
      the skin or through a needle in your vein.

      Your dose of ruxolitinib and/or azacytidine may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      You will be given a drug diary and asked to write down what time you take the study drugs.
      Bring in any unused study drugs and bottles to each study visit during the first 15 cycles of
      treatment.

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      Study Visits:

      Each study visit may be performed at +/- 7 days than the day stated.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-7, 9,12 and then every 3 cycles (+/- 1 Month) starting with cycle 15 all
      patients in both arms (including myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative
      will be evaluated as follows:

        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.

        -  Your transfusion history will be collected.

        -  Your spleen and liver will be measured.

        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires about how you are feeling.

      After 2 years of protocol treatment, this schedule may be adjusted to every 3 to 6 cycles.

      Patients with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm will have
      blood draws once a week during Cycles 1 to 6 and then 1 time each month after that. Blood
      (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      After Cycles 6 and 12, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the
      disease. Routine blood draws and bone marrow biopsies may be done more or less often if the
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      Research Blood Tests:

      Extra blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing and pharmacodynamic (PD). PK
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. PD testing
      measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.

      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing:

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours later

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 6, before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours later

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 12 (or at the end of study if you go off study early), before you
           receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours later

      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PD testing:

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 3, before you receive the study drug

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 6, before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 9, before you receive the study drug

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 12 (or at the end of study if you go off study early), before you
           receive the study drug and then 2 hours later

      Length of Study:

      You can take up to 15 cycles of ruxolitinib and 12 cycles of azacytidine. After 15 cycles of
      ruxolitinib, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may change over to
      commercial supply and continue taking it for up to 5 years from study entry. You will no
      longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      You will be called about 30 days after you go off study and asked if you have had any side
      effects and/or any new treatment(s).

      You will be called and asked if you have had any side effects and how the disease is doing
      for up to 5 years after you first started the study. If you take ruxolitinib for longer than
      16 cycles, you will need to turn in your study diary after every cycle.

AZA will be given on days 1-5 of each 28 day cycle beginning with cycle 4. We propose to initially administer RUX alone at a dose of 5 mg orally twice daily (BID) if the baseline platelet count is 50-100 x 109/L, 15 mg twice daily if the baseline platelet count is 100 - 200 109/L, or at a dose of 20 mg twice daily if the baseline platelet count is &gt; 200 x 109/L. Patients will receive RUX alone for cycles # 1, 2 and 3.</description>
