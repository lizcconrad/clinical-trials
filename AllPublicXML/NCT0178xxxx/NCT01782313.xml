  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who have been diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma that has spread
      (metastasized) or that is not eligible for removal by surgery. The purpose of this study is
      to determine how soft tissue sarcomas respond to treatment with an investigational drug
      called tivozanib. In some lab and clinical studies, tivozanib has been shown to interfere
      with the growth of some types of tumors. The study will also evaluate how safe the study
      treatment is by observing how many and what kind of adverse events (side effects)
      participants experience.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival (defined as complete response [CR] + partial
      response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) assessed at 16 weeks for patients treated with
      tivozanib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate (defined as CR + PR). II. Clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD). III.
      Overall survival (up to 2 years beyond progression). IV. Correlation of clinical outcome with
      antibodies for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2.

      V. Assess Safety and tolerability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tivozanib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or until discontinuation per
      patient preference or physician recommendation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
