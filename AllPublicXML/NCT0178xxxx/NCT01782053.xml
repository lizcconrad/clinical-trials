  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the largest preventable health risk in the U.S. The Family Smoking Prevention and
      Tobacco Control Act of 2010 mandated the placement of larger pictorial warnings on cigarette
      packs as well as nine new statements of smoking risks. This trial tests the effectiveness of
      the warnings proposed by the Food and Drug Administration by providing cigarettes with the
      proposed labels to 320 smokers across two sites (Philadelphia, PA and Columbus, OH). In
      addition, the trial tests the effects of different warning label components.
