    <textblock>
      Hospitalization of youth with established diabetes is both costly and frequently preventable.
      Poor glycemic control is a risk factor for hospitalization and is also associated with
      adolescent age and lower socioeconomic status. This is a randomized, controlled trial for
      high-risk adolescent youth with T1DM and suboptimal glycemic control with an intervention arm
      and usual care control arm matched for frequency of contacts. There will be 110 subjects with
      T1DM and HbA1c&gt;8%, aged 13 to 17 years, recruited from the Diabetes Program at Boston
      Children's Hospital and followed for 6 months. The intervention will be implemented by a
      diabetes nurse educator and social worker, who will each have monthly contact with the
      adolescent and a parent/guardian through a telehealth (videoconference) visit. Care will be
      guided by a diabetes action plan. Telehealth interventions have been utilized successfully in
      both adults and youth with diabetes. They facilitate frequent contact with the care team
      allowing barriers to adherence to be addressed, education to be reinforced, care plans to be
      updated, and diabetes-specific family support to be provided.
