  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will describe the treatment paradigm used over recent years in the clinical
      management of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)+ metastatic breast cancer in
      Hungary. This information will provide insight into real-world exposure and adherence to
      anti-HER2 therapy containing regimens, and improve understanding of the reasons for
      discontinuation of this therapy.

      This is a retrospective, descriptive, cohort study of approximately 180 female patients
      diagnosed with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Hungary. Patients diagnosed with, or
      who progressed to, metastatic disease between 01 September 2009 and 01 September 2010 will be
      included. All patients will be followed until death, loss to follow-up or the end of the
      study period (30 September 2012). All data will be collected retrospectively from patient
      medical records.

      Descriptive statistics of the demographic and clinical characteristics of HER2+ metastatic
      breast cancer patients, including sites of metastases, the time from initial breast cancer
      diagnosis until diagnosis of metastatic disease, and HER2 testing methodology and status of
      HER2 will be described. Further, descriptive statistics of the proportion of HER2+ metastatic
      breast cancer patients who received anti-HER2 therapy, the sequencing of different therapies,
      and the duration of therapies in the metastatic setting will be analysed. Among the subset of
      women who receive lapatinib plus capecitabine, descriptive statistics of the timing of
      initiation of lapatinib plus capecitabine in the metastatic treatment pathway, time to
      treatment discontinuation and time to progression (TTP) on lapatinib plus capecitabine will
      be calculated. Further, descriptive statistics of the type and duration anti-HER2 therapies
      used prior to initiation of lapatinib plus capecitabine and, where relevant, after
      lapatinib+capecitabine will be performed.

        It is planned to capture data on approximately 180 patients with HER2-positive metastatic
        breast cancer in about 20 medical centres in Hungary. Patients diagnosed with, or who
        progressed to, metastatic disease between 01 September 2009 and 01 September 2010 will be
        included. All patients will be followed until death, loss to follow-up or the end of the
        study period (30 September 2012).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients aged 18 years or older at diagnosis of, or progression to, metastatic
             breast cancer
