  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the Peristeen Anal Irrigation System with conservative bowel management in a
      prospective study among spinal cord injured patients with lower motor neuron neurogenic bowel
      dysfunction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with spinal cord injury (SCI) often have severe problems with management of bowel
      function, including incontinence, impaction, lengthy bowel routines and extremely slow
      transit times.The anal irrigation system is a recently available system to help patients with
      bowel dysfunction empty their bowels by using pulse water irrigation. The system consists of
      a rectal balloon catheter, manual pump and water container.
