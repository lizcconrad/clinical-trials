  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this double-blind, randomized, controlled study are to evaluate the
      efficacy of maintaining contact with low-back pain patients through text messaging and
      emailing, to decrease anxiety levels, pain, number of follow-up visits through text messaging
      and emailing, and to improve reporting of surgical site infection after spine surgery through
      text messaging and emailing. The outcomes that will be measured are anxiety, pain, follow-up
      visits and received phone calls, and reporting signs of surgical site infection. Participants
      will include Dr. Oren Gottfried's patients who underwent spine surgery at Duke Hospital or at
      Duke Raleigh Hospital. Patients will be approached after determination that the patient is
      going to undergo spinal surgery. All patients meeting inclusion criteria will be approached
      to participate irrespective of race or ethnicity. A total of 194 subjects will be recruited.
