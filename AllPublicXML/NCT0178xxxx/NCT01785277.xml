      The propose of the study is to validate in Mexico a spanish translation of the Spinal Cord
      Independence Measure (SCIM) Version III, in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

      Internal consistency, reproducibility and reliability will be addressed scoring the results
      of the translated version at two time frames and also of the same patients by different
      examiners (physicians, nurses and technicians).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide estimated annual incidence of SCI has a broad spectrum, ranging from 236 to
      1009 cases per million of people. In Mexico there is an estimate of 18.1 cases per million
      people, affecting primary men in their productive age (25-34 years old).

      Most of the patients have disabilities after the injury, and become dependent of their
      families or professional care providers. The cornerstone treatment in the long therm is
      rehabilitation and the main goal is to achieve patient independence.

      Over the last two decades many disability measure instruments have been developed, like the
      Functional Interdisciplinary Measure (FIM). This scale though it is very useful for patients'
      general outcome, it does not grade patients' independence entirely. In 1997, Dr. Amiram Catz
      developed the first version of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). Since its first
      version, it showed to be a very powerful tool to assess patients' independence. Recently, the
      SCIM-III has been validated in a multicenter study, showing validity, reliability and
      internal consistency.

      The aim of this study is to perform a translate and trans-cultural adaptation of the SCIM-III
      into Spanish and to perform also its validation in Mexican population.
