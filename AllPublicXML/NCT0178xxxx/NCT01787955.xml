    <textblock>
      Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) has been considered as only curative
      treatment modality for periampullary tumor. High mortality rates after PPPD have been reduced
      down to 1%. However, postoperative morbidities are still reported around 10 to 20 % even in
      high volume centers.The delayed gastric emptying syndrome(DGE) is one of major complications
      after PPPD. Many randomized control studies reported that pylorus preserving method was not
      related to the occurence of DGE. Thus,we assumed that large amount of biliary and pancreatic
      juice might affect DGE.

      With the aim to prove that the use of Braun anastomosis after PPPD can prevent DGE, the
      investigators started the recruitment of patients with a periampullary tumors to this
      clinical trial from february 2013 with the study hypothesis that patients with Braun
      anastomosis had less DGE than those who only got conventional PPPD.

      The investigators have calculated the number of patients necessaries to have statistical
      significant differences in 60 patients with a rate DGE expected to be higher than 30%.

      The study include all the patients that usually arrive to our surgery department and who are
      indicated to PPPD for the curative treatment of periampullary tumor.

      The study is randomized, double blind where the investigators and the patients do not know if
      the patients are in the Braun anastomosis group or not, and prospectively analyzed. All the
      clinical and laboratory or radiographic finds relative to the occurrence of DGE are recorded.
