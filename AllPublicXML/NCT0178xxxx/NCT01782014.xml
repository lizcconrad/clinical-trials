  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which of the methods of colonoscopy viz. water
      insufflation or air insufflation or carbon dioxide insufflation is better in detecting the
      adenomas in colon and also which of these methods is best tolerated by patients.

      Hypothesis: the investigators hypothesize that in patients undergoing first time screening
      colonoscopy a higher Adenoma Detection Rate will be found in the proximal colon in the group
      randomized to the water method compared to those randomized to the air or CO2 insufflation
      methods

      Significance:

      ADR is an independent predictor of risk of post screening colonoscopy colon cancer. A simple
      method solely controlled by the colonoscopist that enhances proximal ADR holds the promise of
      rectifying some of the unresolved shortcomings of screening colonoscopy in failing to reduce
      the occurrence of post screening incident cancers in the proximal colon and the associated
      cancer mortality.

      Hypotheses &amp; Specific Aims:

      Primary Hypothesis:

      In patients undergoing first time screening a higher ADR will be found in the proximal colon
      in those randomized to the water method compared to those randomized to the air method or CO2
      method.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

      The examination method but not co-variables, procedure-related or patient-centered outcomes,
      is an independent predictor of proximal colon ADR.

      Specific Aims:

      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded controlled study to compare the study
      (water) and control 1 (air) method and control 2 (CO2 method) to aid insertion of the
      colonoscope. The proximal colon ADR, total ADR, co-variables, procedure-related and
      patient-centered outcomes and adverse event during and within 30 days of colonoscopy will be
      recorded and compared between the study and control methods.
