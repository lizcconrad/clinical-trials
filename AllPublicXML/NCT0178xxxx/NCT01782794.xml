    <textblock>
      The present study is conducted in order to assess the acceptability of Hepatitis B
      vaccination in French general population before and after reimbursement of the paediatric
      vaccine InfanrixHexa. Four measurements are planned, first before reimbursement and the
      others at year 1, 2 and 3 after reimbursement.

      The present study aims to evaluate the changes in Hepatitis B immunization coverage and the
      acceptability thereof among parents, in the general population. This is a national,
      prospective, epidemiological study, comprising four measurement time-points over a three-year
      period, (T1 in 2009, T2 in 2010, T3 in 2011, and T4 in 2012) in order to cover the period
      prior to the introduction of InfanrixHexa® reimbursement, the transition period, and the
      period following reimbursement of the vaccine. The periods between each data collection
      time-point will be identical, lasting a year. Two age groups will be investigated at each
      data collection time-point: 12-15 months and 24-27 months, thus providing measurements
      before/after reimbursement.
