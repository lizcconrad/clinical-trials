    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease
      affecting motor neurons. Early diagnosis is essential for the success of clinical trials and
      objective biomarkers are needed for monitoring disease progression. Nerve and muscle
      ultrasound may provide this information.

      This study will collect pilot data to evaluate the value of muscle and nerve ultrasound to
      identify and monitor disease progression in ALS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormalities at onset: Ultrasound vs. Electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound measures will be compared to electromyography measures at the patient's initial assessment. The number of abnormal muscles will be counted using each technique and analyzed to determine if one test is superior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ultrasound Predicting Outcome at 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The initial ultrasound measures and patient outcomes, as measured by standard validated scales, will be assessed at periodic intervals for one year. Analysis will be performed to determine if ultrasound measures can predict the clinical course.</description>
