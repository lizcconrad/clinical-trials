  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occupational asthma (OA) caused by high molecular weight (HMW) substances have been shown to
      induce predominantly an eosinophilic inflammation. In contrast, OA caused by low molecular
      weight (LMW) substances results in a neutrophilic inflammation. In addition, data regarding
      phenotype of lymphocytes in OA caused by HMW and LMW substances are scarce. The use of a new
      equipment will allow the realization of specific standardized bronchial challenges (BC) to
      occupational agents. Thus, we propose to study in more detail the cellular mechanisms
      involved during BC to HMW and LMW occupational agents in a double-blind placebo controlled
      study.

    <description>At Visit 1: Patients are selected and they will receive a metacholine challenge test during and outside of work. After randomization, patients undergo a standardized bronchial challenge test (SCL SCL • • GenaSOL ™ GenaSIC ™) to either an wheat flour allergen extract or didecyldimethylammonium chloride or placebo. Each bronchial challenge test is followed by blood sampling at different time points and induced sputum. The immediate bronchial response and late bronchial response will be recorded.</description>
