  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to select the optimal conditions for quantification in the oral
      cavity of Lactobacillus brevis CD2, a probiotic strain contained in a commercially available
      dietary supplement and to assess its persistency after oral administration. Different sets of
      primers for L. brevis detection will be tested in real-time PCR reactions to find optimal
      amplification efficiency and target specificity. Primers ability in the identification of L.
      brevis DNA will be assessed in a pilot study conducted on 12 healthy volunteers clinically
      free of oral pathologies. The subjects will take 3 tablets/day for 3 days and one tablet on
      the 4th day. Clinical samples (dorsal surface of tongue, first molar, vestibular fornix and
      saliva) will be collected at baseline (before beginning the trial), at T0 (in the morning
      before the assumption of the last tablet) and 3, 6, and 9 hours after taking the last tablet.
      The quantities of L. brevis DNA will be compared to the total number of bacteria present in
      the samples. The activity of the enzyme arginine deiminase, responsible for oral pH
      homeostasis (particularly abundant in the CD2 strain) will be also assessed in the saliva
      samples before and after treatment, by HPLC measurements.
