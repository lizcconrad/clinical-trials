      A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicentre,

      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENIA11 in combination
      with DMARDs versus DMARDs alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENIA11 in combination with DMARDs versus DMARDs alone in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

      The study period for each patient will be 28 weeks, during which the patient will undergo
      screening for up to 14 days, followed by treatment of 24 weeks and follow-up period of 2
      weeks. Each patient will be required to make a total of 9 visits.
