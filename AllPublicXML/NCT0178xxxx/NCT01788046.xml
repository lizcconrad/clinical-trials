      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 97 centers in the US, Canada, Europe, Israel, the Russian Federation, and Australia. The first participant was enrolled on 12 March 2013, and the last participant 07 October 2013.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to etelcalcetide or placebo. Randomization was stratified by screening parathyroid hormone (PTH) (&lt; 600 pg/mL, 600 to ≤ 1000 pg/mL, and &gt; 1000 pg/mL), prior cinacalcet use and region (North America or non-North America).</pre_assignment_details>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
