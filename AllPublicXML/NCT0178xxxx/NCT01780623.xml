  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common and distressing symptoms associated with a
      cancer diagnosis.Fatigue related to cancer often appears before a diagnosis, worsens during
      treatment, and lasts for years after treatment in up to 35% of patients. Despite the
      long-term effects of cancer-related fatigue, the treatment options available are not always
      appropriate or helpful for all patients.Light therapy is an effective treatment for other
      disorders related to fatigue. The purpose of the study is to investigate the role of light
      therapy on quality of life, sleep patterns, and physical measures of immune function and
      stress hormones in individuals with post-treatment cancer-related fatigue.
