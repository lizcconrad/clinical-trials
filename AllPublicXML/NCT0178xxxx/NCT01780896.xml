    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate visual and nonvisual topographic memory impairment
      and its relationship to vestibular function in humans. Topographic memory refers to the
      ability to remember current and past locations in topographic (navigational) space and to
      make and/or adjust to spatial transformations using such memories. Performance on each of
      these topographic memory tasks will be compared to performance on a set of comparable
      nontopographic memory tasks. Topographic impairments represent some of the earliest cognitive
      deficits observed in Alzheimer's Disease, and the brain areas involved in topographic memory
      are the first to show degenerative changes.
