  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) technology is a powerful tool for cardiac nuclear
      medicine. The increased photon counting sensitivity of camera can be used to explore novel
      protocols like dual isotope (rapid stress Tl-201/rest Tc-99m protocol for use with high-speed
      SPECT MPI). The use of dual isotope imaging is very interesting because this imaging combines
      the use of thallium-201 with technetium-99m agents permitting optimal image resolution and
      simultaneous assessment of viability, all with an exam duration of approximately 20 minutes.
      However, no study compares stress thallium-201/rest technetium-99m sequential dual isotope
      high-speed myocardial perfusion imaging versus invasive coronary angiography. The
      investigators report here the first validation of high-speed protocol with dual isotope for
      myocardial perfusion imaging using invasive coronary angiography as the standard of
      reference.

      The new cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) technology is a powerful tool for cardiac nuclear
      medicine. Indeed, recent clinical validation studies of CZT technology have documented a scan
      time reduction and low radiation dose without degradation of myocardial perfusion imaging in
      comparison with standard dual detector cameras. The increased photon counting sensitivity of
      camera can be used to explore novel protocols that may offer advantages over standard
      protocols used for Myocardial Perfusion Imaging. Berman et al. showed that rapid stress
      Tl-201/rest Tc-99m protocol for use with high-speed SPECT MPI has offered the superior
      qualities of Tl-201 for stress imaging and of the Tc-99m agents for rest imaging can be
      preserved. Nuclear medicine presents the most level of scientific validation for diagnosis
      and prognosis of coronary artery disease. A lot of studies have compared performance of
      standard dual detector cameras vs. Invasive Coronary Angiography. Fiechter et al. reported
      the first validation of ultrafast dedicated cardiac gamma camera with CZT versus invasive
      coronary angiography. But he used a novel hybrid SPECT /CT device and 99m-Tc-tetrofosmin
      pharmacological stress/rest examination. However, no study compares stress thallium-201/rest
      technetium-99m sequential dual isotope high-speed myocardial perfusion imaging versus
      invasive coronary angiography. Moreover, diagnosis performance of this high-speed protocol
      versus fractional flow reserve for stenosis evaluation is unknown.

      The investigators report here the first validation of high-speed protocol with dual isotope
      for myocardial perfusion imaging using invasive procedures (coronary angiography and
      fractional flow reserve) as the standard of reference.

    <description>Diagnostic performance of Stress Thallium-201/Rest Technetium-99m Sequential Dual Isotope High-Speed Myocardial Perfusion Imaging to detect coronary artery disease is evaluated vs. coronary angiography.
Significant CAD was defined as presentation of a stenosis ≥70 % in the three-epicardial vessels and ≥ 50 % in left main coronary disease in coronary angiography.
In CZT SPECT, The global summed stress score (SSS) summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference score (SDS) were calculated by adding the scores of the 17 segments in the stress and rest images, respectively. Significant ischemia is defined by SSS &gt;4.
Analyze is performed per patients, per segments, and per vessels.</description>

    <description>Patients who were referred to our cardiology department for stress-rest CZT SPECT for known or suspected CAD and submitted for a clinical reason to invasive coronary angiography within 2 month of the SPECT studies. for these patients, A 6 French arterial sheath was introduced into the radial artery. After administration of 5000 U heparin, the guiding catheter was advanced into the coronary ostium. Intracoronary nitroglycerin 0.2 mg was administered, and reference images were made. Significant CAD was defined as presentation of a stenosis ≥70 % in the three-epicardial vessels and ≥ 50 % in left main coronary disease. If necessary (at the discretion of the practitioner) the pressure wire was advanced across the stenosis, and Fractional flow reserve (FFR) was measured.</description>
