  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is deadly and generally diagnosed at late stage when the chances of survival
      are low. There is a current belief that this cancer starts in the fallopian tubes and
      progresses towards the ovaries, spreading to the cells on the surface. Within the fallopian
      tubes and the uterus, there is a constant flow of mucus which has only one exit through the
      cervix and out the vagina. Proteins that are generated within the entire female reproductive
      system are trapped into this viscous fluid and eventually released as waste. When a routine
      PAP test is performed, a sample of this mucus is collected along with any cells, and
      preserved in the PAP fluid. The fluid is currently discarded but contains a protein profile
      showing of the status of the cells in the female reproductive system. We have examined this
      fluid and found that it contains unique peptides/proteins that provide a diagnosis of ovarian
      cancer when compared against healthy controls. These markers will be initially refined using
      the comparison of ovarian cancer patients against those with benign adnexal masses that
      entered the clinic during the same time period.

      In this Phase II biomarker validation study we will further refine and validate these
      biomarkers using a new collection of samples from at least 200 ovarian cancer cases with
      epithelial ovarian cancer (endometroid and papillary serous histology, most common) and
      comparing these against 600 patients with a diagnosis of a benign adnexal mass that enter the
      clinics during the same time period. Patient samples will be collected on their first visit
      to the gynecologic oncologist at a number of collaborating clinics. Final processing of all
      of the samples will be performed within the proteomics research facilities of the Mitchell
      Cancer Institute using Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM, with mass spectrometry) based on
      the refined set of makers statistically selected within the first aim. Biomarkers validated
      within this study will be compared with the well accepted CA-125 data for the patients. The
      research involves a three year validation and may allow detection of this cancer at a very
      early stage when the survival is as high as 90%. One aim examines a self-taken test that
      could allow its use in medically underrepresented and rural areas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be fully consented to the collection of the samples in writing (completed consent
             forms).

          2. Age Criteria: Women age 50 and older who are post menopausal (defined as 12 months
             past last menstrual period).

          3. Must have: Diagnosis of an adnexal mass or a suspicion of ovarian cancer, or a
             suspected fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

          4. Must have a uterus and cervix.

          5. Surgery for the adnexal mass must be anticipated. (Only patients with an adnexal mass
             requiring surgery will be eligible).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any subject who has a condition that would increase the risk associated with the
             standard sampling procedures (Such as a pap smear, or cotton swab in vagina)

          2. Prior hysterectomy.

          3. Absence of adnexal mass.

          4. Primary diagnosis of a cancer other than ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian
             tube.

          5. Patients with grossly visible cervical cancer.

          6. Previous/recent treatment for any invasive gynecologic cancer.

          7. Recent chemotherapy within the prior 2 years. (recent neoadjuvant chemotherapy for
             ovarian cancer would exclude the patient from participation).

          8. Cervical conization within the prior 6 months.

          9. History of Radiation therapy to the pelvis, vagina or cervix.

         10. Obvious advanced stage cancer (Stage III or IV) on presentation, if known prior to
             specimen collection.
