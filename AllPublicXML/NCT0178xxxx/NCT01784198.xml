  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein is an essential part of our diet. It is used to build muscle and body tissue, send
      signals throughout our body and to support the immune system. Dietary protein is even more
      crucial during pregnancy as it is needed for healthy growth and development of the baby.
      There is very minimal data available on how much additional protein is required during
      pregnancy. Current recommendations are based on older techniques such as nitrogen balance
      studies of non-pregnant adults and minimally based on pregnancy specific data. There is no
      scientific information regarding the amount of protein needed during different stages of
      pregnancy.

      The investigators hypothesize that the current recommendations of protein intake during
      pregnancy are underestimated.

      The goal of this study is to measure protein requirement in healthy pregnant women
      (19-35y)using a more quick and modern technique called the indicator amino acid oxidation
      technique (IAAO).
