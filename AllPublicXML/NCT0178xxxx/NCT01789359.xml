  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essentially all of the published data on anthocyanin absorption in humans are from short term
      studies - a few days or less, most typically 24 h. However human studies demonstrating
      clinical effects are typically conducted for several weeks or even months. To examine how
      anthocyanin absorption and metabolism may be affected this study will examine urinary
      excretion of anthocyanins over one month, followed by a one week washout, and then one more
      dose of blueberry juice.

Day 1 to day 30, consume daily 250 ml single strength blueberry juice containing 229 mg anthocyanins, taken either as 1 morning dose or 1/3 dose morning, 1/3 mid-day and 1/3 evening. At d 31-38 continue anthocyanin-free diet. On d 39 consume daily dose.</description>
