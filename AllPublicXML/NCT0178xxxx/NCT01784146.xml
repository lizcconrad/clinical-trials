      Objective: To assess the influence of nebulization with bronchodilators carried by the heliox
      coupled to PEP in the distribution of compartimental lung volumes in asmathic adults and to
      correlate with pulmonary function data. Methods: A controlled randomized trial involving 27
      patients divided into four groups: heliox + PEP, oxygen + PEP, heliox and oxygen. After the
      initial evaluation, it was placing 89 reflective markers attached to the surface of the trunk
      and images acquired by optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) of six cameras. Three slow vital
      capacity maneuvers and quiet breathing regarded as phase control. After the control phase,
      all patients underwent nebulization with a distribution noninvasive system, semi-closed using
      10 drops of Fenoterol Bromide and 20 drops of Ipratropium.

    <description>The markers are meant to reflect the infrared signal emitted by the POE to the sensors, which transform these signals into information about the movement of the chest. In this evaluation method the chest is considered a geometric model divided into three regions - the volume of pulmonary rib cage (Vrp), abdominal rib cage volume (Vra), part of the chest corresponding to the diaphragm, and abdomen (Va), and the overall volume of the chest (Vcw) the total volume of compartments.</description>

    <description>In spirometry values were obtained for FEV1, PEF and forced vital capacity (FVC), considering the record as the best value according to the American Thoracic Society 18 the percentage of the predicted 16. For IC, we performed a correction of the weight. The present study included all patients were instructed to discontinue their medication twelve hours before the experiment as corticosteroids and bronchodilators for short or long duration for performing spirometry</description>

    <description>For inhalation of oxygen, we used a noninvasive delivery system, semi - closed (Figure 3) consisting of a non-toxic face mask with two unidirectional valves - inspiratory and expiratory branch - connected to the
nebulizer (Airlife Misty Neb, Baxter; Valencia, CA, USA). In the inspiratory branch, a reservoir bag (Hudson RCI, USA) with capacity of 2.5 L was connected, in order to avoid dilution of the gas. This skin was fixed to the patient's face to prevent leakage and to maintain adequate pressurization and improved patient compliance to the PEEP. The nebulizer was fed by a flow of 8 l / min of oxygen.</description>
