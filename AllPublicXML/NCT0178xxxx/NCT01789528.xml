  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of administration of CAZ-AVI and CXL
      on the intestinal flora of male and female healthy volunteers after multiple administrations
      over 7 days. An assessment of the effect on intestinal flora is an important aspect to
      understand for the safe clinical use of the investigational products and is expected by
      regulatory agencies.
