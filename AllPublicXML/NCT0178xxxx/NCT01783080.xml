    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to assess the ability of a modified version of Behavioral Activation
      for occupational and social improvement to produce change in: 1. social adjustment, 2. work
      functioning, 3. avoidance behavior and 4. behavioral activation.

      Psychosocial functioning was assessed before and after BA treatment in medication responsive
      depressed individuals who continued to have impaired social functioning. The primary goal was
      to demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and retention, and obtain an open pilot sense as to
      whether there are benefits from this brief psychotherapy approach in this population. The
      investigators also planned to refine measures and estimate the effect size of any treatment
      response to estimate power and sample size with the goal of completing a future controlled
      study.

    <description>Social adjustment was measured using the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS). The SAS is a self-report scale that assesses depressive symptoms and functioning in nine social and work-related domains generating a total score that is indicative of a subject's overall level of social adjustment. Subjects rate their own social functioning over times on a 5-point scale on items covering work for pay, housework, extended family, parenting, marital status, social activity and leisure, family unit and student status (sub-scales). Mean values of all the sub-scales are used, with a range from 0-5. Higher score = worse outcome … worse functioning</description>

            <description>BA is a manualized psychotherapy with comparable efficacy to cognitive behavioral treatment and antidepressant medication for acute treatment of depression. BA has two primary foci: 1) functional analyses of cognitive and behavioral processes that involve avoidance and 2) using avoided activities to guide activity scheduling. In this study, BA's focus was shifted to target work dysfunction by activating the patient into employment-related goals. BA-W consisted of 12 50-minute weekly sessions. Conceptualizing work dysfunction as a product of avoidance patterns and low levels of positive reinforcement, the treatment addressed maladaptive coping strategies such as avoidance as maintaining work dysfunction beyond remission of symptoms. Rather than broadly activating patients, activity scheduling focused on tasks such as sending out resumes, calling for job interviews, and networking to meet potential employers.

        <title>Social Functioning at Week Baseline on the Social Adjustment Scale</title>
        <description>Social adjustment was measured using the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS). The SAS is a self-report scale that assesses depressive symptoms and functioning in nine social and work-related domains generating a total score that is indicative of a subject's overall level of social adjustment. Subjects rate their own social functioning over times on a 5-point scale on items covering work for pay, housework, extended family, parenting, marital status, social activity and leisure, family unit and student status (sub-scales). Mean values of all the sub-scales are used, with a range from 0-5. Higher score = worse outcome … worse functioning</description>
