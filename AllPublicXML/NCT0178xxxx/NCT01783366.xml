  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      we first examined whether use of tube exchange catheter during NGT insertion could increase
      the success rate on the first attempt of NGT insertion compared with conventional technique.
      We then addressed the question of whether the use of tube exchange catheter might decrease
      the possible occurrence of complication associated with YOON insertion.

    <measure>Number of attempt of NGT insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>after successful insertion of NGT, within 1 hr</time_frame>
    <description>After anesthetic induction, in the control group inserting the lubricated NG tube through the nostril, at that time head maintained in the neutral position. The tube-exchanger group made use of tube-exchanger as stylet within 20-F NGT. Success of appropriate NGT insertion through the nostrils until 70cm of NGT was considered with gurgling sounds on the auscultation over the epigastrium when 10ml of air was injected through the NGT and gastric contents aspiration via NGT. Total number of attempts until successful NGT insertion was recorded and tried at least three times, and was considered to have failed.
Thus, procedure time would be the dependent factor of primary endpoin which could increse the success rate of NGT.</description>

Success of appropriate NGT insertion was considered with gurgling sounds on the auscultation over the epigastrium when 10ml of air was injected through the NGT and gastric contents aspiration via NGT. NGT insertion time recorded when the NGT begun to insert gently through the nostrils until 70cm of NGT.</description>
