      The purpose of this study is to determinate if mediyoga has effects in quality of life, heart
      rate variability, blood pressure , heart rate in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
      (PAF).

      This is randomized prospective pilot study. Eighty patients from Danderyd hospital,
      Stockholm, Sweden were randomized to either mediyoga group or control group. The mediyoga
      group were completing yoga for one hour, once a week for 12 weeks together with usual
      treatment. The controlgroup had only usual treatment.The usual treatment consists of
      pharmaceutical, cardio version and ablation. Quality of life ( SF-36, EQ-5d), blood pressure,
      heart rate and 24-hours ekokardiografi were measured at baseline and after twelve weeks.A
      follow up after six months was accomplished with SF-36 and EQ-5d, bloodpressure and heart
      rate.
