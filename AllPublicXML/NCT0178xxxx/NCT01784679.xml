  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIBM is a severe progressive myopathy that typically presents in early adulthood as weakness
      in the distal muscles of the lower extremities and progresses proximally, leading to a loss
      of muscle strength and function, and ultimately a wheelchair-bound state. The rate of
      progression is gradual and variable over the course of 10-20 years or longer. There is a need
      to better understand the disease-specific features of HIBM to heighten disease awareness;
      facilitate early diagnosis; identify patients; expand knowledge of the clinical presentation,
      progression and variation of the disease; identify and validate biomarkers and other efficacy
      measures; inform on the design and interpretation of clinical studies of investigational
      products; and eventually to optimize patient management.

      The main objective of this program is to better understand HIBM.

      The specific HIBM Disease Registry's objectives are to:

        -  Understand the geographic distribution and regional incidence/prevalence of GNEM.

        -  Obtain an assessment of the medical history, clinical presentation and progression of
           disease in GNEM patients and provide a connection for subjects to the broader GNEM
           community and associated programs.

        -  Provide customized information to subjects and their physicians that desire information
           on their disease status and progression.

      The specific HIBM Natural History Study's objectives are to:

        -  Characterize HIBM disease presentation and progression over time using relevant clinical
           assessments of muscle strength and function.

        -  Obtain information to better characterize quality of life and understand the timing of
           significant life changing events in HIBM patients using patient-reported outcomes.

        -  Identify biomarkers and efficacy measures for use as endpoints in future clinical
           studies.

        Must have a diagnosis of HIBM, GNE myopathy, Quadriceps Sparing Myopathy (QSM), Inclusion
        Body Myopathy Type 2, distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV), or Nonaka disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be willing and able to provide electronic consent to release access to medical
             information to the study sponsor or its agents

          -  Must have a diagnosis of GNEM, HIBM, Quadriceps Sparing Myopathy (QSM), Inclusion Body
             Myopathy Type 2, distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV), or Nonaka disease.
             (Genotyping will not be required for the GNEM Disease Registry and will not be
             conducted in this protocol. However, when available, genotypes of disease registry
             subjects should be provided and all subjects will be encouraged to be genotyped during
             the course of the disease registry through independent programs.)

          -  Must be willing and able to comply with all study procedures.

          -  Must meet all of the inclusion criteria for the GNEM Disease Registry portion of the
             study.

          -  Must be willing to have their collected information used as part of the GNEM Disease
             Registry.

          -  Must provide a genotype confirming GNE disease. Genotyping will not be conducted as
             part of this protocol, so GNE disease genotype data must be provided by the
             subject/physician from other sources.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the subject will be complaint with study visit
             schedule and study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For Natural History Component, concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of
             the investigator, would interfere with study participation or would affect safety.

          -  For Online Registry Component, there are no exclusion criteria.
