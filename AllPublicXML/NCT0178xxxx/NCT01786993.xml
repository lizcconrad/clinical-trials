      This IDE study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of patient treatment with MPP compared to patient treatment
      with standard BiV pacing at 9 months.

      The study will be conducted at a maximum of 50 investigational centers located in the United
      States. A maximum of 506 subjects implanted with the Quadripolar cardiac resynchronization
      therapy device (CRT-D) system will be enrolled in the study.

      All subjects will undergo a 2 dimensional Echocardiogram within the 30 days prior to implant,
      and again at 3, 6 and 9 months post implant. At implant, the final LV pacing configuration is
      programmed using any one of the 10 available pacing vectors. The paced/sensed
      atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delays may be optimized as per the site's
      standard of care. Subjects will continue to receive BiV therapy until the 3-month follow-up
      visit.

      At the 3-month visit, responder status between Enrollment and 3 months will be assessed using
      the Clinical Composite Score (CCS). All subjects that are &quot;Improved&quot; using the definition
      outlined in the CCS will be grouped together as Responders. All subjects that are &quot;Worsened&quot;
      or &quot;Unchanged&quot; using the definitions outlined in the CCS will be considered as
      Non-responders. All subjects will undergo acute measurement of cardiac performance (e.g.,
      Echocardiography) at various MPP combinations compared to BiV pacing. Only subjects with
      &quot;equal or better&quot; echocardiographic measurements (i.e., EA VTI measurements) with MPP feature
      on compared to BiV pacing will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms - BiV arm
      or MPP arm.

      At the 9-month visit, responder status will be evaluated once again using the CCS and
      compared to the status at 3 months.

    <measure>Freedom From System-related Complications Through 9 Months Compared to an Objective Performance Criterion</measure>
    <time_frame>Implant to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>A system related complication is a complication related to the Quadripolar CRT-D device system which includes pulse generator and leads, as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). All subjects who had an attempted implant or a successful Quadripolar system implant were included in the analysis of this safety endpoint.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Non-responders With MPP Compared to Biventricular Pacing</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis is that the non-response rate to CRT therapy in the MPP therapy arm is not inferior to the non-response rate in the BiV arm between 3 and 9 months post-implant. Responder status was assessed using the Clinical Composite Score (CCS). A patient's CCS was classified as worsened, improved or unchanged based on the definitions below:
Worsened - patient died due to cardiovascular reasons, experienced a HF event, demonstrated worsening in NYHA class, or had worsening of PGA score compared to the last observation
Improved - patient survived without a HF event, and demonstrated either improvement in NYHA class or improvement in PGA score, or both compared to the last observation.
Unchanged - patient was neither improved nor worsened
For patients who were responders at the 3-month visit, those who were &quot;Improved&quot; and &quot;Unchanged&quot; between 3 and 9 months were classified as responders, whereas those who were &quot;Worsened&quot; were grouped together as non-responders.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study enrolled 506 subjects at 49 investigational centers located in the U.S. A patient was considered enrolled upon signing informed consent. The first subject was enrolled on April 25, 2013. The study was double-blinded (the study subjects and the authorized personnel conducting the NYHA Class and Patient Global assessments were blinded).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>455 out of 469 subjects with an attempted implant (97% success rate) received Quadripolar BiV pacing between implant and 3 months. At 3 months, responder status was assessed per Clincial Composite Score and 1:1 randomziation was stratified by responder status. 381 patients were randomized to either BiV (n = 180) or MPP (n = 201) at 3 months.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Non-responders With MPP Compared to Biventricular Pacing</title>
        <description>The hypothesis is that the non-response rate to CRT therapy in the MPP therapy arm is not inferior to the non-response rate in the BiV arm between 3 and 9 months post-implant. Responder status was assessed using the Clinical Composite Score (CCS). A patient’s CCS was classified as worsened, improved or unchanged based on the definitions below:
Worsened - patient died due to cardiovascular reasons, experienced a HF event, demonstrated worsening in NYHA class, or had worsening of PGA score compared to the last observation
Improved - patient survived without a HF event, and demonstrated either improvement in NYHA class or improvement in PGA score, or both compared to the last observation.
Unchanged - patient was neither improved nor worsened
For patients who were responders at the 3-month visit, those who were “Improved” and “Unchanged” between 3 and 9 months were classified as responders, whereas those who were “Worsened” were grouped together as non-responders.</description>
