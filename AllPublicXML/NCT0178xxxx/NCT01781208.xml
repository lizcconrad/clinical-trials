      ARFI (Ultrasound-based Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse) will be used during ultrasound
      guided needle biopsy of the liver of children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new technique based on ultrasound, known as Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging
      is performed using standard approved ultrasound machines and transducers. The sound waves or
      impulses are generated in a different pattern and offer information on the stiffness of the
      tissue. This new technique will be evaluated for usefulness in diagnosing different liver
      conditions.

    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue shear wave speed is positively correlated to a material's/tissue's stiffness and can be noninvasively measured by ultrasound. The relationship between liver shear wave speed and liver histologic fibrosis score were assessed using 2 different ultrasound methods. Liver shear wave speed as obtained using 2 different ultrasound methods served as our primary outcome measures.
Note, the histologic scoring system (Ishak) ranged from 0 to 6, where 0 = no fibrosis and 6 = cirrhosis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Pediatric patients aged 18 and younger were scheduled for a liver biopsy at a large pediatric hospital between 2012 and 2014. A total of 62 patients were recruited and enrolled. Patients and their parents gave consent/assent for the study.</recruitment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Ultrasound-based Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI)</title>
          <description>62 children undergoing clinically ordered ultrasound-directed percutaneous core needle liver biopsy were included. Biopsy was performed for known or suspected (non-neoplastic) liver disease. (One child did not undergo a liver biopsy, so was ineligible and not included in the above total.)
The patients received an additional ultrasound for research purposes that utilized a technique known as ARFI. ARFI, or Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse, uses a transducer which directs sound waves again the liver to measure the stiffness of the tissues.</description>
