  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to use technology to improve adherence to antiretroviral
      therapy (ART)and increase access to ART adherence care for those HIV+ persons living in rural
      areas. The LIVE Network audio music program mobile application (app) is innovative,
      practical, portable, and could be rapidly scaled up to address the adherence self-management
      needs of rural groups nationwide. If successful, the impact on HIV care will be immense and
      could transform the delivery of HIV self-management and adherence education by overcoming
      barriers of geographic isolation, transportation, stigma and confidentiality in this
      vulnerable group.

      The project has two primary aims and one exploratory aim. 1.0 Revise and adapt the Live
      Network (LN) program and manual for rural persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and develop
      into a mobile application.

      2.0 Conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the program. When compared
      with an educational music control condition at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline, those
      randomized to the LN will have: H1: Significantly higher mean antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      adherence rates (measured by pill counts, self report).

      H2: Significantly higher mean levels of ART drug levels in hair sample analyses.

      H3: Significantly better clinical indicators: higher mean CD4 lymphocyte counts and percents,
      a larger proportion achieving virologic suppression (proportion with HIV RNA PCR &lt;50
      copies/ml), and smaller proportion with evidence of drug resistance, all as measured by
      medical record review.

      3.0 Explore: a) the effects of LN on symptoms and symptom management; b) the roles of
      self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and personal goal setting as mediators, and depression
      and health literacy as moderators of adherence.

    <description>The LN is a prerecorded mobile phone application (app). It employs a radio talk show format in which a Disc Jockey entertains HIV medication-, adherence-, and self-management-related questions and comments from callers and poses them to expert care providers, whose responses to these questions are augmented by songs that shed additional light on these issues.</description>
