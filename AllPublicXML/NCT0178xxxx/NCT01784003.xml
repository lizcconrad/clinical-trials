  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to characterize biological ankle joint function during walking and
      running on slopes in order to further develop advanced powered ankle-foot prostheses. Ankle
      joint torque and angle data will be collected from non-amputees while walking and running at
      multiple speeds and slopes. This data will be used to develop control parameters for a
      powered ankle-foot prosthesis. Then, these parameters will be implemented and tested in a
      powered prosthesis worn by people with below the knee amputations.
