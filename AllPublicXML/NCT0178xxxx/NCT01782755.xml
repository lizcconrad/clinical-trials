      Probiotics are commercially available live bacteria thought to have health benefits when
      ingested. A literature review of probiotic studies in the intensive care unit (ICU) found
      that in patients who receive probiotics, there is a 25% reduction in lung infection, known as
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is also an 18% reduction in the chance of
      developing any infection in the ICU. However, the studies reviewed were small and not well
      done. Therefore, whether probiotics are really helpful or not is unclear. Before a large
      carefully performed study is done to evaluate the effects of probiotics in critically ill
      patients, a pilot trial is needed. The investigators plan to study the feasibility of such a
      trial in mechanically ventilated ICU patients in 11 ICUs in Ontario, investigating whether
      orally ingested L. rhamnosus GG (a common probiotic) prevents VAP and other infections. The 4
      goals of the pilot study will be to ensure that we can successfully enrol patients; follow
      the protocol faithfully; make sure patients don't receive additional probiotics, and estimate
      how much pneumonia exists in these patients. In a separate substudy, the investigators will
      evaluate the effects of probiotics on lower lung infiltration with potential harmful
      bacteria, stool bacteria, markers of immunity called cytokines, and markers of infection
      called endotoxin levels. The investigators plan to enroll 150 adults admitted to ICU and
      receiving mechanical ventilation. Following informed consent, patients will be randomized to
      either L. rhamnosus GG group or an identical placebo. Twice daily, patients will receive
      probiotics or placebo in a feeding tube. The investigators will record all infections and
      other important outcomes in the ICU. This study is very important in the ongoing search for
      more effective strategies to prevent serious infection during critical illness. Probiotics
      may be an easy-to-use, readily available, inexpensive approach to help future critically ill
      patients around the world.

      Background: Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that may confer health benefits
      when ingested. Meta-analysis of probiotic trials suggests a 25 % lower ventilator-associated
      pneumonia (VAP) and 18 % lower infection rates overall when administered to patients in the
      intensive care unit (ICU). However, prior trials are small, largely single center, and at
      high risk of bias. Before a large rigorous trial is launched, testing whether probiotics
      confer benefit, harm, or have no impact, a pilot trial is needed. The aim of the PROSPECT
      Pilot Trial is to determine the feasibility of performing a larger trial in mechanically
      ventilated critically ill patients investigating Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. A priori, we
      determined that the feasibility of the larger trial would be based on timely recruitment,
      high protocol adherence, minimal contamination, and an acceptable VAP rate.

      Methods/design: Patients ≥18 years old in the ICU who are anticipated to receive mechanical
      ventilation for ≥72 hours will be included. Patients are excluded if they are at increased
      risk of probiotic-associated infection, have strict enteral medication contraindications, are
      pregnant, previously enrolled in a related trial, or are receiving palliative care. Following
      informed consent, patients are randomized in variable unspecified block sizes in a fixed 1:1
      ratio, stratified by ICU, and medical, surgical, or trauma admitting diagnosis. Patients
      receive 1 × 1010 colony forming units of L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle, Locin Industries Ltd)
      or an identical placebo suspended in tap water administered twice daily via nasogastric tube
      in the ICU. Clinical and research staff, patients, and families are blinded.

      Discussion: The primary outcomes for this pilot trial are the following: (1) recruitment
      success, (2) ≥90 % protocol adherence, (3) ≤5 % contamination, and (4) ~10 % VAP rate.
      Additional clinical outcomes are VAP, other infections, diarrhea (total, antibiotic
      associated, and Clostridium difficile), ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality. The
      morbidity, mortality, and cost of VAP underscore the need for cost-effective prophylactic
      interventions. The PROSPECT Pilot Trial is the initial step toward rigorously evaluating
      whether probiotics decrease nosocomial infections, have no effect, or actually cause
      infections in critically ill patients.
