      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate sternal bone healing following a full
      median sternotomy versus standard of care for sternal closure with wire cerclage. Additional
      outcomes on post-operative pain and analgesic usage, patient function and quality of life,
      and complications will also be collected. A health economics study will also be conducted, in
      which cost and billing data will be collected from sites participating in this clinical
      study.

    <textblock>
      Rigid sternal fixation with the BIOMET SternaLock Blu Sternal Closure System may result in
      greater sternal stability that leads to superior sternal bone healing, less postoperative
      pain and narcotic usage, and improved functional outcomes compared to wire cerclage. The
      health economics analysis is an interesting component of this study, in which cost and
      billing data will be collected from participating sites and analyzed in terms of
      cost/effectiveness for patients and healthcare system.

    <description>Parameters for scoring:
0 - Nonunion: No contact between sternal halves, absence of gap mineralization, and sclerotic osteotomy margins similar to that of cortical bone. Worst outcome
- Indeterminate: No contact or mineralization between the sternal halves, but osteotomy margins were nonsclerotic, concave, or irregular

This technique is the standard configuration for this study, and is intended to ensure that at least 3 plates are used to achieve adequate fixation and stability, while allowing for variations in the plating configuration as a result of patient anatomy and surgeon preference. Various Sternal Blu plates may be used on the manubrium as described below, as can an additional plate on the sternal body.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were considered eligible for enrollment if they were undergoing an open heart surgery (e.g. CABG and/or valve surgery) with a full median sternotomy and met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients were randomized at the time of sternal closure to receive either rigid sternal fixation (using sternal plates) or standard wire cerclage.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Patients will receive treatment option for sternal closure with the SternaLock Blue closure system at a minimum of 2 &quot;X&quot; plates on the sternal body and 1 &quot;L&quot; plate (or equivalent) on the manubrium. This technique is the standard configuration for this study, and is intended to ensure that at least 3 plates are used to achieve adequate fixation and stability, while allowing for variations in the plating configuration as a result of patient anatomy and surgeon preference. Various Sternal Blu plates may be used on the manubrium as described below, as can an additional plate on the sternal body.

          <title>Risk Factor [Congestive Heart Failure by NYHA Classification]</title>
          <description>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classifies heart failure according to the severity of patients' symptoms. Grades I through 4 of heart failure by NYHA is a functional classification, placing patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity. Grade I represents better outcome since there is no limitation of physical activities while Grade IV (exclusionary for this trial) represents the worst outcome, since patients are unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, even at rest.</description>

        <description>Parameters for scoring:
0 - Nonunion: No contact between sternal halves, absence of gap mineralization, and sclerotic osteotomy margins similar to that of cortical bone. Worst outcome
- Indeterminate: No contact or mineralization between the sternal halves, but osteotomy margins were nonsclerotic, concave, or irregular
- Early healing: Faint mineralization between noncontacting sternal halves, or a thin (1 mm) bridge of bone connecting the sternal halves anteriorly or posteriorly, or near bone-on-bone contact between the sternal halves, with sclerotic osteotomy margins
- Mild synthesis: Bridging bone (i.e., no perceptible gap) along less than 50% of the anteroposterior dimension of the sternal halves, with the sternal halves either offset in the anteroposterior dimension, or aligned in the anteroposterior dimension
- Moderate synthesis: Bridging bone along 50% or more of the antero-posterior dimension of the sternal haves 5- Sternal halves well-aligned. Best outcome</description>

This technique is the standard configuration for this study, and is intended to ensure that at least 3 plates are used to achieve adequate fixation and stability, while allowing for variations in the plating configuration as a result of patient anatomy and surgeon preference. Various Sternal Blu plates may be used on the manubrium as described below, as can an additional plate on the sternal body.
