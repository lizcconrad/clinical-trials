    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research (or &quot;knowledge gap&quot; this research is designed to fill) is to
      understand the science of how the combination therapy of 2 drugs (inhaled longacting
      beta-agonists(LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), which are commonly used in chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, is better than each drug alone. ICS and LABA
      both have antiinflammatory properties; that is, they dampen the inflammation in the cells of
      the airways in the lungs. The combination of LABA and ICS has also been shown to improve
      clinical effectiveness in asthma patients. The addition of a LABA to LOW doses of ICS has
      been shown to be more clinically beneficial in asthma than the use of HIGH doses of ICS
      alone. This has allowed a reduction in the total ICS dose and minimised the adverse side
      effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Recent evidence suggests that the use of combination
      therapy of LABA and ICS may also improve clinical effectiveness in COPD patients.

      Investigators will address this hypothesis by examining the inflammation cells of COPD direct
      from the site of disease (the airways) by looking at sputum/mucus. This research will build
      on the existing knowledge of the science of how these drugs work in asthma and COPD and
      allows us to understand the molecular science, which may support new future drug targets for
      patients with COPD, which are greatly needed.

    <textblock>
      Corticosteroids exert their effects by binding to a cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor (GR).
      The inactive GR is bound to a protein complex that includes heat shock protein hsp90, acting
      as molecular chaperones to prevent the nuclear localisation of unoccupied GR.

      GR binding to the palindromic promotor induces the transcriptional induction of
      anti-inflammatory genes such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and
      secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). GR-steroid complex also binds to negative GRE
      sequences, resulting in inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6. More
      importantly, GR binds transcription factor with recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and
      inhibits wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By this process of transrepression,
      corticosteroids reduce such pro-inflammatory cytokines as tumour necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha)
      and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in asthmatic patients whereas they are far less effective in chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.

      The combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long acting beta 2-agonists (LABAs) has
      been shown to improve clinical effectiveness and anti-inflammatory properties in asthma. The
      addition of a LABA to low dose ICS has been shown to be more clinically beneficial in asthma
      than the use of high dose ICS, allowing a reduction in ICS dose and minimising and adverse
      side effects of corticosteroids. Recent evidence suggests that this may also be the case in
      COPD.

      ICS such as budesonide, beclomethasone and fluticasone have been used in combination with
      LABA's such as formoterol and salmeterol. These combination treatments are established in
      national guidelines for treating patients with asthma and also, COPD. The combination of
      formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort ®, Astra Zeneca) will be studied in this project.

      Evidence suggests that LABAs enhance GR function in vitro. In an asthmatics study, the
      combination of formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort ®, Astra Zeneca) was as effective as high
      dose ICS on GR activation, gene transactivation and transrepression. However, the precise
      mechanisms for this enhanced effectiveness are unknown, although priming of the steroid
      receptor (GR) by LABAs may be important.

      Investigators have developed a novel method of measuring GR-GRE binding activity in sputum
      using an enzyme immunosorbent assay system. This method, together with the measurements of
      some functional readouts, will help us to understand some of the mechanisms of steroid and GR
      interactions using non-invasive methods of assessment of the airways. This may provide
      insight into the mechanisms of corticosteroid action and whether the addition of a LABA to
      ICS can alter molecular patterns, which may explain the observed beneficial action of
      combination therapy seen in patient studies in vivo. This may allow a scientific basis to
      explore future drug interactions that may be helpful in patients, particularly those patients
      whose disease tends to be severe and may be unresponsive to standard therapies for COPD
      and/or where high dose ICS have little beneficial clinical effect and have led to
      side-effects.

          2. Aged 38-80 years inclusive

          3. FEV1 &lt;15% reversibility (not % predicted) and/or an increase of &lt;200 ml after inhaled
             β2-agonists (400 μg salbutamol)

          4. Patients will be allowed to use their current short-acting β2-agonists (SABA) and
             long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) and short-acting muscarinic-antagonist (SAMA) and
             long-acting muscarinic-antagonists (LAMA). However they should refrain from
             short-acting β2-agonists (SABA) and short-acting muscarinic-antagonist (SAMA) for 6
             hours before the study visit and for long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) and long-acting
             muscarinic-antagonists (LAMA) at least 12 hours before the study visit, unless needed
             by the patient's clinical condition.

          5. Theophylline (an oral tablet bronchodilator) will be required to be stopped at least 3
             days prior to start of Study Visit one, and patients will not be allowed this
             treatment during the study as it may affect the GR response and the bronchodilator
             (lung function, spirometry) responses.

          6. Capable of giving informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening
             investigations, the Physician Responsible considers the volunteer unfit for the study.

          2. Patients who have a clinical diagnosis of Asthma, as decided by the Study
             Investigators, as this does not fulfil the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease (COPD).

          3. Patients who have had a history of an upper or lower respiratory infection (including
             sinusitis) within 4 weeks prior to study entry, as this can affect the breathing
             response.

          4. Patients who have received oral or parenteral steroids within 4 weeks prior to study
             entry, as this can affect the breathing response and signifies that their condition

          7. Any evidence of a positive pregnancy urine test for female volunteers or females who
             are pregnant or lactating or are likely to become pregnant during the trial. Women of
             child−bearing potential may be included in the study if, in the opinion of the
             investigator, they are taking adequate contraceptive precautions (which will be
             directly enquired at the screening visit).

          8. Patients who have a history of drug allergy which, in the opinion of the Unit
             Physician, contraindicates his/her participation in the study.

          9. Patients with a known or suspected allergy to corticosteroids or any component of the
             formulations and/or suspected hypersensitivity to inhaled corticosteroid (this will be
             asked directly at the screening visit).

         10. Patients who regularly, or on average, drink more than 21 units of alcohol (males) and
