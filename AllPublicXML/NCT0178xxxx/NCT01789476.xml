      This is a single-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group proof
      of concept study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy as well as the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic profile of CR845 in patients with pain following bunionectomy surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the most widely used drugs to treat pain after surgery are opiates, such as
      morphine. Morphine works mainly by activating one of several types of opiate receptors that
      control some of our pain sensation - the so-called mu opiate receptors. These receptors are
      located in many areas of the brain and also outside of the brain. By activating these
      receptors, morphine provides significant pain relief, but also causes side effects that limit
      its use. Some of these side effects include: respiratory depression or arrest (slowed or
      stopped breathing), sedation (a state of calmness or extreme relaxation), euphoria (an
      exaggerated feeling of physical and mental well-being), constipation, nausea, vomiting, and
      drug addiction.

      In order to avoid the side effects of morphine and other mu opiates, the present experimental
      drug CR845 was designed to work at a different type of opiate receptor - called kappa - that
      can also provide pain relief, by acting on sensory nerves outside the brain. CR845 was
      designed to penetrate the brain much less than other opiate drugs, which should result in
      pain relief similar to that of morphine, but with fewer side effects. Because CR845 activates
      kappa receptors instead of mu receptors, the side effects are different than with a
      morphine-type drug. In particular, kappa opiates, such as CR845, do not cause respiratory
      depression or arrest, euphoria, constipation, drug tolerance, physical drug dependence or
      drug addiction. For these reasons, CR845 may present a distinct advantage over other opiates
      that are currently used for pain relief and post-operative pain in particular.

    <measure>Summed Pain Intensity Differences Over 24 Hours (SPID 0-24) Following the Initial Administration of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patients reported their pain intensity using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm represented &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm represented the &quot;Worst Pain You Can Imagine&quot;. SPID 0-24 represents the cumulative time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference (PID) scores between each assessment timepoint following the postoperative administration of study drug (i.e. 0 to 15 min, 15 to 30 min, etc.) over 24 hours. Pain intensity assessments were measured at baseline (entry pain score) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 150 minutes; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48 hours after the first administration of study drug (only timepoints up to 24 hours used in calculating SPID 0-24).
Negative SPID values represent a decrease in pain intensity (i.e. lower values indicate a greater reduction in pain).</description>

        <description>Patients reported their pain intensity using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm represented &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm represented the &quot;Worst Pain You Can Imagine&quot;. SPID 0-24 represents the cumulative time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference (PID) scores between each assessment timepoint following the postoperative administration of study drug (i.e. 0 to 15 min, 15 to 30 min, etc.) over 24 hours. Pain intensity assessments were measured at baseline (entry pain score) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 150 minutes; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48 hours after the first administration of study drug (only timepoints up to 24 hours used in calculating SPID 0-24).
Negative SPID values represent a decrease in pain intensity (i.e. lower values indicate a greater reduction in pain).</description>

        <title>Summed Pain Intensity Differences Over 48 Hours (SPID 0-48) Following the Initial Administration of Study Drug</title>
        <description>Patients reported their pain intensity using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm represented &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm represented the &quot;Worst Pain You Can Imagine&quot;. SPID 0-24 represents the cumulative time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference (PID) scores between each assessment timepoint following the postoperative administration of study drug (i.e. 0 to 15 min, 15 to 30 min, etc.) over 24 hours. Pain intensity assessments were measured at baseline (entry pain score) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 150 minutes; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48 hours after the first administration of study drug.
Negative SPID values represent a decrease in pain intensity (i.e. lower values indicate a greater reduction in pain).</description>
