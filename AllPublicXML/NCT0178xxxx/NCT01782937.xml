      This study is an open-label, non-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      KHK4827 in subjects with pustular psoriasis (generalized) and psoriatic erythroderma.
      Pharmacokinetics of KHK4827 will also be assessed.

          -  Subject has stopped ustekinumab or other anti-Interleukin (IL)-23 biologics therapy
