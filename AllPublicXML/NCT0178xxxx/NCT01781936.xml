  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability, safety, and benefits of an
      investigational drug,Fluocinolone Acetonide Intravitreal Insert (FA-i), in people who have
      posterior uveitis. The study drug, Fluocinolone Acetonide, is currently used in a surgical
      implant, Retisert, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      non-infectious posterior uveitis . The study drug is able to be inserted in an ophthalmology
      (eye) clinic; whereas Retisert must be surgically implanted in the Operating Room. Initially,
      this was a 2-dose randomized pilot study. However, the study was modified to include only the
      0.2 ug/day implant.
