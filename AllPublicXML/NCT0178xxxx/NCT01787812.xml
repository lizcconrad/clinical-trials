  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The California Joint Replacement Registry (CJRR) was created to meet the need for
      comprehensive, scientific assessment of devices, treatment protocols, surgical approaches,
      and patient factors influencing the results of hip and knee replacement surgeries.
      Importantly, it is a Level 3 registry, meaning it collects and incorporates clinical
      information and direct feedback from patients about the outcomes of hip and knee replacement
      surgeries. It is one of only a small number of registries in the United States to do so.

      The CJRR's goals are to:

        -  Collect and report scientifically valid data on the results of hip and knee replacements
           performed in California, including device safety and effectiveness, post-operative
           complication and revision rates, and patient-reported outcomes; and

        -  Promote the use of performance information regarding hip and knee replacements to guide
           physician and patient decisions and to support programs for provider recognition and
           reward.

      Specifically the CJRR is designed to:

        -  Minimize burden on participants by using electronic data sources, rather than manual
           data entry or chart review.

        -  Compile reports assessing the outcomes associated with different devices and surgical
           techniques.

        -  Create benchmarking reports for physicians and hospitals that detail performance data
           and compare it to statewide averages.

        -  Transmit safety alerts on devices with short-term results that provoke concern.

        -  Shape a measurement and reporting system for total hip and total knee replacement
           surgeries.

      The CJRR was developed by the California HealthCare Foundation (CHCF), the Pacific Business
      Group on Health (PBGH), and the California Orthopaedic Association (COA). PBGH manages the
      day-to-day operations of the CJRR.

      CJRR's data elements are aligned with other major orthopedic registries. The CJRR is a member
      of the International Consortium of Orthopedic Registries (ICOR) and the International Society
      of Arthroscopic Registries (ISAR).
