      The purpose of this study is to evaluate improvement of symptoms from benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH) as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) for
      prostatic artery embolization (PAE) using Embosphere Microspheres compared to conventional
      transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
