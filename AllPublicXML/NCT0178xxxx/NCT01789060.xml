    <textblock>
      PI3K(phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT pathway is an important oncogenic signaling pathway.
      However, clinical information about the significance of p-AKT expression in malignant
      lymphoma is not fully understood yet. In this study, we investigated the overexpression of
      p-AKT and its prognostic implication in malignant lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      Recently, among diverse oncogenic signaling pathways, a number of studies have focused on the
      significance of oncogenic PI3K/AKT (phophatidylinositol 3-kinase/serine-threonine kinase,
      also known as protein kinase B [PKB]) pathway. PI3K(phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT
      pathway phosphorylates and activates AKT as phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and plays a critical
      role promoting malignant phenotype and has prognostic significance in various solid cancers.

      However, a systematic approach on the impact of p-AKT overexpression on clinical outcomes has
      not been performed in malignant lymphoma.
