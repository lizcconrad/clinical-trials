  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, more than 35,000 people died in the United Kingdom from lung cancer, the majority
      from non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for patients
      with NSCLC but those treated will still only live for an average of 9 or 10 months after
      diagnosis.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out whether or not giving a drug called
      Olaparib following chemotherapy will benefit patients with NSCLC who have responded to
      initial chemotherapy treatment by prolonging the time before the tumour regrows. Olaparib is
      a new, oral drug developed by AstraZeneca which may help to slow down cancer growth. The
      rationale for this clinical trial is that chemotherapy damages tumour cell DNA and NSCLC
      tumours that respond to chemotherapy are less able to repair this damage. This can be
      exploited by using Olaparib as it blocks an enzyme called Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
      which is essential for DNA repair. This will prevent DNA repair and cause cancer cell death
      by a mechanism known as synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of
      mutation in two or more genes leads to cell death.

      Up to 300 patients who are to receive standard chemotherapy treatment will be initially
      registered into the trial. Of these patients, 114 patients who have responded to chemotherapy
      will be randomly allocated to receive either Olaparib or an inactive dummy pill or placebo by
      mouth. The trial will assess whether Olaparib delays disease progression following standard
      chemotherapy treatment in patients. It will also show whether the side effects of adding
      Olaparib following standard treatment are acceptable.

      This is a multicentre randomised phase II trial. Patients are initially registered either
      before or during induction chemotherapy, their response to which will be used to determine
      whether they are eligible for randomisation. All patients will be asked to consent to
      archival tissue collection for translational analysis and to provide a translational blood
      sample. The second consent will precede randomisation to one of two groups of maintenance
      therapy (olaparib or placebo) with 1:1 randomisation if they have had an objectively measured
      complete or partial response following standard chemotherapy.

      Randomised patients will receive olaparib or placebo until disease progression. They will be
      monitored by CT scan every two cycles until disease progression, where they will be managed
      according to local practice. Follow up will be for a maximum of 12 months from the point of
      randomisation or until disease progression.

      All randomised patients for whom we have a baseline translational blood sample will be asked
      to provide a follow up blood sample upon randomisation and again at radiological progression.
      Registered patients with progressive disease after the initial induction chemotherapy will be
      asked to provide a follow-up blood sample at the end of induction chemotherapy.

    <description>To establish the anti-tumour activity of Olaparib (measured by progression free survival),we will document the time from randomisation to any disease progression and/or death, defined according to strict RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) v1.1.

    <description>Olaparib is a potent inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme (PARP), (molecular weight 434) that is being developed as a monotherapy as well as for combination with chemotherapy and other anti-cancer agents. Olaparib can lead to tumour regression in patients with DNA repair deficient NSCLC. Olaparib may also enhance the DNA damaging effects of chemotherapy.</description>
