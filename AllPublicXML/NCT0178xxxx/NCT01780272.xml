      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the impact of low
      blood sugar during the night on sleep in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

    <description>Each subject will complete one adaptation night visit followed by two experimental night visits, one normoglycaemic and one hypoglycaemic, in randomised order. While subjects are asleep, sleep patterns will be monitored online using polysomnographic recordings during a hypoglycaemic and a normoglycaemic clamp (using constant intravenous (i.v.) infusion of human soluble insulin (Actrapid®)). Plasma glucose will be monitored.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed clinically) for at least 24 weeks prior to
             screening

          -  Currently treated with any anti-diabetic treatment (incl. diet and exercise) except
             insulin with a stable dose for more than 4 weeks prior to screening

          -  Body mass index below 35 kg/m^2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe hypoglycaemic event during the past 6 months or hospitalisation for diabetic
             ketoacidosis during the previous 6 months

          -  Any other chronic disorder or severe disease by clinical information (including
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnoea and epilepsy) which, in the
             opinion of the investigator might jeopardise subject's sleep, safety or compliance
             with the protocol, or subjects with mental incapacity or language barriers precluding
             adequate understanding or co-operation or who, in the opinion of the investigator,
             should not participate in the trial

          -  Use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, hypnotics, sedatives or other drugs known to
             influence sleep within 12 weeks prior to screening
