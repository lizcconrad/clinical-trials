  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of
      an investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is
      still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as
      the safest dose to use and the side effects it may cause.

      Afatinib has been studied in other clinical trials of participants with head and neck cancer,
      lung cancer, and breast cancer. This dose of Afatinib has also been studied in other research
      studies. This is the first clinical trial to study Afatinib in combination with Radiation
      Therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of Afatinib when given in
      combination with Radiation Therapy or in combination with Radiation Therapy and chemotherapy
      for head and neck cancer.

      Afatinib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug works by
      blocking multiple proteins known to play a role in the growth of cancer cells. Information
      from laboratory research studies suggests that this drug may help to make head and neck
      cancer cells more sensitive to Radiation Therapy.

      The other therapy in this research study is Radiation Therapy or Radiation Therapy plus a
      chemotherapy drug called Docetaxel. After surgery, Radiation Therapy and chemotherapy is the
      standard treatment if you have high risk disease. &quot;High risk disease&quot; means that without
      additional therapy, there is a high risk that the disease may return. In this study,
      participants with high-risk disease will receive Radiation Therapy and Docetaxel and
      Afatinib. &quot;Intermediate risk&quot; means that there is an intermediate risk that the disease may
      return. Radiation Therapy alone is the standard treatment approach for intermediate risk
      cancer. In this study, participants with intermediate risk disease will receive Radiation
      Therapy and Afatinib.

      If you are willing to take part in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening
      tests and procedures to confirm your eligibility. Many of these tests and procedures are
      likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not take part in the
      research study. If you already had some of these tests and procedures recently, they may or
      may not have to be repeated. The tests and procedures include: a review of your medical
      history, physical exam, blood samples, urine sample, serum pregnancy test, electrocardiogram,
      echocardiogram and an assessment of your disease to find out the extent of your cancer. If
      these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you may begin
      the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to
      participate in this research study.

      We will collect an archive tumor specimen (leftover tissue from your prior surgery or
      biopsies) to confirm your cancer diagnosis. Additional tests on the tumor specimen may be
      performed as a part of future studies to gain new knowledge about head and neck cancer.

      You will receive Afatinib as a pill that you take by mouth for 7 weeks. During the first
      week, you will receive Afatinib alone. During the second through seventh weeks, you will
      receive Afatinib together with Radiation Therapy OR with Docetaxel and Radiation Therapy.
      Docetaxel is given intravenously, once a week during Week 2 through Week 7. Not everyone who
      participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose
      you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before
      you and how well they tolerated their doses.

      Afatinib needs to be taken on an empty stomach. Specific instructions about this will be
      included in the drug diary you will need to complete.

      If you take part in this research study, you will receive the same radiation that you would
      receive if you were not on the study. The radiation is typically done daily Monday through
      Friday for about 6-7 weeks. You will sign a separate consent form with your radiation
      oncologist that will outline what to expect with this treatment.

      You will be given a physical exam every week during your treatment. You will have a physical
      exam and be asked questions about your general health and specific questions about any
      problems that you might be having and any medications you may be taking.

      You will have blood tests every week during your treatment including chemistry and hematology
      tests and a pregnancy test if you are a woman capable of becoming pregnant before you receive
      your first infusion of docetaxel.

      You will also be asked to return to the clinic one week, four weeks and eight weeks after
      finishing your treatment. Most of these visits are part of routine visits after finishing
      treatment. If you stop the study early for any reason, you will also have a clinic visit. In
      either instance, the following exams and procedures will be performed: physical exam, blood
      tests, other tests including an electrocardiogram, MUGA scan or echocardiogram, CT scan and a
      PET/CT scan.

    <description>All participants who receive any amount of study drug will be evaluable for toxicity. The primary outcome measure is the incidence of a physician-assessed dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at a given dose-level of afatinib. Participants will be assessed for a DLT at least once per week during the course of therapy, including the one-week afatinib lead-in period and the 6-7 weeks of radiation therapy. DLT's are defined as the incidence of a severe or life-threatening toxicity (grade 3-4) as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Versions 4 (CTCAEv.4) or any afatinib-related toxicity requiring a dose reduction occurring during treatment with afatinib and radiation therapy +/- docetaxel. Participants will continue to be assessed for adverse events for 12 weeks after the completion of therapy.</description>
