  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial factors have been found to be associated with an increased risk for coronary
      artery disease incidence, progression and worse clinical outcomes.

      Patients with non-significant coronary artery disease (confirmed vascular irregularities, but
      &lt;60% coronary occlusion) often present with complaints such as chest pain, which warrant
      screening by coronary angiography (CAG) or computed tomography (CT scan). The prognosis of
      this group of patients with mild stenosis remains to be investigated in more detail, and we
      propose that psychosocial factors play a role in the clinical prognosis and patient reported
      outcomes in this group.

      A special focus lies within examining personality characteristics, of which Type D
      personality is a primary predictor variable for prognosis. Type D personality is
      characterised by high negative affect and high social inhibition. In addition to psychosocial
      factors (personality, mood state, social support, SES), biomarkers(inflammation, clotting,
      DNA) as well as standard clinical risk factors (metabolic syndrome, activity level, smoking,
      medication use, disease severity) will be investigated.

      The goal of the proposed study is to investigate a preexisting psycho-biochemical risk
      profile for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and patient perceived symptoms in a
      group with angiographically or CT-scan confirmed, non-significant coronary artery disease.

    <time_frame>Average 42 months (Range 12-72; at least 12 months after inclusion final participant)</time_frame>
    <description>MACE includes the occurence of a recurrent coronary angiography, emergency hospitalization (for cardiac reasons), myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), mortality (cardiac/noncardiac)</description>

    <measure>Patient Perceived Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>patient perceived health status includes self-reported chest pain, disease specific health status, generic health status, fatigue and mood (depression/anxiety). Double time point was included for this outcome measure to examine changes over time, compared to baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosocial factors</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary aim is to investigate the correlation and the stability over time between psychosocial factors, biochemical variables, traditional cardiac risk factors and measures of outcome.
Psychosocial factors include questionnaires as personality scales (Type D personality, Cook-Medley Hostility scale 27 item version), depression (HADS-D at each time point, BDI, CESD-10 and PHQ9 at consecutive time points), anxiety (HADS-A at each time point), fatigue (FAS), global mood scale (Positive and negative affect), generic health status (Short Form 12), specific health status (Seattle Angina Questionnaire). Indicators of education level, marital status, lifestyle factors, and activity level.</description>

    <measure>Biochemical correlates</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Examine biochemical correlates in relation to psychosocial and traditional cardiac risk factors.
Standard assessment is done for high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen, leukocyte count and differentiation, and registration of lipid profile, glucose, creatinin at baseline. Baseline and 12 month serum samples are collected and stored at -80, as well as DNA samples for future funding opportunities.</description>
