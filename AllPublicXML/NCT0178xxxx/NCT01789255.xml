    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well giving vorinostat, tacrolimus, and methotrexate
      works in preventing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after stem cell transplant in patients
      with hematological malignancies. Vorinostat, tacrolimus, and methotrexate may be an effective
      treatment for GVHD caused by a bone marrow transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and the feasibility of the addition of vorinostat to tacrolimus and
      methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine day 100 grades 2-4 acute GVHD. II. To determine 1-year overall survival and
      relapse-free survival. III. To correlate plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers of
      acute GVHD. IV. To correlate protein acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells before
      and after administration of vorinostat.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -10 to 100. Beginning on
      day -3, patients receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) continuously or PO BID (or
      cyclosporine IV continuously or PO in patients unable to tolerate tacrolimus) with taper on
      days 100-180.Patients also receive methotrexate IV once daily (QD) on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.

          -  The effects of vorinostat on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason
             and because histone deacetylase inhibitor agents as well as other therapeutic agents
             used in this trial (e.g., tacrolimus and methotrexate) are known to be teratogenic,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of vorinostat administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients must be able to swallow capsules/tablets

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not a candidate for an unrelated donor allogeneic HSCT based on the
             current institutional bone marrow transplant (BMT) program clinical practice
             guidelines; organ function criteria will be utilized per the current institutional BMT
             program clinical practice guidelines; there will be no restriction to study entry
             based on hematological parameters

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to vorinostat

          -  Patients undergoing a total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen (TBI
             1200 centigray [cGy])

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements; patients still under therapy for presumed or proven infection are
             eligible provided there is clear evidence (radiographic findings and/or culture
             results) that the infection is well-controlled; patients under treatment for infection
             will be enrolled only after clearance from the Principal Investigator (PI)

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because vorinostat is a histone
             deacetylase inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with vorinostat, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with vorinostat

          -  Patients with evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity and/or
             positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, human T-lymphotropic virus
             (HTLV)1/HTLV2 seropositivity; the safety of allogeneic HSCT is not yet
             well-established for this population

          -  Patients with evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C PCR positivity; hepatitis
             reactivation following myelosuppressive therapy can lead to fatal complications

          -  Patients with a history of prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) syndrome

          -  Patients asking or who have had prior treatment with a drug like vorinostat (i.e.,
             valproic acid) within the last 30 days
