      Studies suggest that lutein and n-3 fatty acids may influence the development of a child's
      brain and may be related to how well children learn. Both lutein and the n-3 fats (also known
      as omega-3 fats) are not made by the body and must be obtained in the diet. The investigators
      are interested to understand the importance of n-3 fats and lutein to child brain
      development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will make it possible to look into
      the brain from the outside and see which parts of the brain are being used as children
      complete working memory tasks. The investigators will study brain function using fMRI among
      children with different intakes of n-3 fats and lutein.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Children 6 years of age consuming &lt; 25 mg/day DHA and &lt; 400 μg lutein/day will show
           poorer activation of brain areas on fMRI than children consuming &gt; 150 mg/day DHA and &gt;
           1,200 μg/day lutein.

        2. Children consuming &lt; 400 μg lutein/day and &gt; 150 mg/day DHA will also show differences
           in fMRI results when compared to children consuming &gt; 150 mg/day DHA and &gt; 1,200 μg/day
           lutein.
