    <measure>The proportion of subjects with a clinical response of &quot;success&quot; at Week 12 using IGA.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with a clinical response of &quot;success&quot; at Week 12. Success was defined as an IGA score that was at least 2 grades less than the baseline assessment.</description>

    <measure>Analysis of Application Site Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A descriptive analysis comparing the application site reactions for each treatment group will be conducted to ensure that the test product is not worse than the reference product with regard to the expected and unexpected application site reactions.</description>

    <measure>Safety analyses were conducted on the Safety population.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety incidence of all AEs reported during the study was summarized using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), by treatment group, body system, severity, and relationship to study drug.
The report of AEs included date of onset, description of the AE, and date of resolution.</description>
