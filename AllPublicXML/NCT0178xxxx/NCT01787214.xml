  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have swings in their blood sugar levels that may
      lead to a higher risk of developing heart disease. An important part of diabetes management
      involves eating a diet to prevent large swings in blood sugar levels. Walnuts contain fat,
      protein and fiber that may reduce the swings in blood sugar. The purpose of this study is to
      compare the effects of a walnut-free American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet versus 2 levels
      of walnut-enriched ADA diets on blood sugar swings. Eighteen male and female adults with T2DM
      will participate in the study. Subjects will be randomized to consume an ADA diet with or
      without walnuts for 3 consecutive days every other week. Subjects must test their blood sugar
      twice daily and wear a continuous glucose monitor during the three 72-hour study periods.
      Subjects will be between 40 and 70 years of age and will be recruited from the surrounding
      community using flyers and public service announcements. Consent will take place in the
      Department of Nutrition at Loma Linda University by the study investigators. In total,
      subject participation will last 5 weeks and all meals will be provided during the 3 study
      periods.

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of two isocaloric walnut-enriched meal plans versus a walnut-free ADA meal plan on within-day glucose variability in adults with diabetes by assessing: a) the overall standard deviation (SD) around the sensor glucose calculated for each day and then averaged over the 3-day study periods; b) the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) over the 3-day study periods.</description>

    <measure>Glucose variability dose response</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary objective will be to test for a dose-response effect, i.e. the more walnuts (full-dose versus half-dose) the lower the glucose variability.</description>

    <measure>Dose response to between-day glycemic variability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the three isocaloric ADA meal plans (full-dose, half-dose, walnut free) on the mean of the daily differences(MODD) will be recorded as a measure of between-day glycemic variability</description>

    <measure>Glucose levels by meal</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
