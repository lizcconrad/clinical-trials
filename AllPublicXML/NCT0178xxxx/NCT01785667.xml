  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to clarify the current diabetic status, including development
      of complications, in a nationwide cohort of type 1 diabetics, who were last examined together
      in a large study in 1995. These youngsters were originally participating in a nationwide
      study of children with type 1 diabetes in Denmark back in 1986. The investigators will try to
      establish risk factors for developing diabetic retinopathy. The investigators will have
      emphasis on retinal vessel geometry and the possibilities for early detection of reversible
      retinal changes, and prediction of other vascular complications.

    <description>Using the ETDRS grading protocol the degree of retinopathy in 2011 will be assessed by grading 7-field fundus photographs taken at follow-up examination. This will be related to the degree of retinopathy found in the patients in 1995, where the last study of the cohort took place.</description>

    <time_frame>16 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using the computer software named IVAN we will assess the average vessel diameters around the optic disc on fundus photos from 1995. This we will relate to the degree of retinopathy in 2011 to see if vessel diameters predicts diabetic eye complications.</description>

    <description>Using the computer software named Fractal Analyzer we will assess the fractal dimension around the optic disc on fundus photos from 1995. This we will relate to the degree of retinopathy in 2011 to see if fractals can help predict diabetic eye complications.</description>

        This study includes a cohort of type 1 diabetic patients, who originally were identified in
        21 paediatric departments and studied in 1986. This group initially consisted of 1033
        children and was estimated to involve around 80 percent of all Danish type 1 diabetic
        patients below the age of 18. In 1995 further examinations were performed on the cohort;
        this time 339 chose to participate.

        In this study we will invite the participants from 1995 who also participated in the eye
        examinations, n=324, to participate in yet another follow-up examination.
