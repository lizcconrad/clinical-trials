      This study tests whether pre-cessation interventions known to be effective in the general
      population will increase acceptance of evidence-based treatment, engagement and compliance
      with that treatment and initial quitting success. One hundred and seventy two patients will
      be recruited from 13 Community Support Programs (CSPs). CSPs provide community based care to
      those diagnosed with persistent and serious mental illness. All participants will receive two
      group sessions (40 minutes each) modeled after &quot;Kicking Butts&quot;, a group-based quitting
      preparation program used for the past four years in two Milwaukee CSP programs run by
      Wisconsin Community Services. Individuals will then be randomly assigned to the experimental
      and control conditions (n=86 each). Experimental subjects will receive four evidence-based
      preparatory interventions (motivational interviewing, smoking reduction, practice quit
      attempt, and pre-quit use of nicotine replacement medication) (25 - 30 minutes each).
      Attention control subjects will also receive four individual sessions of the same duration.
      However their individual sessions' content will be a discussion of the personal relevance of
      the group material and will not include any of the preparatory interventions. Data will be
      collected via brief surveys taken pre-intervention, at the end of the last individual
      session, and three months later and from a database provided by the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit
      Line (WTQL).

    <description>Everyone to be put into the experimental or active comparator group will attend 2 group meetings over two weeks each of which lasts 40 minutes. Experience with the Kicking Butts program indicates that this duration is well tolerated by this population. The content of these two group meetings is based on the Kicking Butts program. The Kicking Butts program was initially developed as a cessation intervention, but consistent with the literature about the need to prepare this population to make a quit attempt, has evolved to emphasize preparation for quitting. Topics addressed include the health consequences of smoking, reasons to quit and methods of quitting.</description>

            <title>Cognitive/Motivational Intervention Group</title>
            <description>This arm of the project will address the following questions:
After completion of experimental individual sessions, do the participants in the control group utilize the quit line services at the same, greater or lesser rate than those who are in the Active Control group?
After completion of experimental individual sessions, do the participants in the control group utilize the quit line services at the same, greater or lesser rate than those who are in the Motivated Smokers Comparison group?
Cognitive / Motivational Individual Sessions: Cognitive Motivational subjects will receive four evidence-based preparatory interventions (motivational interviewing, smoking reduction, practice quit attempt, and pre-quit use of nicotine replacement medication) (25 - 30 minutes each).
Nicotine Patch: Cognitive Motivational subjects will be asked to take one 21 mg patch/day for 4 weeks.</description>

Attention Control Individual Sessions: Attention control subjects will receive four placebo individual sessions (25-30 minutes each). The session content will reemphasize group discussion of the personal health risks from smoking.</description>

Do participants in the Motivated Smokers Comparison group (identified as motivated to quit upon recruitment) utilize the quit line services at the same, greater or lesser rate than those who are in the Active Control group?
Participants will not receive any intervention but will be consented and enrolled into this group and assessed for utilization of the tobacco quit line services.</description>
