  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of escalating doses of BVD-523 in patients with advanced malignancies. The
      study also seeks to demonstrate target modulation and early signs of clinical response in
      select patient populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being performed to assess the safety and tolerability of BVD-523

      In Part 1 of the study, an accelerated dose escalation plan will be used to establish dose
      limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended Phase 2 dose.

      In Part 2 of the study, additional patients with particular tumor types and/or cancers
      harboring specific genetic mutations will be recruited for treatment at the Recommended Phase
      2 Dose. Patients may also be assessed pharmacodynamic measures in healthy or malignant
      tissues, using biomarker assays for phosphorylation, cytotoxic or cytostatic measures.
