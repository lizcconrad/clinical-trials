    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the frequency of Residual Neuromuscular Blockade (RNMB)
      in the pediatric population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be the first to investigate the incidence of residual postoperative
      neuromuscular blockade in the pediatric patient following the intraoperative use of NMBA's.
      If there is significant residual blockade present, it may be that these effects will lead to
      postoperative respiratory complications including hypoxemia, atelectasis, and prolonged
      oxygen requirement resulting in a prolonged stay in the post-anesthesia care unit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 18 years.

          2. Surgery requiring the administration of neuromuscular blocking, agents with planned
             extubation in the postoperative care unit (PACU).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Neuromuscular diseases which may prolong the duration of NMBA's or exaggerate the
             effects of residual blockade.

          2. The need for postoperative mechanical ventilation.

          3. Direct admission to the Pediatric ICU, NICU or CTICU.
