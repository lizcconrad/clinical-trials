    <textblock>
      This study is Phase II of a project by the University of Arizona Center for Integrative
      Medicine (AzCIM). Collaborating with AzCIM is the Health Outcomes and Pharmacoeconomics
      (HOPE) Center and the RAND Corporation, Inc. Phase II is a prospective evaluation of the
      clinical and cost effectiveness (outcomes) of an integrative medicine professional practice
      model for adult primary care delivery (the University of Arizona Integrative Health Center -
      UAIHC in Phoenix, AZ). Data will be gathered from eligible and consenting members of UAIHC.
      In addition, a fidelity evaluation will assess whether the practice model was implemented as
      planned.

      The specific aims are to: 1) Recruit, consent, and enroll a sample of eligible patient and
      staff participants from UAIHC; 2) Conduct outcome evaluation of UAIHC care using patient data
      from medical records abstractions, self-report assessments, clinic administrative and service
      utilization/encounter data, and health insurance claims data; and, 3) Conduct fidelity
      evaluation of the implementation of the UAIHC model as described in its business plan using
      patient- and staff-reported fidelity assessments, random chart audits, and abstracted clinic
      administrative data.

      Participants. 1) Participants from the clinic patient population for whom clinical and cost
      outcomes will be tracked (n=500); 2) Clinic patients from whom fidelity data will be
      collected (n=180); and, 3) Clinic personnel from whom fidelity data will also be collected
      (n=14).

      Data Collection. For outcomes evaluation, data will be collected at baseline (initial clinic
      visit), and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow up periods. Sources include clinical symptoms and
      biomarkers from medical records abstractions; patient reported outcomes and satisfaction
      questionnaires; clinic service encounter logs; and, cost data from health insurance claims
      information and clinic financial data. For fidelity evaluation, data will be collected
      monthly for 6 months after study start, quarterly for the next 6 months, and semi-annually
      from then on. Patient data for fidelity will be gathered on a single randomized day of the
      week using a self-administered patient feedback questionnaire. For personnel, fidelity data
      will be collected at the same intervals using a self-administered provider perceptions
      questionnaire of inter-professional team and integrative medical care. Data from audits of
      randomly selected patient charts and administrative records will also be used.
