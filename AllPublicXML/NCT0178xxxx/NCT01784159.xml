  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet activation is an important factor in the pathogenesis of microvascular thrombosis
      characteristic of infections. Microthrombosis may be related to the progression of
      dysfunction during sepsis. Several drugs were tested in order to directly regulate blood
      clotting. However, there is a lack of studies on aspirin use in sepsis. Observational studies
      have demonstrated a decreased morbidity and mortality of sepsis with previous use of aspirin.
      However, no prospective randomized studies regarding this intervention were done. The
      objectives of this study are to evaluate the impact of the use of aspirin in reducing organ
      dysfunction measured by SOFA score on the seventh day, and assess its effect on the duration
      of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, as well as platelet activity, inflammatory
      and prothrombotic activity. Thus, adult patients with severe sepsis and / or septic shock
      with less than 48 hours will be randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 (ASA) will
      receive aspirin 200 mg and Group 2, placebo either once daily for 14 days. The inflammatory
      status and coagulation will be collected either in the D0 and D3, with measurements of
      interleukin 6, interleukin 10 and interleukin-8. The coagulation profile will be analyzed by
      measuring thrombin-antithrombin complex, thrombin time, d-dimer and tissue factor. The
      platelet activity will be evaluated by testing platelet function (PFA) and by measurement of
      urinary metabolites and thromboxane.
