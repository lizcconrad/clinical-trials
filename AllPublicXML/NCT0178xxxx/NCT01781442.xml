    <textblock>
      The Philippine Food and Drug Administration requires that a post marketing surveillance study
      be conducted nationwide and enroll approximately 3,000 study patients. In cases where the
      3,000 patients will not be met, the total sample size can be reduced to 10% of the volume of
      drug use during the first year of it being marketed. Final sample size will be determined
      after one year of marketing authorization. The decision to use Torisel must be a joint
      decision made by the subject and the investigator.

      The investigator must discuss product information with the subject as per usual practice.

    <description>The recommended dose of Torisel is 25 mg infused over a 30-60 minute period once a week.
Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
The use and dosage recommendations for Torisel will take place on the basis of the approved local product document and will be adjusted solely according to medical and therapeutic necessity.</description>

        This is a prospective observational, non-interventional study which will evaluate Torisel
        in Filipino adult subjects. Because the data to be collected will be under routine clinical
        conditions, subjects who have any of the contraindications specified in the product package
        insert are to be excluded. Torisel will be prescribed and administered according to the
        approved product information of the drug in the Philippines. Pfizer will not provide the
        drug for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects that will be included in this post marketing surveillance study must be
             consistent with the approved label indication of Torisel in the Philippines.

             carcinoma will be the ones eligible to participate in the study.

          -  The decision to prescribe Torisel will necessarily precede and will be independent of
             the decision to enroll the patient into the study.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with conditions that are contraindicated with Torisel based on the approved
             local product document in the Philippines will be excluded in this study. This
