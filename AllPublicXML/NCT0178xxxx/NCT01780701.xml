  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prostate cancer diagnosis starts a list of events that often leads to fast-moving
      treatment, thought by many to result in vast over-treatment of this disease. So, discovery of
      different diagnostic methods that allow clinicians to identify slow-growing from potentially
      fast-growing disease prior to or at the time of prostate biopsy could result in early and
      suitable treatment for men at greatest risk, while greatly decreasing the number of biopsies,
      surgical procedures, hormonal and chemotherapeutic treatments, cost, and patient worry, for
      those with more slow-growing disease.
