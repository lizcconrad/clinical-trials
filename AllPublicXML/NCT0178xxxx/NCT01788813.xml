  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effects on the immune system of
      treatment with GSK2245035 in subjects who suffer from nasal symptoms caused by an allergy to
      pollen or perennial allergen, with or without mild asthma. In addition, the effect of
      treatment with GSK2245035 on the body's allergic response in test situations will be
      explored. Approximately 28 subjects will receive GSK2245035 (up to 14 subjects each receiving
      80 nanograms [ng] GSK2245035 and up to 14 subjects each receiving 20 ng GSK2245035) and 14
      subjects will receive the dummy drug (placebo) during the study. Assignment of a subject to
      GSK2245035 or placebo will be done by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the subjects nor
      the clinic staff will know whether a subject is being dosed with GSK2245035 or placebo during
      the course of the study. The study will include (a) Screening phase where the eligibility of
      subjects for enrolment will be assessed (b) Treatment phase during which subjects will
      receive either 8 nasal sprays of GSK2245035 80 ng or a matching placebo once weekly for 8
      weeks (each dose will be split between the two nostrils). Subjects participating in this
      study in 2014 will receive a reduced dose of 20 ng i.n. of GSK2245035 once weekly for eight
      administrations (c) Follow-up period where any GSK2245035 induced changes to the immune
      system and the effect of treatment on the body's allergic response in test situations will be
      monitored. The maximum planned study duration for all subjects, including the screening,
      treatment and follow-up periods, is approximately 180 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Good general health, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based
             on a medical evaluation, including medical history, physical examination, laboratory
             tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be
             included only if the investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures

          -  Body weight &gt;=45 kilograms (kg)

          -  History of symptomatic pollen- or perennial allergen- driven allergic rhinitis with or
             without mild asthma (with a clear link between exposure to allergen and development of
             symptoms) for more than 2 years

          -  Positive skin allergy test (wheal &gt;=3 mm[millimeters]) or serum allergen-specific
             Immunoglobulin E (IgE) (&gt;=class 2) for perennial allergens and/or pollen allergens,
             relevant to the area of the research unit, within a year from the study start

          -  Positive screening nasal allergen challenge, defined by a Total nasal symptoms score
             (TNSS) response of &gt;=5 (on a 12 point scale) and a decrease in Peak Nasal Inspiratory
             Flow (PNIF) of &gt;30%

          -  Males and non-pregnant or non-lactating females between 18 and 65 years of age
             inclusive at the time of signing the consent form

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential,
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy, or
             postmenopausal, defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases
             a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 million
             international units (MIU)/mL and estradiol &lt;40 picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomoles
             (pmol)/liter (L) is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of child-bearing potential and
             has a negative early pregnancy test at screening, confirmed menses and/or a negative
             early pregnancy test within 10 days prior to the first dosing visit, a negative early
             pregnancy test before each dosing and agrees: to use one of the required contraception
             methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% starting at least 2 weeks prior to the start of
             dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. The subject must
             agree to use contraception until four days after the last dosing; or has only same-sex
             partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods: Condom plus partner use of a required highly effective
             contraceptive (with a failure rate of &lt;1%); or Abstinence, defined as sexual
             inactivity consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. This criterion must be
             followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until four days after the
             last dosing

             and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) medical monitor may pose additional risk factors

          -  Nasal conditions that according to the opinion of the investigator may affect the
             outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal perforation, nasal polyps, other nasal
             malformations or history of frequent nosebleeds

          -  Respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to the first dosing

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days prior to first dosing and
             throughout the treatment and follow-up period unless in the opinion of the
             investigator and/or GSK medical monitor the medication will not interfere with the
             study procedures or compromise subject safety. Acetaminophen is an exception and will
             be permitted at daily doses of up to 2 g from screening to follow-up. Approved
             contraceptives and pre-approved medications as specified in the protocol are also

             they have previously disclosed the use of a prescription drug that could cause a
             positive drug screen that according to the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor will not pose any safety risks to the subject and will not compromise the
             study (b) Subjects with a positive marijuana (THC) screen may be entered into the
             study at the investigator's discretion but all pre-dose drug screens must be negative
             (c) Subjects with a positive alcohol screen may have this test repeated at a
             subsequent screening visit but all pre-dose alcohol screens must be negative.
