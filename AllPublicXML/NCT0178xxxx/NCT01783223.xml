      This study is intended to evaluate the prevalence of chronically inebriated patients in the
      Emergeny Department (ED). Patients will be identified prospectively by screening all patients
      (24/7) presenting to the ED for one month. A running tally of all patients in the ED will be
      kept. Of these patients, any patient that is noted to have alcohol intoxication will be
      identified. The chart of that patient will be reviewed for details about the patient's
      alcohol use and for the patient's suitability for a sobering house, which is a place where
      intoxicated patients can go to await sobriety. The chart will also be reviewed for the number
      of previous visits for alcohol use to our hospital ever and in the last year.
