  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether young children receiving Vitamin A and
      Zinc supplements will have a lower incidence of symptomatic malaria than similar children
      receiving vitamin A supplements alone.

      The aim of our study was to determine the impact of the combination of vitamin A and zinc
      supplements on malaria morbidity in young children. The primary objective was to determine
      the effect of vitamin A alone vs. vitamin A and zinc supplements on the incidence of clinical
      malaria. The specific objectives were to determine the effect of vitamin A alone vs. vitamin
      A and zinc supplements on changes in anthropometric measurements specifically weight and
      length/height and to assess the effect of the study interventions on the incidence of anemia,
      diarrhea and pneumonia. It also assessed the tolerability of the supplements and determined
      the change in zinc status by measuring plasma zinc concentration using atomic absorption
      spectrometry before and at the end of the intervention. The study also determined the change
      in vitamin A status as assessed by the modified relative dose response (MRDR) test during and
      at the end of the intervention.
