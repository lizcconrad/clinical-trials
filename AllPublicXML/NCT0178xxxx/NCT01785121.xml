  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to determine the effectiveness of structured access to a Wii game
      computer compared to motivational support only in heart failure patients on exercise capacity
      and daily activity. Secondly, to determine the effectiveness of structured access to a Wii
      game computer compared to motivational support only in heart failure patients on the combined
      endpoint of death, readmission and quality of life.

      The following research questions will be addressed:

        -  What is the effectiveness of structured introduction and access to a Wii game computer
           in patients with heart failure to improve their exercise capacity compared to patients
           with heart failure in a control group who only receive motivational support?

        -  What is the effectiveness of structured introduction and access to a Wii game computer
           in patients with heart failure compared to patients with heart failure in a control
           group who only receive motivational support to increase their daily physical activity,
           decrease health care use and improve quality of life?

        -  What are experiences of heart failure patients and how is their exercise motivation when
           they are introduced and instructed to play with a Wii game computer?

      Substudy

      HF-WII PLUS MEDIYOGA

      In this substudy Medical Yoga will be tested in a randomized group next to the Wii and the
      control group in the HF-Wii study and therefore the substudy will be called HF-Wii plus
      MediYoga.

      In addition to the usual treatment and information about rehabilitation and daily activities
      for heart failure patients, this group will train a 60-minute yoga class twice a week.
      Patients will sit on chairs or yoga mats to perform yoga. Each patient will perform a total
      of 20-24 sessions over a 12-weeks period. A session will include 10 min warm-up and breathing
      exercises, 40 minutes of yoga postures and finally 10 min relaxation and meditation. At the
      end of each session, participants have the opportunity to discuss their experiences or
      questions. At the first visit, participants will receive a CD and a booklet with yoga
      postures and instructions. Patients are encouraged to train Medi Yoga at home with a target
      of one session a day. All yoga sessions will be conducted by a certified Medicare Yoga
      instructor.
