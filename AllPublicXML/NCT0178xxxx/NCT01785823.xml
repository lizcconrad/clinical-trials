  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We investigated the efficacy and the safety of the pharmacokinetic model-based
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) regimens of fentanyl for postoperative analgesia after
      total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA).

    <textblock>
      Infusions of fentanyl (2 ml/hr of diluent was equivalent with 0.5 μg/kg/hr of fentanyl) were
      maintained at the fixed-rate of 2 ml/hr until the postoperative 24 hr, or at the decremental
      rates of 6.0 ml/hr or 8.0 ml/hr during 1 hr, 4.0 ml/hr during 1~3 hr and 2.0 ml/hr during
      3~24 hr, postoperatively.
