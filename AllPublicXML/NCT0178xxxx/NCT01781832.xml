  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary bladder fibrosis (thickening and scarring) is fairly uncommon in children.
      Traditionally, the presence of urinary bladder fibrosis has been confirmed directly with
      bladder biopsy or using urodynamic testing. In this study we will use ultrasound scanning and
      ARFI (acoustic radiation force impulse) wave velocities to potentially identify any urinary
      bladder wall fibrosis.

      Urinary bladder fibrosis (thickening and scarring) is fairly uncommon in children.
      Traditionally, the presence of urinary bladder fibrosis has been confirmed directly with
      bladder biopsy or using urodynamic testing.

      We will use ultrasound ARFI (acoustic radiation force impulse)-derived shear wave velocities
      to potentially identify the presence of urinary bladder wall fibrosis. We hypothesize that
      shear wave velocities found within the bladder wall will increase with increasing evidence of
      fibrosis.

    <description>Shear Wave Velocity, VITQ, or Virtual Touch Tissue Imaging quantification is a color 2D method for measuring a tissues's stiffness. A color image (elastogram) of stiffness is acquired using this method. Then, one or more regions of interest can be placed in the area of interest on the elastogram. VITQ regions of interest are smaller than those used by VTQ.</description>

    <description>This is an ultrasound-based new technique using Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI). Shear Wave speeds are derived using ARFI.
During ultrasound scanning a sound wave is sent towards tissue. The tissue's movement in response to the wave is measured in Shear Wave Velocity, which can estimate tissue stiffness. This technique may help detect bladder wall thickness and fibrosis (thickening) in the urinary bladder of pediatric patients.</description>

          <description>Subjects were pediatric patients scheduled to have a test on their bladder called CMG (cystometrogram). CMG is an invasive test that requires insertion of a catheter (tube) into the bladder.
The patients agreed to have a research ultrasound (US) of their bladder. The US included a technique called elastography, which uses sound waves to measure the stiffness of tissue.</description>

          <title>(ARFI)-Derived Shear Wave Velocities</title>
          <description>This is an ultrasound-based new technique using Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI)-Derived Shear Wave Velocity Imaging. This will aid in detecting bladder wall thickness and fibrosis in the urinary bladder of pediatric patients.
ARFI-Derived Shear Wave Velocities: An ultrasound based scan using acoustic radiation force impulse-derived shear wave velocities to obtain images of the urinary bladder. The research ultrasound scan will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete.</description>
