    <textblock>
      This Post-Marketing Observational Study (PMOS) was conducted to assess the effectiveness of
      adalimumab on reducing synovitis (inflammation of the synovial membrane, which lines movable
      synovial joints, such as shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, and hips) in adult participants
      with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in Egypt. B-mode ultrasonography data was collected from
      participants receiving adalimumab treatment who had not been treated with any other
      anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy in the past.

    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, observational, single arm, multicenter study. Participants were
      treated with adalimumab in accordance with usual clinical care practices and local marketing
      authorization requirements. A total of 5 visits were planned: Baseline (Visit 1), Visits 2,
      3, 4 and 5 (Week 13). The time interval between the baseline visit and the second visit was
      approximately 2-3 weeks, with a window of one week. Additional study objectives were to
      investigate the rate of RA progression via changes in the B-mode ultrasonography assessment
      score over time as well as changes in the number of joints with erosion over time. The study
      was terminated due to low enrollment.

    <description>Synovitis was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none, 1=minor, 2=moderate, and 3=major presence). The sum of the scores of all 12 joints (elbow, wrist, second metacarpal (MCP), third MCP, knee and ankle) on both left and right sides is the ultrasonography assessment score, with a score range of 0-36.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) to 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a participant-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement. Due to an error, HAQ data was not collected at 13 weeks.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a participant-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement. Due to an error, HAQ data was not collected at 13 weeks.</description>
