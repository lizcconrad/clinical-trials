    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to determine safety, tolerability and feasibility of
      bilateral carotid body resection in patients with systolic heart failure and peripheral
      chemoreceptor hypersensitivity. The secondary aim is to assess potential efficacy of
      bilateral carotid body resection.
