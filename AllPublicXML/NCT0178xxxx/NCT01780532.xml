    <textblock>
      After locating the suspicious lesion/mass with standard of care mammography and/or
      ultrasound, a photoacoustic scan will be performed in the breast where the lesion is located.
      After the PA scan a biopsy will be performed, if clinically indicated (based on the mammogram
      and ultrasound only).
