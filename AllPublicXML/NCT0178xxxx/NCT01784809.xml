  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study addresses a significant public health threat of Human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among drug involved women on
      probation, parole or other community supervision. This randomized controlled trial aims to
      test the efficacy of a multimedia version of a 4-session, gender-specific, integrated drug
      use and HIV/STI prevention intervention (Multimedia Women On the Road To Health (WORTH)) in
      increasing condom use and decreasing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
      among 420 drug-involved, female offenders in a large community court setting in New York
      City, compared to a non-media version of the same intervention (Traditional WORTH) and to a
      4-session Wellness Promotion condition.

    <textblock>
      While it is clear that women inmates in jails and prisons bear a high burden of Human
      immunodeficiency virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), the effective
      development of prevention interventions for this high-risk group require an understanding of
      HIV risk context, sexual behaviors and attitudes for women while they are still in the
      community and before they become heavily involved in the criminal justice system. HIV
      prevention interventions must focus on women at early points of entry into the criminal
      justice system, when they are still in the community and at higher risk of engaging in unsafe
      sex and drug behaviors. This study focuses on a population of drug-involved women who have
      been arrested and given a court sanction, but are still living in the community.

    <description>The Multimedia WORTH intervention features the same core elements as the original version, but these core elements are translated into interactive tools and culturally tailored video vignettes designed to enhance group learning and individualized feedback. Participants will interact with Multimedia WORTH at two levels: (1) group materials will be delivered via computer projection onto a screen and (2) participants will complete individual activities and create journal logs tracking their progress on personalized goals on their personal user accounts using laptop computers. The computer multimedia support tool includes text, imagery, animations, audio and video in a format that guide the facilitator's delivery of the intervention. ***To view pilot features of the Multimedia WORTH intervention in development, please visit the following web address:

    <description>The basic format of each WORTH session remains consistent following a sequence of 5 steps: (1) an opening (quote, song, poem) which will provide a brief culturally relevant point of inspiration to engage participants (2) Check-in to review material from the previous session, and to discuss any incidents where participants engaged in risk behaviors and to acknowledge positive ways in which women used new skills to avoid HIV risk; (3) a discussion to raise awareness of links between IPV, drug-related activities, and HIV risks; (4) a skills-building component relevant to the discussion; and (5) review and update participant needs, homework assigned for skills-building at home, and a closing ritual. The WORTH intervention consists of four 2-hour group sessions that are led by a female facilitator.</description>
