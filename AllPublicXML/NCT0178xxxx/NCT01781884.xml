  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical study.
      All groups will receive standard intensive diabetes treatment with insulin and life style
      management. 60 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo or
      different dosage of GABA.

      GABA is an amino acid produced from glutamate by glutamic acid decarboxylase. It was approved
      for the treatment of hepatic coma, fibromyalgia, ataxia in China and is widely used as
      supplement for the treatment of epilepsy, insomnia, stress and tobacco dependence. It has
      been recently shown that GABA can prevent and reverse the development of diabetes in type 1
      mice models. Participants will receive placebo or GABA for 52 weeks.

      The study will consist of 4 weeks screening period, 2 weeks run-in period, 52 weeks treatment
      period and 4 weeks follow-up period. Enrollment is expected to occur over 2 years.

      To assess the efficacy and safety of GABA for the treatment of juvenile type 1 diabetes in
      new onset subjects.

      Primary Outcome:

      The primary statistical hypothesis to be assessed in this study is whether the mean C-peptide
      value for study subjects receiving GABA differs significantly from the mean value for placebo
      subjects assessed at follow-up.

      Secondary Outcome:

      The study will examine the HbA1C and the daily dosage of insulin (units/kg).

      Exploratory Endpoint:

      The study will assess the effects of treatment on inflammatory markers and immunological
      outcomes.

      Major Inclusion Criteria:

      Type 1 diabetes within past 6 months Age 5-21 years* At least one diabetes associated
      autoantibody
