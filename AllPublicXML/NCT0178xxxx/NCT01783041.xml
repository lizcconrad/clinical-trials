  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are vulnerable to brain injury, nutritional deficiencies and poor early
      growth which places them at increased risk for developmental problems later in life. The
      micronutrient carnitine, which is present in breast milk and stored in the fetus late in
      pregnancy, has been shown to protect against brain injury in animal studies. Without
      supplementation, almost all preterm infants develop carnitine deficiency soon after birth.
      Thus it is important to determine if carnitine supplementation protects against brain injury
      and improves developmental outcomes in these vulnerable preterm infants. We hypothesize that
      preterm infants supplemented early with L-carnitine while receiving parenteral nutrition will
      not develop carnitine deficiency and will have improved growth in the first two weeks of life
      and higher scores on developmental tests when compared to control infants who did not receive
      carnitine.
