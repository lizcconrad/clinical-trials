      AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of an innovative exercise program (EP) for
      patients during treatment for gastrointestinal tumors, breast and non small cells lung
      cancer, in terms of improved quality of life (QOL), fatigue and functional capacity respect
      the usual standard treatment (ST). DESIGN: Pragmatic randomized clinical trial in two
      parallel groups: EP and ST. SETTING: 7 Primary Health Centers (PHC) of the redIAPPISCIII, in
      coordination with oncology services. PARTICIPANTS: 250 patients with the above tumors,
      locally advanced or with metastatic disease, in adjuvant treatment, with Performance
      Status(PS) PS1-PS0. INTERVENTION: Both groups received standardized usual care. The EP group
      will receive, in addition, a nurse supervised exercise program for 2 months in the PHC and a
      second phase in community facilities during the remaining 10 months. MEASUREMENTS: The
      primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in the QOL+66 treatment, as measured by
      the specific questionnaire for patients with cancer EORTC QLQ-C-30 and Short Form(SF-36)
      overall. Secondary: fatigue (FACIT-F), radiological response, functional capacity (6 minutes
      walking and cardiopulmonary test), muscle strength and progression-free survival and overall.
      Predictors and confounders: age, sex, stage and tumor type, histology, treatment. ANALYSIS:
      We will compare between groups mean changes from baseline measurement of quality of life
      questionnaire (QOL) and other variables, on an intention to treat basis, using longitudinal
      mixed-effects models for repeated measures at 2, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Cost /
      effectiveness and cost / incremental utility associated to the program wil be estimated.
