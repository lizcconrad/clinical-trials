    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation is to determine whether the use of painPREMIER will
      significantly improve function in patients with low back pain in an occupational health
      clinical setting. painPREMIER is a tool that assists clinicians in the accurate diagnosis of
      back pain and associated problems in order to treat them most effectively.

      Patients presenting at feeder sites to be referred to low back pain clinic and assessed for
      eligibility A decision was made to terminate this study on 09 OCT 2013. The study was
      terminated for operational/business reasons. This study was not terminated for reasons of
      safety or efficacy.
