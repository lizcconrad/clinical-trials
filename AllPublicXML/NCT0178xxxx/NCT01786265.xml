  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with hormone therapy in
      combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone for 8 months controls the disease better
      than treatment with standard hormone therapy alone.

      Abiraterone acetate is designed to decrease the production of testosterone (male sex
      hormones), which plays a role in causing prostate cancer to grow.

      Prednisone is commonly used to treat prostate cancer and is given along with abiraterone
      acetate treatment to help lower or prevent some side effects.

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned
      (like the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being assigned
      to each group.

      If you are in Group 1, you will receive standard of care hormonal therapy. The study doctor
      will decide what hormone therapy you will receive and will explain when and how you should
      take the hormone therapy and any risks.

      If you are in Group 2, you will also receive standard of care hormone therapy. In addition,
      you will take 4 abiraterone acetate tablets by mouth each day at least 2 hours before a meal
      and 1 hour after a meal. You will also take prednisone every day.

      About every 28-days is considered a &quot;cycle.&quot; You should return all unused study drug and/or
      empty pill bottles at the end of each cycle.

      Study Visits for Group 1:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 5, 9 and every odd cycle after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments
           you may be receiving.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function and your PSA and testosterone levels. Before the Cycle 5 blood draw only, you
           must fast overnight and in the morning for at least 8 hours before your visit.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests, to check your liver function and your PSA levels. On Cycles 3 and 7, this
      blood will also be used to check your testosterone levels. These tests may be done at a local
      facility and results faxed to MD Anderson.

      Study Visits for Group 2:

      Every 2 weeks (for the first 12 weeks), blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn to test
      your liver function. This may be done at a local facility and results faxed to MD Anderson.

      On Day 1 of Odd Cycles (1, 3, 5, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments
           you may be receiving.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function and your PSA and testosterone levels. Before the Cycle 5 blood draw only, you
           must fast overnight and in the morning for at least 8 hours before your visit.

      On Day 1 of Even Cycles (2, 4, 6, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments
           you may be receiving.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function and your PSA levels.

      These study visits may be done at a local physician's office and results faxed to MD
      Anderson.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive the study drugs for up to 8 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the
      study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable
      to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End of Treatment Visit:

      When you are no longer taking the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments
           you may be receiving.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function, and to check your PSA and your testosterone level. You must fast overnight and
           in the morning for at least 8 hours before your visit.

        -  You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease

        -  You will have a CT scans to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test your PSA and testosterone
      levels. This may be done at your local local facility and the results faxed to MD Anderson.

      Every 6 months:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function, your PSA level and your testosterone level.

      The follow-up visits will continue as long as the disease is stable.

      Crossover Study Phase:

      If the disease gets worse while you are on study, you will be eligible for the extension
      phase. If you received hormone therapy alone, you will be treated with the combination of
      hormones and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for 8 months. If you received the
      combination therapy, you will receive hormone therapy alone.

      If you crossover to the other treatment group on this study, the schedule for visits in the
      extension study will be identical to the schedule described above.

      This is an investigational study. Abiraterone acetate is FDA approved in combination with
      prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel. Prednisone is FDA approved and
      commercially available as a corticosteroid. The use of hormone therapy in combination with
      abiraterone and prednisone in patients with prostate cancer is investigational.

      Up to 310 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 310 patients will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.
