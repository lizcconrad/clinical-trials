  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this study is to validate the venous blood oxygenation measurements of the
      Mespere VA Oximeter compared to the saturations measured by venous blood sampling through an
      inserted central vein catheter, which is currently the standard of care for measuring SvO2

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The conventional bedside pulse oximeter has been a standard in clinical care for non-invasive
      hemodynamic monitoring and measures arterial blood oxygenation. To date, a non-invasive
      bedside monitor for measuring mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) has not been developed.
      The clinical applications of venous oximetry are numerous and include management of severe
      sepsis and septic shock, trauma and hemorrhagic shock, heart failure and cardiac arrest.

      The existing method for venous blood oxygenation monitored is either through an invasive
      fiber optic catheter, or intermittently by blood sampling through a central venous catheter
      Oximetry. However, SvO2 measurements using fiber optic catheters are very expensive, and all
      central line insertions include inherent risks. Also, insertion of a central line is in some
      circumstances not feasible (e.g. discomfort/limited experience in central line insertion,
      unavailability of specific monitoring systems etc.) resulting in inappropriate therapy
      usually guided by SvO2. Therefore, a non-invasive monitor to measure SvO2 at the bedside
      negating the requirement for a central line insertion would be of clinical benefit and allow
      appropriate therapy of many patients listed above at a time when therapy has the most
      benefit.

      The Mespere VA Oximeter is a non-invasive medical device for monitoring of venous blood
      oxygenation.

      Continuous measurement of venous oxygenation will be beneficial because it will help the
      physician better understand local ischemia as well as provide better guidance for the
      physician to be able to best treat the patient and decrease their burden of illness.

        Study subjects will consist of patients admitted either to the Medical Surgical ICU or the
        Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit at University Hospital. The four groups will comprise
        patients with the following diagnoses: i) sepsis +/- septic shock, ii) post cardiac surgery
        low output syndrome requiring inotropic/vasopressor therapy, iii) cardiogenic shock post
        myocardial infarction, and iv) hypoxemic respiratory failure.
