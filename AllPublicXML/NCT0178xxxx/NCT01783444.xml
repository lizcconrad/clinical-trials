      This study will assess the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus and capecitabine
      monotherapies compared to everolimus/exemestane combination in woman with ER + advanced
      breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm, randomized, open label, multi-center phase II study investigating the
      combination of everolimus (10mg daily) with exemestane (25mg daily) versus everolimus (10mg
      daily) versus capecitabine (1250mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days, 3-week cycle) in patients with
      estrogen-receptor positive, HER2 negative, advanced breast cancer after recurrence or
      progression on letrozole or anastrozole. The reference therapy (control arm) used in the
      course of this trial is the combination arm of everolimus plus exemestane. The
      investigational therapies in the context of this study are everolimus monotherapy and
      capecitabine monotherapy. All treatments will be taken orally until disease progression,
      intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of patient's informed consent. Patients will be randomly
      assigned with equal allocation to one of the treatment arms:

        1. Exemestane (25mg daily) in combination with everolimus (10mg daily)

        2. Everolimus (10mg daily)

        3. Capecitabine (1250mg/m2 twice daily) orally for two weeks, followed by a one week rest
           period in 3-weeks cycles.

      Treatment assignment will be stratified by the presence of visceral disease (yes vs. no).
      Visceral refers to lung, liver, heart, ovary, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, malignant
      pleural or pericardial effusion or malignant ascites.
