    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the rate of absorption and bioavailability of
      fentanyl 400 µg sublingual spray, Actiq® 400 µg transmucosally, and fentanyl citrate
      injection 100 µg intravenously.

    <textblock>
      This was a Phase I, single-dose, open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-treatment cross over
      study in which 21 healthy subjects received single doses of fentanyl 400 µg sublingual spray,
      Actiq® 400 µg transmucosally, and fentanyl citrate injection 100 µg intravenously following a
      10-hour overnight fast. There was a 7 day washout period between treatments.
