      The study will involve an eighteen-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel designed
      comparison between add-on topiramate and add-on placebo to stable treatment with amatadine in
      the treatment of PD patients who continue to have dyskinesia on amantadine.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 10 and week 14 performed by blinded rater</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) will be the primary outcome measure for this study. This choice is based on the outcome of the MJFF-funded Validation of Dyskinesia Rating Scales study. In this study, the UDysRS was identified as the most sensitive scale to detect change in dyskinesia in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of amatadine. The UDysRS utilizes rater information, patient self-report and objective measures of dyskinesia to provide assessments of impairment and disability due to dyskinesia.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Parkinson's disease patient, defined by UK Brain Bank criteria

          2. Current age between 30-90

          3. Clinically pertinent dyskinesias defined by CGI-s score (see attachment) &gt; 3 (mild)
             established by clinician's total assessment of patient including objective observation
             during the screening process. *

          4. Stable doses of all antiparkinsonian medications for at least 4 weeks

          5. Stable treatment with at least 200 mg amantadine for at least 4 weeks.

          6. Presence of a caregiver willing to participate in the study

          7. In the opinion of the enrolling investigator, the subject will be able to maintain
             current dosing schedule of antiparkinsonian drugs for the duration of the trial.

          8. Subjects must be free of dementia, depression and psychosis as determined by clinical
             examination.

          9. The subject must be willing to participate in all study related activities and visits.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any subjects with clinical evidence suggestive of an atypical or secondary form of
             Parkinson's Disease

          2. Any subject who, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, has a concomitant
             medical illness which would preclude them from being treated with amantadine,

          3. Any subject who, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, will be unable to
             maintain current stable dosing of their anti-parkinsonian medications for the duration
             of the trial,

          4. Any subject with evidence for dementia, depression, or psychosis, as determined by
             clinical examination.

          5. Any subject who has not signed informed consent, or unable or unwilling to participate
             in all of the study related activities.
