    <textblock>
      Premature infants are at risk of having pauses in breathing, or apneas, due to their
      immaturity. Premature infants are routinely given caffeine, a respiratory stimulant, on the
      first day of life to prevent apneas. However, if they continue to have apneas, they may
      require a breathing tube to be placed in the trachea. There are risks to having a breathing
      tube, so it would be beneficial to avoid it if possible. If caffeine is given earlier, it may
      decrease the need for a breathing tube. Some studies also suggest that caffeine may also
      improve heart function which may prevent low blood pressure if given early.

      This goal of this observational study is to compare the respiratory and acute hemodynamic
      effects of caffeine administered in the first 2 hours versus 12 hours of life in infants &lt;29
      weeks gestation. Our primary hypothesis is that caffeine administered in the first two hours
      of life can prevent the need for endotracheal intubation in the first 12 hours of life..
      These evaluations are critical in determining both the safety and efficacy of early caffeine
      therapy.

          <title>Intubation</title>
          <description>The primary aim of our study is to compare the respiratory effects of caffeine administered in the first 2 hours versus at 12 hours of life in infants &lt;29 weeks' gestation. Our primary hypothesis is that early caffeine administered (at &lt; 2 hours of life) can prevent the need for endotracheal intubation in the first 12 hours of life.</description>

            <description>Infants will receive a blinded dose of either placebo (IV normal saline) or IV caffeine citrate 20mg/kg infused over 15 minutes within the first 2 hours of life. If the infant is in the early caffeine group, the blinded drug will be IV caffeine citrate 20mg/kg in the first 2 hours and placebo at 12 hours of life.
Caffeine: Infants will receive a blinded dose of either placebo (IV normal saline) or IV caffeine citrate 20mg/kg infused over 10 minutes within the first 30 minutes of life. They will receive a blinded dose of the opposite of what they received in the DR (placebo or caffeine) at 6 hours of life. Therefore, the intervention is timing of initial caffeine dose.</description>
