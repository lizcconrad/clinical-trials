    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficacy of intravenously injected
      0.4% 13-C-Methacetin solution for the determination of liver function with the LiMAx-test on
      patients with partial liver resection. The LiMAx-test is compared with an untreated control
      group and post-surgical management of both groups is investigated.
