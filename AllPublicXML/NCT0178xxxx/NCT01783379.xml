    <textblock>
      In this trial, our goal is to determine the pharmacokinetics of micafungin in a non-selected
      cohort of patients with suspected or proven invasive fungal infections. Patients will receive
      micafungin for the period necessary to achieve clinical and / or mycological cure. An attempt
      will be made to have 2 PK curves, one full and one limited sampling on days 3 (n=9) and 7
      (n=5). Furthermore, we will be able to determine intra-individual variability. On non-PK
      days, trough samples will be taken to determine the time to steady state. All samples will be
      taken just prior to the morning dose of micafungin. All infusion rates will be according to
      the SPC label information. Patients are considered to be evaluable if at least the first PK
      curve has been completed. Two moments of PK analysis will enable us to determine whether
      there is an increase over time in exposure if steady state has not been reached.

      Whilst micafungin (Mycamine®) has much to offer, little is known about its pharmacokinetic
      profile in ICU patients with specific co-morbidities such as obesity, hypoalbumenia, and
      severe liverfunction disturbances. Also, ICU patients are known to experience changes in
      pharmacokinetics (PK) due to changes in hemodynamics, extracorporeal elimination techniques,
      interacting comedication, etc. Based on criteria outlined below, micafungin may prove to be
      the drug of choice in this cohort of patients. Therefore it seems prudent to conduct a trial
      in a cohort of patients who receive micafungin but with co-variates that may be of influence
      to the pharmacokinetic profile. To build a valid pharmacokinetic model, all patients on
      micafungin will be included in the analysis and used for model building. Co-variates that
      will be explored are at least: obesitas, liverfunction, albumin, creatinin-clearance.
      Simulations will be performed to determine if adequate exposure is reached under different
      patho-physiological conditions.

      In conclusion: this trial is on determining the PK of micafungin in a non-selected cohort of
      patients with suspected or proven invasive fungal infections. Most important covariates will
      be modelled using advanced mathematical techniques. Micafungin may prove to be beneficial
      over the other two echinocandins in terms of limited factors that impact PK. This has to be
      proven in a prospective trial.

        All patients receiving micafungin for the treatment or suspicion of an invasive fungal
        infection will be included. At least 20 patients will be included to obtain 16 evaluable
        patients. If recruitment of 20 patients is achieved within one year, more patients can be
        included. A formal sample size cannot be performed for several reasons but the sample size
        is rather based on the general assumption that 16 patients are sufficient to have a
        descriptive PK approach.
