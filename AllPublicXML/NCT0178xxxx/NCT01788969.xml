    <textblock>
      The manifestation of weakness and involuntary reflexes following motor incomplete spinal cord
      injury (SCI) may be partly a result of damage to descending pathways to the spinal cord that
      release serotonin. In models of SCI, for example, application of agents that simulate
      serotonin has been shown to modulate voluntary motor behaviors, including augmentation of
      walking recovery. In humans following neurological injury, the effects of 5HT agents are
      unclear. Few previous reports indicate improved motor function following administration of
      agents which enhance the available serotonin in the brain, although some data suggests that
      decreased serotonin may be beneficial. In this application, the investigators propose to
      study the effects of clinically used agents that increase or decrease intrinsic serotonin
      activity in the brain on strength and walking ability following human motor incomplete SCI.
      Using detailed electrophysiological recordings, and biomechanical and behavioral measures,
      the investigators will determine the effects of acute or chronic doses of these drugs on
      voluntary and involuntary motor behaviors during static and dynamic conditions. The novelty
      of this proposed research is the expectation that agents that enhance serotonin activity may
      increase abnormal reflexes in SCI, but simultaneously facilitate motor and walking recovery.
      Despite potential improvements in voluntary function, the use of pharmacological agents that
      may enhance spastic motor behaviors following SCI is in marked contrast to the way in which
      drugs are typically used in the clinical setting.

      The proposed study will consist of a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial using a
      crossover design to assess the effects of SSRIs (escitalopram oxalate, Lexapro速, Forest
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc) and 5HT-antagonists (cyproheptadine [CYPRO], Periactin 速, Merck, Inc)
      on volitional and spastic motor behaviors in subjects with motor incomplete SCI following
      both acute and chronic medication delivery. Voluntary and reflexive motor behaviors in 120
      subjects with SCI will be assessed. These interventions will be applied to individuals with
      acute (&lt; 6 months post injury) chronic (&gt; 1 year post injury) motor incomplete SCI to
      determine both the rate and extent of changes in volitional motor performance and involuntary
      spastic behaviors. For the training portion of the study (referred to as subproject 2 below),
      a portion of the acute and chronic subjects will be evaluated every 2 weeks for up to16 weeks
      and participate in locomotor training, to investigate and better understand changes in motor
      function and recovery in individuals with spinal cord injuries. Following 2-4 weeks of this
      training, individuals will be given either the study drug, or placebo and continue evaluation
      and training. Following an additional 4 weeks, subjects will be given either the placebo or
      study drug (whichever they did not receive during the prior 4 weeks). The order will be
      randomized.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age of subjects between 18 and 65 years of age, due to the effects of greater age on

          -  medically stable with medical clearance from the subject's primary internist or
             physiatrist to participate;

          -  level of the lesion between C5-T10 spinal cord level due to non-progressive etiology;

          -  &lt;6 months or &gt;1 yr since initial injury. Range of motion requirements include: ankle
             dorsiflexion ankle to 10 degrees and plantarflexion to 30 degrees, knee flexion from 0

          -  women of childbearing potential will not be excluded, although women who are pregnant
             will be excluded due to the lack of proven safety of pharmacological agents in
             pregnant women

          -  cranial stimulation exclusions: history of epilepsy or a seizure event, metal implants
             in the head or face, unexplained and recurring headaches, skull abnormalities or

             preliminary screening tool (Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale)
             will be administered to all patients. Scores &gt; 16 indicate symptoms of depression. For
             those patients, a physician will be required to evaluate the subject to determine
             eligibility.
