    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is the most common inflammatory skin disorder
      of children, affecting 10-20% of children and 1-2% of adults.

      This skin disorder can be associated with unbearable itchiness and an increased
      susceptibility to skin infections. The cause of AD is currently poorly understood; therefore,
      there are no targeted treatment options at present. There have been recent studies in adults
      with AD that explain the cause and give us new routes to investigate treatment options,
      however no major studies in this arena have been done in children. We hope to evaluate the
      skin and blood biomarkers that are found in pediatric AD and compare them to adult AD.

      Hypothesis: The immune system worsens the skin barrier issues that are common in atopic
      dermatitis. We believe there are similar immune and skin abnormalities in adult versus
      pediatric atopic dermatitis. Finally, blood levels of the activated molecules in atopic
      dermatitis can serve as surrogates for skin immune activation and will correlate with disease
      severity.

      Objectives:

        1. To define the cellular and molecular biomarkers of atopic dermatitis in skin biopsies
           and blood samples from a pre-adolescent pediatric population and correlate it with
           disease severity.

        2. To measure the skin barrier in atopic dermatitis.

        3. To determine quality of life in atopic dermatitis through various questionnaires.

        Subjects will be recruited at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago
        Division of Dermatology outpatient clinics.

          -  100 children with mild to severe AD, 100 aged-matched and sex-matched healthy (no
             evidence of atopy) controls, 100 aged-matched and sex-matched controls with an atopic
             condition (allergic rhinitis or asthma) but no history of atopic dermatitis will be
             enrolled to obtain blood samples.

          -  AD subjects between the ages of 0 months to 4 years of age will be asked to give
             buccal (cheek) swabs to test for a mutation in filaggrin, a common skin protein.

          -  70 children with mild to severe atopic dermatitis, and 70 age- and sex-matched (but
             not site-matched) healthy controls (no evidence of atopy), will be enrolled to obtain
             skin biopsies.

          -  30 children with atopic dermatitis and 30 age/sex matched non-atopic controls, who may
             or may not have participated in the aforementioned assessments, for imaging
             evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may be of either sex and must be between the ages of 0 months and 17 years at
             the time of enrollment (Healthy controls, atopic controls, and AD patients)

             asthma) but no history of atopic dermatitis

          -  All controls for skin sampling may have no observable abnormality in the sampled skin
             and, to further assure the normality of the &quot;normal&quot; skin edges, must not have
             evidence of inflammation or epidermal change in the lesion to be surgically removed
