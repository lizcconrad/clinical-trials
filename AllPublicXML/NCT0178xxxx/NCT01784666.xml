    <textblock>
      This study investigates the medication isradipine, which is currently approved by the FDA to
      treat high blood pressure, in the treatment of depression in bipolar disorder. Isradipine or
      placebo (contains no active medication) will be used as an &quot;add-on&quot; to lithium, valproate,
      and/or atypical antipsychotics for individuals currently experiencing a major depressive
      episode. Our hypothesis is that isradipine will be superior to placebo in improving
      depressive symptoms.

      Primary Aim: To estimate the antidepressant efficacy of isradipine versus placebo as an
      adjunct to lithium, valproate, and/or other atypical antipsychotics among individuals with
      bipolar I disorder in a nonpsychotic major depressive episode.

      Hypothesis: Isradipine will be superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms
      assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

    <description>The study uses the Sequential Parallel Comparison design (SPCD), with two 4-week phases: n=30 subjects are randomized 1:1 to isradipine versus placebo add-on for 4 weeks, with the placebo nonresponders re-randomized 1:1 for a further 4 weeks. The SPCD will allow us to pool data from both phases to estimate the isradipine treatment effect. Subjects who respond in phase 1, and all subjects who receive isradipine in phase 1, continue blinded treatment in phase 2 to preserve the blind, but only phase 1 results are analyzed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-65

          -  written informed consent

          -  meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) criteria (by Structured Clinical
             Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - IV -I/P (SCID)) for bipolar I
             disorder, current episode depressed

          -  Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS) score of at least 20 (i.e., moderate
             depression) and no greater than 34 (i.e., severe depression) at screen and baseline
             visit

          -  Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score &lt; 12 at screen and baseline visit

          -  currently treated with a lithium preparation (carbonate or citrate) at stable dose for
             at least 4 wks with level &gt;0.6 and &lt;1.0; and/or valproate at stable dose for at least
             4 wks at level &gt;60 and &lt;110; and/or other atypical antipsychotic at stable dose for at
             least 4 weeks (at least minimum FDA-labeled dose)

          -  Caucasian by self-report - please see discussion below

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychotic features in the current episode, as assessed by YMRS item #8 &gt; 6 [where

             excluding lithium/valproate/other atypical antipsychotic [response rates for these
             subjects is likely to be extremely low and would require a substantially larger-scale
             study to identify treatment effects]

             endocrine, neurological, or hematological disease, based on review of medical history,
             physical examination, and screening laboratory tests (this will include any clinical
             or laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism; if maintained on thyroid medication must be

          -  history of hypertension or current treatment for hypertension

          -  current use of isradipine or history of anaphylactic reaction or intolerance to
             isradipine or any component of the preparation

          -  ECG abnormalities at entry: prolonged QTC interval or complete or incomplete bundle
             branch block

          -  patients who have taken an investigational psychotropic drug within the last 3 months

        blockers; any other antihypertensive because of the risk of cause hypotension; any other
        drug known to interact with isradipine. Benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotic agents
        (e.g., zolpidem) may not be initiated after study entry; subjects requiring these agents
        will be removed from the study. Allowed: Sedative-hypnotic agents if dosage has been stable
        for 4 weeks prior to study entry; thyroid or estrogen replacement provided dosage has been
        stable for 3 months. Acceptable anticonvulsants include lamotrigine, valproate, gabapentin,
        topiramate, oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine.

Isradipine: The study uses the Sequential Parallel Comparison design (SPCD), with two 4-week phases: n=30 subjects are randomized 1:1 to isradipine versus placebo add-on for 4 weeks, with the placebo nonresponders re-randomized 1:1 for a further 4 weeks. The SPCD will allow us to pool data from both phases to estimate the isradipine treatment effect. Subjects who respond in phase 1, and all subjects who receive isradipine in phase 1, continue blinded treatment in phase 2 to preserve the blind, but only phase 1 results are analyzed.</description>
