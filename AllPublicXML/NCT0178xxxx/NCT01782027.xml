      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of radiolabeled particulate cholesterol
      administered intravenously in association with albumin, as a method to study reverse
      cholesterol transport (RCT) in people carrying mutations in genes known to affect high
      density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism by analyzing changes in the tracer activity in total
      plasma, lipoproteins fractions and feces.

      The study will use 3H-cholesterol bound to albumin (particulate cholesterol) to assess the
      ability of HDL to transport cholesterol from the periphery to the liver to be eliminated.
      This process is called reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and is one of the main mechanisms
      by which HDL protect against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mutations in some of the
      genes affecting HDL metabolism, may results in changes in RCT. The validation of a method
      assessing RCT is important for the development of new drugs which affect RCT and may result
      in useful treatments for atherosclerosis.

      Subjects carrying mutations in genes known to affect HDL metabolism and healthy controls will
      be enrolled in the study. Changes in the tracer activity in total plasma, lipoproteins
      fractions and feces will be analyzed following the intravenous administration of radiolabeled
      particulate cholesterol.

          2. Subjects must be:

               1. Carriers of functional mutations of genes encoding proteins affecting HDL
                  metabolism;

               2. Healthy control subjects with HDL cholesterol levels within the normal range of
                  the lab where screening tests are run, or at the discretion of the investigator,
                  and matched for gender, race, age (Â± 5 years) to the patients.

             child-bearing potential must be following a medically accepted form of contraception)

          4. Subjects must be able to comprehend and willing to provide a signed IRB approved
             Informed Consent Form.

          5. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with all study-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known cardiovascular disease, including coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, or
             peripheral vascular disease (control subjects only)

             (control subjects only).

          3. Any current, unstable endocrine disease as assessed by collection of medical history
