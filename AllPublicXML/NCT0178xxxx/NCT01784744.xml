  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The febrile hypothesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) stems from the observation that
      clinical symptoms improve during fever. This fever induced amelioration of symptoms could be
      due to one of three possible causes, (1) the direct effect of temperature; (2) a resulting
      change in the immune inflammatory system function associated with the infection or fever;
      and/or (3) and increase in the functionality of a previously dysfunctional Locus
      Coeruleus-Noradrenerigic (LC-NA) system. Little has been done to explore the potential direct
      effect an increased body temperature may have on autism symptomology. Parental reports have
      demonstrated that during febrile episodes children with ASD have improved social cognition
      and language skills, and decreased disruptive behaviors. In order to further explore the
      direct temperature effect, further investigation is needed, which the investigators propose
      below. The investigators propose to complete a one year double blind crossover study with 15
      children with ASD between the ages of 5 and 17 years old. Five children with ASD will
      complete a control protocol prior to beginning the full protocol with 10 additional ASD
      children. This will allow for any needed amendment of protocol parameters prior to completion
      of the full protocol.
