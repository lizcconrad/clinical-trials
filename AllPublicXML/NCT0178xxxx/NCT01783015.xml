  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first 12 weeks of this study will compare the efficacy of etanercept 50 mg once-weekly to
      placebo in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded well to infliximab or
      adalimumab plus methotrexate. This comparison will be performed for all subjects and
      separately for subjects who are anti-drug antibody positive for one of these medications.
      From week 12 to week 24, all subjects will receive etanercept 50 mg once-weekly. The effect
      of anti-drug antibody status on the efficacy of etanercept as well as the safety profile of
      etanercept in these subjects will also be evaluated throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Euro Quality of Life (Qol) EQ-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a participant-completed questionnaire designed to assess health related quality of life. There are 2 components to the EQ-5D: a Health State Profile and a VAS. For the Health State Profile, participants recorded their level of current health for 5 domains comprising a health profile: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Scores from the 5 domains may be used to calculate a single index value, also known as a utility score. On the VAS participants were asked to rate their current health on a scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 represented the &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; and 100 represented the &quot;best imaginable health state.&quot; In addition to a summary of mean changes, 1 categorical endpoint each based on EQ-5D utility score and 1 based on the VAS were derived and analyzed: EQ-5D utility score improvement ≥0.05 and EQ-5D VAS score &gt;82.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>In this 24 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (Period 1), 2 period study, a total of 20 participants were screened, out of which 16 participants were randomized. Due to delayed enrollment and an insufficient number of participants, recruitment was terminated.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eleven participants were randomly assigned to etanercept [ETN] and 5 participants to placebo in the blinded treatment period. A total of 11 participants (9 ETN treated and 2 placebo treated) completed the blinded treatment period and entered the open label treatment with ETN. One of the 2 placebo treated participants entered the Escape Arm.</pre_assignment_details>

Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered.

        <description>The EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a participant-completed questionnaire designed to assess health related quality of life. There are 2 components to the EQ-5D: a Health State Profile and a VAS. For the Health State Profile, participants recorded their level of current health for 5 domains comprising a health profile: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Scores from the 5 domains may be used to calculate a single index value, also known as a utility score. On the VAS participants were asked to rate their current health on a scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 represented the “worst imaginable health state” and 100 represented the “best imaginable health state.” In addition to a summary of mean changes, 1 categorical endpoint each based on EQ-5D utility score and 1 based on the VAS were derived and analyzed: EQ-5D utility score improvement ≥0.05 and EQ-5D VAS score &gt;82.</description>
