    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The purpose of the trial is to assess safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of liraglutide in obese
      adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years.

             and gender

          -  Fasting plasma glucose below 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) (central laboratory analysis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinically diagnosed secondary causes of childhood obesity such as
             chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. Turner syndrome), syndromic obesity (e.g. Prader Willi
             syndrome) or endocrinologic disorders (e.g. Cushing Syndrome)

          -  Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of bulimia

          -  Subjects with Tanner stage 1 development (prepubertal)

          -  Diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus as judged by the investigator

          -  Previous treatment with a GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) receptor agonists (e.g.
             exenatide or liraglutide or other), DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitors,
             orlistat or other weight lowering medication, any antipsychotic medication or systemic
             corticosteroids within the last 3 months

          -  Currently using or have used within 3 months before screening for this trial: any
             systemic treatment that in the opinion of the investigator interferes with PK
             (pharmacokinetic), PD (pharmacodynamic) and safety endpoints

          -  Surgical treatment for obesity

          -  Past or current chronic or idiopathic pancreatitis, or any of the following: -amylase

             (e.g. schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) that could in the opinion of the investigator
             interfere with trial compliance or subject safety

          -  Subjects with a history of suicide attempts or history of any suicidal behaviour
             within the past month before entry into the trial
