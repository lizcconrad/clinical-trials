      Orthodontic treatment is carried out by placing fixed attachments(brackets)on teeth with
      wires which run through them and create tooth movement. These metal brackets are bonded
      (glued) onto the tooth surface by a three step process. Firstly, a mild acid is used to
      roughen the tooth surface, secondly a free flowing glue (composite primer) is used to fill in
      the roughened pores and thirdly, the bracket is glued on to the tooth surface with a
      'composite' material which sets hard by exposure to a high intensity light.The success of
      this procedure is measured by bracket failure rates.

      The literature review suggests that the scientific evidence is not clear to indicate whether
      the use of a primer is absolutely essential to achieve acceptable bracket success rates in a
      clinical environment.

      The primary aim of the study is to find out if the rate of loss of orthodontic brackets is
      clinically acceptable when they are glued onto the tooth surface without the use of a primer
      as compared to brackets bonded with a primer over a 12 month study period. The investigators
      will also investigate the Bonding time,Type of bracket bond failure,length of treatment and
      Peer Assessment Rating scores (PAR)

      This RCT will be undertaken on consented NHS patients in 3 hospitals in Yorkshire region by
      multiple operators

      The results from this study will help improve our knowledge of the best approach to bonding
      metal brackets on teeth. If the bracket failure rate is similar in both groups, this would
      indicate that the use of a primer is not always necessary. For patients, this would mean
      lesser time required to place brackets at the start of orthodontic treatment. For clinicians
      and NHS purchasers the outcome will influence cost effectiveness (as the primer is the most
      expensive component in the bonding process) and provide a framework for future studies.

      AIMS OF THE TRIAL The primary aim of the trial is to find out if clinically acceptable
      bracket failure rates can be achieved when metal brackets (fixed brace attachments) are glued
      (bonded) to teeth without the use of a primer as compared to brackets glued with a
      conventional primer in adolescent and adult orthodontic patients over a 12 month study
      period.

      The other objectives are to determine if the gluing time per bracket is different between the
      groups and the type of glue failure at bracket-tooth interface using Adhesive Remnant Index.
      Length of treatment time and Peer Assessment Rating scores will also be analysed.

      HYPOTHESES The null hypothesis for the primary outcome is - &quot;there is no difference in the
      bracket failure rates when metal brackets are bonded with primer as compared to those which
      are bonded without a primer&quot;.

      The null hypotheses for the secondary outcomes are - &quot;there is no difference in the bonding
      time per bracket and the type of bond failure using Adhesive Remnant Index between the
      control and experimental group in this study.

      METHOD OF INVESTIGATION

        1. Sample population All patients referred to the Leeds Dental Institute/Seacroft hospital/
           St.Luke's hospital, Bradford who qualify for orthodontic treatment.

        2. Setting Patients treated in a dental teaching hospital and district NHS hospital setting

        3. Operator characteristics All patients will be treated from the start until the end of
           the study period by 6 operators of various experience (NHS specialist registrar at two
           sites − Leeds Dental Institute and St.Luke's Hospital, orthodontic therapists (SLH) and
           consultant orthodontists (SLH/LDI and Seacroft hospitals)

        4. Study design A multicentre single-blinded randomised controlled clinical trial in a NHS
           hospital setting. Individual patients will be allocated randomly to either the test or
           control group.

        5. Intervention Test group − Metal brackets will be bonded without a primer Control group −
           Metal brackets will be bonded with primer

        6. Methods to minimise bias - Randomisation and Blinding All consecutive patients who need
           fixed appliance treatment will be taken off the waiting list and no attempt will be made
           to match them for age, sex or malocclusion to ensure a representative sample, except for
           the exclusion criteria. After informed consent is obtained, they will be randomly
           allocated to either the control (with primer) or experimental (without primer) group.
           This will be done by preparing opaque numbered sealed envelopes in blocks of 10 in
           advance by the supervisor (NH) using random number tables. The supervisor will enroll
           the participants and assign them to their group using the sealed envelopes which blinds
           the two operators and participants to the assignment before enrollment. Once the
           envelopes are opened the blinding of the operators will be lost. The operators cannot be
           blinded in this trial as the intervention administered to the test group cannot be
           blinded. Treatment will be started on all patients within 3 months of the enrollment.

        7. Agreed start and end points Upper and lower teeth will be bonded when appropriate. If
           upper and lower teeth are bonded at separate visits, then the specific dates will be
           considered as the start point. The follow up period will be for 12 months and the
           incidence of first bracket loss will be recorded (i.e. event). Any subsequent bracket
           loss will also be recorded. For patients who have no failures the bracket survival time
           will be followed up until the end of fixed appliance treatment by the original or
           subsequent operator (i.e. anybody involved in the follow−up of these patients after the
           end of 12 month study period). In the event of repeated failures in the same patient or
           in the same area, the data will be recorded and statistical analysis for clustering will
           be appropriately selected.

        8. Subject withdrawal criteria Any participant can voluntarily withdraw from the study at
           any time without any compromise to the agreed and proposed treatment. Such a subject
           will be accounted for during data and statistical analysis. The drop-out sample will not
           be replaced during the trial. All data pertaining to first time bracket failure will be
           recorded as agreed until the withdrawal date for an individual sample. The follow up of
           such a patient will be for orthodontic treatment only and data pertaining to the trial
           will not be recorded after a sample confirms a withdrawal.

        9. Trial termination - reasons for abandoning the trial The trial will be terminated if
           more than 50% of the brackets fail ( greater than 8 brackets per patient) in the
           experimental group in at least three patients within the first review appointment (6
           weeks). This is because such a high failure rate is clinically unacceptable for
           continuation of routine orthodontic treatment in the experimental group.

       10. Bracket Bonding procedure As the bracket failure rate for the control group has been
           calculated from a previous study by Littlewood et al., a similar procedure to bond
           brackets will be followed in this study to avoid intervention bias. All teeth will be
           bonded including molar teeth. A pre−calibrated light curing unit will be used for
           setting the glue hard as follows -

           Summary of main issues -

           1. PURPOSE AND DESIGN

           Routinely orthodontic treatment is carried out by placing orthodontic brackets on teeth
           and wires which run through them which help move teeth. These metal brackets are bonded
           or glued onto the tooth surface by a three step process. Firstly, a mild acid is used to
           roughen the tooth surface, secondly a free flowing glue (composite primer) is used to
           fill in the roughened pores and thirdly, the bracket is glued on to the tooth surface
           with a 'composite' material which sets hard by exposure to a high intensity light. In
           routine studies, the success of this procedure is measured by bracket failure rates.

           The literature review revealed 7 studies which were relevant to bonding of orthodontic
           brackets with and without use of primers. Out of these 5 were invitro experimental
           studies, 1 was a retrospective study and 1 was a prospective non−randomised controlled
           study. Most studies in this field have been lab based studies which have measured bond
           strength and failure rates in extracted human teeth. The methodologies used have been
           retrospective and lack robust study design to eliminate bias. This literature review
           suggests that the scientific evidence is not clear to indicate whether the use of a
           primer is absolutely essential to achieve acceptable bracket success/failure rates in a
           clinical environment. A RCT was designed and carried out in Bradford/Leeds (see previous
           reference number) which showed no statistical difference between the primer and non
           primer groups. However, this was a single operator study who was an orthodontic trainee.
           This study aims for a 'real world' effect by using multiple operators with various
           degrees of orthodontic experience.

           To summarise, arguably the evidence available from previous studies to either support or
           refute the use of primer prior to bonding brackets in a clinical setting appears to be
           weak. The main drawbacks of these studies were related to inconsistent study designs and
           many of the conclusions may not be applicable for the following reasons -invitro
           studies, use of chemically cured resins rather than light cured systems which are
           currently used, different bracket systems, variation in bonding steps, use of flowable
           composites which are not routinely used for bonding and lack of a prospective randomized
           controlled study in a clinical setting. All these studies have concluded the need for
           further research to investigate if clinically acceptable bond strength can be achieved
           without the use of a primer. If this hypothesis is true, then bonding brackets may
           become faster, efficient and cost effective. Therefore, a well designed randomized
           controlled study could be justified to clarify if the use of a primer is essential prior
           to bonding brackets.

           The results from this randomised clinical trial will help improve our knowledge of the
           best approach to bonding metal brackets on teeth. If the bracket failure rate is similar
           in both groups, this suggests that the use of a primer is not always necessary to gain
           sufficient bond strength in a clinical environment. From a patient's perspective, this
           would mean lesser clinical time required to place brackets at start of orthodontic
           treatment. For clinicians and NHS purchasers the outcome of the study will influence
           clinical chair side time, cost effectiveness (as the primer is the most expensive
           component in the bonding process) and provide a framework for future studies in this
           field.

           The trainee student will benefit from training in broad research methodology, scientific
           critique, statistical concepts and experience in undertaking a randomised clinical trial
           as a part of Masters project.

           PROTOCOL/ QUALITY ASSURANCE The research will be undertaken as a part of routine
           orthodontic care provided by a consultant led service in orthodontic departments in
           Leeds Dental Hospital, St Lukes Hospital and Seacroft hospital. All the patients
           recruited into the project will receive the same standard of quality orthodontic
           treatment as provided if they did not choose to partake in the study. All the procedures
           for orthodontic treatment at the Leeds Dental Institute/Bradford teaching hospitals are
           quality assured by the Deanery/General Dental Council and Specialist Advisory Committee
           (SAC) as part of an established three year training programme in Orthodontics (this
           relates to the fact that one of the researchers will be an orthodontic registrar on on a
           training pathway). The other clinicians are orthodontic consultants and orthodontic
           therapists supervised by orthodontic therapists.

           The research committee at Leeds Dental Institute consists of Clinical/Academic
           Orthodontic Consultants from the region and are routinely involved in supervision of
           MSc/DDS students regarding their research projects every year. This panel was asked to
           review the protocol prior to submission and the members include independent reviewers
           not involved in the study.

           RECRUITMENT All consecutive patients who need fixed appliance therapy will be taken off
           the NHS waiting list and no attempt will be made to match them for age, sex or
           malocclusion to ensure a representative sample, except for the exclusion criteria. After
           informed consent is obtained, they will be randomly allocated to either the control
           (with Transbond primer) or experimental (without primer) group. This will be done by pre
           paring opaque numbered sealed envelopes in blocks of 10 in advance by the supervisor
           (NH) using random number tables. The supervisor will enroll the participants and assign
           them to their group using the sealed envelopes which blinds the two operators and
           participants to the assignment before enrollment. Once the envelopes are opened the
           blinding of the operators will be lost. The operators cannot be blinded in this trial as
           the intervention administered to the test group cannot be blinded. Treatment will be
           started on all patients within 3 months of the enrollment.

           INCLUSION / EXCLUSION Inclusion criteria •Patients requiring single or two arch fixed
           appliance therapy (with no history of previous orthodontic treatment)including patients
           requiring orthognathic surgery

           •Willing to consent to participate in the trial

           Exclusion criteria

             -  Patients with craniofacial anomalies

             -  Patients with several buccal restorations or congenital enamel defects

             -  Hypodontia cases (with more than one tooth missing in each quadrant)

           CONSENT Children under 16 Routine orthodontic treatment is undertaken at about 12 years
           of age onwards and a majority of patients requiring orthodontic treatment will be from
           this age group on a NHS waiting list. These patients have to be included in the study as
           any clinical relevance of the study will be applicable to patients in this age group, in
           addition to adults. Appropriate informed consent with parental involvement is routinely
           followed at the start of treatment for these patients as per NHS trust policy.

           Each participant will be given a patient information sheet outlining the objective,
           details of the study and answer any frequently asked questions. The patient information
           sheet will be drafted individually for both adults and children below 16 years of age.

           The informed consent process will be done by the registrar treating the case or the
           supervising consultant, usually at the next appointment so that enough time is given to
           the patient if they choose to participate. All participants will be explained regarding
           the research prior to consent. For participants below 16 years of age, the informed
           consent process will involve the responsible parent who will sign the form in addition
           to the child.

           A minimum of 24 hours upto 6 weeks (until the next appointment) of time will usually be
           available for the patient to think over the decision to participate. In routine
           orthodontic treatment, usually the registrar/clinician will take treatment records at
           the initial visit and give a patient information leaflet. Routinely any treatment
           planning and consent is done at the subsequent appointment which is usually in a few
           weeks under consultant supervision.

           Any participant requiring language interpretation will be provided with a suitably
           qualified interpreter, as per the NHS trust protocol. No participant will be excluded on
           the basis of ethnic origin, language preferences, religion, sexual preference or gender.

           Any involvement of patients with significant learning disability or special needs raises
           sensitive issues related to comprehension and consent. Although they will be not
           excluded from participation if they wish to do so, these patients will be offered to
           partake and the views of the person with parental authority will be considered.

           RISKS, BURDEN AND BENEFITS Possibly, greater failure of brackets (fixed brace
           attachments) in the experimental group which may need to be glued back on soon after.
           These failures will not affect the treatment outcome in any way.

           Possibly, extra visit to the department if brackets fail, so that they can be glued back
           on. This may add on a few weeks of additional time to overall treatment, but will not
           affect the treatment outcome in any way.

           As per the drafted protocol for the trial &quot; the trial will be terminated if more than 50
           % of the brackets fail in the experimental group in at least three patients within the
           first review appointment (6 weeks). This is because such a high failure rate is
           clinically unacceptable for continuation of routine orthodontic treatment in the
           experimental group &quot; In such a situation all the participants will be informed in
           writing regarding trial termination and all steps would be taken to ensure that routine
           orthodontic treatment is continued as planned. In such cases all the brackets which have
           been bonded as per the protocol for the experimental group will be replaced to match the
           control group i.e. routine treatment.

           CONFIDENTIALITY Each patient will have a patient identification number as per trust
           policy and this will be quoted on all forms relevant to the study. No other identifiable
           information will be available on the forms. All electronic data pertaining to the study
           will be stored in computers within the NHS site and these systems are subject to local
           NHS trust data protection policies and caldicott principles. No external source will
           have access to this data. The data will be shared only within the members of the
           research team for analysis purposes.

           The data will be stored in NHS computers and will be protected as per the NHS trust
           protocol under the Data Protection Act. The Chief investigator and members of the
           research team will have access to the data
