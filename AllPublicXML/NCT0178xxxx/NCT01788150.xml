    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, active-control, multi-center clinical trial comparing the safety
      and efficacy of the Svelte Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent Integrated Delivery System (IDS) to
      that of the commercially available Resolute IntegrityTM Drug-Eluting Stent.

      The study objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Svelte Drug-Eluting Coronary
      Stent Integrated Delivery System (IDS) compared to the Resolute IntegrityTM Drug-Eluting
      Stent in patients with single, never previously treated coronary artery lesions

             and

          7. Patient agrees to comply with specified follow-up evaluations and to return to the

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patient has either a single target lesion, or two lesions (target and non-target)
             located in separate coronary arteries;

          2. If a non-target lesion is treated, it must be treated first and only with commercially
             available PTCA balloons and/or stents. Post PCI of the non-target vessel, all of the
             following conditions must be met:

                  ischemia.

          3. Reference vessel ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter by visual estimate;

             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were

                  hemodynamically stable for 72-hours;

               2. Patients who have had a non-STEMI may be included if their troponin levels are
                  within the laboratory normal range within 24-hours pre-procedure.

          8. Co-morbid condition(s) that could limit the patient's ability to participate in the

          4. Significant (&gt; 50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might
             require revascularization or impede run off;

          5. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft;

          6. Ostial target lesion (within 5.0 mm of vessel origin) or any location within the left
