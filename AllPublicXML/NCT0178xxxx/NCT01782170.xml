    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of Iocide oral rinse in a human clinical
      trial of gingivitis. Iocide oral rinse will be evaluated against a placebo rinse. Indices for
      gingivitis, plaque and bleeding will be scored and blood tests will be performed to determine
      the effect of the antimicrobial oral rinse on relative levels of biological markers of
      inflammation.

             Investigator;

          -  Have &gt; 25% sites with Gingival Index (GI) scores of &gt; 2 at Visits 1 and 2;

          -  Have Plaque Index (PI) scores of &gt; 1 on &gt; 50% of sites;

          -  Use of effective method of contraception for the duration of the study or permanently
             sterilized;

          -  Able and willing to comply with study requirements including following instructions on
             study treatment and returning for follow-up visits as required by the protocol;

          -  Have full understanding of all elements of, and signature and dating of the written
             informed consent prior to the initiation of protocol specified procedures;

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before and
             during the study period. Sexually active females must be using an effective form of
             birth control or abstinence. These methods include oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;),
             an intrauterine device (IUD), levonogestrol implants (Norplant®), medroxyprogesterone
             acetate injections (Depo-provera®) or contraceptive foam with a condom.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible for
        participation in this study:

          -  History, or current evidence, of any significant acute or chronic subject-reported
             medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             render examination difficult or invalid or prevent the subject from active study
             participation;

          -  ≤24% of sites with GI score &gt;2;

          -  Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOab) positive &gt;34;

             implant or any other condition requiring antibiotic premedication;

          -  Subject reported history of last past 6 months or current drug abuse;

          -  Chronic treatment (2 weeks or more) with any medication known to affect periodontal
             status (including phenytoin, calcium antagonists, cyclosporine, coumarin,
             non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and aspirin) within 1 month of the screening
             examination. All other medications for chronic medical conditions have been initiated
             at least 3 months before enrollment;

             from the Sponsor within four weeks prior to Visit 2 (Study Day 1);

             (6) months;

          -  Females with childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test, pregnant or
             nursing mothers, suspected pregnancy, or intention to become pregnant during the
