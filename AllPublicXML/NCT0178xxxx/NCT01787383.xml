    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety of a simultaneous treatment regimen
      compared to a sequential treatment regimen when two separate areas with AKs (one located on
      face/scalp and the other located on trunk/ extremities) are treated with ingenol mebutate gel

    <description>Composite Local Skin Reaction (LSR) score 3 days after treatment of each selected treatment area in both treatment groups (simultaneous or sequential). The composite LSR score (0 to 24), reflecting the sum of the individual LSR grades (erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration, grade 0 to 4), was calculated for each selected treatment area at each visit.The composite LSR score ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 24 (worst possible outcome). Both affected areas were calculated together &quot;Per Arm&quot;. Each subject could contribute with up to 2 values (1 for each treated area).</description>

        <description>Composite Local Skin Reaction (LSR) score 3 days after treatment of each selected treatment area in both treatment groups (simultaneous or sequential). The composite LSR score (0 to 24), reflecting the sum of the individual LSR grades (erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration, grade 0 to 4), was calculated for each selected treatment area at each visit.The composite LSR score ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 24 (worst possible outcome). Both affected areas were calculated together &quot;Per Arm&quot;. Each subject could contribute with up to 2 values (1 for each treated area).</description>
