      A sniff test for nasal patency is a common method before ultrathin transnasal
      esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) to select the right or left nostril for insertion, yet
      there is no objective method to select an appropriate meatus insertion site (MIS) where
      tolerance and epistaxis rate can be improved.

      The investigators hypothesize that that an objective anterior rhinoscopy (to be more
      specific, the investigators term it &quot;anterior meatoscopy&quot;) method might be more effective
      than the subjective breathing-in method (sniff test) to select the appropriate meatus
      insertion site, thus reducing nasal bleeding and nasal discomfort.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an endoscopic meatus scoring scale
      (EMSS) by anterior meatoscopy (AM) to select a MIS on patient tolerance and adverse events
      during nasal anesthesia and UT-EGD.

      The investigators will perform a prospective randomized-controlled trial to compare patient
      tolerability and adverse events during nasal anesthesia and endoscopy between the AM-selected
      and self-selected MIS. A total of 233 consecutive patients with epigastric discomfort
      (symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia) will be included in the study in a large tertiary referral
      hospital in Taiwan.

    <textblock>
      Transnasal esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) offers physicians and patients a number of
      advantages compared with conventional peroral EGD (P-EGD) and has become increasingly popular
      in clinical practice over the past several years. However, insertion failure varying from
      2.3% to 62.7% due to tight nasal vault have been reported. Dumortire reported 17.9 % of
      patient refused UT-EGD due to nasal pain and epistaxis remains to be a common side effect.
      Therefore a well performed nasal anesthesia has been regarded as the most important step for
      UT-EGD.

      The concept of endoscopic guidance is actually an application of anterior rhinoscopy to
      select the most patent meatus for nasal anesthesia and endoscopic insertion. The scope should
      be placed in the side of the nasal cavity that is most patent. Therefore, it is reasonable
      that a nasal examination is performed prior to UT-EGD to determine the less obstructed side.

      In fact, anterior rhinoscopy is a common outpatient procedure by otolaryngologists and is
      performed with an otoscope. Instead, we use a transnasal endoscope to select the most patent
      meatus and thus we first introduce the concept of anterior &quot;meatus-copy&quot;, which is different
      from &quot;meatoscopy&quot; for the urinary meatus.

      The conventional sniff nasal patency test is an inspection of nasal passability by asking a
      patient to compare the breathing-in air flow in either side of the nose. This is a
      self-selected and subjective method of choosing just the right or left nostril for transnasal
      endoscopy.

      Nasal septum and nasal turbinates, especially the inferior turbinates, are erectile tissues
      in the nose, fluctuate greatly in size depending on physiological changes (e.g. body
      temperature and exercise) and response to inflammation. Often, the sensation of a blocked
      nose is subjective. The otolaryngologist may find a perfectly patent airway and yet the
      patient will insist that his nose is clogged up. Therefore, an objective method to evaluate
      nasal patency would help to avoid a narrowed meatus, thereby reducing nasal pain and
      epistaxis during nasal anesthesia and transnasal endoscopy.

      Methods used to objectively measure nasal patency and resistance include rhinomanometry and
      acoustic rhinometry. However, these two methods are sophisticated and not straightforward.
      There is no literature describing the optimal selection method for transnasal endoscopic
      insertion. Assessments of nasal patency by dynamic methods include nasal peak flow,
      rhinomanometry, and acoustic rhinometry. However, a convenient endoscopic method of
      evaluating nasal meatus patency has not been proposed.

      Locating on the anterior portion of a meatus, the transnasal endoscope itself can act as a
      nasoscope to look for the most patent meatus.

      We found anterior meatuscopy allows the direct visualisation of the turbinates and meatus
      without causing discomfort. Thus it may be a useful ancillary technique to select the most
      patent meatus for scope insertion. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate
      whether a anterior meatuscopy scoring system could reduce nasal bleeding and improve
      tolerance associated with UT-EGD.

    <description>The primary outcome measures were tolerability proﬁles on a validated visual analogue scale as previously described and difficulty in inserting the transnasal endoscope through the selected meatus based on a Likert scale. The scale contained 5 points of difficulty: minimal, slight, moderate, substantial, and extreme. Facing a 5-point VAS card (1 = minimal discomfort to 5 = severe discomfort), all patients gave realtime feedback by speaking or pointing out their scorings for the following: (1) pain during anesthesia, (2) pain during nasal insertions, and (3) pain during exsertion, and they answered immediately after UT-EGD for (4) overall tolerance.</description>

    <description>The nasal vestibule is the most anterior part of the nasal cavity. It is lined by the same epithelium of the skin (stratified squamous epithelium) but not respiratory epithelium (pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium) so that an endoscope tip in this region would hardly causes trauma or bleeding. Before being inserted gently into the nasal vestibule for anterior rhinoscopy, the endoscope tip is applied with 2% lidocaine gel and then sprayed with 10% liquid lidocaine. This procedure can provide mild vestibular anesthesia which can prevent patients from sneezing when the vibrissae hair is irritated by the endoscope tip. Instead of holding the insertion tube as usual, an endoscopist holds the bending section for better control of the distal tip during anterior meatuscopy.</description>

    <description>All patients in the control group receive a sniff test in the left lateral decubitus (LLD) position directed and recorded by an assistant nurse. This test has been conducted for decades and is still used by many transnasal endoscopists, otolaryngologists, and pediatrics. In brief, the more patent nostril is selected by the patient inhaling through only one nostril with the other sealed by the examiner's index ﬁnger. Patients are asked to indicate which of their nostrils is most patent. If neither is more patent, the right nostril is chosen by default. The middle meatus is more difficult to examine and may be less well anesthetized than other structures. Thus, the inferior nasal meatus is selected for each case because the inferior meatus is usually the largest of the three nasal meatuses.</description>
