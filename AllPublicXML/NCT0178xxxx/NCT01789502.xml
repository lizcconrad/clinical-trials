  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized study to compare of outcome of fully covered metal
      stents with that of plastic stents for preoperative biliary drainage in distal common bile
      duct cancer, pancreas head cancer or ampullary cancer with respect to the incidence of
      stent-related adverse events, the re-intervention rate, the effectiveness of biliary
      drainage, surgical outcomes and hospital stays.

    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is curative option in periampullary tumor. Preoperative endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatog-raphy (ERCP) is usually undertaken in patients with resectable
      disease to relieve biliary obstruction, which is thought to impair immune response, clotting,
      and other functions that impact intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. Despite
      conflicting data pertaining to preoperative biliary drainage, ERCP with biliary stenting has
      become standard practice in patients with periampullary malignancies. In a recent multicenter
      randomized trial, patients who underwent preoperative biliary drainage had a 74% rate of
      complications compared with 39% for those who directly underwent surgery without preoperative
      biliary drainage. In this trial, however, all patients underwent placement of plastic stents.
      In ERCP, self-expandable metal stent are being increasingly placed for palliation of
      malignant biliary obstruction. Compared with plastic stents, self-expandable metal stents
      have large caliber and have demonstrated longer patency duration. Even in patients with
      resectable malignant disease, self-expandable metal stents which are placed below the level
      of transection may not impair technical outcomes at surgery and can be safely removed along
      with the surgical specimen.

      This prospective study is designed to compare the incidence of stent-related adverse events,
      the re-intervention rate, the effectiveness of biliary drainage, surgical outcomes and
      hospital stays in patients with periamupllary tumors who are undergone with self-expandable
      metal stents or plastic stents placement for preoperative biliary drainage
