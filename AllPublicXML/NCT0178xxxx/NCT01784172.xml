      for simple female stress urinary incontinence.

    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common disease of female. The inconvenience caused by
      SUI affects the patients' quality of life and health seriously. To date, there has not
      specific therapy on SUI. Former research showed acupuncture may work for SUI. This
      multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial of acupuncture for simple female stress
      urinary incontinence is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of EA. This project is
      conducted by Chinese researchers, supported by the Chinese Government. The research result is
      expected to provide high quality evidence of EA for simple female stress urinary
      incontinence.

Bilateral BL33 are given acupuncture of 50～60mm with 30～45°angle to inward and downward by 75mm filiform needle. Bilateral BL35 are given acupuncture of 50～60mm to outward and upward by 75mm filiform needle. Twirl, lift and thrust for 3 times, until local sour and heavy feeling coming.The electric stimulator is applied to bilateral BL33 and BL35, with continuous wave,50 Hz and electric current 1- 5mA.Every session lasts for 30 min per day.The participants are treated continuously for 6 weeks for 3 sessions a week, 18 sessions for each patient in all.
