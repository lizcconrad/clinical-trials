  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BABY HUG Treatment Study was designed to see if treatment with the drug hydroxyurea (also
      called HU) in children with sickle cell disease could prevent organ damage, especially in the
      spleen and kidneys. There was also a chance that treatment could prevent painful crises, lung
      disease, stroke, and blood infection.

      The current observational trial, Follow-Up Study II (designated FUS II) includes enhanced
      neuropsychological, brain, cardiac, and pulmonary evaluations for this very well
      characterized cohort of subjects. Measures of spleen and renal function and markers of DNA
      damage will continue to be collected. Assessment of other target organs in sickle cell
      disease including pulmonary and cardiac function will be performed in addition to evaluation
      of developmental aspects of SCD and potential HU toxicity.

    <measure>The primary objective of Follow-Up Study II is to monitor the continued safety and potential efficacy of HU treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of HU will be assessed by ongoing clinical monitoring of growth and development, age-appropriate neuropsychological evaluation, serial hematologic and chemistry parameters, and the frequency of expected and unexpected clinical events related to sickle cell disease. Disease and treatment-related effects on the spleen will be measured by a liver-spleen scan, pitted cell counts and HJB enumeration. Kidney function will be measured by GFR estimation from the Schwartz formula or cystatin C measurements and the urine osmolality and urine microalbumin:creatinine ratio. The BH FU II investigators will also seek to study how early treatment with HU changes the child's disease trajectory on open-label HU.</description>
