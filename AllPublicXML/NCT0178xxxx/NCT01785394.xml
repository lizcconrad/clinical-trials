  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether exhaled breath temperature, a surrogate
      marker of airway inflammation, rises during the pollen season in sensitized subjects with
      allergic rhinoconjucnctivitis with or without mild asthma. Sublingual Immunotherapy with
      respective allergens suppresses the seasonal increase of EBT. During the second year (2013)
      of the trial all patients will be treated with 5 grass allergen extract: carry over
      differences between the active and placebo arms from the previous year (2012) will be looked
      for.

    <textblock>
      Patients with grass pollen allergy are most typical and best responding to sublingual
      immunotherapy. Their selection will be done in accordance with the criteria listed in Chapter
      9 of the World Allergy Organization Position Paper on specific immunotherapy 2009 and in
      compliance with the rules for good clinical practice.

      Proposed primary variable: the difference between the changes of exhaled breath temperature
      before and in the pollen season of subjects treated with grass-pollen sublingual
      immunotherapy and the untreated control patients.

      Suggested secondary variables: changes over time of exhaled breath temperature in the two
      groups, difference in symptoms scores, methacholine responsiveness, rescue medication usage.

      Statistical analysis: On the basis of the available data about the variability of exhaled
      breath changes and its changes upon flare up of airway inflammation or after
      anti-inflammatory treatment we have calculated a sample size of 20 subjects in each group to
      be sufficient to prove differences in the primary variable with a significance level &lt;0.05.
      However, as this is &quot;first time ever&quot; type of pilot study on sublingual immunotherapy and
      exhaled breath temperature in grass-pollen patients, this estimate is relative. By all means
      this study will identify trends to be used for sample size calculations in future studies.
      During the second year of the study when all patients will be on active treatment with 5
      grass allergen extract, carry over effects from the first year of treatment with 5 grass
      allergen extract or placebo on exhaled breath temperature will be explored.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the differences between the changes of exhaled breath temperature before and in the pollen season of subjects treated with 5 grass allergen extract applied sublingually and untreated control patients. Possible carry-over differences between the same two arms will be explored during the second year of the trial. Calculations will involve difference between assessment at month 6 and baseline for year 1 (2012) and in year 2 (2013) and comparisons between the two arms of the study will be made.</description>
