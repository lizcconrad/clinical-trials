  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of KAM2904 Face
      Cream and KAM3008 Body Lotion in reducing the symptoms of mild to moderate AD. Efficacy will
      be evaluated by comparing SCORAD and Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) in a group of subjects
      treated with KAM2904 Face Cream and KAM3008 Body Lotion (the treatment group), versus a group
      of subjects treated with a petrolatum-based moisturizer (the control group). Safety will be
      determined by the number and severity of Adverse Events Device-Related.
