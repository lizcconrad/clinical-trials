      As there is no prospective data on the combination of abiraterone and salvage radiotherapy,
      the aim of this study is to further evaluate the safety profile of abiraterone acetate plus
      prednisone in patients with prostate cancer who are biochemically relapsing after surgery and
      undergo salvage radiotherapy with 6-months LH-RH agonist.

      The investigators hypothesize that the toxicity profile of both treatments should not
      potentiate each other. This study will also provide preliminary data on the efficacy of this
      combination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma

          2. The patients should have undergone only surgery for localized prostate adenocarcinoma:
             pT2, pT3 or pT4 with bladder neck involvement

          3. pN0: negative lymphadenectomy at the time of prostatectomy

          4. At inclusion the patients should have no clinical signs of progressive disease and
             should be M0 (bone and pelvic scans).

          5. ≥ 18 years of age with life expectancy ≥ 10 years

          6. Performance Status (ECOG) ≤ 1

          7. PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/ml after prostatectomy (dosage performed within 2 months after surgery)

          8. PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml et ≤ 2 ng/ml at the time of inclusion

          9. Elevation of PSA over three consecutive assays performed in the same laboratory, with
             a minimal interval of two months between assays, (PSA nadir level followed by two
             other progressive assays)

         10. At least 6 months between surgery and biochemical relapse

         11. Serum potassium ≥ 3.5 mmol/L in the 72 hours before first dose of abiraterone acetate

         12. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN or a calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min

         13. Liver function:

             Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN (except for patients with documented Gilbert's disease)
             AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN

         14. Patients must be affiliated to a Social Security System.

         15. Patient information and written informed consent form signed for both principal and
             additional research

             laboratory tests and other study procedures
