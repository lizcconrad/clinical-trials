    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 After Trial Entry in Osteoarthritis Pain Measured on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12/Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>The pain in subjects with osteoarthritis was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale score. The WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the average of the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from 5 pain subscale questions. Subjects mark the VAS, which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length, with a single vertical line to indicate their pain level over the last 24 hours, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Extreme Pain&quot;.
The WOMAC pain subscale score difference is calculated as the WOMAC pain subscale score assessed at Week 12 minus the WOMAC pain subscale score assessed at baseline.</description>

          <description>The pain in osteoarthritis subjects within the past 24 hours was measured at baseline using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale score. The WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the mean of the visual analogue scale scores from 5 pain subscale questions, with 0 mm meaning &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm meaning &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;.
The pain subscore was calculated for 139 subjects in the Meloxicam 5 mg group, 130 in the Meloxicam 10 mg group, and 133 in the placebo group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 After Trial Entry in Osteoarthritis Pain Measured on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score.</title>
        <description>The pain in subjects with osteoarthritis was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale score. The WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the average of the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from 5 pain subscale questions. Subjects mark the VAS, which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length, with a single vertical line to indicate their pain level over the last 24 hours, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Extreme Pain&quot;.
The WOMAC pain subscale score difference is calculated as the WOMAC pain subscale score assessed at Week 12 minus the WOMAC pain subscale score assessed at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the Average of Weeks 2, 6, and 12 After Trial Entry in Osteoarthritis Pain Measured on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score.</title>
        <description>The pain in subjects with osteoarthritis was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale score. The WOMAC pain subscale score is calculated as the average of the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from 5 pain subscale questions. Subjects mark the VAS, which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length, with a single vertical line to indicate their pain level over the last 24 hours, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Extreme Pain&quot;.
The WOMAC pain subscale score difference was calculated as the WOMAC pain subscale score assessed at Weeks 2, 6, and 12 minus the WOMAC pain subscale score assessed at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 After Trial Entry in Osteoarthritis Pain, Stiffness, and Function Measured Using the Total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Score.</title>
        <description>Pain, stiffness, and function in subjects with osteoarthritis were measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Index, which is a 24-item questionnaire. The total WOMAC score is calculated as the average of the mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from the questions in the pain, stiffness, and function subscales. Subjects mark the VAS, which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length, with a single vertical line to indicate their response to each of the questions, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain, Stiffness, or Difficulty&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Extreme Pain, Stiffness, and Difficulty&quot;.
The total WOMAC score difference was calculated as the total WOMAC score assessed at Week 12/early termination minus the total WOMAC score assessed at baseline.</description>

        <description>The function in osteoarthritis subjects within the past 24 hours was measured at baseline using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function subscale score. The WOMAC function subscale score is calculated as the mean of the visual analogue scale scores from 17 function subscale questions. Subjects mark the VAS, which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length, with a single vertical line to indicate their functional limitation level over the last 24 hours, with 0 mm meaning &quot;No Functional Limitation&quot; and 100 mm meaning &quot;Extreme Functional Limitation&quot;.
The WOMAC function subscale score difference was calculated as the WOMAC function subscale score assessed at Week 2 minus the WOMAC function subscale score assessed at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 After Trial Entry in Osteoarthritis Function Measured on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Function Subscale Score.</title>
        <description>The function in osteoarthritis subjects within the past 24 hours was measured at baseline using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function subscale score. The WOMAC function subscale score is calculated as the mean of the visual analogue scale scores from 17 function subscale questions. Subjects mark the VAS, which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length, with a single vertical line to indicate their functional limitation level over the last 24 hours, with 0 mm meaning &quot;No Functional Limitation&quot; and 100 mm meaning &quot;Extreme Functional Limitation&quot;.
The WOMAC function subscale score difference was calculated as the WOMAC function subscale score assessed at Week 6 minus the WOMAC function subscale score assessed at baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 2 After Trial Entry in Osteoarthritis Stiffness Measured on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale Score.</title>
          <description>The stiffness in osteoarthritis subjects within the past 24 hours was measured at baseline using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) stiffness subscale score. The WOMAC stiffness subscale score is calculated as the mean of the visual analogue scale scores from 2 stiffness subscale questions. Subjects mark the VAS, which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length, with a single vertical line to indicate their stiffness level over the last 24 hours, with 0 mm meaning &quot;No Stiffness&quot; and 100 mm meaning &quot;Extreme Stiffness&quot;.
The WOMAC stiffness subscale score difference was calculated as the WOMAC stiffness subscale score assessed at Week 2 minus the WOMAC stiffness subscale score assessed at baseline.</description>
