  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), negatively influencing their quality of life,
      treatment response and survival. Loss of muscle protein is generally a central component of
      weight loss in CHF and COPD patients but patients also have reductions in fat mass and bone
      density, independent of the severity of the disease state. The purpose of this
      cross-sectional study is to provide detailed insight in disease related gut function by
      obtaining information on gut permeability, digestion and absorption of glucose, fat and
      protein in CHF and COPD patients compared to matched healthy controls. This will provide
      required information that is necessary to implement new strategies to develop optimal
      nutritional regimen in CHF and COPD. The hypothesis is that CHF and COPD are related to
      decreased gut function and absorption, leading to decreased anabolic response. Second, this
      decreased nutritional status is linked to reduced muscle functioning and possibly decreased
      cognition. In addition, we will examine the effect of aging on by comparing gut function
      digestion and absorption of the CHF and COPD aged matched healthy controls to a group of
      young healthy subjects.

      This study involves one test day of approximately 7-8 hours. On this test day subjects will
      ingest a sugar drink to assess gut permeability and gut function, and a protein meal to
      measure digestion/absorption and the anabolic response to food intake. Subjects will also
      receive a mixture of amino acids that are made a little heavier than normal, called stable
      isotopes. This stable isotopes is used to investigate protein behavior in the body (protein
      kinetics). Blood (100-120 ml in total) and urine samples will be collected over 7 hours.
