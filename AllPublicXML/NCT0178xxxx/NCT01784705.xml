  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bright light therapy (BLT) has been found to be effective in treatment of seasonal affective
      disorder (SAD). The mechanism of action of conventional BLT in the treatment of SAD is under
      debate. Recently, transcranial bright light (TBL) via ear canals has been proved to modulate
      the neural networks of the human brain and improve cognitive performance in healthy subjects.
      Moreover, TBL has been found to alleviate symptoms of SAD in open trial. In this case the
      investigators will study the effect of transcranial bright light treatment via ear canals on
      depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients suffering from SAD in randomized controlled
      double-blind study design.

    <description>The bright light treatment was given transcranially via ear canals by using bright light device. The bright light was produced using two light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The bright light was transmitted into both ear canals by an optical fibre. Daily 12 minutes TBL was taken at home during forenoon.</description>
