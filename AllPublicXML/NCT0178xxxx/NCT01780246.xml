  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of nusinersen
      (ISIS 396443) administered intrathecally to participants with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
      who previously participated in ISIS 396443-CS1 (NCT02865109). The secondary objective was to
      examine the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single dose of ISIS 396443 administered
      intrathecally to participants with SMA who previously participated in ISIS 396443-CS1.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical signs attributable to Spinal Muscular Atrophy

          -  Satisfactory completion of dosing and all study visits in ISIS 396443-CS1
             (NCT01494701) with an acceptable safety profile, per Investigator judgement.

          -  Able to complete all study procedures, measurements and visits and parent/participant
             has adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 2 years from Screening

          -  Meets age-appropriate institutional criteria for use of anesthesia/sedation, if use is
             planned for study procedure

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any new or worsening of existing condition which in the opinion of the
             Investigator would make the participant unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere
             with the participant participating in or completing the study.

          -  Dosing in ISIS 396443-CS1 (NCT01494701) within 270 days (9 months) of screening, or
             longer ago than 450 days (15 months)

          -  Dosing in ISIS 396443-CS2 (NCT01703988)

          -  Hospitalization for surgery (i.e. scoliosis surgery) or pulmonary event within 2
             months of screening or planned during the duration of the study

          -  Presence of an untreated or inadequately treated active infection requiring systemic
             antiviral or antimicrobial therapy any time during the screening period

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters

          -  Treatment with investigational drug, biological agent, or device within 1-month of
             Screening or 5 half-lives of study agent, whichever is longer. Treatment with
             valproate or hydroxyurea within 1 months of screening. Any history of gene therapy or
             cell transplantation

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
