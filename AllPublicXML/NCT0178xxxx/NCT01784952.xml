  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We examined whether a substitution of whole grains and legumes for refined rice in a high
      carbohydrate diet (about 65% of energy derived from carbohydrate) may modify the effect of
      this variant on changes in apolipoprotein A-V (apoA-V) and triglyceride concentrations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We genotyped the APOA5 -1131T&gt;C in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes, who were randomly assigned to either a group ingesting whole grain
      and legume meals daily or a control group for 12 weeks.

    <description>The intervention program consisted of replacing of refined rice intake with 1/3 of legumes, 1/3 of barleys, and 1/3 of whole grains three times per day as a high carbohydrate source and increased vegetable intake to at least 6 units (30-70 g/unit) per day for sufficient dietary fiber intake. The subjects were recommended to drink no more than one alcoholic beverage drink (15 g alcohol) per day and were assigned physical activity consisting of a regular 30-min walk after dinner each day. Participants were also instructed to record their physical activity diary for 24 h every 4 weeks.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who were in in impaired fasting glucose (IFG, 100≤ fasting glucose &lt;126
             mg/dL) and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL) were referred
             to the Department of Family Medicine or Internal Medicine. They were rechecked for
             their health and lipid profiles, and then those who satisfied the study criteria were
             recommended to participate in the dietary intervention program

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current and/or past history of cardiovascular disease including angina

          -  Liver or kidney dysfunction

          -  Thyroid or pituitary disease

          -  Unstable weight loss/gain (≥2 kg) over the previous 6months

          -  Pregnancy or lactation. Subjects who were taking medication were also excluded
