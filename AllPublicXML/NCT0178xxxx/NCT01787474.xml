      Objectives:

      Primary Objective Determine the safety, feasibility, and maximum tolerated dose of
      mbIL21-expanded haploidentical NK cells after induction chemotherapy with fludarabine,
      cytarabine, and G-CSF (FLAG).

      Recipient:

      While growing the NK cells from the blood in the lab, mismatched T cells may also grow, which
      can cause a reaction against normal tissue called graft-vs-host disease (GvHD). In the lab,
      the T cells will be removed from the cell product using special magnets and antibody-coated
      magnetic beads. The drug aldesleukin (interleukin-2) is then added to the NK cells to improve
      their function. The aldesleukin will be washed out of the cell product before it is given to
      you.

      The NK cells will be donated from a family member who has a certain genetic type in their
      blood called HLA that partly matches yours.

      Screening Tests:

      You had screening tests that are a routine part of the transplant preparation that helped
      show that you were eligible to take part in this study.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of NK cells
      based on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest
      dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue for up to 3 dose levels or until the
      highest tolerable dose of NK cells is found. One (1) to 5 participants will be treated in
      each dose level.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you. If your doctor
      thinks it is needed, you will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day,
      starting on the day of admission and continuing until your white blood cell levels are high
      enough. Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of white blood cells.

      Once a day for the next 5 days after admission (or 4 days, if you are 60 years old or older),
      you will receive fludarabine by vein over about 30 minutes. About 4 hours later, you will
      receive cytarabine by vein over about 1 hour.

      After the last day that you receive fludarabine and cytarabine, you will rest until you
      receive NK cells (about 2 -14 days).

      Three (3) times a week for 2 weeks, you will receive NK cells by vein over 30 minutes. You
      will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study
      staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Visits:

      Before treatment starts:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood
           pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Before each NK cell infusion:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  The amount of oxygen in your blood will be measured by placing a sensor on the tip of
           your finger.

      Twice a week, while your blood counts are low, you will have blood (about 2 teaspoons) drawn
      for routine tests.

      Once your blood counts are high enough, you will have blood (about 2 teaspoons) drawn for
      routine tests once a week until Day +56.

      Once your blood counts are high enough or around Day +28 (whichever is earlier), you will
      have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease and DNA tests to
      check if the cells in your bone marrow are yours or your NK cell donor's. To collect a bone
      marrow aspiration/biopsy, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a
      small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle.

      Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test the genetic makeup and function of the
      infused NK cells and to check the status of the disease:

        -  Before treatment starts.

        -  Before and about 1-3 hours after each NK cell infusion.

        -  Once a day on Days +14, +16, +18, +21, and then weekly until Day +56.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on the study will be over on Day +56.

      You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, if not enough NK cells can be collected, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum tolerated dose defined as highest dose studied in which 6 patients have been treated and at most 2 patients with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed.
A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as:
Acute severe (grade 3 or 4) infusional allergic reaction related to the NK cells infusion.
Prolonged cytopenia beyond D+28. If neutropenia is still present at day 28, that will trigger the designation of prolonged neutropenia as a DLT. If neutrophil counts have recovered by day 28, then no DLT will have occurred. In either case, the status of neutrophil recovery beyond day 28 will not change the designation of DLT or No DLT made at day 28.
Acute GvHD overall grade 3 or 4.
Severe (grade 3 or 4) unexpected toxicity related to the NK cell infusion.</description>

    <measure>Complete Remission (CR) Assessment Following Infusion of the NK Cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with complete remission (CR): Bone marrow aspiration - Less than 5% leukemic blasts. Disease assessment after neutrophil recovery and or Day 28, whichever is earlier: 1. Unilateral bone marrow biopsy and aspirate for cytology, flow cytometry, MRD, chimerism, cytogenetics, and FISH (for known tumor markers). 2. If recovery has not occurred by Day +28, then a second bone marrow will be obtained at the time of neutrophil recovery or Day +56, whichever is earlier. CR estimated with Kaplan-Meier estimator and tabulated with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Donor NK-Cell Expansion</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Donor NK-cell expansion defined as an absolute circulating donor-derived NK cell count that increases above the post-infusion level. Proportion of patients with successful in vivo NK-cell expansion estimated with a 95% confidence interval. The following chimerism methods employed to determine origin and number of circulating NK cells. Chimerism may be determined by flow cytometry using haplotype-specific antibodies. Chimerism may be determined by STR polymorphisms. When there is a sex-mismatch between the donor and the recipient, assays based on determining the frequency of sex-chromosomes may be used.</description>
