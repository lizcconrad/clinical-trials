    <measure>Subjective Rating of Overall Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Overall satisfaction, as rated by the participant on a 10-point scale, with 1 being very dissatisfied to 10 being very satisfied. The participant rated both eyes together by providing one single rating.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive Purchase Intent</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>As reported on a questionnaire in response to, &quot;Assuming these lenses were at a price you would expect to pay, how likely would you be to purchase these lenses?&quot; The binary 'positive' vs 'negative' response variable was derived from a 5-point Likert scale. Positive purchase intent is reported as the percentage of participants choosing &quot;Definitely would purchase&quot; or &quot;Probably would purchase.&quot;</description>

             each eye at distance.

          -  Manifest cylinder less than or equal to 0.75 diopter in each eye.

          -  Wear contact lenses within protocol-defined specifications.

          -  Require spherical contact lenses within the available range of powers.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any eye condition that contraindicates contact lens wear.

          -  Any systemic or ocular abnormality, infection, or disease likely to affect successful
             wear of contact lenses or use of their accessory solutions.

          -  Moderate or severe ocular findings upon examination.

          -  Any use of systemic or ocular medications that could contraindicate contact lens wear,
             including use of topical ocular medications requiring instillation during contact lens
             wear, except for approved lubricating drops.

          -  Habitual lenses worn in an extended wear modality (routinely sleeping in lenses
             overnight for 1 night per week or more) over the last 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Previous corneal or refractive surgery or irregular cornea.

          -  Eye injury or surgery within the last 6 months (excluding placement of punctal plugs).

        <description>As reported on a questionnaire in response to, &quot;Assuming these lenses were at a price you would expect to pay, how likely would you be to purchase these lenses?&quot; The binary 'positive' vs 'negative' response variable was derived from a 5-point Likert scale.
