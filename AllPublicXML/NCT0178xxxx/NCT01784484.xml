      BACKGROUND: Fibrosis assessment by Transient Elastography or Fibro scan is validated in
      chronic hepatitis C, however limited data are available in chronic hepatitis B and in non
      alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). AIMS: Document the prevalence and severity of fibrosis
      in patients with different chronic liver disease (elevated liver enzymes) who are being
      followed up in the liver unit and to find associated factors with significant fibrosis and
      cirrhosis at ziv medical center, Safed,Bar Ilan University. Israel. METHODS: Fibro scan will
      be performed to all patients with abnormal liver enzymnes who attend the liver clinic. Liver
      stiffness measurement, age, gender, BMI, will be measured. Questionaire on soft drink
      consumption, Coffee drinking, use of herbs, and a history of cancer or heart disease will be
      distributed. Expected RESULTS: we expect that the liver stiffness (normal 1-6 Kpa) will be
      higher in NAFLD patients than in viral hepatitis patients for the same age ,same BMI, and the
      same duration of disease. More over, we expect serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values
      will emerge as the most important independent predictive variable of fibrosis and not serum
      ALT. A significant correlations between soft drink and coffee consumption with the extent of
      liver fibrosis is also expected. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study will confirm that
      screening patients with elevated liver enzymes is beneficial and detect earlier the presence
      of liver fibrosis mainly in patients with NAFLD.
