      Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a collection of physical and emotional symptoms related to a
      woman's menstrual cycle. These symptoms occurring only during the luteal phase of the
      menstrual cycle that are of sufficient severity to interfere with some aspects of life of
      these women, reflecting also in interpersonal relationships, workplace and in their
      productivity. For these reasons, this research was conducted with the nursing staff of the
      Samaritan Hospital in order to verify the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture to alleviate
      some of the symptoms of PMS.
