    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to learn about the outcomes of smoking
      cessation treatment. Researchers want to learn how many smokers stopped smoking after taking
      part in smoking cessation treatment with the Texas Quitline.

      Study Test:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will collect a saliva sample to test for
      cotinine to confirm your smoking status. Cotinine is a chemical released in your body when it
      breaks down nicotine. You will receive a kit in the mail with supplies for the testing. The
      study staff will call you to make sure that you received the kit and to discuss the
      instructions with you. To collect the saliva, you will put a small piece of cotton in your
      mouth for a few minutes. You will mail the saliva sample back to the study staff, using a
      postage-paid envelope.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be complete after you collect the saliva sample and
      mail it back to the study staff. Study data will be destroyed 5 years after the study has
      been completed and the data has been analyzed. Data collected in this study will not be used
      for future research.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 1,459 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at Harris
      Health System clinics.
