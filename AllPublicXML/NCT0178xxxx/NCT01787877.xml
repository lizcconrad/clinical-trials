  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke represents the third commonest cause of death after heart disease and all types of
      cancer combined, and is the leading cause of long-term permanent disability among adults.
      Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only safe medical treatment
      for acute ischemic stroke but only a small fraction of patients are eligible for a
      thrombolysis treatment. Current guidelines on thrombolysis post stroke with tPA exclude its
      uses beyond 3 hours after stroke onset and when time of onset is unknown thus excluding many
      patients from potentially beneficial treatment.

      For an appropriate triage and management of patients, it is essential to improve imaging
      techniques beyond a simple CT scan. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT), currently considered
      as an investigational technique, permits a quantitative determination of the cerebral
      perfusion within the brain. It helps distinguish salvageable ischemic penumbra from
      irreversibly infarcted core in acute stroke patients. This technique has therefore the
      potential to select patients who are most likely to benefit from thrombolysis with tPA, can
      be used to predict the benefit after thrombolysis and determine the suitability for other
      therapeutic interventions. In patients with a primary diagnosis of TIA, PCT would help to
      identify possible persistent cerebral ischemia but also provide important information for
      rapid instigation of prophylactic strategies.

      The diagnosis and management of patients with ischemic stroke and TIA is challenging and is
      primarily based on clinical assessment in conjunction with neuroimaging. Development of
      specific molecular biomarkers as additional tools to support a clinical diagnosis, exclude
      common stroke mimics such as migraine or epileptic seizures, identify patients at risk of
      disease, and help guide patient treatment by predicting complications following t-PA
      treatment would be of great value.
