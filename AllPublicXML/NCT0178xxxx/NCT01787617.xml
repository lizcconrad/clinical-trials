  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of an exercise training intervention
      on the ability of African American males to use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that
      helps the body use glucose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the effect of exercise training on insulin resistance in
      African American males. African American males have higher rates of diabetes and lower levels
      of fitness when compared to Caucasian males. A project such as this is necessary because
      there is evidence to show that exercise training can reduce the risk of developing diabetes,
      though no studies have been conducted in African American males. In addition, ARTIIS will
      test the effect adhering to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (150 minutes
      of moderate intensity aerobic activity and 2 days of 20 minutes of muscular strength
      activity), on insulin resistance in African American men. This study will provide important
      information that can either strengthen or refine current physical activity recommendations.
      Furthermore, this intervention will be delivered through community facilities in order to
      increase the likelihood that the intervention will be sustainable.

    <measure>Change in insulin response to an oral glucose tolerance test over 5 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>20-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An Oral glucose tolerance test is a medical test in which glucose is given and blood samples are taken afterward to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood. The test is usually used to test for diabetes or insulin resistance. We will administer this test at Baseline, Week 10, and Week 20.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this intervention will engage in both aerobic and resistance training in accordance with Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, that is 150 minutes of aerobic training and 2 days of additional 20 minutes of resistance training. The aerobic training component will be completed on a treadmill and target training intensity will be self-selected at 65% to 85% of maximal aerobic capacity. Each resistance training session will consist of both upper and lower body exercises: 2 sets of 9 exercises with each set consisting of 10 repetitions.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized into the control group will not be provided with memberships to any exercise facility, nor will they receive behavioral instruction on how to increase physical activity. They will receive information on living a healthy lifestyle. Such minimal interventions have not been shown to increase physical activity in participants. The participants in this group will undergo the baseline, 10 week, and 20 week testing.</description>
