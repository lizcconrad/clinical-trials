      RATIONALE: Multi-faceted provider education and decision support intervention will increase
      the rate of appropriate referral of breast cancer patients at increased risk for hereditary
      breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling.

      PURPOSE: This cluster randomized controlled trial will compare active and passive
      interventions to increase the rate of appropriate genetic counseling referrals of newly
      diagnosed breast cancer patients at increased risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the
      community oncology setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5-10% of all breast cancer patients have hereditary breast cancer, the majority
      due to an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (BRCA mutation carriers). Breast
      cancer patients who are BRCA mutation carriers have up to a 65% risk for a new primary breast
      cancer in the future. Additionally, BRCA mutation carriers have a 10-45% lifetime risk for
      ovarian cancer.

      Effective options to decrease these high future cancer risks are available to breast cancer
      patients who learn they carry a BRCA mutation - including prophylactic mastectomy and
      oophorectomy. Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy reduce the risks for future primary
      breast cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively, by more than 90%. Because of the high risks
      for future cancer and the opportunity for effective risk reduction among mutation carriers,
      national guidelines consistently recommend referral of breast cancer patients at increased
      risk for hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling by a
      qualified genetics professional. Lack of implementation of this standard of care constitutes
      an error of omission and jeopardizes patient outcomes.

      We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare a &quot;passive intervention&quot; -
      dissemination of professional guidelines - with an &quot;active intervention&quot; - a multi-faceted
      provider education and decision support intervention to improve 1) appropriate referral of
      breast cancer patients at risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community cancer center
      setting and 2) pre-surgical referral among newly diagnosed patients. Ultimately, these
      results will lead to decreased breast and ovarian cancer incidence and mortality among breast
      cancer patients and their family members, as well as improved outcomes of and satisfaction
      with surgical decision-making.

    <description>Site providers will be randomized and receive either the active or passive genetic counseling intervention. Post intervention, site providers will maintain a database of all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients that meet the study eligibility criteria. One year post diagnosis, subjects will be mailed an informed consent form including questionnaires from their providers. Returned patient questionnaire data along with information provided directly from site providers will be utilized to determine the rate of appropriate referral for genetic counseling.</description>

    <time_frame>12-15 months post diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcomes will be assessed by patient questionnaire and medical record documentation, where appropriate, and include evaluation of:
The rate of pre-surgical referral of appropriate patients to genetic counseling
The rate of referral of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who are not appropriate for genetic counseling referral
The rate of genetic counseling uptake
The rate of bilateral mastectomy, including the rate of bilateral mastectomy among patients receiving different genetic test results
Psychosocial outcomes:
Perceived risk for future primary breast cancer and for ovarian cancer will be assessed
Knowledge of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer will be measured
Cancer-related distress will be assessed using answers from the patient questionnaire
Satisfaction with the decision regarding surgical treatment will be assessed
Provider knowledge outcomes from the educational session will also be assessed</description>

             including In situ and Invasive cancer, Stages 0 - III. Pathologic confirmation of
             diagnosis is required.

        Participant Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous diagnosis of cancer except for non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Stage IV breast cancer

          -  Received HBOC genetic counseling or mutation testing prior to diagnosis. If the
             patient was previously tested only for a variant of uncertain clinical significance
             (i.e., not for known familial mutation, Jewish ethnicity panel/Multisite 3 or
             comprehensive sequencing) and documentation is provided, they remain eligible.
