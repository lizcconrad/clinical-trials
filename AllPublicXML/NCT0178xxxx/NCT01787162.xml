      Goal of the study is to assess the frequency of pulmonary hypertension in patients with
      chronic myeloproliferative diseases. In each patient an echocardiography at rest will be
      performed. In patients without musculoskeletal disease an exercise test (spiroergometry) will
      be performed. Patients with elevated SPAP at rest or with reduced exercise capacity (peak VO2
      &lt; 65%) a right heart catheterization (RHC) will be recommended. Also patients with advanced
      NYHA functional class (III or IV) or with typical PH findings in electrocardiogram will be
      advised to undergo a RHC. Additionally for the evaluation of exercise capacity a 6 MWD will
      be performed.

      This work- up of patients allows clinical and hemodynamic evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous small studies and clinical cases have suggested a possible association between
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD). MPD may cause PH
      through different mechanisms as: high cardiac output, asplenia, direct obstruction of
      pulmonary arteries by megakaryocytes, chronic thromboembolic endothelial pulmonary
      hypertension (CTEPH), porto-pulmonary hypertension (POPH). However, the exact prevalence of
      PH in this group of disorders is not known.

      This study is designed to identify the pulmonary vascular changes and describe the prevalence
      of pulmonary hypertension (defined in this study as mean pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (mPAP) ≥25mmHg as assessed by right-heart catheterization (RHC) or systolic pulmonary
      arterial pressure (sPAP) ≥37mmHg (2.9 m/s) assessed by echocardiography.
