  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) on
      electrocardiogram results (recordings of the electrical activity of the heart) in healthy
      volunteers after a single therapeutic dose (300 mg) and a single supra-therapeutic dose (4
      times higher [1,200 mg] than the anticipated therapeutic dose of 300 mg). The safety and
      tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance), single-center,
      double-blind (neither investigator nor volunteer knows the identity of the assigned
      treatment), double-dummy (a technique for retaining the blinded nature of the study when the
      treatments do not look identical), placebo-controlled (one of the treatments is inactive),
      positive-controlled (one of the treatments has a known potential effect on electrocardiogram
      results), four-way cross-over study (all volunteers will receive each of the 4 treatments but
      in a different order) to assess the effect of canagliflozin (a drug currently being
      investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) on electrocardiogram results in
      healthy volunteers. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a double-blind
      treatment phase, and an end-of study (or follow-up) phase. Volunteers will be assigned to 1
      of 4 treatment sequence groups (ADBC, DABC, BCDA, or CDAB). The treatment sequence will be
      decided by randomization. Treatment A will be a single dose of 300 mg of canagliflozin.
      Treatment B will be a single dose of 1,200 mg of canagliflozin. Treatment C will be a single
      dose of placebo (inactive medication). Treatment D will be a single dose of 400 mg of
      moxifloxacin (an antibiotic with known potential to affect electrocardiogram results). Each
      treatment will be given during a treatment period of 2 days duration; each treatment period
      will be separated by a washout period (when no medication is given) of 10 to 14 days. Each
      volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 61 days.

    <description>QT intervals (assessment of the electrical activity of the heart) will be measured from 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) readings and will be corrected for heart rate. The corrected QT intervals (QTc) obtained following single doses of 300 mg canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754), 1,200 mg canagliflozin, and 400 mg moxifloxacin, will be compared with QTc intervals obtained following dosing with placebo.</description>
