      The purpose of this study is to examine risk factors associated with infant growth and the
      development of obesity in the first year of life. The investigators plan to establish a
      racially and ethnically diverse southern cohort of 800 mother/infant dyads, followed
      regularly from birth to 12 months of age. The cohort will be residents of Durham, North
      Carolina (NC) and the immediate surrounding area. The proposed longitudinal study will
      examine factors contributing to the development of obesity, including dietary behaviors,
      physical activity and inactivity, stress, and sleep duration and quality. Frequent in-home
      assessments throughout infancy and contact with other care providers will help pinpoint
      exactly when children begin to gain weight excessively and will identify risk factors related
      to energy intake, energy expenditure, stress, and sleep associated with obesity.
