  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to address the question of whether antacids or multivitamins influence the
      pharmacokinetics of raltegravir when co-administered. The aim of this study is to optimise
      the dosing of raltegravir when co-administered with antacids or multivitamins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, prior to
             participation in any screening procedures and must be willing to comply with all study
             requirements.

          -  ≥ 18 years

          -  Male or female subjects

          -  A female may be eligible to enter and participate in the study if she:

          -  Is of non-child-bearing potential defined as ether post-menopausal (12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea and ≥ 45 years of age)or physically incapable of becoming
             pregnant with documented tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or

          -  Is of child-bearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at screening and agrees
             to use one of the following methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy

          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of IP,
             throughout the study and for at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of all study
             medication

          -  Clinically relevant alcohol or drug use or history of alcohol or drug use that will
             hinder compliance with treatment, follow up procedures or evaluation of adverse
             effects

          -  Use of proton pump inhibitors

          -  Exposure to any investigational drug or placebo within 4 weeks of first dose of study
             drug

          -  Consumption of grapefruit and oranges or products containing grapefruit or oranges
             within 1 week of first study drug and for the duration of the study

          -  Use of any other drugs including over-the-counter medications and herbal preparations,
             within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug

          -  Previous allergy to any of the constituents of the pharmaceuticals in this trial
