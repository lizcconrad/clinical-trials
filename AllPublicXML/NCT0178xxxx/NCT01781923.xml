    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to collect preliminary data on the efficacy of a cognitive
      remediation program in improving the neurocognitive deficits in children with chromosome
      22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). This study involves a two part approaching including a
      computerized cognitive remediation program (CCRP, Posit Science, CA) in combination with a
      Social Cognitive Training (SCT) program. The computer-based training program has shown
      encouraging results in improving learning deficits in individuals with schizophrenia and we
      now seek to adapt them to children with 22q11DS, who have unique needs due to their lower IQ
      and high risk of psychosis in late adolescence and adulthood. The SCT is a small-group
      intervention program based on cognitive enhancement therapy, which has been shown to improve
      social cognition and functionality in adults with schizophrenia. A preliminary study will be
      performed using this two-pronged approach, to establish the feasibility and gather
      preliminary data on neurocognition before and after the intervention in these children; these
      data would enable a larger randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy of this
      approach.
