    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if cilengitide given in combination with
      bevacizumab can help to control glioblastoma. The safety of this drug combination will also
      be studied.

      Cilengitide is designed to block the flow of blood to cancer cells, which may help to slow or
      block the growth of cancer.

      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of new blood vessels, which may help to slow or
      block the growth of cancer.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 4 weeks. The length of any study cycle may be extended if you experience
      side effects from the drugs.

      Cilengitide will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion (into a vein) 2 times a week during
      each 4-week cycle. The infusion will last about 1 hour each time and will be separated by at
      least 72 hours.

      Bevacizumab will be given on as an IV infusion over 90 minutes on Days 1 and 15 of each
      cycle. After several infusions and depending on how you react, the length of time of the
      infusion may decrease.

      If the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest and depending on how you react to
      bevacizumab, the length of the infusion time may be decreased.

      On the days you are scheduled to receive both cilengitide and bevacizumab, you will receive
      cilengitide after the bevacizumab infusion.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, urine and blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine
      tests.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, your blood pressure will be measured and blood (about 1 tablespoon)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will complete the MDASI-BT questionnaire.

        -  Urine and blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease (only at Cycles 2, 4,
           6, 8, and so on.)

      On Day 15 of Cycles 2 and beyond, your blood pressure will be measured.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After your last dose of the study drugs, you will have and end-of-treatment visit and the
      following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam including measurement of your weight and vitals.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a neurologic exam.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will complete the MDASI-BT questionnaire.

        -  Urine and blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up phone calls.

      Long-Term Follow-Up Visit:

      After you have stopped taking the study drugs and completed your end-of-treatment visit, the
      study staff will call you 1 time every 6 months to check on how you are doing. Each phone
      call should last about 5 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Cilengitide is not FDA approved or commercially
      available. At this time, the combination of cilengitide and bevacizumab is being used for
      research purposes only.

      Up to 39 participants will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 20 will be enrolled at
      MD Anderson.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma (GBM) will be eligible
             for this protocol. Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade
             glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a glioblastoma is made. a) Central
             pathology review is required for study entry. Either H &amp; E stained slides from
             diagnosis or more recent tumor sampling OR unstained tumor sections must be submitted
             and reviewed by the study neuropathologist. b) A paraffin-embedded tumor block
             (preferred) or 15 unstained tumor section slides are required to be submitted at the
             time of registration.

          2. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for
             the release of their protected health information. Patients must be registered in the
             MD Anderson Cancer Center Office of Multicenter Clinical Research (OMCR) database
             prior to treatment with study drug.

          3. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years old.

          4. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;/= 70

          5. At the time of registration: Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of
             prior therapy: &gt;/= 28 days from any investigational agent, &gt;/= 28 days from prior
             cytotoxic therapy (&gt;/= 7 days from prior daily administered [i.e. metronomic]
             cytotoxic agents) , &gt;/= 14 days from vincristine, &gt;/= 42 days from nitrosoureas, &gt;/=
             21 days from procarbazine administration, and &gt;/= 7 days for non-cytotoxic agents,
             e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer
             does not count). Any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents
             should be directed to the Study Chair.

          6. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC &gt;/= 1,000/mm3, platelet count of
             &gt;/= 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin &gt;/= 10 gm/dl), adequate liver function (SGOT &lt; 2.5
             times ULN and bilirubin &lt; 2 times ULN), and adequate renal function (creatinine &lt; 1.5
             times ULN) before starting therapy. These tests must be performed within 14 days prior
             to treatment start date. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by
             transfusion.

          7. Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by
             MRI or CT scan. A scan should be performed within 14 days prior to treatment start
             date and on a steroid dose that has been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. If
             the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration a new
             baseline MR/CT is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used
             throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.

          8. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: a). They have recovered
             from the effects of surgery and are at least four weeks from craniotomy or at least 1
             week from stereotactic biopsy. b). Residual disease following resection of recurrent
             GBM is not mandated for eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of
             residual disease post-operatively, a CT/ MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in
             the immediate post-operative period or at least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14
             days prior to treatment start date. If the 96-hour scan is more than 14 days before
             registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If the steroid dose is increased between
             the date of imaging and registration, a new baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable
             steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

          9. Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater
             than or equal to 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry
             unless there is a new area of enhancement consistent with recurrent tumor outside of
             the radiation field, or there is histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor.

         10. Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic
             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation
             necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium scanning, MR spectroscopy or
             surgical/pathological documentation of disease.

         11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented
             within 14 days prior to treatment start date.

         12. Prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) within normal limits and
             partial thromboplastin time (PTT) below upper limit of normal.

         13. No evidence of hemorrhage on the baseline MRI or CT scan other than those that are
             stable grade 1.

         14. Patients must be at first or second relapse. Relapse is defined as progression
             following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if that was used as initial
             therapy). The intent therefore is that patients have no more than 2 prior therapies
             (initial and treatment for 1 relapse). If the patient had a surgical resection for
             relapsed disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the
             patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as 1 relapse. For
             patients who had prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a
             high-grade glioma will be considered the first relapse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy other than as
             specified in the protocol.

          2. History of coagulation disorder associated with bleeding or thrombotic events.

          3. Any significant concurrent disease, illness, or psychiatric disorder that would
             compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with consent, study participation,
             follow up, or interpretation of study results, including legal incapacity or limited
             legal capacity.

          4. Co-medication that may interfere with study results; e.g. immuno-suppressive agents
             other than corticosteroids

          5. Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics

          6. Requires anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists, heparin, or thrombin or
             factor X inhibitors. (Low molecular weight heparin is allowed)

          7. Have had a diagnosis of another malignancy, unless the patient has been disease-free
             for at least 12 months following the completion of curative intent therapy, with the
             following exceptions: a). Patients with treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ
             carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the disease-free
             duration, are eligible for this study if definitive treatment for the condition has
             been completed. b). Patients with organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of
             recurrent or progressive disease based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values are
             also eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical
             prostatectomy has been performed.
