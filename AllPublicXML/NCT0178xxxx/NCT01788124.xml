      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comfort of two type of speculums used during
      routine gynecologic exam. Your treatment and medical care will not change because you are
      participating in this study. Your doctor will continue to make all decisions regarding your
      proper treatment and care.

      Speculum examination is a common procedure in the gynecology clinic used for evaluation of
      numerous conditions such as vaginitis, and during cervical cytology screening (PAP smears).
      The speculum is inserted into the woman's vagina and used to keep the vaginal walls apart
      during exam and procedures. Each step of the examination with a speculum including insertion,
      manipulation during examination, and removal can cause discomfort for the patient. Fear of
      examination pain is considered one barrier to examination compliance. Any method to decrease
      discomfort during the exam would be considered beneficial to patient screening.

      Typically two types of speculums are used in clinical practice, metal and plastic. There are
      advantages to both, and usage is usually predicated by physician preference. Previous studies
      have demonstrated a clear difference in patient comfort between metal speculums and newer
      dilating speculums such as the Vera scope (1). Clinical trials have also shown the benefit of
      using lubrication on metal speculums during routine exams (2). To date there are no clinical
      trails to examine the difference in patient comfort between metal and plastic bi-valve
      speculums.
