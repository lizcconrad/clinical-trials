  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in HIV-infected individuals. There are
      insufficient data correlating concentrations of anti-TB drugs with treatment response. We
      hypothesize that sub-therapeutic concentrations of anti-TB drugs are associated with
      inadequate TB treatment response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

      During the study periodic monitoring will be conducted to ensure that the protocol and Good
      Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.The monitors may review source documents to
      confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The study site may be subject to review
      by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or appropriate regulatory authorities.

      A CRF will be completed for each included subject and will be signed by the investigator or
      by an authorized staff member to attest that the data is true. Any corrections to entries
      made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and
      should not obscure the original entry. Qualit assurance will as also be performed regularly
      on the CRFs.

      The primary end point will be analyzed using Time to event (cure, death, relapse etc)analysis
      and failure rates and hazard ratios will be calculated accordig to categorical drug
      concentrations with proposed cutt offs.

      Secondary end points will be analysed using time to event for occurence of toxicities which
      will also be corelated to the drug concentrations.
