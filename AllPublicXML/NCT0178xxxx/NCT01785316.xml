      A randomized controlled, open-label, multi-centre study evaluating if Isolated Hepatic
      Perfusion (IHP) increases Overall Survival compared with Best Alternative Care (BAC) in
      patients with isolated liver metastases from uveal melanoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Despite
      successful control of the primary tumor, metastatic disease will ultimately develop in
      approximately 50% of the patients. The liver is the most common site for metastases, and
      about 50% of the patients will have isolated liver metastases. These metastases are generally
      refractory to systemic chemotherapy and the median survival for patients with liver
      metastases is about 6 months. Regardless of treatment, the mortality rate is approximately
      90% at 2 years with only about 1% of the patients surviving more than 5 years.

      Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) is a regional treatment that was first performed more than
      40 years ago (Aust and Ausman 1960). During IHP, the liver is completely isolated from the
      systemic circulation, allowing a high concentration of chemotherapy to be perfused through
      the liver with minimal systemic exposure. In a previous study from our institution, IHP was
      analysed based on improvements in the procedure and the results showed an improved outcome
      together with minimized morbidity and mortality over time.

      A phase II follow-up study confirms that IHP is a promising technique with tolerable
      morbidity. There are yet no randomized trials comparing overall survival in IHP, but in an
      attempt to answer this question the investigators did a register study showing a 14 months
      increased survival when comparing the patients treated with IHP with the longest surviving
      patients in Sweden during the same time period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female aged above 18 years.

             procedures.

          3. Histologically or cytologically proven liver metastases of uveal melanoma. If this is
             not possible at the time of randomization, a biopsy is mandatory before start of
             treatment.

          4. Liver metastases measurable by MRI (preferred) or CT of thorax and abdomen according
             to RECIST version 1.1 with at least one unidimensional measurable lesion ≥ 10 mm. The
             examination should be within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.
