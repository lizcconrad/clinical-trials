  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because the rate of non union of long bone in lower extremities specially in tibia in this
      two last decade due to malnutrition and smoking and other risk factors was increased, so many
      patient in our country suffer from non union on the other hand it seems that the use of the
      mesenchymal stem cells can irritate the union rate. Therefore the investigators decide to
      inject the mesenchymal stem cell derived from iliac bone marrow after centrifuge with ficoll
      procedure to non union site in patient that are resistant to other treatment. Then the
      investigators will follow the patient with monthly radiography and evaluate the callus volume
      and clinical union and any side effect of this treatment.clinical union consider to relief
      pain in non union site and be stable in examination.
