  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if earlier initiation of oral (by mouth as opposed
      to tube) feedings in premature infants results in earlier attainment of full oral feedings
      and/or discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants will be enrolled and randomized at 30 0/7 weeks postmenstrual age. The Earlier Oral
      Feeding group will initiate oral feedings at 30 0/7 weeks postmenstrual age. The Later Oral
      Feeding group will initiate oral feedings at 33 0/7 weeks postmenstrual age. The number of
      oral feeding attempts will be advanced according to a feeding progression protocol for both
      groups. Successful completion of a feeding is defined as oral completion of the full volume
      of a feeding within 30 minutes, without a bradycardic episode (heart rate &lt;100 beats per
      minute) or desaturation (oxygen saturation decrease &gt;5% from baseline values). If infant does
      not successfully complete &gt;95% of the total prescribed volume of a feeding, the remainder of
      the volume will be supplied via gastric tube. All oral feedings will be performed by bedside
      nurses, or by a parent with observation by the nursing staff, with continuous
      cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring. Individual oral feeding attempts for both
      groups will continue until one of the following occurs despite appropriate pacing of the
      feeding: 1) the feeding is completed 2) feeding duration of 30 minutes 3) adverse event
      during a feeding [multiple bradycardic episodes (3 episodes of heart rate &lt;100 beats per
      minute), bradycardia with choking episode, single severe bradycardia (heart rate &lt;60)]. If
      the infant experiences an adverse event during an oral feeding attempt, oral feeding attempts
      will be held for 2 days.
