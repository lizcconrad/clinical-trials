  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of this open, pilot study is to characterize biological parameters
      related to acute kidney injury among patients undergoing a programmed coronarography with
      injection of contrast material. The study focuses on two main factors that may influence
      acute kidney injury: (1) sodium chloride hydration strategy versus sodium bicarbonate
      hydration strategy and (2) presence of oral L-carnitine treatment versus absence of oral
      L-carnitine treatment. We will also test for a potential interaction between these two
      factors.
