  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical evaluation is to evaluate the immediate and long-term (up to
      12 months) outcome of NanoCrossTM balloon catheter (Covidien) in a prospective,
      non-randomised, controlled investigation for the treatment of patients with critical limb
      ischemia (Rutherford 4-5) due to the presence of lesions of minimally 10cm in length at the
      level of the below-the-knee arteries.
