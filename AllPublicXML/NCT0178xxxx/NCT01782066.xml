  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive meningococcal disease is a worldwide problem with serious repercussions for those
      affected. Vaccination is recognized as the best way to combat it. The cost of vaccination is
      prohibitive in many low-resource settings at home and abroad. By harnessing the special
      immunologic properties of the skin, a dose reduction may be achieved by intradermal
      administration of the vaccine. The cost savings associated with dose reduction will increase
      availability of the vaccine.
