  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of vemurafenib
      that can be given in combination with cetuximab and irinotecan to patients with advanced
      cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      Vemurafenib is designed to block BRAFV600 inside the cancer cells, which is involved in
      cancer cell growth.

      Cetuximab is designed to block proteins inside the cancer cell, which may prevent or slow the
      growth of cancer cells and leads to cell death.

      Irinotecan is designed to stop cancer cells from making new DNA (the genetic material of
      cells). If the cancer cells cannot make DNA, they cannot divide into new cells and may die.

      This is an investigational study. Vemurafenib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of certain types of melanoma in patients with BRAF mutation.

      Cetuximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of KRAS wild type,
      EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck.

      Irinotecan is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

      The use of these drugs together in advanced cancer is investigational.

      Up to 33 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide which
      dose level of vemurafenib you will receive. All participants will receive the standard dose
      of cetuximab and irinotecan.

      Dose Escalation Group:

      Up to 3 dose levels of vemurafenib will be tested in combination with cetuximab and
      irinotecan. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.

      The dose of any of the study drug combinations that you receive may be lowered if you have
      intolerable side effects.

      Dose Expansion Group:

      After the highest tolerable dose of vemurafenib is found, additional participants will be
      enrolled in the expansion group and will receive the study drug combination at that dose.
      This group will have up to 15 participants with BRAF mutant, KRAS wild type colorectal
      cancer.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take vemurafenib by mouth 2 times a day. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may
      take it less often. Vemurafenib can be taken with or without food. Always take it with food
      or always take on an empty stomach. Take with full glass of water.

      You will receive cetuximab and irinotecan by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. You
      will be monitored for at least 1 hour after the end of drug infusion.

      Study Visits:

      During Week 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam and your skin will be checked.

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.

      At Week 1 of Cycles 1-2, if you are in a certain group on study, blood (about 2 teaspoons
      each time) will be drawn before your dose of irinotecan and 8 more times over the next 24
      hours for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the
      body at different time points.

      If you are enrolled in the colorectal cancer dose expansion group, you will have a biopsy for
      biomarker testing on Day 14 of Cycle 2.

      Beginning at Week 1 of Cycle 3, you will have EKG every other cycle (once monthly) for 3
      months, and then once every 3 months until the end of the study.

      Beginning at Week 1 of Cycle 3, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing
      every other cycle (once monthly).

      Beginning at Week 1 of Cycle 3, women who are able to become pregnant will have a blood
      (about 2 teaspoons) or urine pregnancy test every other cycle.

      At Week 1 of Cycle 3 and Cycle 5, urine will be collected for routine tests.

      At Week 1 of Cycle 3, if you are in a certain group on study, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will
      be drawn for PD testing.

      Every 3 Cycles, you will have imaging to check the status of the disease. These tests can
      include some or all of the following: a CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan, and/or bone scan. You
      will also have a chest x-ray.

      You will have an additional head and neck exam every 12 weeks while on study.

      All patients will have a chest CT 6 months after their last dose of vemurafenib. SCC patients
      will have additional chest CTs at screening and every 6 months while on study.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as your doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if you continue to
      have intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. At
      this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.
           Â°Your skin will be checked. You will also have a head and neck exam.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to measure
           tumor markers.

        -  If you are in a certain group on study, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK
           testing.

        -  You will have imaging to check the status of the disease. These tests can include some
           or all of the following: a chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan, and/or bone scan.

        -  If you are in the Dose Expansion group and the disease got worse while you were on
           study, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

    <description>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined as highest dose studied in which the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was less than 33%.
DLT is defined as:
Any clinically grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity.
Any grade 4 neutropenia (with or without fever and/or sepsis) or thrombocytopenia (with or without bleeding) lasting at least 1 week or longer
Any grade 3 or 4 nausea or vomiting lasting more than 5 days despite anti-emetics regimens or grade 3 or 4 diarrhea refractory to anti-diarrhea medications
Any other grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity including symptoms/signs of vascular leak or cytokine release syndrome; or any severe or life-threatening complication or abnormality not defined in the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 that is attributable to the therapy
Any toxicity that does not resolve within 7 days of aggressive supportive measures or causes suspension of the drug (except allergy) or a dose reduction should be counted as a DLT.</description>
