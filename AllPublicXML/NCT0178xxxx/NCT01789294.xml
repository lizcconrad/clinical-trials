    <textblock>
      Aim of this prospective, parallel multi-arm, randomized, clinical trial, was to compare the
      clinical outcome of patients Methods.We recruited children who undergone diagnostic
      colonoscopy in Umberto I Pediatric Department (Rome, Italy) from 2008 to 2010. Eligibility
      criteria were: 1) only demonstration of LNH; 2) no concomitant disease; 3) no treatment
      assumed since the clinical onset. Patients were allocated 1:1:1 to dietetic (Group A) vs
      mesalamine (Group B) vs no treatment (Group C) for a 8-weeks period. Skin prick tests and
      patch test for common foods, and symptoms scoring at baseline and follow up have been
      performed by blinded clinicians. Chi-square test for trend was used to compare the frequency
      of symptoms score improvement (&gt;1 point) among groups. The association of baseline features
      of patients with the clinical response was estimated by frequency analysis.

    <textblock>
      Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) of the lower gastrointestinal tract is a common finding in
      pediatric colonoscopies, whose clinical significance is not yet been clearly established.
      Although initially considered to be a normal, age-related variant, some authors recently
      suggested to regard LNH as a marker of food allergy (FA).

    <description>to identify an appropriate management approach for LNH by evaluation of clinical severity and response.
Clinical severity at time 0 and 1 was assessed by Pediatric Gastroenterologists blinded to allocation concealment. Basing on standardized Childhood behaviour checklists questionaire compiled by parents, symptoms were graded using a validated score of abdominal pain (from 0 to 12).
Clinical response was defined as the improvement of at least 1 point in symptom scores from time 0 to 1.</description>
