  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of ventral hernias has remained inappropriately high. Any innovation in order
      to reduce this incidence would be simply cost-effective. Although there is still some concern
      about the use of mesh in clean-contaminated or contaminated surgery, based in our
      experimental studies, we plan to use a mesh in the primary closure of abdominal incision to
      prevent incisional hernias.

      The investigators propose a clinical trial to assess a model to prevent the incisional hernia
      after laparotomy to treat colorectal carcinoma is scheduled. A simple randomization is
      scheduled: in the intervention group a prefascial large-pore low-weight 5 cm wide
      polypropylene mesh is fixed covering the midline closure; in the control group a conventional
      closure with a running suture of long-term absorbable material with a suture/wound length
      ratio 4:1. The sample size was calculated with an estimated incidence of ventral hernia of
      25% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group, 0,05 alfa and a 0,15 beta error.
      The main goal is the appearance of a ventral hernia after 24 months of follow-up. Other
      outcomes are wound complications and morbidity. Exclusion criteria are adult patients with a
      previous ventral hernia, estimated survival of less than 6 months or hemodynamic instability
      during surgery.

      The diagnosis of ventral hernia will be assessed by clinical exploration on 3,6,12,18 and 24
      months and abdominal CT controls at 6,12, and 24 months. The study will be statistically
      evaluated with SPSS 18.0.

The material is a monofilament uncoated suture made of poly-4hiydroxybutirate (Monomax, B.Braun) USP 1. Then, a prefascial large-pore low-weight 5 cm wide polypropylene mesh (Optilene Mesh Elastic, B.Braun) is fixed covering the midline closure. The mesh is fixed in the prefascial plane with absorbable monofilament interrupted sutures, USP 2/0.</description>
