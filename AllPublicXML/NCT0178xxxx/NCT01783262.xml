    <time_frame>The change in the mean Visual Analogic Scale scores from baseline to 3 and 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It is a horizontal line, 10 cm in length with 0 cm labeled &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 cm labeled &quot;worst pain I have ever had&quot;. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state</description>

    <measure>Duruöz Hand Index (DHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in the mean of DHI at 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>is a self-report questionnaire which measures hand functional ability detecting how much difficulty the patient has performing eighteen daily tasks of living in reference to hand function. Each item is scored from 0 (performed without difficulty) to 5 (impossible to do). A total score is obtained by adding the scores of all questions (range 0-90). A higher score indicates greater disability. It was found that this scale is reliable and valid in patients with osteoarthritis</description>

    <measure>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The changes in mean at 3 and 6 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 30-item scale that addresses difﬁculty in performing various physical activities that require upper extremity function (physical function, 21 items); symptoms of pain, activity-related pain, tingling, weakness, and stiffness (pain symptoms, 5 items); or impact of disability and symptoms on social activities, work, sleep, and psychological well-being (emotional and social function, 4 items). The score ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 disability and 100 most severe disability.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  according to the Eaton et al. classification the inclusion criteria involved those
             patients with stage III, participants had to have a history 6 months of pain and they
             were 18 years of age or older. Exclusion criteria were also the presence of
             degenerative or non-degenerative neurologic conditions, in which pain perception is
             altered, a history of coagulopathy, cancer, cardiac pacemaker, calcaneal fracture, and
             pregnancy.
