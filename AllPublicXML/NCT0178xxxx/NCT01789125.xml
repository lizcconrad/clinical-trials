      The primary aim of this research study is to enhance smoking cessation outcome among smokers
      with anxiety disorders. We are comparing two group treatment approaches: (1) An
      educational-supportive psychotherapy and standard smoking cessation treatment, and (2) An
      integrated smoking cessation and anxiety treatment program (START). Both treatments also
      utilize nicotine replacement therapy.
