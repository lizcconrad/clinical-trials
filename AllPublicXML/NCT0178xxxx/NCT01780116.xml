      When compared with those in the control (usual care) group, participants in the AT group are
      expected to demonstrate significant improvements immediately and at three, six and 12 months
      after completion of the intervention in: level of medication adherence, readmission rate,
      mental status, insight into treatment, and level of functioning.

      When compared with those in the control (usual care) group, participants in the AT group are
      expected to demonstrate significant improvements immediately and at three, six and 12 months
      after completion of the intervention in the following aspects:

        1. level of adherence to antipsychotic medication,

        2. rate and length of psychiatric hospital readmission,

        3. mental status,

        4. insight and attitude into illness and treatment, and

        5. level of functioning.

      The primary outcomes are level of antipsychotic medication adherence, re-hospitalization
      rates and mental status; and the patients' drug attitude will be the mediating factor of the
      AT.

    <description>Systematic and highly structured medication adherence program using the motivational interviewing (MI) technique that focuses on six principles: expressing empathy, developing discrepancy between client's beliefs and evidence, supporting self-efficacy, avoiding argumentation, and rolling with resistance to behavioral change. MI is often able (with in-depth behavioral analysis) to focus on particular consequences of problem behavior, such as medication non-adherence, that have an obvious impact on patients.</description>
