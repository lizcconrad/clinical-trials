      The purpose of this study is to determine whether electronic cigarettes can reduce reactivity
      to smoking-related cues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco-related illness causes over 5 million deaths per year in the developed world, and
      most currently available smoking cessation treatments do not effectively enhance long-term
      cessation outcomes. Reactivity to smoking cues is one factor associated with relapse
      vulnerability, which is untreated by cessation aids such as NRT. Combining treatments, which
      ameliorate both pharmacological nicotine withdrawal and reduce smoking cue reactivity, may
      enhance smoking cessation success. During this study we will test whether combining NRT with
      non-nicotine containing electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) effectively reduces reactivity
      to smoking cues. The only source of nicotine participants will receive during the study will
      come from NRT. We will use e-cigarettes that provide no nicotine, yet may provide a similar
      experience to smoking as e-cigarettes taste and feel similar to a regular cigarette. However,
      since nicotine delivery is not associated with the act of smoking the reinforcing effects
      associated with smoking behavior may be reduced. Reactivity to smoking cues will be assessed
      using a battery of measures including: self-report, behavioral, and neuroimaging.
