      CHECKLIST-ICU will be a cluster randomized trial to ascertain whether the use of an
      intervention including 1) checklists with assessment of daily goals during the
      multidisciplinary visit, and 2) clinician prompting can reduce in-hospital mortality of
      patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).

      The investigators also aim to describe participant ICUs in terms of the standards for
      intensive care units proposed by the Brazilian National Health Agency (ANVISA).

      Cluster randomized trial involving ICUs in Brazil. ICU is the unit of randomization.

      The trial will have two stages:

        -  Stage I - Baseline data.In this stage we will:

             -  Apply &quot;Safety Attitudes Questionnaire&quot; for the employees of the participating ICU.

             -  Characterize participant ICUs in terms of the standards (RDC nº7/2010, RDC
                nº26/2012 e RDC nº 63/2011) for intensive care units proposed by the Brazilian
                National Health Agency (ANVISA)

             -  Characterize patients: we will collect data from 60 consecutive critically ill
                patients from each participant ICU to describe adherence to measures aimed at
                avoiding ICU complications and clinical outcome measures.

        -  Stage II - Intervention: This is the main stage for data analysis. ICUs will be randomly
           assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group should use a
           multi-item verbal checklist including assessment of daily goals during the
           multidisciplinary visits plus clinician prompting. We will collect data from 60
           additional patients for each ICU in both study groups and apply &quot;Safety Attitudes
           Questionnaire&quot;.

    <description>Interventions are:
Checklists: The checklists are arranged in a paper notebook (one per patient) with a daily list on each page, as most ICUs do not have electronic health record systems. During the multidisciplinary visit, the checklist items are read aloud by the nurse and answered by participants of the visit. The checklist is applied at least once on all week days preferably in the mornings, although we strongly suggest applying it also on weekend days.
Daily Goals and Clinician Prompting: During the clinical discussion of each patient and the application of the checklist, the intensivists write down the daily goals in a standardized form and read them aloud to the team. Every afternoon between 3 and 5 PM, a nurse reviews the daily goals and takes note of any pending items. Subsequently, the nurse prompts the on-call physician, requesting solutions for these pending items.</description>
