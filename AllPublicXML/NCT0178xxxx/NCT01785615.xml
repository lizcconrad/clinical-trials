  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known regarding the association of individual components of the metabolic syndrome
      (MBS) and prothrombotic, inflammatory and preclinical cardiac structural and functional
      markers in women with this syndrome. Less is known about adequate treatment as the
      pathological mechanism of this syndrome is not well understood.

      The purpose of this study is two fold;

        1. To determine basic differences in biochemical and cardiovascular structural markers in
           women with and those without MBS and their association with the individual components of
           MBS.

        2. To determine the impact of atorvastatin to lower the risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome.
           Atorvastatin is one of the most effective drugs approved by the United States Food and
           Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of high cholesterol. It belongs to a class
           of drugs called statins and its role in primary prevention is still unclear. Thus this
           population seems to be an ideal group that may benefit from this intervention.

      The first phase of the study is an observational phase as previously described. The second
      phase was a prospective evaluation of the effect of a well known &quot;statin&quot; drug (Lipitor) on
      different biochemical factors measured in the blood. The eligible study participants had
      blood work done upon enrollment and if criteria was met(according to the Adult Treatment
      Panel III), they were given dietary counseling (NYHA - New York Heart Association Step 1
      diet) as a lead in phase. Lab work was repeated at 3 weeks to evaluate the impact of the diet
      and if participant's profile still met criteria for MBS,randomization for either atorvastatin
      (Lipitor) 80mg or placebo (sugar pill) for 12 weeks took place.

      <recruitment_details>Approximately 250 women volunteers were screened and 140 were selected to go on to the first phase of the trial. After a 6-week period of a run in diet phase, 24 did not return to start randomization. Out of 116 women, 6 failed to meet MBS criteria by one ATP III element.</recruitment_details>

        <description>Approximately 30 ml of blood was collected in two serum (red top), four 3.2% (0.105M) sodium citrate (blue top) Vacutainer® tubes and a syringe at each visit. Collected samples were centrifuged within an hour of collection at 3000xG for 15 minutes at 20°C to obtain platelet-poor plasma and complete serum separation. Each sample was sent to the University of Rochester Clinical Laboratories for testing. The ratio of Apo B to Apo A1 ratio was calculated.</description>

        <description>Approximately 30 ml of blood was collected in two serum (red top), four 3.2% (0.105M) sodium citrate (blue top) Vacutainer® tubes and a syringe at each visit. Collected samples were centrifuged within an hour of collection at 3000xG for 15 minutes at 20°C to obtain platelet-poor plasma and complete serum separation.

        <description>Approximately 30 ml of blood was collected in two serum (red top), four 3.2% (0.105M) sodium citrate (blue top) Vacutainer® tubes and a syringe at each visit. Collected samples were centrifuged within an hour of collection at 3000xG for 15 minutes at 20°C to obtain platelet-poor plasma and complete serum separation. Each sample was sent to the University of Rochester Clinical Laboratories for testing.</description>
