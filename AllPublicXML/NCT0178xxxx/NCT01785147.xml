      Clinical study which aim is to assess in heavy smokers willing to quit smoking the efficacy
      and the safety profile of BP1.4979 for smoking cessation on the total abstinence measured by
      subject diary and confirmed by exhaled CO (abstinent &lt; 10 ppm).

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure of efficacy will be 4-week prolonged abstinence from smoking cigarettes at the end of 12-week double-blind treatment phase (i.e. from V3 to V4).
The continuous abstinence measured by subject diary and verified by exhaled CO (abstinent &lt; 10 ppm) will define response to the treatment.</description>
