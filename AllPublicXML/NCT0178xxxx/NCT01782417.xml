  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanics are affected by arthritis at a slightly lower age-adjusted rate compared to
      non-Hispanic whites and African Americans. However, compared to other groups, Hispanics have
      a higher prevalence of arthritis-attributed activity limitations (primarily related to OA),
      are less likely to receive hip replacement independent of health care access, and are less
      likely to receive knee replacement. The study is conducted to develop and test a telephone
      delivered intervention for the management of OA in Hispanic adults. This study is conducted
      as a minority supplement to the Patient and Provider Interventions for Managing
      Osteoarthritis in Primary Care (PRIMO) NCT01435109 and Pro00022836.

      Arthritis affects approximately 50 million adults in the United States (US), making it one of
      the most common causes of disability in this county. In addition, is associated with
      significant physical activity limitations, increased prevalence of obesity, decreased health
      related quality of life, and increased health care costs. Hispanics are affected by arthritis
      at a slightly lower age-adjusted rate compared to non-Hispanic whites and African Americans.
      However, compared to other groups, Hispanics have a higher prevalence of arthritis-attributed
      activity limitations (primarily related to OA), are less likely to receive hip replacement
      independent of health care access, and are less likely to receive knee replacement. In
      addition, there have been very few interventions to improve either medical or behavioral
      aspects of OA treatment recommendations among the Hispanic population. The study will
      developed and test a culturally appropriate Spanish educational materials and telephone
      scripts for the patient- and provider-based interventions and will test the patient and
      provider intervention in a group of Adult Hispanics with OA.
