      BK infection is an important cause of graft dysfunction and graft loss after renal
      transplantation. It has been widely accepted that emergence of BK virus correlates with the
      more potent immunosuppressive agents used to lower acute rejection rates. In contrast to
      other opportunistic infections after transplantation, for which routine prophylactic agents
      are administered, there is no effective agent for the prevention of BK infection. Some data,
      however, suggests that quinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin may have activity against
      BK virus. This has led us to investigate whether routine, short-term ciprofloxacin
      administration post-transplant can lower the incidence of BK infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BK virus is a member of the virus family polyomaviridae (&quot;polyoma&quot;). The virus, which can
      manifest as a viral nephritis, was first described in a renal transplant recipient in 1971,
      however it was not until the past decade that infection with BK virus became known as an
      important contributor to graft dysfunction and graft loss after renal transplantation. It has
      been widely accepted that emergence of BK virus correlates with the more potent
      immunosuppressive agents currently used to lower acute rejection rates. In contrast to other
      opportunistic infections after transplantation, for which routine prophylactic agents are
      administered, there is no effective agent for the prevention of BK infection, nor is there an
      effective agent for treating BK infection once it occurs.

      Ciprofloxacin is a well known anti-infective agent in the fluoroquinolone class of
      antibiotics. It is most active against gram-negative enteric pathogens, and is commonly used
      for a variety of infectious indications.

      Though classified as antibacterial agents, fluoroquinolones have been suggested to exhibit
      anti-BK viral effects by interfering with helicase activity of the BK virus large T antigen.
      Ciprofloxacin has been shown in previous studies to reduce urine BK viral load, and
      BK-associated hemorrhagic cystitis in the stem cell transplant population. Ciprofloxacin has
      also been associated with a lower incidence of BK viremia in one retrospective study in
      kidney transplant recipients. Based on these reports, the investigators hope to find a
      reduction BK viremia and BK nephropathy using a prospective, randomized study design.
