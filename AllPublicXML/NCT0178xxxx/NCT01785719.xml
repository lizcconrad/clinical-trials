      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of weight loss on ovarian morphology,
      metabolism, and body composition in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome
      (PCOS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders occurring in
      women of reproductive age. PCOS is considered a syndrome of ovarian dysfunction that is
      characterized by the heterogeneous clinical manifestation of infrequent or absent menstrual
      cycles, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Since the majority of patients
      also present with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and/or other risk factors for
      metabolic syndrome, there is a definite need for the development of therapeutic strategies to
      help these women lose weight and improve their metabolic and reproductive function.

      At present, there is evidence to suggest that the loss of as little as 5-10% of body weight
      through prescribed diet and lifestyle interventions can improve symptomology in women with
      PCOS. However, the mechanism whereby weight loss specifically stimulates ovulation and
      restores menstrual cyclicity is unclear. Hence, the goal of this study is to explore the
      effects of weight loss on ovarian morphology, metabolism, and body composition in overweight
      and obese women with PCOS. The researchers believe that a dietary intervention based on the
      nutritional recommendations of the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and supported by
      the Obesity Society and American Diabetes Association, will reduce the degree of metabolic
      disturbances and consequently restore healthy ovarian follicle development in women with
      PCOS.

      To accomplish these objectives, 30 overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m^2) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2)
      women with PCOS will be evaluated every-other-day by 3D transvaginal ultrasonography during a
      4-week baseline interval and 12-week commercial weight loss program (Nutrisystem® D).
      Participants will range in age from 18 - 38 and will not have used hormonal contraception,
      fertility therapies, or insulin sensitizers in the three months prior to enrollment.
      Ultrasound scans of the ovaries will be assessed for the total number and size of follicles
      using both two- and three-dimensional imaging techniques. Participants will have blood
      samples collected every visit to track changes in LH, FSH, estrogens, and progesterone during
      the scanning interval. The following metabolic parameters will be assessed at Week 2 of the
      baseline interval and Weeks 6 and 12 of the commercial weight loss program: (1) 75-gram oral
      glucose tolerance test to characterize glucose and insulin dynamics at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120
      minutes post-glucose ingestion; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify body fat
      and lean muscle distribution; (3) vitals and anthropometry assessment to measure waist and
      hip circumference, height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, and (4) fasting blood
      tests to detect androgens (i.e., total testosterone, androstenedione, free androgen index)
      and serum markers of metabolic syndrome (i.e., lipids and hemoglobin A1C).

      Further, to evaluate the effects of ovarian morphology, metabolism, and body composition on
      sustained weight loss and/or weight maintenance in overweight and obese women with PCOS,
      participants will be invited to return six months after their intervention is complete. The
      aforementioned procedures, including transvaginal ultrasound, 75-gram oral glucose tolerance
      test, DXA, vitals and anthropometry assessment, and fasting tests will be repeated.

    <description>Participants will be enrolled in 12 weeks of the Nutrisystem® D weight loss program; a portion-controlled, low calorie and low glycemic index meal delivery system that provides 1250-1500 calories per day. Nutrisystem® D has been proven to help overweight individuals achieve real and sustainable weight loss results. When meals and snacks are consumed as instructed, typical weight loss is 1-2 lbs per week, for an average loss of 8% body weight by the end of 3 months. Nutrisystem® D offers a balanced meal plan consistent with the nutritional recommendations of the USDA Dietary Guidelines and American Diabetes Association; individuals can still consume all of their required micro- and macronutrients, but with fewer calories.</description>
