      The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that immediate elbow motion is safe after
      anterior submuscular ulnar nerve transposition, and will not result in disruption of the
      repaired flexor pronator origin, under which the nerve is placed. The advantages of immediate
      elbow motion after submuscular ulnar nerve transposition for performing activities of daily
      living and self-care are evident, however theoretical advantages include early &quot;gliding&quot; of
      the transposed ulnar nerve with a lower risk of nerve adhesions and subsequent traction
      neuritis, as well as improved blood flow and quicker, more complete, recovery of nerve
      function.

      A group of 44 consecutive patients that are determined to be candidates for anterior
      submuscular ulnar nerve transposition based on history, positive findings on physical
      examination, and confirmatory electrodiagnostic testing will be prospectively randomized to
      either immediate motion or long arm cast immobilization after surgery. All patients will be
      counseled about the two postoperative treatment options (immobilization followed by protected
      range of motion versus immediate range of motion), risks involved with each treatment
      protocol, postoperative follow-up and need for radiographs. If they choose not to
      participate, they will be treated by the same postoperative protocol currently used by the
      principal investigator: arm sling at rest for six weeks with intermittent active assisted
      range of motion exercises.
