  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noisy breathing is commonly caused by a floppy voicebox which is a condition called
      laryngomalacia. The cause of laryngomalacia is not fully understood, but some studies have
      suggested that it could be due to acid escaping from the stomach and spreading up the
      swallowing passage to the throat (acid reflux). This affects about 1 in 100 newborns and is
      therefore one of the most common reasons for infants to see Otolaryngologists at BC
      Children's Hospital (BCCH). These infants can have a spectrum of distressing symptoms
      including squeaky breathing, choking, difficulty feeding, failure to gain weight, and
      episodes of turning blue (due to lack of oxygen).

      At present, Otolaryngologists at BCCH will sometimes give children with laryngomalacia
      medication to reduce the amount of acid they make in their stomachs, in the hope that this
      will reduce their symptoms of laryngomalacia. It has never been scientifically confirmed
      whether anti-reflux medication will benefit these children any more than doing nothing at
      all.

    <description>This score is a disease-specific quality of life measure for laryngomalacia. Each of the symptoms that can occur in laryngomalacia are scored as present (1) or absent (0) as follows - inspiratory stridor, suprasternal retraction, substernal retraction, feeding difficulty, choking, post-feeding vomit, failure to thrive (i.e. poor weight gain with deviation from the normal growth curve), and cyanosis. Therefore for each patient, a total symptom score is calculated (8 = all symptoms, 0 = no symptoms).</description>

Although this is an effective anti-reflux medication in this population, its use is off-label, and like any medication has potential risks, particularly in very young children. Side effects that have been described include abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and cough. Although omeprazole is usually a safe medication, we do not currently know if it provides any benefit in laryngomalacia.</description>
