  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent detrusor overactivity (DO) after transurethral prostatectomy results in
      symptomatic failure in more than one third of the patients. Storage symptoms are major
      complaints in the early postoperative period after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate
      (HoLEP). Levels of the urinary nerve growth factor (NGF), produced by bladder urothelium and
      smooth muscle, are increased in the patients with overactive bladder (OAB), and decreased
      after the OAB symptoms were improved. Also, urinary NGF levels are increased in patients with
      benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), but the changes of the NGF levels after relief of the BPO
      by the medical or surgical treatment have not been fully investigated. If the elevated
      urinary NGF levels are reduced after successful surgical treatment of BPO, measurement of
      urinary NGF could be a useful objective tool to assess the therapeutic outcomes of the
      operation.

      The aims of this study are to measure the urinary NGF levels in patients with BPO and to
      compare the results between the patients with detrusor overactivity (DO) and without detrusor
      overactivity (Non-DO), average 2 weeks before Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate
      (HoLEP) procedure. After HoLEP, urinary NGF levels are rechecked at the periods of
      postoperative 3 months and 6 months, and compare changes between the two groups.

      -  Investigators are going to enroll age-matched control group and measure the urinary NGF
           levels as a baseline value (30 males).

        -  Investigators are going to enroll BPO patients group (DO group 50 and Non-DO group 50
           patients).

        -  Administration of the anti-cholinergic agents was reported to decrease urinary NGF
           levels. Investigators are going to try to avoid the effect of anti-muscarinic drugs.
