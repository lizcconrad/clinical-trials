  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated circulating levels of certain amino acids (the building blocks of protein) are
      strongly associated with insulin resistance. This study will investigate the metabolism of
      these amino acids in individuals with normal glucose metabolism compared to overweight or
      obese pre-diabetic individuals. The purpose of this study is to determine how elevated levels
      of the branched-chain amino acids may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and
      ultimately diabetes. An additional purpose is to determine whether exercise or gastric bypass
      (GBP) surgery intervention can correct aberrations in branched-chain amino acid metabolism as
      insulin sensitivity improves. This information will be used to further our understanding of
      the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in at-risk populations and
      potentially improve clinical treatment of such conditions.
