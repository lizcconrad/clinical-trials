    <textblock>
      The COPD Research Registry is a confidential database of individuals diagnosed with COPD or
      at risk of developing COPD. The Registry was established in 2007 by the COPD Foundation with
      the purpose of providing a mechanism for researchers to boost enrollment in clinical trials
      and other research studies. The COPD Foundation is working with National Jewish Health in
      Denver, Colorado to serve as the Registry's Data Coordinating Center and to ensure strictest
      confidentiality of participant information.
