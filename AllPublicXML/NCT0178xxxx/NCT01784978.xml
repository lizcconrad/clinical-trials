    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the progression-free survival, of patients who
      receive rotations of sunitinib and everolimus versus patients who receive sunitinib as a
      first line treatment followed by everolimus when progression occurs.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized phase II study to investigate the feasibility of
      alternating cycles of treatment with sunitinib and everolimus compared to sequential
      treatment of sunitinib followed by everolimus.

      The study population consists of adult patients (over 18 years old) with clear cell mRCC
      (Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer) who have not received prior therapy for their metastatic
      disease.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the progression free survival, feasibility and
      safety profile of the experimental arm compared to standard of care.

      In the experimental arm alternating treatment will consist of repeating cycles of 24 weeks of
      treatment consisting of 12 weeks of sunitinib 4weeks on 2 weeks off, 50 mg pd followed by 12
      weeks of everolimus 10 mg per day 11 weeks on 1 week off in patients with metastatic clear
      cell renal cancer. The comparative arm will be the standard regimen of sunitinib (50 mg pd
      4/2) until progression, followed thereafter by everolimus (10 mg per day continuously, 11/1)
      until progression.
