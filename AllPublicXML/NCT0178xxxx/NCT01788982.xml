  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the treatment of thyroid cancer with the so called targeted therapy the angiogenesis
      pathway has several potential targets. The Receptors for Vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and especially VEGFR-2 is considered to be crucial for the initiation of the formation
      as well as the maintenance of tumor vasculature.

      In thyroid cancer these VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2), VEGF itself and receptors of the
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and for the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are often
      overexpressed. Other cells as pericytes and smooth muscle cells that are also involved in
      tumor angiogenesis express these receptors as well.

      Inhibitors of the VEGFR or PDGFR pathway have been tested in thyroid cancer with positive
      results. However there is no treatment that is generally considered as standard of care for
      patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) or medullar thyroid cancer (MTC) who have
      progressed on one line of therapy. The classical cytotoxic chemotherapy has not shown a
      clinically meaningful benefit yet.

      Nintedanib is a triple angiogenesis inhibitor which inhibits receptors of VEGF, FGF and PDGF.
      Therefore it might act not only on endothelial cells but also on pericytes and smooth muscle
      cells. Nintedanib also interacts with other kinases such as RET. Because of this multi-kinase
      activity rationale exists to investigate the effect in MTC and DTC.

      Because it targets these three major angiogenesis signaling pathways it might prevent further
      tumor growth and related tumor escape mechanisms. Therefore nintedanib may be active in
      patients who have progressed on agents that target only one pathway.

             measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and for at
             least 6 months after the last study treatment. A highly effective method of birth
             control is defined as those which result in low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per
