  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for subjects with a type of skin cancer called melanoma. The main purpose of
      this study is to examine the safety of the study drug (Poly-ICLC) in patients with your
      disease. The study team would like to know about any side effects a patient may have when
      given the study drug. Another goal of the study is to determine if combining dendritic cells
      and the study drug can be possibly used as a vaccine for your disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cells are cells that are present in your body's immune system that help your body
      fight disease. This is a vaccine trial, as your own cells will be extracted (removed),
      treated in a lab, then re-administered to your body with the study drug in hopes of creating
      an immune response to the disease. It is not guaranteed that your disease burden will be
      reduced by participating in this trial.TScreening tests will be conducted to determine
      whether or not subjects can participate in this study. If subjects are eligible and choose to
      participate, they will have a procedure called leukapheresis. The leukapheresis product that
      is collected from you will be taken to a special lab at MUSC where it will undergo a process
      that will grow additional dendritic cells under controlled conditions in the lab. These cells
      will be given together with Poly-ICLC therapy when you begin study treatment. Some days you
      will receive both Poly-ICLC and dendritic cells, but on other days you will receive the
      Poly-ICLC by itself. After study treatment, subjects may be asked to return to MUSC
      approximately every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter for follow
      up procedures.

    <description>Poly-ICLC is considered an investigational drug and has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of your disease. It is currently being tested in clinical trials for brain tumors, lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and prostate cancer. It is thought that Poly-ICLC, when used with dendritic cells as a vaccine therapy, may work to help the immune system fight disease.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma
             that is metastatic and/or unresectable. If the histologic diagnosis is based on a
             metastatic site, the histology must be compatible with melanoma.

          -  Patients must be HLA-A2 positivity by serological testing.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1

             contribute to prolonged PT/PTT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have any serious uncontrolled acute or chronic medical condition
             that would interfere with this treatment. Examples would include active acute or
             chronic infection requiring antibiotics, uncontrolled cardiovascular, endocrine, or
             infectious disease.

          -  Patients must not have significant ongoing cardiac problems, myocardial infarction
             within the last six months, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, uncontrolled
             arrhythmia or congestive heart failure.

          -  Surgery less than or equal to 14 days prior to study registration

          -  Patients who have had prior radiation or chemotherapy in which the last treatment
             administration is less than or equal to 28 days prior to registration. Patients who
             have had prior treatment with ipilimumab or Interleukin-2 will be allowed as long as
             this 28 day wash-out period is followed.

          -  Patients who are breast feeding or have a positive pregnancy test (if female).

          -  Patients with active CNS lesions are excluded (i.e., those with radiographically
             unstable, symptomatic lesions). However, a patient treated with stereotactic therapy
             or surgery is eligible if the patient remains without evidence of disease progression
             in the brain and is stable for 1 month. Whole brain radiotherapy is not allowed, with
             the exception of patients who have had definitive resection or stereotactic therapy of
             all radiologically detectable parenchymal lesions.

          -  Patients must have no plans to receive concurrent chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy or any other type of therapy for treatment of cancer while
             on this protocol treatment.

          -  Due to the undetermined effect of this treatment regimen in patients with HIV-1
             infection and the potential for serious interaction with anti-HIV medications,
             patients known to be infected with HIV are not eligible for this study.

          -  Due to the possibility of harm to a fetus or nursing infant from this treatment
             regimen, patients must not be pregnant or nursing. Women and men of reproductive
             potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method.

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years.
