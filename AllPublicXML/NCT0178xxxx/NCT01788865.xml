      Prospective, Multi-center, open label, single arm Study

        1. Treatment

           - Covered self-expandable dual-layered metallic mesh Stents(cSEMS) are implanted in
           patents with malignant ureteral obstruction

        2. Follow up

             -  Assessments including X-ray(KUB), are done 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the
                procedure.

             -  Diuretic RI scan (DTPA, MAG-3) 3, 6, 12 months after the procedure

             -  Imaging such as IVP(Intravenous Pyelogram), ultrasonogram, CT(Computed Tomogram)
                are performed at 6 and 12 months.
