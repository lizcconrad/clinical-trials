    <textblock>
      One hundred patients with the diagnosis of posterior blepharitis based on history taking and
      proper physical examinations by two experienced ophthalmologists will include in the study.

      Patients will diagnose with posterior blepharitis if they score at least one in two symptoms
      (based on a subjective grading scale) and two signs (based on an objective grading scale) of
      posterior blepharitis according to study criteria. Patients will exclude if they have the
      following criteria: age&lt; 12 years old,history of previous ocular or lacrimal surgery,previous
      usage of contact lenses,any history of ocular allergy,history of systemic diseases with
      ocular involvement (except rosacea), history of usage of topical or systemic antibiotic in
      the last month, pregnancy or lactating mothers, liver failure and any history of sensitivity
      to cyclines.

      Qualified patients then randomly receive oral azithromycin (2 of 250 mg capsules for the
      first day and 250mg for the next 4 days) or oral doxycycline (100mg capsule every 12 hours
      for one month) in a double-blinded fashion. each patients in both treatment groups will
      accurately instruct to apply warm compress and eyelid scrubbing 2 times a day for 5 minutes
      each in the treatment period. Symptoms and signs were recorded for each patient in two
      treatment groups at baseline visit (before treatment) and then in the days 7, 31, 37 and 61
      after treatment.

    <measure>Change of Blepharitis Symptoms Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the baseline until 61 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Five main ocular symptoms of posterior blepharitis (itching, foreign body sensation, dryness, burning, and lid swelling) will be asked of each patient and graded at baseline, and days 7, 31, 37 and 61 after treatment. For each item there was a question with scale from zero to three (zero for no symptom three for maximum symptom). Therefore, maximum score for symptoms was 15 (worse outcome) and minimum score for symptoms was zero (better outcome). Finally, we reported a change in total score calculated as the latest time point (61 days) minus the earliest time point.</description>

    <description>Total severity score was a combined score of symptoms and signs. For symptoms, there were five items and for signs there were seven items. Each items had three scales form Zero (no symptom) to three (severe symptom). Therefore, there was 12 items to calculate total severity score. Maximum score was 36 (worse outcome) and minimum score was zero (better outcome). A change in total severity score calculated as the latest time period (61 days) minus earliest time point.</description>

    <description>lid margin debris, lid margin redness, Meibomian gland (MG) secretion, occluded MG, conjunctival redness, tear brake up time and ocular surface staining at Baseline, and days 7, 31, 37 and 61 after treatment were measured. For each items there was a question with scale form zero to three (zero for no sign to three for maximum sign). Therefore, maximum score for signs was 21 (worse outcome) and minimum score was zero (better outcome). We calculated a total score for signs. Finally, we reported a change in total score calculated as the latest time point (61 days) minus earliest time point.</description>

        <description>Five main ocular symptoms of posterior blepharitis (itching, foreign body sensation, dryness, burning, and lid swelling) will be asked of each patient and graded at baseline, and days 7, 31, 37 and 61 after treatment. For each item there was a question with scale from zero to three (zero for no symptom three for maximum symptom). Therefore, maximum score for symptoms was 15 (worse outcome) and minimum score for symptoms was zero (better outcome). Finally, we reported a change in total score calculated as the latest time point (61 days) minus the earliest time point.</description>

          <title>Change of Blepharitis Symptoms Score</title>
          <description>Five main ocular symptoms of posterior blepharitis (itching, foreign body sensation, dryness, burning, and lid swelling) will be asked of each patient and graded at baseline, and days 7, 31, 37 and 61 after treatment. For each item there was a question with scale from zero to three (zero for no symptom three for maximum symptom). Therefore, maximum score for symptoms was 15 (worse outcome) and minimum score for symptoms was zero (better outcome). Finally, we reported a change in total score calculated as the latest time point (61 days) minus the earliest time point.</description>
