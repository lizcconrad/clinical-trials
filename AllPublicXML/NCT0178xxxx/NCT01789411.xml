  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AtheroRemo-IVUS study aims to investigate the relation of coronary plaque phenotype and
      vulnerability as determined by intravascular ultrasound and near infrared spectroscopy with
      genetic profile and novel circulating biomarkers. AtheroRemo-IVUS is a prospective,
      observational, cohort study of patients who underwent coronary catheterization for acute
      coronary syndrome or stable angina pectoris. Prior to the catheterization procedure, blood
      samples were drawn for biomarker measurements and genetic analyses. Subsequent to the
      catheterization procedure, intravascular ultrasound is performed in a non-culprit coronary
      artery. In patients who are also participating in the AtheroRemo-NIRS substudy, near-infrared
      spectroscopy is additionally performed in the same non-culprit vessel. Primary endpoint is
      the presence of vulnerable plaque as determined by intravascular ultrasound. Secondary
      endpoint is long-term incidence of major adverse cardiac events. Results from AtheroRemo-IVUS
      are expected to improve our knowledge on the role of genetic profile and inflammation in the
      development of atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaques. Furthermore, novel biomarkers and
      intracoronary imaging techniques will be validated in this study.

          2. Patients with stable angina pectoris (CCS Class 1, 2, 3 or 4) or unstable angina
             pectoris (Braunwald Class 1-3, B-C) or patients with documented silent ischemia or
             patients with an acute myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI).
