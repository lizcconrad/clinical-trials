    <textblock>
      To achieve the goal of trachoma control as mandated by the World Health Organization,
      countries must reduce the backlog of trichiasis surgery cases to less than 1/1,000 of their
      population. However, these cases reside in rural villages in trachoma endemic districts, and
      finding them to offer services is a challenge. Community Treatment Assistants (CTAs) are
      village residents who are trained to offer Mass Drug Administration (MDA) to their
      communities and hence are in contact with most residents. A training guide and tool for
      screening for trachomatous trichiasis (TT) will be developed to train CTAs in rural Tanzania
      to identify cases in their communities and refer them to surgery. Compared to the current
      process by which CTAs passively screen for TT if cases complaint, investigators hypothesize
      that the trained CTAs will identify twice the usual number of TT surgery cases during ongoing
      community antibiotic administrations for trachoma and will also miss fewer cases. If this
      simple system is effective, it can be implemented widely to screen communities for cases of
      TT.

      Residents from thirty-six villages holding MDA, for whom a complete census is available, will
      be randomized on a 1:1 basis to intervention (where the CTAs receive the enhanced training
      from the enhanced training team) and usual assessment (where the CTAs receive the usual
      instructions from the regular MDA team). In both arms, the CTAs will keep records of all
      cases they have screened as positive for TT amongst the residents.

      A Master TT grader will grade all screened cases of TT to determine the rate of true
      positivity in both arms.In addition, he will examine a random sample of residents who are
      screened as negative to detect potentially missed cases and estimate the total burden of
      trichiasis cases in both arms as well.The assessments of the Master TT grader will serve as
      the gold standard for calculations of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
      predictive values of the enhanced training versus usual assessment methods.

      <pre_assignment_details>Community Treatment Assistants(CTAs) in intervention arm received an additional half-day training and TT screening card in addition to training received by CTAs in usual care arm. All MDA participants 15 years and older were screened for TT.Senior grader re-screened all TT cases identified by CTAs along with a selected random sample in both arms.</pre_assignment_details>

    <limitations_and_caveats>While use of CTAs in TT screening during MDA offers clear advantages, this approach is limited to areas that merit MDA.
Attrition of CTAs may also prove to be a limitation for this screening approach.</limitations_and_caveats>
