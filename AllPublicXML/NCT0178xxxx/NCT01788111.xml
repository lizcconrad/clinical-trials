    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the occurrence of neck and back pain in a
      population of commercial helicopter pilots, and investigate factors related to the profession
      that can cause these problems. The project has a biological approach assessing the supporting
      and stabilizing muscles (multifidus) in pilots with chronic back and neck ailments. Pilots
      with low back problems are invited to a controlled intervention trial to investigate whether
      one can achieve improved spinal health with a rigid training r√©gime. Primary trial outcome is
      improved neck and back multifidus muscles pathology and function as assessed by the extent of
      fat infiltration -as visualized on MRI - and the volume and ability of the lumbar multifidus
      muscles to contract as shown with ultrasound. The perceived effect on spinal health with sick
      leave frequency is also evaluated.
