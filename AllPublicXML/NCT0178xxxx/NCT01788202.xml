      When it is safe to administer general anesthesia to the patient with cocaine positive urine
      drug screen has never been clearly determined. The study doctors would like to determine the
      effect of cocaine on blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm during surgery. After surgery, the
      subjects will be observed in regards to mental status and any changes in heart rate and
      rhythm.

    <textblock>
      The risks associated with administering general anesthesia to cocaine abusing patients with a
      positive urine cocaine metabolite is a major cause of cancellation of surgery in many trauma
      centers. Although many clinicians wait 24 to 48 hours after a positive urine drug screen
      before administering anesthesia, no standard or practical guidelines have yet to determine
      when it is safe to proceed with general anesthesia in this patient population. Due to the
      lack of guidelines for these cases, the rate of cancellation of procedures for these patients
      is high. The frequent cancelling of such cases causes a waste of resources, personnel, and
      time. The risks associated with cocaine use that cause most clinicians to cancel cases are
      mainly due to the cardiovascular effects of cocaine. Increases in blood pressure, heart rate,
      temperature, and the potential for myocardial infarction and fatal arrhythmias are what
      clinicians fear when administering general anesthesia to these patients. However, due to the
      urgency of some of the cases, it would be beneficial to both the patient and institutions to
      know when it is safe to proceed with the case and when it is not. When it is safe to
      administer general anesthesia to the patient with cocaine positive urine drug screen has
      never been clearly determined. This observational study will evaluate the effects of general
      anesthesia on the cocaine abusing patient with cocaine positive urine drug screen.
