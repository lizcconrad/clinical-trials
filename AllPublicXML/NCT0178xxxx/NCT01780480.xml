    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of the dynamic combination therapy on Chinese herbal granule formula
      (Fangji) based on differentiation of syndromes (&quot;Zhenghou&quot;) according to the theory of
      traditional Chinese medicine for improving the symptoms in the convalescent phase of ischemic
      stroke, and to establish the pharmacodynamic model of &quot;Zhenghou&quot; according to the results of
      this trial.

    <description>Based on standard medical care, after evaluated the style of the syndrome (Zhenghou) by an experienced integrative medicine doctor, the patients should be given a combination therapy of a Chinese herbal granule formula twice a day for 4 weeks, which should be selected from 10 kinds of Chinese herbal granules, including 3 gram of Huangqi(Astragalus root), 2 gram of Renshen(ginseng), 2.5 gram of Danggui(Angelica sinensis), 2 gram of Danshen(Salvia miltiorrhiza), 2 gram of Dilong(Geosaurus), 3 gram of Chishao(Radix Paeoniae Rubra), 2 gram of Honghua(Safflower), 2 gram of Chuanxiong(Rhizoma Chuanxiong), 2 gram of Sanqi(Radix Notoginseng), 3 gram of Shudihuang(Radix Rehmanniae Preparata). The Chinese herbal granule formula could be weekly changed according to differentiation of Zhenghou.</description>
