  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by enlarged ovaries, menstrual irregularity
      and hyperandrogenism and is the most common cause of oligoovulatory infertility. Insulin
      resistance with resulting hyperinsulinemia is also common among women with PCOS, along with
      increased risk for dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and related cardiovascular
      consequences. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol with anti-carcinogenic, anti-proliferative
      and pro-apoptotic properties, that has been shown to decrease proliferation and
      steroidogenesis in theca cells, emerging as a potential therapeutic agent in PCOS patients.
      However, little is known about its potential beneficial effect on oocyte quality as well as
      other reproductive outcomes, such as implantation an pregnancy rates. The present study
      evaluates effects of resveratrol on selected biochemical parameters and reproductive outcome
      among patients with PCOS who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF).
