      The purpose of this study is to definitively resolve questions regarding the use of
      multimodal pharmacologic pain management for orthopedic trauma patients in the context of a
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial.

      Also, as a significant proportion of this population develops chronic post traumatic
      osteoarthritis (PTOA), a sub-objective of this study is to examine the etiology and incidence
      of chronic pain and PTOA in this population.

      In this study, will test whether adjunctive analgesic therapy during the pre and
      peri-operative period, in addition to standard of care pain management, can improve overall
      pain control and pain related outcomes without increasing analgesic related side effects.

      Patients will be randomized into three treatment groups. The intervention will begin within
      48 hours of admission and continue for no longer than two weeks or up to the time of
      definitive fixation.

      Group 1: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral placebo, plus intravenous and
      oral placebo for 48 hours at each surgical procedure.

      Group 2: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (meloxicam), plus intravenous NSAIDs (ketorolac) and oral
      placebo for 48 hours at each surgical procedure.

      Group 3: standard pain management, plus up to two weeks of oral pregabalin, plus intravenous
      placebo and oral pregabalin for 48 hours at each surgical procedure.

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of standard pain management (Group 1) vs. standard pain
      management plus pre and peri-operative NSAIDs (Group 2 - meloxicam + ketorolac) in the
      treatment of severe lower limb fractures.

      Hypothesis 1a: When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management,
      patients treated with NSAIDs will: (1) have reduced post operative opioid utilization; (2)
      report reduced levels of persistent pain; and (3) have noninferior rates of surgery for
      nonunion.

      Hypothesis 1b: When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management,
      patients treated with NSAIDs will benefit from (1) improved post operative pain control; (2)
      improved pre operative pain control; (3) reduced lengths of stay; (4) reduced pain
      interference; (5) improved functional outcomes; (6) lower levels of depression and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (7) improved overall health status; and (8) have
      noninferior rates of analgesic treatment related side effects.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of standard pain management (Group 1) vs. standard pain
      management plus pre and peri-operative pregabalin (Group 3) in the treatment of severe lower
      limb fractures.

      Hypothesis 2a : When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management,
      patients treated with pregabalin will: (1) have reduced post operative opioid utilization;
      (2) report reduced levels of persistent pain; and (3) have noninferior rates of surgery for
      nonunion.

      Hypothesis 2b: When compared to patients who received standard of care pain management,
      patients treated with pregabalin will benefit from (1) improved post operative pain control;
      (2) improved pre operative pain control; (3) reduced lengths of stay; (4) reduced pain
      interference; (5) improved functional outcomes; (6) lower levels of depression and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (7) improved overall health status; and (8) have
      noninferior rates of analgesic treatment related side effects.

      Specific Aim 3: Estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of each adjunctive analgesic
      therapy relative to standard of care analgesic therapy in the treatment of severe lower limb
      fractures. Costs will be estimated from both the health care provider perspective and the
      societal perspective. The time horizon for cost-effectiveness analysis will be based on the
      actual period of observation . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated for:
      (a) study group 2 (NSAIDS - meloxicam + ketorolac) relative to standard of care; and (b)
      study group 3 (pregabalin) relative to standard of care. For purpose of cost-effectiveness
      analysis, the effect will be measured as unit change in specific outcome metrics at 12 months
      (or longer period as available) compared to baseline. The following cost-effectiveness
      metrics, all relative to standard of care, will be reported:

        1. incremental cost per unit change in the Brief Pain Inventory

        2. incremental cost per unit change in the Short Muscular Function Assessment (SFMA)

        3. incremental cost per unit change in health state preference (&quot;utility&quot;) as derived from
           the VR-12

      PTOA Pilot Study: Additional funding was received from NIH to conduct a pilot, observational
      study of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), leveraging current resources of the Pain
      study. PTOA is an important outcome in the population to be enrolled in the Pain study.

      The aims of the PTOA Study are to: (1) measure the incidence of PTOA and chronic pain for up
      to 24 months following fracture reduction surgery and (2) quantify the extent to which
      fracture severity and post-reduction contact stress are related to the development of PTOA.
      Accomplishment of these aims will require (1) for all patients in the Pain study: complete a
      PTOA survey at 12 months and at any subsequent visits that are conducted as part of standard
      of care and provide access to all standard of care imaging studies completed during the study
      period and (2) for a subset of 60 pilon fracture patients enrolled in the Pain study for whom
      post-operative CT scans are not standard of care, obtain additional consent for completion of
      a study-funded post-operative CT scan and 24 month radiographic study.

    <measure>Functional Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SMFA (Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment) is a shorter version of the 101-item Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (MFA) questionnaire. The SMFA is a 46-item questionnaire consisting of the dysfunction index and the bother index. The dysfunction index has 34 items for assessment of patient function, while the bother index consists of 12 items designed to detect how much patients are bothered by functional items. The SMFA has been evaluated for reliability, validity and responsiveness in trauma populations. To be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generic Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The generic health status will be measured by the VR-12 instrument from which a VR-6D can be computed for the purpose of a cost-utility analysis. The VR-12 is a multipurpose self-administered generic measure of health status. It was developed to measure health-related quality of life, estimate disease burden and compare disease-specific benchmarks across populations. The VR-12 items measure eight health domains: general health perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical and emotional problems; bodily pain; energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health. The instrument produces a physical health and mental health summary measure. To be assessed at 6 and 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of depressive symptoms will be measured using the nine item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a well validated tool for assisting clinicians in diagnosing depression. There are two components of the PHQ-9: (1) assessing symptoms and functional impairment to make a tentative depression diagnosis, and (2) deriving a severity score. The PHQ-9 is based directly on the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). To be assessed at 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Traumatic Stress (PTSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD will be measured using the standard PTSD Checklist (PCL), a 17-item measure that elicits responses for each of the DSM-IV disorders that comprise the diagnostic criteria for PTSD (intrusive, avoidant, and arousal symptoms). The psychometric properties of the PCL have been well established and it is the most widely used measure of PTSD. Both civilian and military versions are available. The military version will be used for all those patients on active duty at the time of their injury. To be assessed at 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Costs</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Costs for the index hospitalization and subsequent hospitalizations (within one year) will be derived using hospital bills, outpatient bills and professional fees. Hospital costs will be calculated from charges at the revenue center/cost department line level using cost-to-charge ratios (CCRs) computed from the hospital-specific Medicare Cost Reports. Billing data will be supplemented or imputed by identifying medical resource utilization as documented in study case report forms, categorizing resources using standard medical billing codes, and assigning costs based on Medicare fee schedules. Of particular interest will be resource utilization and costs associated with the index hospital admission, surgical procedures for bone grafting and nonunion, subsequent admissions for complications, and post-operative follow-up care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fracture Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Fracture severity will be measured using standard of care CT scans. In severe fractures, this image will be obtained after application of a temporary joint spanning external fixator. Thus, the fracture severity analysis will be based on fractured distal tibias with limb alignment provisionally controlled. After definitive fracture reconstruction, a second CT scan will be obtained at the 3 month follow up time point, for assessment of chronic contact stress challenge. The second CT scan will be obtained for all patients for whom it is standard of care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fracture Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Fracture classification will be obtained using radiographs of the patient's injured ankle at presentation and after each surgical intervention according to standard of care practice. These radiographs will be used for clinical care, to classify the fractures, and at follow-up to assess outcome. Radiographs will be obtained at the time of initial hospital evaluation, immediately following treatment and at follow up clinic visits according to standard of care. Final clinical assessments and radiographs will be obtained as close to 12 months as routine practice allows. At practices where patients are routinely followed for more than 12 months and 24 month clinical assessments and radiographs will be conducted, at which point all study-related activities will be completed. A subset of 60 patients, identified prospectively, will provide an additional CT 3 months following definitive fixation, and will provide a final set of radiographs 24 months following definitive fixation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>PTOA sub-study assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Among patients in the Pain study, data relevant to the development of PTOA will be collected observationally. All radiographic images, including CT scans and x-rays, taken per standard of care in the first year will be obtained. Additionally, for those patients routinely receiving follow-up beyond 12 months, weight bearing radiographs of the ankle taken at between one and two years after injury will be used to assess and characterize the development of PTOA. In the subset of 60 pilon fracture patients actively recruited into the PTOA pilot study, CT scans following definitive fixation, all radiographic images taken per standard of care, in addition to a final set of weight bearing radiographs of the ankle taken at 24 months will be used to assess and characterize the development of PTOA. The presence of PTOA will be determined using the Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) scale.</description>
