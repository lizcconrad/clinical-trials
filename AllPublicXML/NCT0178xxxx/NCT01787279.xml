  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access programme to make Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) available to
      patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B in Morocco. Patients will receive Pegasys
      180 mcg subcutaneously weekly for 48 weeks and efficacy and safety will be recorded during
      treatment and for 24 weeks of follow-up.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Hepatitis C Virus Deoxyribonucleic Acid &lt;10,000 Copies/Milliliter at Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who had Hepatitis B Virus Deoxyribonucleic Acid (HBV-DNA) levels below 100,000 copies per milliliter (mL) at the end of follow-up (at Week 72) were reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Normalization of Alanine Aminotransferase at Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with a normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level at the end of the study was analyzed. Normal ranges for ALT are 7 to 56 International Units/Litre. Participants with ALT less than the upper limit of normal at end of treatment were reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect that is fatal or life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Hepatitis B Virus DNA &lt; 400 Copies/mL at Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who had HBV-DNA levels below 400 Copies/mL at the end of follow-up (at Week 72) were reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Seroconversion at Screening and Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>At Screening and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion is defined as the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with a negative result for HBsAg and the presence of anti-Haemoglobin (HBs) antibodies (a positive result for anti-HBs) determined at Week 48. Blood samples were analyzed to check whether it is HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs antibodies positive.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Combined Response Hepatitis B Virus DNA &lt; 10,000 Copies/mL and Normal ALT at Week 72</measure>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect that is fatal or life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above</description>
