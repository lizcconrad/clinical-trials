  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective observational study on predictors available and on variables of difficult
      intubation adopting Gliscope video laryngoscope routinely.

      Primary hypothesis of the current study is that the rate of difficult intubation with
      Glidescope is low and multiple predictors interact favorably in anticipating difficulties.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All possible factors involved in difficult intubations were included in this prospective
      analysis.

      Main predictors were considered: time to Cormack Lane using Glidescope intubation, Cormack
      Lane score, experience of the operator (staff or resident), number of bag mask ventilation,
      number of intubation attempts.
