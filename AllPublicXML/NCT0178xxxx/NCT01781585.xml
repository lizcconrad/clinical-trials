  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic instability occurs frequently during dialysis treatment and still remains as
      significant cause of patient mobility and mortality. Postoperative hemodynamic optimization
      has been proved to reduce morbidity in high-risk patients. Intracranial pressure increased
      can lead to further structural and functional impairment owing to its deleterious effect on
      the compromised microcirculation and metabolism. This study was to compare the intra-cerebral
      pressure (ICP) and hemodynamic parameters between the sustained low-efficiency dialysis
      (SLED) and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in post- brain tramatic patients.

      Patients and Methods This study was based on a clinical cohort study of the renal failure
      patients in the database of the National Taiwan University Surgical ICU Acute Renal Failure
      (NSARF) Study Group17-21, with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of the National
      Taiwan University Hospital (201107015RC).

      Study protocol

      The inclusion criteria were end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with increased ICP status
      post ICP monitor insertion. We started the study after the hemodynamic stable and acceptable
      ICP less than 20mmHg22. The ESRD patients with active brain hemorrhage, cardiac arrhythmia
      during dialysis, residual urine output, with inotropic equivalent more than 15 were excluded.

      All the patients were ventilated in supine position in controlled-volume mode after stable
      from brain hemorrhage. During data collection, supportive therapies, ventilatory settings and
      vasopressor therapy were kept unchanged. Patients were randomized to receive CVVH or SLED and
      the next day on the other. The ICP monitor was equipped and the indwelling radial artery
      catheter connected to the FloTrac/Vigileo hemodynamic monitoring system and for whom the
      ultrafiltration rate was set around 1.0 kg/8hr to 1.5 kg/8hr according to fluid status.
      Ultrafiltration rate and sodium concentration were fixed during each session.

      Clinical assessment The biochemical parameters were measured using the Toshiba TBA-200FR
      Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (Toshiba, Tochigi-Ken, Japan). When multiple daily measurements
      were performed, the data obtained closest to 8:00 AM were analyzed 23. The baseline
      hemodynamic was defined as average of two hours prior dialysis in each dialysis sessions.
