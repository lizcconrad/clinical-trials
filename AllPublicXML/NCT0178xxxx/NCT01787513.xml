      A randomised controlled trial comparing Internet based cognitive behavioural therapy for
      major depressive disorder plus a cognitive bias modification intervention (OxIGen) version A
      vs. Internet based cognitive behavioural therapy for major depressive disorder plus a
      cognitive bias modification intervention (OxIGen) version B on symptoms of depression and
      negative interpretation bias.

    <textblock>
      Cognitive accounts of depression and anxiety emphasize the importance of cognitive biases in
      the maintenance of disorders. One specific bias is the interpretation of ambiguous
      information. A negative interpretation bias is defined as a systematic tendency to interpret
      potentially ambiguous information in a negative rather than benign way and this bias has been
      associated with symptoms of depression. Research has led to the recent development of
      computerized cognitive bias modification (CBM) techniques to augment such biases and it has
      been suggested that CBM techniques may be useful as an adjunct to current treatments to
      enhance maintenance of treatment gains and minimize relapse rates. The fact that CBM
      procedures lend themselves to being delivered remotely, are cost-effective, and can be
      self-paced in ways that suit the patient make them an ideal candidate for inclusion in the
      Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) programs currently offered through St.
      Vincent's Hospital and the University of New South Wales. Therefore, the primary aim of the
      current trial is to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of adding CBM procedures to
      the existing iCBT modules offered through St. Vincent's Hospital and the University of New
      South Wales. It is expected that iCBT + CBM (active version) will result in superior
      treatment outcomes as indexed by a standardized clinical battery compared to iCBT + CBM
      (control version).
