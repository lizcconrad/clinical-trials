    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the Connective Tissue Motion Measure (CTMM) in low back pain and
      no-low back pain subjects, evaluate the reliability of the CTMM, and examine the correlation
      of CTMM with low back pain symptoms, disability, and functional measures. The investigators
      hypothesize that CTMM will be reduced, on average, in low back pain subjects, that CTMM will
      be reliable with an intra-class correlation greater than 0.8, and CTMM will negatively
      correlate with low back pain symptoms, disability and functional measures.
