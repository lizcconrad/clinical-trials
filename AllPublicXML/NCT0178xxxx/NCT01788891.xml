      This study will help identify which ARV candidates should be prioritized for pediatric use in
      resource-limited settings
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children in resource-limited settings are increasing experiencing treatment failure, as
      defined by virologic, immunologic, and/or clinical criteria. There are few studies of HIV
      resistance mutations in children failing first line NNRTI therapy in resource limited
      settings. The emergence of treatment failure and drug resistance in children on ART
      emphasizes the urgency for developing evidence-based second-line and salvage treatment
      strategies. Pediatric treatment is complicated by a number of factors, including having fewer
      numbers of ARVs approved by drug safety agencies and the lack of pediatric formulations. This
      further shortens the list of available second-line ARVs as compared to adults.

      Despite the growing number of children on second-line therapy worldwide, there are limited
      data on efficacy of second-line PI therapy in children after NRTI-NNRTI failure. There are
      currently no options for third-line/salvage regimens for children in resource-limited
      settings. New drugs and drug classes are approved for use in children by the US FDA but are
      not routinely available outside of high-income settings.

      Also, there are no data on the resistance patterns of children failing second-line therapy in
      resource-limited settings to guide clinical management and ARV procurement. Clinicians need
      evidence-based guidelines for how to manage children with treatment failure, and access to
      the drugs necessary to construct potent and durable third-line regimens.

      TASER-P is a longitudinal observational cohort study to monitor for treatment failure to
      second-line ART in Asian children.

      Blood and hair will be used for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Blood drawn at every visit
      will be used to assess CD4 count, viral load, and other basic chemistry test panel. If
      necessary, drug resistant tests will also be carried out on the blood samples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years old

          -  Have confirmed HIV infection

          -  Are being switched to or treated with second-line ART. Second-line ART is defined as
             the second regimen with a major antiretroviral class switch. For example, a switch
             from an NNRTI-based to a PI-based regimen or vice versa

          -  Caregivers give informed consent. Children will be asked to give assent if they know
             their HIV status and have reached the minimum age to give assent according to each
             site's institutional review board regulations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Started mono- or dual- therapy as the first ART therapy

          -  Failing first-line triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimen

          -  Are being switched to or treated with second-line ART without failure of first-line
             therapy (i.e., for toxicity)

          -  Caregiver +/- child (if asked to give assent) refuses to participate in this study

          -  Have not been enrolled in TApHOD
