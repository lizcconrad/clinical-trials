  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to examine the safety profile and the effectiveness in daily
      clinical practice of adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis participants showing rapid
      progression of structural damage of the joints, who had no prior history of treatment with
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or biological agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study of adalimumab. Each participant
      enrolled when initiating adalimumab treatment and was to be followed up for 24 weeks or until
      discontinuation of the drug.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with their treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Adverse events were collected from the time of informed consent until the completion of the study, up to 26 weeks.</description>

    <description>The DAS28-4(ESR) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health were included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt;3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt;2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with their treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Adverse events were collected from the time of informed consent until the completion of the study, up to 26 weeks.</description>

        <title>Mean Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>The CDAI is a validated measure of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, global health assessed by the participant on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 (cm), and global health assessed by an investigator on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 (cm) were included in the CDAI score. Scores on the CDAI range from 0 to 76. A CDAI score ≥22.1 indicates high disease activity, a CDAI score between 10.1 and 22.0 indicates moderate disease activity, a CDAI score between 2.9 and 10.0 indicates low disease activity, and a CDAI score ≤2.8 indicates clinical remission.</description>

          <description>The SDAI is a validated measure of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, global disease activity assessed by the participant on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 (cm) , global disease activity assessed by an investigator on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 (cm), and serum levels of C-reactive protein (mg/dL) were included in the SDAI score. Scores on the SDAI range from 0 to 86. An SDAI score ≥26.1 indicates high disease activity, an SDAI score between 11.1 and 26.0 indicates moderate disease activity, an SDAI score between 3.4 and 11.0 indicates low disease activity, and an SDAI score ≤3.3 indicates clinical remission.</description>
