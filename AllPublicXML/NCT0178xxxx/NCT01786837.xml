  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Functional Magnetic stimulation (FMS)
      on gastrointestinal motility in patients suffering from chronic constipation due to
      non-neurological issues.

      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the usefulness of FMS as a noninvasive method to
      stimulate the GI motility in individuals with non-neurological constipation by adopting a
      5-week conditioning protocol performed in a hospital outpatient setting. FMS has demonstrated
      the ability to generate significant rectal pressure and enhance GI transit in normal and
      spinal cord injury subjects. With proper abdominal muscle conditioning, FMS may improve
      colonic motility partly due to improved abdominal muscle tone.
