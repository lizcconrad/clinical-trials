  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of normal vs. protein-rich afternoon
      snacks on appetite control, satiety, and reward-driven eating (particularly in the evening)
      in young people. Indices of attention and mood will also be assessed.

      Study hypotheses include the following:

        1. The consumption of a high-protein, soy-rich afternoon snack will lead to significant
           improvements in appetite control and satiety, reductions in food motivation and reward,
           and will delay the drive to eat in normal to overweight young people.

        2. The consumption of a high-protein, soy-rich afternoon snack will lead to reduced
           unhealthy, evening snacking, particularly on foods high in fat and/or sugar, in normal
           to overweight young people.

        3. The daily consumption of a high-protein, soy-rich afternoon snack will lead to
           significant improvements in afternoon alertness, concentration, fatigue, and well-being
           in normal to overweight young people.

      Forty adolescents will participate in the following randomized crossover-design study. Prior
      to the start of the study, the participants will be asked to document their habitual
      breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snack times. The snack patterns and associated testing days
      will be scheduled so that each participant consumes the afternoon snack (or refrains from
      snacking) 3 hours after lunch; however, the time of day when this occurs is based on the
      participant's previous, habitual snack time. Once this is determined, each participant will
      randomly acclimate to the following snack pattern for 3 consecutive days: 1) Higher Protein
      Soy-based Snacks (250 kcal; 40% Protein; 40% Carbohydrates; 20% Fat); 2) Typical, Low Protein
      Snacks (5% Protein; 50% Carbohydrates; 45% Fat); and 3) No Snack.

      On day 4, the participants will consume a standard breakfast, at home, and lunch, at school,
      and will come in to our facility 1 hour prior to their habitual snack time. The participants
      will be placed in a window-less, comfortable room, void of all time cues. They will be
      informed that they will remain in this room for the next 6 hours. The participants will begin
      the testing day by completing baseline questionnaires assessing appetite, satiety, mood, and
      cognitive function. A brain scan will be completed using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) to identify brain activation patterns in response to food stimuli. Following
      the fMRI scan, the respective snack will be given to the participants; they will have 15
      minutes to eat the snack. A second fMRI scan will then be performed. The participants will
      continue to complete the previous questionnaires until they voluntarily choose to eat. At
      this time, the volunteers will be presented with an 'all you can eat' snack buffet. They will
      be permitted to eat as much or as little as they would like to eat over the next 3-hour
      period. The participants will remain in the facility until the full 8-hour testing day is
      completed, regardless of when they requested to eat. Following the 6 hours, the participants
      will be permitted to leave the facility.

    <description>The participants will be asked whether they would like to request a dinner buffet throughout the 5 h post-snack period. When the response is &quot;Yes, I want to eat right now&quot;, the time from snack consumption will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) for Assessing Brain Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>-30 min, +30 min</time_frame>
    <description>Brain activation responses will be assessed before and after the snack during each testing day. During the fMRI brain scan procedure, the participants will be placed in a supine position. A structural scan will be performed to identify anatomical structures. During the fMRI phase, the participants will view a set of photographs. The fMRI paradigm incorporates stimuli from 3 categories of pictures including food, nonfood (animals), and blurred baseline images. The pictures from each category will be presented in blocks of images (10 photographs (of the same type of stimuli) per block). The scan involves 3 repetitions of each block of stimulus-producing images (i.e., food, animal), alternated with blocks of randomized blurred images. The functional scan lasts 7 min and is performed in duplicate. Scanning will be performed at the MU-Brain Imaging Center on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany).</description>

    <description>Computerized questionnaires, assessing perceived sensations of appetite and satiety will be completed throughout the testing days. The questionnaires contain visual analog scales incorporating a 100 mm horizontal line rating scale for each response. The questions are worded as &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; with anchors of &quot;not all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; The following questions will be incorporated:
How strong is your feeling of hunger?
How strong is your feeling of being full?
How strong is your desire to eat?
How much food could you consume right now?
How strong is your feeling of thirst?
How strong is your craving for something sweet?
How strong is your craving for something salty?
Host strong is your craving for something savory?
The Adaptive Visual Analog Scale Software (Neurobehavioral Research Laboratory and Clinic; San Antonio, TX) was used for these assessments.</description>

    <description>Computerized questionnaires, assessing snack palatability and perceptions of the snack will be completed during screening and after the first and last bite of each snack during the acclimation and testing days. The questionnaires contain visual analog scales incorporating a 100 mm horizontal line rating scale for each response. The questions are worded as &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; with anchors of &quot;not all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; The questions assess snack appearance, smell, flavor, texure (feel), liking.

    <measure>Attention &amp; Memory Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>-30 min, + 60 min</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed immediately before and 60 min post-snack using the lap-top based CantabÂ® computerized assessment system. This program consisted of a core battery of tests grouped into 3 main categories including 1) Visual Memory; 2) Working Memory; 3) Executive Function; 4) Attention/Alertness; and 5) Planning. This program has been used in our previous breakfast studies with success.</description>

    <description>Indices of mood state will be assessed immediately before and 60 min post-snack using the on-line, Profile of Mood States, 2nd Edition (POMS2). This program consisted of a core battery of tests with the following sub-categories 1) Tension; 2) Depression; 3) Anger; 4) Vigor; 5) Fatigue; 6) Confusion; and 7) Friendliness.</description>

    <measure>Energy Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>+300 min, 24 h</time_frame>
    <description>Post-snack energy intake will be assessed through ad libitum dinner and snacking assessments. The ad libitum dinner will contain approximately 2,000 kcal and will consist of a chicken, rice, and stir-fry meal, chips, chocolate mints, ice tea, and water. The dinner meal will be consumed in the testing facility. The participants will be instructed to eat as much as or as little as they choose over a 30 min period. All contents will be weighed before the dinner and any remains will be re-weighed afterwards to determine the type and quantity of foods consumed.
The ad libitum evening snacks will contain 3,000 kcal and will include common snack foods. After the testing day is complete, the participants will take the snack packout home and consume any of the foods he/she chooses until going to bed. All contents will be weighed before the packout and any remains will be re-weighed afterwards to determine the type and quantity of foods consumed.</description>
