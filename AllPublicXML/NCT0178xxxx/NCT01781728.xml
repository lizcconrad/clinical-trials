  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are looking to see if a certain dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) may be a viable treatment option for recurrent or residual pancreatic or periampullary
      adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No standard treatment option has yet been established for patients with recurrent or residual
      disease after definitive treatment of pancreatic or periampullary cancers (duodenal,
      ampullary, bile duct). Linac based stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) administered in
      1-3 fractions has been shown to be an effective treatment option for patients with
      unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, achieving local control rates of
      84-92% at one year. Associated late gastrointestinal toxicity rates have been reported to be
      22-25% at 1 year. We hypothesize that similarly excellent local control rates (80-90% at one
      year) with a reasonable rate of toxicity (≤20%) can be achieved using Linac based SBRT
      delivered as 5 Gy x 5 for patients with local failure (remaining disease) after previous
      treatment with conventional chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with or without surgery and as 6.6
      Gy x 5 for radiation-naïve patients with local failure (remaining disease) after previous
      treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy. The toxicities of note for this trial are grade 2
      and greater gastritis, fistula, enteritis, ulcer, or any other grade 3 or greater
      gastrointestinal toxicity.
