      The purpose of this study is to test three hand feeding techniques that can be used to
      provide feeding assistance to persons with dementia - direct hand feeding, hand-over-hand
      feeding, and hand-under-hand feeding.

      Proposed Aim 1: To collect pilot data related to using three hand feeding techniques for
      feeding persons with dementia (PWD) in the nursing home (NH) setting: (1) direct hand
      feeding; (2) hand-over-hand feeding; and, (3) hand-under-hand feeding. Primary outcomes are
      impact on frequency of aversive feeding behaviors, meal intake, and time spent assisting with
      feeding.

      Proposed Aim 2: Evaluate implementation of the hand feeding intervention for larger
      randomized study of feeding techniques.

      Aim 2a: Conduct a process evaluation for method of recruiting, screening, and obtaining
      informed consent of legally authorized representatives (LARs)/ assent of PWD.

      Aim 2b: Establish fidelity to treatment for all three hand feeding interventions.

    <description>Trained Research Feeding Assistants (TRFA), blind to the study outcomes, will assist enrolled PWDs with all three meals for two days using a pre-specified hand feeding technique. Videotaping will occur for two enrolled PWD during the six day time frame to promote efficiency. Coding of the video will be done by a trained Data Technician after meals have been recorded to determine frequency of aversive feeding behaviors, calculate meal intake, and time spent assisting with the meal.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hand feeding techniques</intervention_name>
    <description>Direct hand feeding technique: When the feeding assistant holds the object (e.g., fork, spoon, cup) intended to provide food or fluids to the PWD without any active involvement on the part of the PWD.
Hand-over-hand feeding technique: Occurs when the PWD is holding the object (e.g., fork, spoon, cup) in an attempt to feed/ drink for themselves. If the PWD has trouble with this activity, the feeding assistant puts his or her hand over the hand of the PWD, in an effort to guide/ support/ assist the PWD with the activity.
Hand-under-hand feeding technique: Occurs when the feeding assistant holds the object (e.g., fork, spoon, cup) and places the PWD hand over the top of their hand; therefore, the feeding assistants hand is under the hand of the PWD in a more supportive position.</description>
