  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the initial efficacy of a psycho-social,
      metacognitive-functional intervention for Adults (Cog-Fun - A) with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

      It is hypothesized that participants in the Cog-Fun - A intervention will demonstrate
      improvements in measures of executive functioning, occupational performance and quality of
      life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Cog-Fun - A is a structured occupational therapy intervention for promoting self
      management in adults with ADHD. The protocol comprises three central treatment modules:
      Adaptive self awareness, executive strategies and skill implementation and multi-context
      transfer of strategies and skills.

      The intervention is administered by occupational therapists on an individual basis, once a
      week, over 3-4 months.

      20 participants will be recruited through community advertising. Sample size was determined
      based on expected moderate effect sizes. Data will be collected at the onset and completion
      of the intervention. Data will be analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods.

      Adverse events if occur will be reported to supervising psychiatrist and the Helsinki
      Committee.
