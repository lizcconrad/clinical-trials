  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DHEA is a natural allosteric inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). G6PD is a
      key regulatory enzyme for the survival of synovial sarcoma. The investigators postulate that
      they can inhibit the production of NADPH in synovial sarcoma and cause cell death by using a
      naturally occurring G6PD inhibitor.

    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DHEA (Phase I only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of cycle 1 for all phase I patients (estimated to be 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached.
Dose-limiting toxicities are defined as one of the following events occurring during the 1st cycle of treatment thought to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment:
Grade 3 or greater liver function test abnormalities
Grade 3 or greater psychiatric disorder
Quality of life (QOL) alteration (change in score of 30%)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease) (Phase II only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction inf short axis to &lt;10mm, disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diaters while on study</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of progression-free survival (PFS) (Phase II only)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive disease (PD): aAppearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>

    <measure>Toxicity of DHEA as measured by grade and frequency of adverse events</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or non-resectable
             synovial sarcoma.

          -  Failed at least one line of chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy count
             as a prior line of therapy.

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, as ≥ 20 mm by
             chest x-ray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.

          -  At least 16 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl

               -  Platelets ≥ 50,000/mcl

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ IULN OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with
                  creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Patients using
             antiestrogens for oral birth control are ineligible. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her
             treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 3 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to DHEA or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with DHEA. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Known mania-associated psychiatric disorder.

          -  Known seizure disorder.

          -  Using corticosteroids or estrogen-based oral birth control.

          -  Using drugs known to lower or increase levels of DHEA.

          -  Requires estrogen or testosterone.

          -  Taking warfarin sodium. Patients on other blood thinners should be monitored for
             thrombocytopenia.

          -  Taking a strong inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450. Intermediate inhibitors are
             allowed if deemed medically necessary.
