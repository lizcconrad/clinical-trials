      Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and safety of F-18 THK-5351 PET in Alzheimer's disease
      patients and healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Totally 24 subjects age 20-90 including 12 healthy cognitively intact subjects and 12
      probably Alzheimer's dementia patients with NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. For disease subjects,
      caregiver should be able to report activities of daily living and their mental status.
      Patient should be able to give informed consent or have a caregiver give consent with subject
      assent.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome measures are to evaluate the dosimetry of novel radiotracer F-18 THK-5351 in human.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Time-integrated activity in each organ will be calculated by trapezoidal integration of the first 45 min of the organ's time-activity curve, followed by a single-exponential fit to the remaining data points (based on the 4 whole-body images) extrapolate to infinity, all base on non-decay-corrected data.Residence times will be obtained by dividing the time-integrated activity by the injected amount of activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimal scanning time for brain imaging using F-18 THK-5351.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>PET data will be acquired using SIMENS PET/CT or PET/MRI scanner with an axial field of view of 15.7cm. For PET/CT protocol, a 50-min dynamic brain PET scan (6x10s, 4x60s, 5x180s, 6x300s) will be started simultaneously with the injection of 10mCi of F-18 THK-5351 after a low-dose CT scan for patient positioning and attenuation correction.</description>
