    <textblock>
      Despite surgical and medical innovation have reduced mortality rates in cardiac surgery, the
      disease severity and operative procedural complexity have increased and morbidity rate is
      still high. Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, redefined in cardiac surgery
      &quot;post-cardioplegic injury&quot; (2) as a whole of ischemia-reperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass and
      surgical trauma, has been recognized as a significant contributor to mortality and morbidity.
      I/R injury is classified as reversible or irreversible. Reversible injury includes
      arrhythmias, edema, vascular dysfunction and contractile stunning expressed as low output
      syndrome without cell death and without apparent signs of infarction or other serum injury
      markers. Irreversible reperfusion injury includes apoptosis and necrosis. I/R injury is a
      complex process associated with increase of radical, oxidant and cytokines production,
      complement and neutrophil activation and endothelial activation leading to microvascular
      dysfunction and deterioration of coronary flow reserve. In the hypoxic heart increase
      anaerobic lactate production, K+ efflux and membrane depolarization. The intracellular Na+
      concentration rises as a consequence of slow Na+ channels inactivation and the induction of
      voltage-gated Na+ channel late current component (late INA). Intracellular Na++ accumulation
      enhanced activity of reversed-mode Na+-Ca++ exchanger causing intracellular Ca++ overload and
      ventricular dysfunction. Therefore inhibition of late INA has been shown to be
      cardioprotective. Ranolazine, an FDA-approval antianginal and anti-ischemic agent, high
      selective blocker of late INA, inhibits the late sodium current in myocardial ischemia,
      decreases Na+ and Ca2+ overload and improves left ventricular function in experimental animal
      models. For this reason it was also adjuncted to cardioplegia improving diastolic function in
      isolate Langerdoff-perfused rat hearts. The authors test the hypothesis that ranolazine
      improve myocardical protection in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery with
      cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB).

      We aim to perform a prospective, single-center, investigator-initiated, randomized (1:1),
      blinded, placebo-controlled study. The patients undergoing elective and complete CABG
      revascularization performed by the same surgeon, will be randomized in two different groups
      to receive, in the three days before surgery, Ranolazine at a dose of 375 mg twice daily or
      placebo. After the enrollement in the research according the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, the randomization list will be computer-generated. The study participants, the
      reserchers responsible for data reporting and analysis and the ecocardiographers will be
      blinded to the treatment that each patient will receive. In a previous phase all data for the
      recruitment will be considered and registered before surgery: basic clinical parameters (age,
      gender, height, weight, body surface, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure,
      mean heart rate); medical history (diabetes mellitus type I or II, smoking status, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary desease, systemic arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history
      of cardiovascular events, angina, percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI), previous cardiac surgery, chronic peripheral arterial disease, cerebral
      ischemia, bleeding and chronic renal failure); basic hematologic parameters (creatinine,
      glucose, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell counts and equation, platelets number,
      aPTT, INR); baseline transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) parameters (left ventricular
      ejection function (LVEF), left ventricular volumes, left ventricular regional wall motion,
      diastolic function (mitral inflow velocities as Early diastolic velocity (E), late diastolic
      velocity with atrial contraction (A), and deceleration time (DT), early diastolic velocity
      (e') and late diastolic velocity with atrial contraction (a') using tissue Doppler imaging,
      pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), valvulopathy and aortic desease); assestment of
      risk stratification according to different scores (New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes,
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina grading scale, EUROSCORE II, American Society og
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system); preoperative patient therapy.
      In a following phase laboratory, hemodynamic and imaging evaluation will be carried out
      during and subsequent to CABG surgery. Through a coronary sinus inserted catheter will be
      dosed Troponine I (TnI) immediately before CPB and after the release of aortic cross clamp,
      about 10 minutes after the end of reperfusion. TnI will be also dosed at arrival on intensive
      care unit and 6, 12, 24, 48 h after unclamping of the aorta. Blood samples will be collected
      simultaneously from the radial artery and the coronary sinus before starting CPB and after
      removal of aortic cross clamp to evaluate lactates extraction, oxygen consumption (VO2) and
      oxygen extraction (O2ER), and C-reactive protein (CRP) pre and post-CPB. Hemodynamic
      measurements will be obtained by an arterial and a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) inserted
      before surgery, and will include arterial pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean pressure),
      pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure
      (PAWP), cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), left
      ventricular stroke work (LVSW), left stroke volume variaton (LSVV) and coronary artery
      perfusion pressure (CPP); these measurements will be conducted 30 min after intubation, after
      sternotomy, 10 min after protamin, after sternosynthesis, at arrival in the intensive care
      unit, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 h after CPB. Lastly a transesophageal echocardiographic study will be
      performed by two expert echocardiographers following the protocols of the Society of
      Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (21) and American Society of Echocardiography (22). Left
      ventricle myocardial performance index, LVEF, left ventricular regional wall motion, E/A
      ratio, E', E/E' and deceleration time (DT) of mitral inflow velocity will be measured; these
      measurements will be obteined 30 minute after intubation before sternotomy and ten minute
      after protamin. All collected data will be entered into a database in Excel format.
