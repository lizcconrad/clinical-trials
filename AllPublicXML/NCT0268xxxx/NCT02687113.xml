  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fusion technique of pre-radiofrequency
      ablation (RFA) cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR) and real-time ultrasonography would improve
      feasibility of RFA in patients with liver tumor in comparison with ultrasonography guidance
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RFA is one of commonly used local therapies for primary or secondary liver tumors. For
      successful and safe procedure, safe route of electrode and lesion visibility are essential
      for RFA, and the conditions are usually evaluated on pre-RFA planning ultrasonography (USG).
      However, RFA is sometimes aborted due to limited sonic window of various cause and
      challenging identification of small isoechoic tumors or hepatocellular carcinomas among
      dysplastic nodules . Therefore, precise targeting and assuring safe route would be of
      clinical importance. In this preliminary study, investigators attempted to determine US and
      CT/MR fusion technique would be able to improve RFA feasibility in patients with liver tumors
      in comparison with conventional US alone technique.
