  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty (20) subjects presenting with a renal stone and candidates for FURS (flexible
      ureteroscopic renal surgery) will undergo a single FURS procedure for a kidney stone as part
      of the study, using the study device. These subjects will be randomized into stone breaking
      treatment or stone dusting.
