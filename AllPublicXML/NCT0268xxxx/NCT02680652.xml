      This is an observational, case--control study with a single blood draw among two cohorts,
      patients with CVID and healthy controls. Samples will be analyzed by cytometry (CyTOF) to
      simultaneously examine the major signaling pathways of all circulating innate and adaptive
      immune cell types as well as whole exome sequencing. The goal is to improve our general
      understanding of the human immune response to infections and the diagnosis of CVID.

      Abstract: An increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections is the hallmark of
      explain the study rationale, primary immunodeficiencies (PID). The most common PID requiring
      treatment with Ig replacement (SCIg or IVIg) is Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID),
      which is diagnosed by the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia plus defective responses to
      vaccine antigens. Prior to diagnosis, CVID patients oftentimes develop autoimmunity that
      requires immunosuppression or cancers that require chemotherapy. Unfortunately, difficulties
      arise in making the diagnosis of CVID in adults treated with immunosuppressive drugs,
      steroids, or chemotherapy, preventing the timely use of Ig replacement therapies in these
      patients. Furthermore, CVID is difficult to diagnose in young children. Exome sequencing and
      other genetic methods have thus far failed to identify monogenic causes for CVID because
      these methods result in too many &quot;hits&quot; to specifically validate. At the same time, patients
      with derangements of signaling pathways including STAT1, STAT3, PI3K, and others have CVID,
      suggesting that by examining the signaling pathways, we could find consistent signs of CVID.
      The Investigators propose to use a broad, new screen developed by the PI to study the
      functional defects of human immune responses in CVID. Using time--of--flight mass cytometry
      (CyTOF) and phospho-specific antibodies, the investigators will simultaneously examine the
      major signaling pathways of all circulating innate and adaptive immune cell types at once to
      identify abnormal phosphorylation of signaling molecules in response to a variety of
      canonical stimuli. This method is innovative because it identifies signaling defects in the
      immune response while being insensitive to chemotherapy or immunosuppression, because the
      signaling responses examined are biologically upstream of immunosuppressed targets. Our
      approach generates a new &quot;signaling fingerprint&quot; for facilitating the diagnosis of CVID. Our
      proposal is also impactful, because knowledge gained about functional defects in CVID, when
      combined with whole exome sequencing, will improve the general understanding of the human
      immune response to infections. There are two major aims: 1) studying healthy control subjects
      across a variety of ages as comparisons to CVID patients, and furthermore to generate new
      information about how immune signaling responses change with age, which is currently unknownÍ¾
      and 2) studying CVID patients to identify the consistent aberrant signaling responses that
      will allow the acceleration of diagnosis and treatment. Design of study: The investigators
      propose an observational, case--control study with a single blood draw among two cohorts,
      patients with CVID and healthy controls. Methods: Fifty (50) CVID patients (adult and
      children) will be consented in Dr. Butte's Immunology Clinic at Stanford, and healthy
      controls (100), at the adult or pediatric primary care clinics at Stanford. There will be one
      blood draw of 2 mL of blood to analyzed immediately by Stanford's established phospho-CyTOF
      protocol in the Human Immune Monitoring Core facility at Stanford.

      This screen examines phosphorylation of all circulating immune cell types at once (CD4 and
      CD8 T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and DCs).
      Whole blood from subjects and from controls will be aliquotted into portions, and each
      portion will be stimulated with either cytokines, TLR agonists, anti-TCR or anti-BCR
      antibodies, PMA, or left unstimulated. Treated cells will be surface stained, fixed,
      permeabilized, and stained intracellularly for 12 signaling phospho-proteins, then analyzed
      by CyTOF, which enables measurement of over 50 parameters simultaneously. Data will be
      analyzed in FlowJo and CytoBank software, with further statistical analysis in R.
