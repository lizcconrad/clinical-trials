  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red meat makes a significant contribution to the human diet. The most widely consumed meat
      globally is pork which accounts for 36% of overall meat intake with beef and poultry
      contributing 22% and 35%, respectively. Pork meat provides a range of important nutrients
      including protein, zinc, B-vitamins and a range of important minerals however there is
      accumulating evidence to suggest that consuming red meat and processed meat increases the
      risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colon cancer. Despite these reports of a negative
      impact on health, global pork consumption continues to increase and there are increasing
      efforts to improve the nutritional profile of pork meat through the development of novel
      porcine feed regimens. The manipulation of pig feed to produce 'healthier' meat and meat
      products offers a feasible approach to reduce the risk of preventable disease. Furthermore,
      recent projections of an increased global demand for pork and poultry, particularly in China,
      have highlighted the increasing strain that will be placed on the supply of grains and the
      need to find alternative and sustainable feed ingredients. Macroalgae is emerging as a
      potential sustainable source of novel bioactive ingredients for the animal feed industry with
      some species known to be a good source of protein, minerals, polyunsaturated fatty acids and
      a range of fibre components including fucoidan and laminarin.

      The polysaccharides, laminarin and fucoidan, which are found in abundance in brown seaweed,
      are gaining increasing attention as a potential bioactive feed ingredients with putative
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Incorporation of a
      laminarin/fucioidan mix (LAM/FUC) into the porcine diet was shown to result in lower levels
      of lipid oxidation in fresh pork steaks. Numerous studies to date have also investigated the
      health promoting effects of LAM/FUC through modulation of the porcine gut microbiota which
      was shown to enhance inflammatory cytokine expression in response to pathogen recognition and
      also to increase piglet performance post weaning.

      The uptake and fate of fucoidan in humans remains unknown albeit after consumption, unaltered
      fucoidan has been detected in human plasma after ingestion suggesting at least partial
      bioavailability of this compound. A study by Moroney et al. (2015) using an in vitro
      bioavailability Caco-2 model provided indications that fucoidan was bioavailable and that it
      may have potent antioxidant potential.

      The primary aim of this randomised parallel placebo controlled human intervention trial was
      to investigate if consuming pork meat from pigs supplemented with a LAM/FUC mix, in addition
      to their normal diet, would impact on blood oxidant and inflammatory status of healthy
      adults. The secondary aim was to determine the effect of consuming LAM/FUC fed pork meat on
      lymphocyte DNA damage, lipid status and immune function in healthy adults.
