    <textblock>
      Critical incidents in anesthesia is one of the most valuable methods to assess the safety of
      anesthesia practice among different types of patients. Most of the studies in this regards
      are retrospective with many drawbacks and pitfalls like absence of information in the records
      of the patients.

      In the investigators' study, the investigators will follow the critical incidents among
      patients who underwent surgery under anesthesia whether regional or general over the next two
      years from 2016 to 2018, by examining the patients records from the hospital database and
      recording the events that occur to the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the forthcoming two years, the investigators will study in details critical incidences
      that may occur to patients in the perioperative period like; acute hypoxic event, acute major
      hemorrhage, acute airway obstruction and others that may endanger the life or one of the
      patient organs and whether the patient survive the acute event or die.

      These critical incidences will be collected and all information about it will be known in
      order to be studied and to know were was the defect and eventually to improve the safety of
      practice of anesthesia and surgery.
