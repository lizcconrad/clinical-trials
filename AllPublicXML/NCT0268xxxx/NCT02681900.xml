    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of a self-affirmation manipulation on (i) acceptance of a health
      message detailing the risks of alcohol consumption, (ii) engagement with the health message
      and (iii) alcohol consumption at 7-day follow-up. Half of the participants complete a
      self-affirmation manipulation, where they reflect on their most important values, whereas the
      other half complete a control equivalent, where they reflect on their least important values.
      Immediately post-intervention, all participants then receive information about the risks of
      alcohol consumption and complete measures of message acceptance and engagement with the
      materials. Seven days after intervention, participants self-report their alcohol consumption
      in the previous 7 days.

    <description>Seven days after the intervention, participants are contacted and asked to report their alcohol consumption over the previous 7-day period via self-report items. Participants report the type of alcohol (e.g., beer, spirit), type of container (e.g., small glass, pint, single measure) and the number of each type of drink they had consumed on each day over the previous 7 days using the adapted version (Armitage, Harris, &amp; Arden, 2011) of the timeline fallback technique (Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992). The total number of units consumed by each participant was then calculated using the UK NHS alcohol unit calculator (NHS Choices, 2013: www.nhs.uk/tools/pages/alcohol-unit-calculator.aspx).</description>

    <measure>Effect of intervention on acceptance of health information</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measures to assess whether the intervention affected the extent to which people accepted information about the risks of alcohol consumption were taken immediately after the intervention via self-report items. Acceptance items included personal relevance, negative affect, attitudes, anticipated regret and intentions. Responses to items were given on 7-point scales with relevant anchors (e.g. strongly disagree [1] to strongly agree [7]). A mean score was calculated for each participant on each measure, with higher scores indicating greater levels of that construct.</description>

    <description>Measures to assess whether the intervention affected the extent to which people engaged with the information were taken immediately after the intervention via self-report items. Engagement items included perspective taking, attention, emotion and visualization.

A mean score was calculated for each participant on each measure, with higher scores indicating greater levels of that construct.</description>
