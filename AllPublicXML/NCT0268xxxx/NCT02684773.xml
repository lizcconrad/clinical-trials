    <textblock>
      Background: In 2010, approximately 39000 Canadians had end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and
      the prevalence rate of dialysis has increased by 189% over the past 2 decades. The annual
      mortality rate remains high at ~15%, and cardiovascular events are the leading cause of
      death. Intensification of conventional dialysis schedules has been the major focus in recent
      years. Currently, most Canadian dialysis patients receive conventional in-center hemodialysis
      (CHD), which is administered as a 3-4 hour session 3/week. Recent research has focused on
      home nocturnal hemodialysis (8 hours of hemodialysis at home for 5-6 nights/week), which may
      have substantial cardiovascular benefits, including regression of left ventricular (LV)
      hypertrophy, improved LV ejection fraction and enhanced blood pressure control. Nevertheless,
      this dialysis modality is only feasible in a highly selected minority of ESRD patients who
      can self-manage their dialysis treatment at home. In-center nocturnal hemodialysis (INHD),
      administered as 7-8 hours of hemodialysis in hospital for 3nights/week, represents a
      promising and practical alternative for many dialysis patients. In a Canadian Institutes for
      Health Research (CIHR) supported cohort study, the investigators have recruited 67 patients
      and have completed 1-year follow-up. There is a compelling need for longer-term follow-up,
      since all the published randomized controlled trials are of short duration (6-12 months),
      while renal replacement therapy is a life-long treatment. Furthermore, the observed large
      variability of cardiac remodeling in individual ESRD patients remains poorly understood.
      Therefore, the current study is an extended follow-up phase (5 years from enrollment) on the
      completed 1-year follow-up period and the purpose of this study is to objectively evaluate
      the long-term effects of more intensified hemodialysis treatment which the INHD modality
      offers.

      Need for Long-term and Generalizable Data: In contrast to the seminal Alberta trial which
      showed a significant LV mass reduction with home nocturnal hemodialysis, the recently
      reported Frequent Hemodialysis Network Nocturnal Trial demonstrated only a trend toward
      reduction in LV mass. It is likely that the highly selected participants, inadequate trial
      power and duration (12 months) account for the observed results. Currently, it is unknown
      whether INHD, which is less intensive but more feasible for most ESRD patients, is associated
      with similar cardiovascular benefits in the long term.

      Objective:

        1. To determine the long-term effects of INHD on (i) LV mass; (ii) global and regional LV
           systolic and diastolic function; (iii) myocardial tissue characteristics; (iv) left
           atrial structure and function; (v) selected cardiovascular biomarkers in ESRD patients.

        2. To examine the determinants and mechanisms of cardiac remodeling in ESRD

      Hypothesis: Conversion to INHD is associated with sustained improvements in cardiovascular
      structure and function, as compared to conventional hemodialysis (CHD) in patients with
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

      Study Design and Population: This will be a 2-centre, prospective, longitudinal cohort study
      of 67 adult ESRD patients (INHD subjects and CHD controls) enrolled in the original study.
      All eligible participants who provide consent will undergo cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) examination and bloodwork at 5 years since enrollment in the study. Other follow-up
      procedures include the following -electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiogram, ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring, lateral x-ray of the aorta, and completion of questionnaires.

      Outcome: The primary endpoint is the change in LV mass over 5 years, as measured by cardiac
      MRI. Secondary endpoints include LV size, global and regional diastolic and systolic
      function, left atrial size and function, changes in myocardial tissue characteristics, blood
      pressure, serum troponin, norepinephrine, Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), high sensitivity
      C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6, matrix metalloproteinases, fibroblast growth
      factor-23, fetuin-A, transforming growth factor-beta, connective tissue growth factor,
      clinical events, and quality of life.

      Significance: The provision of an enhanced dialysis regimen has emerged as the most promising
      avenue through which to modify the dismal cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving
      chronic hemodialysis. INHD represents a means of administering such therapy to a broad
      spectrum of dialysis patients for whom home therapies would not be feasible. This study will
      be the first to precisely define the long-term cardiac effects of intensified dialysis and to
      elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac remodeling in ESRD, using cardiac MRI and other novel
      biomarkers. These important observational findings may have a major impact on the optimal
      management and outcome of ESRD patients in the real world.
