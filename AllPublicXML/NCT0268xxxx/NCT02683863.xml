  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether DMF (Dimethyl Fumarate) or MMF (monomethyl
      fumarate) its main bioactive metabolite, is capable of entering the central nervous system in
      SPMS patients that are being treated with Tecfidera®. PK samples (pharmacokinetics - or the
      amount of study drug in blood) will be tested to compare with PK samples, the amount of study
      drug, in spinal fluid (CSF).
