      The goal of the study is to investigate the effects of intranasal oxytocin (OT) or placebo to
      resting state brain activity in healthy males.

    <textblock>
      Although several fMRI studies investigated the neural correlates of OT administration, only
      few have focused on the underlying modulatory effects of OT on baseline brain function. While
      functional MRI examines the neural activity during a certain task, it might be especially
      interesting to assess the main effect of OT on the basic activity of the human brain in rest.
      This resting state activity becomes typically evident in the default mode network (DMN),
      compromising midline structures such as medial frontal cortex, cingulate and precuneus, as
      well as specific resting state networks .

      In fact, a recent study succeeded in demonstrating a modulatory influence of OT. Recent
      studies were able to show an increased functional connectivity at rest of amygdala to the
      medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a small sample of 15 subjects.

      However, distinct subregions of the amygdala seem to be involved in different OT effects. To
      goal of the present study is to decipher the modulatory effects of OT to subregions of the
      amygdala in a larger sample using improved anatomical mapping of the seed regions and relate
      these alterations to individual traits of healthy volunteers. We expected to add evidence to
      the increase of amygdala - PFC connectivity under OT as well as detailed anatomical mapping
      of this networks.
