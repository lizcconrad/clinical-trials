    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by wide fluctuations of glucose. The
      long-acting insulin has showed to improve glycemic variability however the behavior of
      insulin glargine versus insulin degludec is unknown.

      Clinical trial, crossover, double dommy, randomized, parallel group was carried out. The
      sample size was calculated using the formula for clinical trials of mean differences with an
      &quot;n&quot; of 6 patients per group was obtained. Patients between 30 and 65 years of age will be
      included with T2DM, without hiperglycemic drugs, A1C 6.5 to 11.0 % and with written signature
      consent. They were assigned randomly by sealed envelope either to received insulin Degludec
      or insulinGlargine (10 IU SC every 24 hours for six days), patients who were administered
      initially insulin Degludec corresponded then insulin Glargine and vice versa, with a washout
      period of 14 days between each intervention.

      The clinical findings and laboratory tests included a metabolic profile and biosafety, which
      will be made at baseline. Body weight, body fat, body mass index and blood pressure were
      performed during the initial visit, likewise, interstitial glucose concentrations by
      ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring system (Guardian®, Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge),
      through which the mean amplitude of glucose excursions [MAGE] and area under the curve of
      glucose were calculated, which served to assess the glycemic variability. Adverse events and
      adherence to treatment were documented. Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon,
      Chi2, Fisher exact test. It is considered with significance at p &lt;0.05.
