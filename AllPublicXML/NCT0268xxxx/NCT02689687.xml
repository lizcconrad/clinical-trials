    <textblock>
      This study offers remote monitoring devices for weight and medication adherence, combined
      with behavioral economic approaches, to patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). This
      pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of enrollment processes and intervention
      roll-out to inform a randomized controlled trial, to estimate the readmission rate of
      participants, and to assess if and how managing clinicians respond to weight gain alerts
      entered into a participant's electronic medical record.

      The specific aims of this study are: (1) To leverage access to the University of Pennsylvania
      Health System (UPHS) CHF clinic, PennChart (electronic medical record system) resources for
      identifying eligible patients, and the Way to Health (WTH) platform to launch a pilot study
      that will inform a randomized controlled trial; (2) to evaluate the feasibility of the
      enrollment processes and intervention roll-out to inform a randomized controlled trial; (3)
      to estimate the readmission rate of participants; and, (4) to assess if and how managing
      physicians respond to weight gain alerts entered into participant charts in PennChart. In
      this pilot study, no randomization will occur and all participants will receive the
      intervention.

    <description>All participants will be (1) given an electronic pill bottle for their diuretic and a Bluetooth scale; (2) asked to provide the coordinator with name and contact information of a family member or friend to serve as a support partner; (3) will be assigned a 2-digit number to be used as part of the lottery-based engagement incentives in which eligibility to win will be conditional on medication adherence and registering a weight measurement; and, (4) will determine their preferences for Way to Health platform communication methods during the study.</description>

    <description>Participant adherence to stepping on their scale will be monitored on a daily basis and participants will be contacted if they are non-adherent to weighing-in. Participant weight gain will also be monitored, and if weight gain exceeds a specific threshold, the managing physician will be notified through the electronic medical record system. Managing providers will also be sent a weekly report of weight measurements.</description>
