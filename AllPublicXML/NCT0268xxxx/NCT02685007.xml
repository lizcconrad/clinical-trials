  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe ease of use and satisfaction with application of the
      pre-rolled TachoSil in laparoscopic procedures within approved therapeutic indication as per
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

  <detailed_description>

      The drug being observed in this study is called Tachosil. Tachosil is being used in open
      invasive surgery for use as a local haemostatic and tissue sealing. This study will look at
      the application and an overview on the ease of use of pre-rolled form of Tachosil in minimal
      invasive (laparoscopic) surgery, cost analysis along with the evaluation of participant's
      satisfaction with the product.

      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants who will be inpatients. A participant
      can be included in the study when the physician has decided to use pre-rolled TachoSil
      according to the local SmPC and after obtaining informed consent from the patient.
      Participants will be analyzed in a routine setting after surgery.

      Data from all participants will be collected from their files as well as study specific
      questions answered by the treating physician.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in 12 Austrian centers. The overall recruitment
      period is expected for 1 year and six months. Participants will be analyzed from the date of
      surgery till their discharge from hospital.

    <measure>Surgeon's Assessment of Tachosil</measure>
    <time_frame>Post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Likert scale will be used for the assessment of ease of use and overall satisfaction of participant, while using Tachosil. It is a 5-point scale ranges from 1-5, where 1=easy/satisfied to 5=difficult/not satisfied. Higher scores will indicate difficulty and less satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Hospital Stay</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through study completion</time_frame>
    <description>For a participant, duration of hospital stay will include his time spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) and normal hospital station.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgeon's Assessment of Pharmaco-economic Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmaco-economic evaluation will include analysis of cost spent on hospital/ICU stay, avoiding the complications and cost savings based on information to be given by physicians and pecuniary considerations (cost per minute of surgery/day in ICU/day in normal ward).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Intra-Operative and Post-Operative Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 18 months (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug.</description>
