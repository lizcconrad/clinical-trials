  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Because a significant number of
      people with depression do not respond to medication or therapy, alternative treatment options
      are greatly needed. Recent research has focused on brain stimulation methods due to their
      therapeutic utility for treating depression. Yet, current brain stimulation methods have
      drawbacks, including invasive surgery and limited precision in targeting specific areas. A
      novel brain stimulation method, transcranial ultrasound (TUS), is noninvasive, has greater
      spatial precision than most existing methods, and is proven safe for humans. TUS has been
      found to increase positive mood in chronic pain patients. In a double blind study, TUS
      increased positive mood in over 140 healthy undergraduates at the University of Arizona.

      Despite evidence that TUS can increase positive mood in humans, it has yet to be investigated
      whether TUS can increase positive mood in humans who are experiencing chronic low mood or
      depression. The present study will, for the first time, examine whether TUS can improve
      depressive symptoms. Twenty to thirty participants with mild to moderate depressive symptoms
      (Beck Depression Inventory Score between 10 and 25) will be randomly assigned to a TUS sham
      or TUS activation condition. In the TUS activation condition, TUS will be used to stimulate
      the right fronto-temporal area, which has previously been shown to increase positive mood.
      Participants in the TUS sham condition will not receive any brain stimulation. Participants
      will attend five sessions within seven days or ten sessions within fourteen days. At each
      session, in addition to brain stimulation, self-reported mood and depressive symptoms will be
      recorded. Furthermore, the investigators will use electroencephalogram (EEG) to record
      changes in brain electrical signals during TUS stimulation. Based on prior research, the
      investigators predict that mood will increase and depressive symptoms will decrease with TUS
      stimulation.

    <textblock>
      Participants will first complete the online screening and those who qualify to complete the
      study will be contacted via telephone (see above for telephone recruitment and consent
      procedure). After providing informed consent, on the first day, participants will be randomly
      assigned to either a TUS treatment or a TUS sham condition (placebo), and the study will be
      double blind. Participants in the TUS treatment condition (with sham or treatment unknown to
      both participant and experimenter) will have TUS stimulation at the right fronto-temporal
      area five times within seven days or ten times within fourteen days.

      Participants will sign up for the first five sessions first but will be reminded participants
      may withdraw from the study at any time. Should participants choose to continue with the
      second week of treatment, participants will be scheduled for another five sessions. In other
      words, participants will have the option of completing 10 days of the procedure. The
      procedure does not differ between week 1 and week 2. However, participants will be
      compensated less for week 2. Participants will have the option to continue into week 2, as
      participants may find that the treatment is benefiting them. The first, fifth, and tenth days
      of the study will take approximately 2 hours and the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh,
      eighth, and ninth will take only one hour.

      In the sham condition, the ultrasound probe will be placed at the right fronto-temporal area
      five times over the course of seven days or ten times over the course of fourteen days
      without the stimulation. Prior research has shown that stimulation at this area induces
      positive mood change and is implicated in positive mood. On the first, middle, and last day
      of the procedure (day 1, 5, 10), EEG data will be collected. On the second, third, and fourth
      day as well as sixth through ninth days of the procedure EEG data will not be collected and
      only TUS stimulation will occur. Collecting EEG data at these points will allow for
      comparison of resting electrical brain profiles from the beginning of the study to the end of
      the study. Additionally, the investigators will assess state mood and rumination before and
      after TUS, as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms at the end of each day. The state mood
      and rumination will allow us to examine the mood effects of TUS, whereas the depressive and
      anxiety symptoms questionnaires will allow us to examine any changes in these important
      profiles over the course of the study.

    <measure>Depressive Symptoms Assessed With the Beck Depression Inventory-II</measure>
    <time_frame>Once on day 1 &amp; day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is one of the most widely used self-report measures for assessing depression. It includes 21 self-report items. Scores range from 0 to 63, and higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms. In this study, the BDI-II was used to monitor depressive symptoms each day. The outcome is the change in BDI-II score as measured by BDI-II on Day 5 minus BDI-II on Day 1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rumination Symptoms Assessed With the Ruminative Responses Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Once on day 1 &amp; 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Ruminative Responses scale (RRS) consists of 22 statements. It measures rumination, past-focused repetitive thinking that causes and maintains depression. Participants are asked to rate on a scale of 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always) how much they think about various things (e.g. &quot;think about how alone you feel&quot; and &quot;think about all your shortcomings, failings, faults, mistakes&quot;). Scores range from 22 to 88 with higher scores indicating more rumination. The RRS was used in this study to measure symptoms of rumination on the first and fifth day of this study. The outcome is the difference from Day 5 to Day 1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Worry Symptoms Assessed With the Penn State Worry Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Once on day 1 &amp; day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The PSWQ assesses trait worry, a key component of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Participants rate themselves on a scale of 1 (&quot;not at all typical of me&quot;) to 5 (&quot;very typical of me&quot;) for sixteen different statements. Scores range from 16-80, and higher scores reflect higher levels of worry. This scale has been widely used to assess worry and will allow for assessment of worry in the present study (Brown et al., 1992). The PSWQ was used to monitor symptoms of worry on first and fifth day of this study. The outcome measure is difference from Day 5 to Day 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Symptoms Assessed With the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Once on day 1 &amp; day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) assesses severity of anxiety symptoms across anxiety disorders and with subsyndromal symptoms. Participants rate five items on a scale from 0 (indicating no anxiety or impairment) to 4 (indicating severe or extreme anxiety or impairment). Scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety and impairment from anxiety (Norman et al., 2006). The OASIS was used to monitor overall severity of anxiety on each day of the study. The outcome measure is difference from Day 5 to Day 1.</description>

          <title>Worry Symptoms Assessed With the Penn State Worry Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The PSWQ assesses trait worry, a key component of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Participants rate themselves on a scale of 1 (&quot;not at all typical of me&quot;) to 5 (&quot;very typical of me&quot;) for sixteen different statements. Scores range from 16-80, and higher scores reflect higher levels of worry. This scale has been widely used to assess worry and will allow for assessment of worry in the present study (Brown et al., 1992). The PSWQ was used to monitor symptoms of worry on first and fifth day of this study. The outcome measure is difference from Day 5 to Day 1.</description>

        <title>Anxiety Symptoms Assessed With the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale</title>
        <description>The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) assesses severity of anxiety symptoms across anxiety disorders and with subsyndromal symptoms. Participants rate five items on a scale from 0 (indicating no anxiety or impairment) to 4 (indicating severe or extreme anxiety or impairment). Scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety and impairment from anxiety (Norman et al., 2006). The OASIS was used to monitor overall severity of anxiety on each day of the study. The outcome measure is difference from Day 5 to Day 1.</description>

        <title>State Anxiety Assessed With Two Items From the Visual Analogue Mood Scale</title>
        <description>The Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS) asks patients to rate how much they are experiencing eight mood categories on a scale of 0-100. Global Affect and Global Vigor are subscales. The Global Vigor scale includes a number of items related to anxiety (calm, tense) as well as fatigue (alert, weary). Based on decreases that were seen in global vigor, we create a sum variable of only calm &amp; tense items on the VAMS to examine whether state anxiety decreased. Scores range from 0-20, with higher scores indicating more anxiety. This sum variable served as a post-hoc measures of anxiety each day of the study before stimulation/sham, 10 minutes after stimulation/sham, and 30 minutes after stimulation/sham. Outcome is the difference between measure taken 10 minutes after Stim/Sham and measure taken before Stim/Sham. This measure was taken each of the five days and outcome represents the average over all five days from after to before Stim/Sham.</description>

For most participants, they were monitored from Day 1 of participation to Day 5 of participation (Day 1 to Day 5 occurred within 7 days). However, participants had an option to continue the study up to 10 days if they felt it was helpful for their depression. As such, participants could be monitored for up to 10 days of participation (within 14 days).</time_frame>
