          5. History of mental illness or suicide risk, with a history of epilepsy or other central
             nervous system disorders.

          6. Severe arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, frequent superventricular
             tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter) or cardiac degree II or above
             conduction abnormalities displayed via 12-lead ECG.

             past four weeks.

         11. A drug or treatment known to cause major organ system toxicity during the past four
             weeks.

         12. Poor compliance, difficult to complete the study.

         13. Any other conditions that might increase the risk of subjects or interfere with the
             clinical trial.
