  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that is designed to boost your body's
      immune system. It does this by allowing immune cells to grow and fight the cancer. Nivolumab
      has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma (a form of skin cancer) and lung
      cancer. It is currently under study for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer.

    <description>as determined by the investigator using RECIST 1.1 criteria between patients receiving Nivolumab and SBRT and those receiving Nivolumab alone. BOR rate is defined as the number of patients randomized to a given arm with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) of non-irradiated lesions divided by the total number of patients randomized to the given arm. In order to ascertain this endpoint, efforts will be made so that patients will be followed for 96 weeks or until progression of disease (and treatment cessation), whichever comes first. At each time-point, subjects should have CT/MR of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed Written Informed Consent

          -  Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent form
             in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,
             laboratory testing, and other study obligations.

          -  Target Population

          -  Males and females ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic HNSCC, including nasopharynx WHO Type I-III
             histologies; patients can have simultaneous loco-regional disease. Central biopsy
             review at MSKCC is not required.

          -  Subjects must have at least two lesions:

               -  At least one lesion must be safely amenable to irradiation and likely to meet
                  criteria delineated in Section 9.2.1 in the judgment of the treating radiation
                  oncologist. This can be a lesion that was previously irradiated as long as prior
                  radiation was at least 6 months prior to projected first fraction of SBRT and as
                  long as reirradiation dose constraints as outlined in appendix are being met.

               -  A separate, not-to-be-irradiated lesion measurable by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1
                  criteria.

          -  A formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block or a minimum of 3
             unstained slides of tumor sample obtained via excisional, incisional, or core needle
             biopsy from a metastatic or loco-regionally recurrent lesion. A new baseline biopsy
             does not need to be obtained for study purposes. If 3 unstained are unavailable from a
             metastatic or loco-regionally recurrent lesion, with permission of the PI, FFPE tumor
             tissue from the primary disease site at the time of original diagnosis is acceptable.

          -  For oropharynx or nasopharynx primary lesions, documentation of viral status is
             required (e.g. high risk HPV sub-type PCR, p16 IHC, HPV ISH, EBER, etc). Tests done on
             primary tumor specimens from date of initial diagnosis at outside institutions are

             randomization.

          -  Immunosuppressive doses of systemic medication, such as steroids or absorbed topical
             steroids (doses &gt;10mg/day prednisone or equivalent) must be discontinued at least 14
             days prior to Nivolumab administration.

          -  Subjects with an initial magnesium &lt;0.5 mmol/liter (1.2 mg/deciliter) may receive
             corrective magnesium supplementation but should continue to receive either
             prophylactic weekly infusion of magnesium and/or oral magnesium supplementation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 28 days prior to
             randomization.

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding

             weeks after the last dose of investigational product.

          -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or
             surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception.

          -  Azoospermic males and women of childbearing potential who are continuously not
             heterosexually active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, they still
             must have a pregnancy test.

             evidence of progression for at least 8 weeks after treatment for these metastases is
             complete and within 28 days prior to first study treatment.

          -  Histologically confirmed non-squamous histologies are not allowed; an exception is

             enrollment requires approval of a principal investigator.

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune
             disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes

          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration should be excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids and

             absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with Nivolumab, drugs with a predisposition
             to hepatoxicity should be used with caution in patients treated with
             Nivolumab-containing regimen.

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 antibody.

          -  Treatment with any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologics for cancer, or
             investigational therapy within 14 days of randomization.
