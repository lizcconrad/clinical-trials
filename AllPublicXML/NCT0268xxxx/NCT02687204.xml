  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood clots that form in the extremities (deep venous thrombosis) and lungs (pulmonary
      embolus) are feared complications of reconstructive surgery. One in ten patients with
      symptomatic pulmonary embolus will be dead in 60 minutes. Patients with deep venous
      thrombosis can develop the post-thrombotic syndrome, known to be a major driver of poor
      quality of life. These phenomena, broadly known as venous thromboembolism (VTE), have
      substantial downstream ramifications, and the US Surgeon General and the American Society of
      Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), among others, have underscored the importance of VTE prevention in
      surgical patients. Reconstructive surgery, most commonly performed to fix traumatic injuries
      or defects after cancer excision, often involves borrowing tissue from adjacent or distant
      areas on the body; reconstructive surgery patients can routinely have surgical injury
      involving 20% or more of their total body surface area. Injury and resultant inflammation are
      known to increase metabolism of certain drugs, including those used to prevent VTE after
      surgery.

      Enoxaparin is a blood-thinning medication that decreases likelihood of blood clot formation.
      Previous research has shown that reconstructive surgery patients who are given enoxaparin
      after surgery are less likely to develop VTE. However, despite receiving of a standard dose
      of enoxaparin, many patients still develop this life-threatening complication. The
      investigators believe that patients metabolize enoxaparin differently based on the degree of
      surgical injury created during reconstruction, and seek to critically examine enoxaparin
      metabolism in reconstructive surgery patients. The proposed research will evaluate how
      enoxaparin affects the blood based on standard, ASPS-recommended dosing after reconstructive
      surgeries; the investigators will also examine whether the extent of surgical injury alters
      metabolism as well. Enoxaparin effectiveness will be tracked using anti-Factor Xa (aFXa)
      levels. If subtherapeutic aFXa levels are observed, the study will also design, implement and
      test a clinical enoxaparin dose-adjustment protocol to achieve appropriate post-operative
      aFXa levels. Further research based on these data will examine reduction in VTE risk when
      aFXa-driven enoxaparin dosing is used.

      The ultimate goal of the investigators research is to better understand the interplay between
      enoxaparin dosing, degree of surgical injury, and blood clots after major reconstructive
      surgery. Ultimately, this research will expand medicine's understanding of why post-operative
      VTE occurs, will allow the investigators to individualize a patient's VTE prophylaxis
      strategy based on their unique characteristics, and will further improve patient safety after
      reconstructive surgery.
