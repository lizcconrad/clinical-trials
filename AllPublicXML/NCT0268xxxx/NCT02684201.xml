  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with upper-limb amputation usually have intact nerves within the residual limb,
      and studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of those nerves can produce
      sensations that appear to emanate from the amputated limb. In this study, investigators will
      examine the sensations that are produced by electrical stimulation of these nerves at the
      location where they exit the spinal cord. Stimulation of the spinal cord is commonly used to
      treat intractable back and limb pain, and the procedure includes a test phase in which
      electrodes are temporarily placed under the skin near the spinal cord and removed at the end
      of testing. Similarly, in this study, electrodes will be placed near the spinal cord in the
      upper back and neck, and stimulation will be applied over the course of multiple testing
      sessions, lasting less than 30 days. The electrodes will be removed at the last day of
      testing. During each testing session, electrical stimulation will be applied through the
      electrodes and a series of tests will be performed to determine the types of sensations
      produced by stimulation. In addition to producing meaningful sensations with electrical
      stimulation, this study will also test the effect of stimulation on phantom limb sensations
      and phantom limb pain.

      The purpose of this research study is to characterize the types of sensations that can be
      produced by stimulating the spinal nerves in upper-limb amputees, as well as the effects of
      that stimulation on phantom limb pain. The study involves a medical procedure to temporarily
      place one to three stimulation electrodes in the space near the spinal cord. This medical
      procedure will be performed under local anesthesia, and will take approximately one to two
      hours. Afterwards, the electrodes will be connected to an external stimulator and a series of
      experiments will be performed to characterize the types of sensations generated by electrical
      stimulation of the spinal cord and spinal nerves, as well as to measure the effect of
      stimulation on phantom limb sensations and phantom limb pain. Over the course of less than 30
      days, there will be up to 20 of these experimental sessions. At the end of the final
      experimental session, the stimulation electrodes will be removed by gently pulling on them.

      The investigators are inviting participants to consider participating in this research
      because they have an upper-limb amputation. Participants must be between the ages of 18 and
      70 and at least one year post-amputation. Participants must be willing to travel to the
      University of Pittsburgh at least twice per week for 30 days.

      Participants cannot have any serious diseases or disorders that affect your ability to
      participate in this study. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the study
      cannot be included. The investigators will ask females of child-bearing potential to undergo
      a urine pregnancy test prior to any procedures (such as MRI, x-ray, fluoroscopy) that may
      disrupt the healthy development of an unborn child. If participants are currently taking any
      medications that thin their blood, participants will not be eligible for this study.
      Participants will have to meet other criteria to be eligible, which will be reviewed with
      participants upon their consent. The investigators will screen 15 people and expect that up
      to 10 individuals will complete this study.

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Document changes in phantom limb sensation and phantom limb pain during and shortly after cervical epidural spinal nerve stimulation in amputees. Before placement of the spinal cord stimulator leads, investigators will document the subject's description of their history of perceived phantom limb. If subjects report a history of phantom limb pain, investigators will ask them to periodically update their perception of the limb throughout each experimental session, as well as within a month after the device has been removed.</description>

    <measure>Success rate during control of prosthetic hand</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will test the subject's ability to use a myoelectric prosthetic hand with and without sensory feedback provided by electrical stimulation of the spinal roots. Using either a virtual prosthetic limb or an instrumented prosthesis, stimulation of the spinal roots will be modulated based on signals recorded from the limb such as pressure at the finger tips or joint angles. In both the presence and absence of stimulation, subjects will be asked to perform tasks such as manipulating blocks, opening a jar, or identifying the stiffness and size of various objects.</description>
