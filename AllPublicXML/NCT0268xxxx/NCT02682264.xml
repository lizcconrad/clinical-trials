      The primary objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety of CB-03-01 cream,
      1% applied twice daily for an additional nine months in study participants with acne vulgaris
      that participated in the Phase 3 pivotal studies for a total treatment of up to 12 months.

      This is a multicenter, open label, long-term extension study for CB-03-01 cream, 1% focused
      on safety in male and female participants, 9 years or older who completed one of the Phase 3
      pivotal studies [CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26]. Participants will apply the active medication
      (CB-03-01 cream, 1%) twice daily to the entire face and, if designated by investigator AND
      desired by the participant, truncal acne for nine additional months of treatment. Thus,
      overall participants will be exposed to CB-03-01 cream, 1% for a total treatment of up to 12
      months (0 or 3 months in the Phase 3 pivotal study and an additional nine months in this
      long-term safety study).

      Participants will treat facial acne per protocol for nine months. Treatment of truncal acne
      will be discussed by the investigator and participant. Treatment on the face and/or trunk may
      be discontinued if/when acne clears and re-started if/when acne worsens, according to the
      assessment of the investigator for each respective treatment area (i.e., face and trunk).

      Participants (approximately 600) will be rolled over from the Phase 3 pivotal studies
      [CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26] into this long-term, safety study in order to achieve at least
      300 participants on-study at 6 months and 100 participants on-study at 12 months.
