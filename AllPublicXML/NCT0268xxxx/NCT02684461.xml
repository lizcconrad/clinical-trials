  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of three treatment arms that
      are designed to improve survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Eligible
      subjects could be randomized to four (4) cycles of chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy, or
      immunotherapy followed by chemotherapy, or four cycles of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy.

      This open-label, three-arm, non-comparative randomized phase II study is designed to evaluate
      three different sequences of double-consolidation with the humanized monoclonal antibody
      targeted against cell surface receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), pembrolizumab, and
      nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced Non small cell lung cancer post induction
      chemotherapy. While the goal of each arm is to guarantee exposure to each of these two agents
      to patients who have not progressed post induction chemotherapy, they do so with different
      sequence. In ARMs A and B, consolidation is sequential, with either pembrolizumab followed by
      nab-paclitaxel (ARM A), or nab-paclitaxel followed by pembrolizumab (ARM B). In ARM C,
      consolidation is concurrent, with the two agents administered concurrently.
