  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label study will compare the safety and
      efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil with delayed introduction of sirolimus and discontinuation
      of cyclosporine, with those of mycophenolate mofetil and long term continuation of
      cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients receiving daclizumab (Zenapax) as induction
      treatment and followed by 8 month treatment with corticosteroids. The anticipated time on
      study treatment is 12 months. Participants who will complete the initial 12-month study and
      who will provide written informed consent will be eligible to participate in a 60-month
      follow-up phase.
