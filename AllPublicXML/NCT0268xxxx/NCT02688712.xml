    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how effective and safe LY2157299, in combination with
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy, might be in treating rectal cancer. Also as part of this
      study, research will be done on tumor samples to see if it is possible to predict if patients
      will respond to treatment, and blood samples to look at the immune system response to study
      treatment.

      About 50 people will take part in this study. The study treatment will be given over an 8
      week period and the investigators will continue to collect your health information for up to
      5 years, as part of this study

      This is a prospective Phase II study to test the efficacy of LY2157299 in combination with
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. This study will test the
      hypothesis that LY2157299 will improve effector T cell tumor infiltration and activity
      resulting in improved pathologic response rates. The investigators propose that this improved
      immune response will result in improved disease-free and overall survival.

      The objectives are:

        1. Determine the rate of pathologic complete response in patients with locally advanced
           rectal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and the investigational
           agent LY2157299

        2. Correlate immunoscore changes prior to therapy, during therapy, and at surgical
           resection with pathologic response and MRI parameters

        3. Immune monitoring to evaluate potential biomarkers of treatment success.

      Eligible patients will have histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma, AJCC Stage IIA
      IIIC or AJCC Stage IV appropriate for consideration of primary rectal tumor resection.
      Patients will undergo a forceps biopsy of the rectal mass as part of the diagnostic workup as
      well as undergo staging evaluation including an MRI with additional study sequences. Enrolled
      patients will receive a 14 day course of LY2157299 followed by a repeat biopsy and MRI with
      study sequences. In this trial the investigators plan to use the maximum tolerated dose of
      LY2157299 established in human clinical trials, 300mg delivered as 150mg P.O. BID. On day 15
      patients will begin chemoradiation with either 5-FU (fluorouracil ) or capecitabine
      (Xeloda®). On day 29, patients will undergo another fourteen day course of LY2157299
      concurrent with their ongoing chemoradiation.

      Patients will undergo 50.4 to 54Gy of radiation in 1.8Gy daily fractions delivered Monday
      through Friday for a total of 28-30 fractions. The acceptable duration of chemoradiation,
      including treatment breaks or delays, is up to 8 weeks total. Six to ten weeks after
      completing their neoadjuvant therapy, patient will undergo a tumor specific mesorectal
      excision as per standard of care with evaluation of pathologic response rate. Patients will
      be followed for disease-free survival, progression free survival, local recurrence, and
      overall survival. A three patient safety lead-in will be performed, where a six week safety
      period following completion of radiation will be completed prior to enrolling subsequent
      patients.

             resection.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          -  Age 18 years or above.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5X upper limit of laboratory normal

               -  BNP ≤ 3 times the baseline value and upper limit of laboratory normal

               -  Troponin I ≤ upper limit of laboratory normal

               -  hsCRP ≤ upper limit of laboratory normal

               -  Cystatin ≤ upper limit of laboratory normal

               -  PT/INR ≤1.5X upper limit of laboratory normal

          -  Pre-menopausal women must have a negative pregnancy test on the day treatment starts
             and must avoid becoming pregnant while on treatment and for 3 months following
             completion of therapy. Men must avoid fathering a child while on treatment and for 3
             months following completion of therapy. This exclusion is required due to the
             toxicities that chemotherapy, radiation, and LY2157299 may have on the forming fetus,
             spermatogenesis or the nursing child. Also, because pregnancy may alter immune
             function it may limit the treatment efficacy. Women of childbearing potential must
             agree to use a medically approved contraceptive method during the treatment period and
             for 3 months following the last dose of LY2157299. Contraceptive methods may include
             an intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pills or barrier method. If condoms are
             used as a barrier method, a spermicidal agent should be added as a double barrier
             protection.

          -  No active bleeding.

          -  Ability to give informed consent and comply with the protocol. Patients with a history
             of psychiatric illness must be judged able to understand fully the investigational
             nature of the study and the risks associated with the therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection requiring systemic antibiotics.

          -  Active autoimmune disease as defined by the autoimmune disease assessment tool (see

          -  Diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) within 3
             years of enrollment.

          -  History of prior pelvic radiation.

          -  Aortic aneurysm (see protocol)

          -  Abnormal Echocardiogram (see protocol)

          -  Immunodeficiency, need for immunosuppressive medications, or need for chronic
             steroids.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug study within 28 days of enrollment.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women, as treatment involves risks to the embryo or fetus.

          -  Other medical or psychiatric conditions that in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator would preclude safe participation in protocol.

          -  History of cardiac disease, including myocardial infarction within 6 months before
             study entry, unstable angina pectoris, New York Heart Association Class III/IV
