  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Often, assessing a classifying diagnosis in patients with interstitial lung disease provides
      a diagnostic challenge. Currently HRCT, endoscopic or surgical video assisted thoracoscopic
      surgery(VATS) assessment including lung biopsies are diagnostic tools for patients with
      suspected ILD. However, tissue acquisition is associated with morbidity in these patients
      with an already compromised pulmonary function. In clinical practice this results in the fact
      that only a minor part of patients with an indication for tissue acquisition are actually
      undergoing biopsies. The aim of this study is to determine ILD-characteristics on imagign
      collected with minimal invasive novel optical techniques, to examine whether the addition of
      novel optical techniques to the diagnostic process of ILD could potentially limit the need
      for a tissue- (surgical) diagnosis and/or reduce the sampling error rate of biopsies by
      providing additional information on biopsy location.

    <textblock>
      Novel probe based optical techniques such as Confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) and Optical
      coherence tomography (pOCT) are non-invasive optical techniques, compatible with conventional
      diagnostic bronchoscopes and provide non-invasive, real-time information on the airway wall
      and the alveolar compartment. Therefore, immediate validation of optical measurements during
      a biopsy is possible. Optical techniques might either obviate the need for an tissue biopsy
      or improve the diagnostic yield of conventional biopsy methods and make surgical lung
      biopsies that are associated with high morbidity and costs redundant.

      Hypothesis: Novel optical techniques (pCLE and pOCT) provide real time information about the
      characteristics of the mucosa and/or the alveolar compartment in ILD.
