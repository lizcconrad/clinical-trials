  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is common and particularly outpatients may experience unsatisfactory pain
      relief. This randomized, double-blind, crossover study of postoperative pain in outpatients
      undergoing split-mouth, third lower molar extraction aims to examine whether or not the
      combination of metamizole and ibuprofen is superior to either drug alone.
