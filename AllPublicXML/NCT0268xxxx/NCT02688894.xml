      This protocol is a molecular screening protocol only. No drug intervention study will be
      included in this protocol. Based on the molecular profiling, patients may be eligible for
      drug intervention study of SUKSES trial.

      This procedure can be performed during or after the first-line treatment. DNA will be
      extracted from the archived or fresh tissue and blood. NGS-based cancer panel and Nanostring
      CNV will be tested with DNA from tissue and/or blood.

      Immunohistochemistry and FISH will be done by pathologists using archived or fresh tissue.

      Tumor tissues (fresh or archival) will be analyzed using NGS-based cancer panel, nanostring
      CNV, immunohistochemistry and/or FISH.

      Specific methods of each molecular tests will be defined with standard laboratory manual
      developed by pathologists.
