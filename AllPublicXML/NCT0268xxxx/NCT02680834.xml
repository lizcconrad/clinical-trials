  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test non-inferiority of chronic Venous Leg Ulcer (VLU) area
      closure at 16 weeks with a dual action pneumatic compression device compared to multi-layer
      bandaging.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with a chronic venous leg ulcer will participate in a 2 week run in phase using
      standard of care multi-layer bandaging before being randomly assigned to either treatment
      using a dual action pneumatic compression device or multi-layer bandaging for up to 16 weeks.
      Participants will be seen in clinic for treatment, evaluation, complete symptom and quality
      of life questionnaires.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be ≥ 18 years of age or legal age at the time of enrollment.

             prior to randomization.

          -  Must have at least one of the following within the past six (6) months: Dorsalis Pedis
             (DP) systolic pressure ≥ 80mmHg for diabetic patients or ≥ 60mmHg for non-diabetic
             patients on study limb; Posterior Tibial (PT) systolic pressure ≥ 80mmHg for diabetic
             patients or ≥ 60mmHg for non-diabetic patients on study limb; Transcutaneous partial
             pressure oxygen (TcP02) &gt; 30mmHg; Great toe systolic pressure &gt; 40mmHg

          -  Active ulceration (CEAP classification of C6)

          -  Ulcer duration: Non healing VLU ≥ 1 month but not greater than 24 months.

          -  Ulcer size ≥ 2cm2 ≤ 50cm2

          -  Three or fewer separate full thickness ulcers on the study limb.

          -  Leg circumferences within the following range:Ankle - 12 to 44cm; Calf - 22 to 60cm;
             Below knee - 22 to 68cm

          -  Must be able and willing to provide informed consent prior to study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Target ulcer or any other ulcer on the study limb involves exposure of tendon, muscle,
             or bone.

          -  Target ulcer is of non-venous etiology (sickle cell anemia, necrobiosis lipoidica
             diabeticorum, pyoderma, malignancy).

          -  Treatment of the target ulcer with living cellular therapy within 30 days of the time
             of projected randomization.

          -  Endovenous ablation or other venous surgery within one week of enrollment

          -  History of skin sensitivity to any of the components of AT, multi-layer bandages or
             compression garments.

          -  History of an acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) within the
             last three (3) months.

          -  Acute thrombophlebitis within the last six (6) weeks.

          -  History of pulmonary edema or decompensated congestive heart failure within six (6)
             weeks of screening.

          -  Currently has an active infection of the skin on the target limb such as cellulitis
             requiring antibiotics.

          -  Active cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes with an HbA1c value of &gt; 12% within the past three (3)
             months.

          -  Changes to medications that affect edema within the last 30 days prior to enrollment
             (e.g. diuretics, calcium channel blockers of the dihyropyridine class, pioglitazone,
             cox-1 inhibitors, pregabalin, and gabapentin, diltiazem or fluctuating doses of
             systemic steroids).

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids requiring daily administration at doses greater than
             5mg of Prednisone per day or equivalent for greater than two weeks.

          -  Currently pregnant or trying to become pregnant.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to participate in all aspects of study protocol.

          -  Exhibit any condition which, according to the Investigator, justifies the subject's
             exclusion from the study, such as a medical condition where an increase in venous or
             lymphatic return is undesirable.

          -  Currently participating in another clinical trial.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria after two week run-in:

          -  If ulcer area has decreased by greater than 30% compared to baseline area.

          -  Ulcers measuring less than 1.5cm² after the run in will be excluded.

          -  Any ulcer appearing to have evidence of infection.

          -  Ulcers increasing in size greater than 50% after run in also excluded.

          -  If the sum of the ulcer areas on the study limb is &gt; 50cm2 the subject is excluded.
