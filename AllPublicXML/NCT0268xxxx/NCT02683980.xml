  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty (20) subjects presenting with a hyperplasia enlarged prostate and candidates for
      surgery will undergo a single treatment for ablation of the prostate using the study
      device.Follow up visits are scheduled for the day of release from the hospital and at 1 and 3
      months post procedure.

      The primary objective of this study is to explore Vaporization efficacy and safety when
      treating PBH (Benign prostatic hyperplasia ) with the contact side firing fiber with
      recommended settings.
