  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation trial of MVT-2163 and MVT-5873 used in performing
      PET scans. The study is designed to determine the best time and dose of these agents that
      result in the best PET image of a tumor. Subjects will be seen on days 1, 2, 4, and 7 for
      imaging and a clinical assessment. The last study visit is on day 28.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation trial of a fixed dose of MVT-2163 and
      varying antibody masses of MVT-5873. The study is designed to identify an optimal dose (total
      antibody mass) and optimal timing, for tumor imaging using PET scanning. This trial will
      include a dose escalation and an expansion phase. During the dose escalation portion of the
      study, a determination of the optimal time to perform PET imaging will be made. Following the
      identification of the &quot;optimal&quot; dose and timing, an 10 additional subjects will be imaged
      using the best dose and timing.

      In each portion of the study subjects will have a screening visit and, no more than 28 days
      later, those who are eligible for the study will receive MVT-2163. Each cohort will have 3-6
      subjects. Subjects in cohort 1 will be administered MVT-2163 alone on day 1. Subjects in
      cohorts 2 and 3 will receive MVT-5873 on day 1, followed approximately 10 minutes later by
      MVT-2163. Subjects will return for visits to the clinic on days 2, 4, and 7 for additional
      imaging and safety assessments. A follow-up visit will occur on day 28.

      The study will also evaluate the tissue distribution and pharmacokinetics of MVT-2163 and,
      based on these data, the study will estimate the radiation dosimetry of MVT-2163. Safety
      assessments will be performed using ECGs, vital signs measurements, assessments of
      performance status, and clinical laboratory measurements.
