    <textblock>
      SHR6390 is a small molecular, oral potent, selective CDK4/6 inhibitor. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate the safety/tolerability and the pharmacokinetic profile of SHR6390 in
      Chinese advanced solid tumor patients by using a &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation.Preliminary efficacy
      will be also investigated in this study.
