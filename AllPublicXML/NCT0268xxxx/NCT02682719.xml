      The purpose of this study is to determine whether LCZ696 (valsartan/sacubitril) is safe and
      has beneficial effects on the heart and blood vessels in patients with high blood pressure
      and/or diabetes or other risk factors for developing heart failure (elevated levels of
      natriuretic peptide and elevated left atrial volume index). Patients will be randomized to
      receive LCZ696 or valsartan (and matching placebo) for 18 months to assess the impact on left
      ventricular diastolic function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The STOP-HF prospective, randomized trial demonstrated that a biomarker driven strategy of
      natriuretic peptide (NP) based screening and collaborative care with general practice can
      help target cardiovascular prevention and improve outcome in an at-risk population of
      patients without heart failure.

      However, while successful, the STOP-HF biomarker strategy lacks a specific pharmacological
      intervention linked to the screening biomarker, NP. The most appropriate therapy to build on
      STOP-HF is LCZ696 (sacubitril/valsartan), a first in class angiotensin receptor neprilysin
      inhibitor (ARNI). As neprilysin degrades biologically active NP, LCZ696 increases myocardial
      cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) while reducing myocardial stiffness and hypertrophy.
      NPs also stimulate natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation and have been shown to have
      anti-fibrotic and anti-sympathetic benefits which could augment the STOP-HF preventative
      strategy.

      Elevated NP in an at-risk population independently identifies cardiovascular risk, which can
      be specifically targeted by LCZ696. In a small number of patients (4%) with cardiovascular
      risk factors and elevated NP, significant asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction will be
      present and for these RAAS modifying therapy is mandated.

      However, there is a larger group of patients with elevated NP who have normal systolic
      function of the left ventricle but who have significant isolated diastolic dysfunction. These
      patients have asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (ALVDD) and are at
      heightened risk for heart failure and other cardiovascular events. The Investigators and
      others, have shown that cardiac inflammation, fibrosis and hypertrophy drive the
      pathophysiology. Importantly, there is currently no specific therapy for these patients,
      beyond conventional risk factor control.

      Interrupting this pathophysiological process at an early stage before the development of
      ventricular dysfunction, may prevent/slow development to heart failure and also have an
      impact on the development of other cardiovascular events driven by this pathophysiological
      process. This represents a novel way to modify risks at an earlier stage in the natural
      course of cardiovascular disease, in a targeted and individualized manner. It is known that
      suppressing the RAAS will reduce the pro-fibrotic impact of angiotensin II. Addition of
      neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril in LCZ696, will reduce degradation of endogenous,
      cardio-protective, biologically active NPs and cGMP and will augment the beneficial impact on
      fibro-inflammation beyond conventional RAAS modifying therapy.

      There are a number of emerging biochemical and imaging surrogates of left ventricular
      dysfunction, which can be evaluated in a relatively small population over a short time frame
      in a prospective, phase II study design. Of these, one of the most reliable, continuous
      markers of diastolic function in the heart is LAVI. There was a dramatic impact of LCZ696 on
      LAVI in comparison with valsartan in the PARAMOUNT study. Furthermore, this endpoint can be
      precisely defined using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) in a phase II design. In
      this study, doppler Echocardiographic images will be collected to correlate with cMRI images.
      Doppler Echocardiography will be more feasible in follow on studies with larger populations.

      In summary, it has been demonstrated that asymptomatic patients with elevated NP levels are
      at higher risk of heart failure and other cardiovascular events. Elevated NP in this setting
      represents a protective, endogenous response to fibro-inflammation. The predominant cardiac
      abnormality in these patients is ALVDD, which can be tracked using LAVI. The hypothesis is
      that augmenting this protective fibro-inflammatory response with LCZ696 could demonstrate
      superiority over the current state of art therapy in patients with hypertension or diabetes
      and elevated NP in a phase II study design and, in doing so, PARABLE may deliver a major
      clinical innovation in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
