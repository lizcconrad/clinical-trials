      This is a two-part study.

      Part 1:

      Part 1 of the study is a single-dose, dose-escalation, study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and PK profiles following oral administrations of FDL169 to healthy female
      volunteers in the fed state. Up to five doses will be assessed.

      Part 2:

      Part 2 of the study is a multiple-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK
      profiles following oral administrations of FDL169 to healthy female volunteers in the fed
      state.

             supplements within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and FDL Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.
