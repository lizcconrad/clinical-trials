  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fully Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS) have been introduced with the objective to
      preserve native vessel geometry, allow for adaptive vessel remodeling with late lumen gain,
      restore physiological vasomotion, and avoid late adverse events including restenosis and
      scaffold thrombosis. Although randomized clinical trials in low risk patients to date suggest
      non-inferiority in terms of safety and efficacy compared with metallic DES, several reports
      have raised concerns regarding the scaffold thrombosis highlighting the importance of
      technical considerations regarding lesion preparation and scaffold expansion. OCT offers the
      opportunity to plan the procedure and optimize the implantation of BVS.

      The hypothesis of the present study is that a strategy of OCT-guided PCI using BVS is
      superior to angiography-guided PCI (e.g. by selecting scaffold dimension on the basis of a
      pre-procedural OCT and applying corrective measures in case of suboptimal treatment result as
      indicated by OCT).
