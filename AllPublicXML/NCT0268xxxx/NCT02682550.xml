      The NTF_PT_2014 multicenter study aims to collect, store, and analyse plasma and serum from
      polytrauma-patients (injury severity score ≥25) and corresponding clinical data to address 1)
      how trauma modulates the release of danger molecules, inflammatory mediators, coagulation
      factors and novel biomarkers, 2) how the specific injury pattern affects the posttraumatic
      response and regenerative potential on an organ-, cell, and molecular level, and 3) how could
      a specific organ- and immune-monitoring predict the clinical outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polytrauma is worldwide a major socio-economic problem. Especially the polytrauma-induced
      complications, such as systemic inflammatory response, sepsis, organ dysfunction remain
      associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. The underlying posttraumatic
      pathophysiology remains poorly understood, especially since the polytrauma patients present a
      highly variable patient cohort with complex injury patterns, comorbidities and different
      therapeutic strategies.

      Therefore, the present &quot;NTF_PT_2014&quot; multicenter study of the Trauma Research Network (NTF)
      of the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma (DGOU) with its established national
      Polytrauma-serum-bank aims to collect, store, and analyse plasma and serum from
      polytrauma-patients and corresponding clinical data to address:

        1. how trauma modulates the release of danger molecules, inflammatory mediators,
           coagulation factors and novel biomarkers?

        2. how the specific injury pattern affects the posttraumatic response and regenerative
           potential on a organ-, cell, and molecular level?

        3. how could a specific organ- and immune-monitoring predict the clinical outcome?

      Blood will be drawn from anticipated 1000 patients with an injury severity score ≥ 25 at the
      time of hospital admission (in the emergency room), 8 h, 24h, 48, 120 h, and 240 h post
      injury. The biochemical and immune-monitoring data will be correlated to corresponding
      clinical data and data from the German Trauma Registry (TraumaRegister DGU®).

      Blood from age- and sex matched healthy volunteers (n=200) will serve as a control group.

      The study will provide a detailed picture of the molecular danger response after multiple
      injury and may reveal novel therapeutic targets for posttraumatic complications.
