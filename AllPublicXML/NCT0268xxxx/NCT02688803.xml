  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a term applied to breast cancer cases that have &lt;1%
      expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) and do not over
      express HER2.

      TNBC is diagnosed in 15-20% of breast cancer cases and tends to occur in younger women and
      have biologically more aggressive high grade disease. Clinically, patients with TNBC have a
      poorer prognosis compared to patients diagnosed with other breast cancer subtypes. Because of
      the aggressive phenotype and due to observations that systemic chemotherapy offers
      significantly higher benefit in ER negative disease, current treatment guidelines from
      provincial and other organizations recommend that patients receive adjuvant systemic
      chemotherapy for any TNBC greater than 0.5 cm in greatest diameter or node positive
      independent of primary tumor size.

      Currently, there is no world-wide standard recommended chemotherapy regimen for the
      management of TNBC in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting, with treatments varying from region
      and institution.

      As physicians do not know what the &quot;best&quot; treatment for patients is, genuine uncertainty
      (&quot;clinical equipoise&quot;) exists. Physicians will choose between different &quot;standards&quot; in their
      personal practice, using idiosyncratic decision making processes, without the physician or
      the patient knowing the optimal option. This is not good for patients, physicians and society
      as a whole. Determining the optimal treatment remains an important medical issue for
      patients, physicians and society. This study will survey opinions on a novel method to allow
      comparisons of established standard of care prophylactic treatment using the &quot;integrated
      consent model&quot; as part of a pragmatic clinical trial and attempt to compare head to head
      standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with TNBC.
