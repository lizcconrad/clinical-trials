      Primary Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the
      chemotherapy-free combination of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab (GA 101) in patients with
      previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) and a high tumor burden. Primary endpoint to be
      observed for this is the rate of progression free survival one year after start of therapy.

      Hypothesis The hypothesis of the study is that ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab
      will achieve response rates (CR and PR), rates of MRD negativity and PFS which are comparable
      to currently used standard rituximab-chemotherapy combinations such as R-CHOP or
      R-bendamustine in subjects with previously untreated FL and a high tumor burden.

      OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, multicenter phase 2 study in up to 98
      subjects with previously untreated FL and a high tumor burden in advanced stages and in need
      of therapy. The study will include a central monitoring of MRD by PCR, a central pathologic
      review and complimentary research projects including monitoring of immune response.

      The study therapy comprises an initial 6 cycles of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab followed by an
      additional 24 months of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab maintenance.

      In patients being MRD negative at 30 months, i.e. at the end of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab
      maintenance, and without clinical progression no further treatment is given while MRD
      monitoring is continued.

      MRD monitoring will be regularly performed on peripheral blood samples collected before the
      start of therapy and at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 30 respectively. Subsequently, MRD
      analyses will be performed every 6 months until clinical progression of the disease or for a
      maximum of 4 years (until the end of the study).

      If MRD assessment on peripheral blood samples turns from positive to negative within the
      first 30 months, confirmatory blood and bone marrow samples should be taken 6 months
      thereafter.

      In patients remaining MRD positive at 30 months without clinical progression, single agent
      ibrutinib therapy is continued for another 12 months.

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be formed and constituted. The
      independent DMC will review the safety of the treatment and make recommendations as to the
      further conduct of the study.

      The data generated by this phase II study should serve as the basis for a subsequent
      randomized phase III study comparing the chemotherapy-free combination of ibrutinib plus
      obinutuzumab with standard immune-chemotherapy.

    <description>Initial therapy 6 cycles of Ibrutinib:
Ibrutinib 560 mg once daily every day until start of maintenance for a total of 24 weeks.
1000 mg of GA101 I.V. on days d 1, 8, 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2-6 (21 day cycles).
Maintenance with another 24 months of ibrutinib plus GA101 in patients with clinical remission after the last induction cycle:
Ibrutinib 560 mg once daily every day. GA101 at a dose of 1000 mg I.V. every 2 months for a total of 24 months. The total duration of ibrutinib plus obinutuzumab therapy will therefore be 30 months.
In patients remaining MRD positive at 30 months without clinical progression, single agent ibrutinib therapy is continued for another 12 months.</description>
