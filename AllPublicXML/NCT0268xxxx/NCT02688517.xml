      This research trial studies the use of targeted genomic analysis of blood and tissue samples
      from patients with cancer. Genomic sequencing is a laboratory method that is used to
      determine the entire genetic makeup of a specific organism or cell type. Genomic sequencing
      can be used to find changes in areas of the genome that may be important in the development
      of cancer. It may also help doctors improve ways to diagnose and treat patients with rare
      cancers with poor prognosis or lack of effective therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain blood and tumor tissue for next-generation sequencing and determine the
      frequency of finding genomic alterations for which there are clinically available
      (commercially or research based) targeted therapies. Treating clinicians will be provided
      with relevant validated mutation data for treatment or referral of the patient to pertinent
      studies.

      II. To collect clinical outcomes of patients with actionable mutations for which sequencing
      has been performed.

      III. To obtain whole tumor genome data for data storage and future computational analysis and
      correlation with clinical data.

      IV. To obtain tumor tissue for development of future in vitro and in vivo cancer models.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed for the presence of mutations via next
      generation sequencing. Patients may also undergo collection of blood samples for analysis of
      circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and circulating tumor cells.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every
      6 months for 3 years.
