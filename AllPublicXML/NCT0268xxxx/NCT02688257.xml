  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with large primary operable breast cancers are offered chemotherapy prior to surgery
      to shrink the tumour and enable breast conserving surgery. Conventional assessment of
      response to chemotherapy relies on a change in tumour size which does not always correlate
      with the change in amount of viable tumour. Newer techniques such as functional MRI,
      microbubble and optoacoustic ultrasound offer the potential to detect responses to
      chemotherapy by evaluating functional changes in tumour vascularity and oxygenation. Neither
      modality utilises ionising radiation.

      Although MRI is widely used for detecting breast cancer, its ability in assessing functional
      responses to chemotherapy prior to surgery has not been fully exploited. Dynamic contrast
      enhanced (DCE) MRI has a sensitivity around 90% and provides quantitative measurements of
      blood volume and flow. Other functional techniques detect variation in tissue oxygenation:
      this is called the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) mechanism. The BOLD technique uses a
      special magnetic resonance (MR) sequence called T2* to measure the weakly magnetic effect of
      deoxygenated haemoglobin. The investigators wish to develop and validate T2* measurements
      which relate to oxygenation of a tumour. The investigators also want to validate other MR
      sequences including diffusion weighted (DW) MRI, which quantifies microcirculation of blood
      in the capillary network and the diffusion of water within tissues.

      Microbubble ultrasound is an established technique that utilises an intravenous contrast
      agent comprising tiny microbubbles of gas that can increase the reflectivity of blood and
      enhance spectral and colour Doppler signals obtained from routine ultrasound imaging.
      Optoacoustic imaging is new technique where the output signal depends on the oxygenation of
      the tissues under study. It utilises a light signal input and measures ultrasound signal
      output.

      The investigators want to correlate our imaging findings with histopathology after surgical
      resection of the tumour.
