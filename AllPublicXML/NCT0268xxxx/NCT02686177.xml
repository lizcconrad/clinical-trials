  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GLP-1 receptor agonists are introduced in the treatment of type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and their
      efficacy is documented. However, safety aspects are also important to evaluate with respect
      to micro and macrovascular complications associated with T2D. Few studies have properly
      addressed the role of GLP-1-based therapies in regulating vascular integrity and
      angiogenesis. The study evaluate the impact of one-month treatment Liraglutide on both ANGPT2
      and ANGLPT4 levels and endothelial circulating progenitor cells, angiogenesis biomarkers in
      type 2 diabetic patients.

      GLP-1 receptor agonists are introduced in the treatment of type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and their
      efficacy is documented. Beside their therapeutic benefits, direct cardiovascular effects have
      also been reported. However, safety aspects are also important to evaluate with respect to
      micro and macrovascular complications associated with T2D. T2D patients treated with GLP-1
      analogs may suffer from microvascular complications such as macular oedema and proliferative
      retinopathy, characterized by excessive retinal angiogenesis. Few studies have properly
      addressed the role of GLP-1-based therapies in regulating vascular integrity and
      angiogenesis. The role of GLP-1 on endothelial cell (EC) growth, EC integrity and
      angiogenesis thus needs to be characterized. Our aim is to provide the proof of concept that
      agonists of GLP-1 regulate angiogenesis in humans and identify the underlying mechanisms. The
      present project is the translational part of the ANR Angiosafe-T2D, regarding clinical safety
      aspects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (namely Liraglutide) on angiogenesis.

      The study evaluate the impact of one-month treatment Liraglutide on both ANGPT2 and ANGLPT4
      levels and endothelial circulating progenitor cells, angiogenesis biomarkers in type 2
      diabetic patients.

    <description>Circulating progenitor cells (EPCs) will be quantified using flow cytometry before and after one month treatment GLP-1 receptor agonist or reference treatment (control group). Briefly, after erythrocyte lysis, peripheral blood will be stained with 10µL fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human CD34 mAb (Becton Dickinson), 10µL phycoethrin-conjugated anti-human KDR mAb (R&amp;D Systems), and 10µL allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD133 mAb (Miltenyi Biotech). The frequency of CD34+ cells, CD34+ KDR+ cells before and after GLP-1R agonist or control treatment will be determined by a two-dimensional side-scatter fluorescence dot plot analysis after appropriate gating using blood samples from above-stated recruited patients</description>
