  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly care has become one of the most important subjects in Taiwan and &quot;frailty syndrome&quot;
      are the most common problems among the elderly. In view of this trend, Taipei Veteran
      Memorial Hospital imported POWER rehabilitation from Japan in 2008. While showing significant
      clinical benefits, investigators have found that the system still has certain limitations
      (e.g. high cost, requires large space, patients must commute to the center, lacks real-time
      objective feedback , boring routines makes staying power to motivate patients for long term
      rehabilitation programs.)

      To overcome the above limitations, this project proposes an evidence-based rehabilitation
      model that accounts for actual clinical need and collaborates with our engineering team to
      develop a &quot;cluster&quot; , &quot;wearable&quot; and &quot;Brain-Computer Interface System&quot; version of POWER
      rehabilitation system. Combining cloud technology, investigators now introduce
      internet-of-things into the POWER rehabilitation procedure. The result will lower the burden
      of clinical support personnel, and provide an opportunity to quantify &quot;frailty syndromes&quot; so
      as to allow objective and quantitative scientific evaluation, leading to a more objective
      clinical diagnosis.

      In addition, this project further proposes a virtual-reality (VR) system for POWER
      rehabilitation, as well as designs for the VR sceneries. Through the use of different
      animated 3D VR sceneries and interactive game design, investigators can make rehabilitation
      interesting and fun for the patients, motivating long-term compliance of the patients,
      thereby, improving the clinical outcome of POWER rehabilitation.

      This project has the potential to create an innovative solution to address the current
      bottlenecks of our rehabilitation treatment model. Successful development of the system will
      offer rehabilitation clinicians more treatment options, lower the cost of supporting staff,
      reduce commuting cost for the patients, and elevate patient desire to comply with the
      treatment program. Finally, the system will not only enhance Taiwan's academic reputation in
      the international arena, it will also generate new commercial opportunities for Taiwan and
      contribute to Taiwan economic development.

    <measure>Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in physical examination at 12, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TFI contains two parts, sociodemographic questions including questions on multimorbidity, lifestyle, life events and living environment (part A) and the assessment of components of frailty (part B). Frailty is assessed with 15 items divided into physical, social and psychological domains. All item scores are summed into a frailty score ranging from 0-15. Persons with a total TFI score â‰§5 are considered to be frail.</description>

    <description>This index measures the extent to which somebody can function independently and has bowel control, bladder control, toileting, chair transfer, ambulation and stair climbing. The index also indicates the need for assistance in care. Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater independence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in physical examination at 12, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IADL's are activities related to independent living and include preparing meals, managing money, shopping for groceries or personal items, performing light or heavy housework, doing laundry, and using a telephone. The total score may range from 0 - 8. A lower score indicates a higher level of dependence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in physical examination at 12, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale assesses physical and cognitive disability. This scale focuses on the level of disability indicating the burden of caring for them. The scale includes 18 items. Each item is scored from 1 to 7 based on level of independence, where 1 represents total dependence and 7 indicates complete independence. Possible scores range from 18 to 126, with higher scores indicating more independence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in physical examination at 12, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
