    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect and usability of mobile and cloud technology -based
      intervention on lifestyle modification in 18-40 year obese and overweight subjects.

      The study has a dose-response design with three randomized subjects groups from Mode 1 to
      Mode 3 with increasing intensity of intervention (guidance, exercise program, diet, support).
      The special focus of this study is on motivation and use of music and mobile health devices
      as motivational tools to support individualized exercise training, healthy diet and overall
      healthy life style.

      Obesity negatively impacts health in many ways. It is associated with metabolic diseases and
      mood disorders and in women pregnancy outcome as well as the health of the offspring.

      The modern evolution of societies steers populations towards a profound sedentary lifestyle.
      Physical activity brings about health benefits, however, the risk reduction for chronic
      diseases remains significantly greater for fitness than physical activity per se. The recent
      knowledge suggest Individualized approach rather than general guidelines for exercise in
      prevention-oriented strategies.

      In this study we compare three different intensities of lifestyle intervention: 1) general
      guidelines for healthy exercise and diet, 2) individual program,and 3) highly individual
      program. Individual programs will be based on pre-examinations including interview and
      clinical exercise test. Mobile and cloud technologies will be used to collect data and steer
      the subjects´ lifestyles and daily activities and together with music to motivate them. The
      duration of the active intervention is 3 months and it will continue on a self-governing
      basis up to 1 year. The primary outcome is maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), and secondary
      outcomes are physical activity, cardio-respiratory and cardiovascular parameters, blood
      volume, total hemoglobin mass, metabolic health along with chronic low-grade inflammation and
      well-being.
