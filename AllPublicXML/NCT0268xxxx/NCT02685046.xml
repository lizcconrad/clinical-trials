  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proof-of-concept trial the investigators will study the effects of imatinib treatment
      on the biology of mesenchymal-type colon cancers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor biopsies from patients with newly diagnosed colon cancer will be pre-screened with an
      RT-qPCR test to identify tumors of the mesenchymal subtype. Patients with mesenchymal-type
      tumors that meet the in- and exclusion criteria will be treated with imatinib during the
      &quot;window period&quot; that normally precedes surgery. Immediately following tumor resection,
      biopsies will be taken from the surgical specimen. Gene and protein expression of the pre-
      and post-treatments biopsies will be compared to assess the effects of imatinib therapy on
      PDGFR- and cKIT-signalling and on the mesenchymal gene expression profile.
