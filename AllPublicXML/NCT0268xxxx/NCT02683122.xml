  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New onset of pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and an increase in white blood cell (WBC) count
      accompanied by purulent tracheal secretions are clinically indicative of hospital-associated
      pneumonia (HAP). The low specificity and sensibility of diagnostic tests for HAP, however,
      tends to result in an extremely high incidence of missed diagnoses and may lay to high
      mortality.

      The place of analysis of organ dysfunction in relation to the diagnosis of nosocomial
      pneumonia in intensive care is not yet defined, because early organ dysfunction may be the
      first symptoms noted by clinicians.
