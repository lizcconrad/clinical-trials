  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to investigate the benefits of epidural analgesia in
      pancreatic resections in a prospective, single blind, randomized control trial. This study
      will evaluate both short and long-term outcomes related to epidural analgesia, providing a
      longitudinal and comprehensive perspective to the advantages and disadvantages of this
      technique. The investigators hypothesize that the use of epidural analgesia reduces a
      patient's consumption of morphine or morphine-equivalent in the post-operative period
      following pancreatic resections.
