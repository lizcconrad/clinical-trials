      EUS-FNA is the recommended diagnostic examination of choice when patients present with
      suspected lower mediastinal lymph nodes on imaging. EUS-FNA is minimal invasive and low in
      costs, and although it has a good record in detecting diseases (eg confirm a nodal metastasis
      or granulomas) it has limitations in excluding diseases (missing metastases/ or granulomas)
      resulting in a false negative rate of 15-20%. Substantial limitations that most likely can be
      attributed to areas within the node that are not sampled during EUS-FNA tissue acquisition.
      Improved needle based EBUS/ EUS guided nodal diagnostics might result in improved quality of
      the fine needle aspirations, reduce in surgical diagnostic procedures , reduced costs and
      result in a shorter timebefore-treatment interval.

      Needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) is a modern imaging technique, compatible
      with the conventional diagnostic aspiration needle, that uses an excitation laser light to
      create 'real-time' microscopic images of tissues. Therefore this technique provides
      additional information regarding the nodal status and could therefore improve the diagnostic
      yield of EUS-FNA. Specifically, we will describe the nCLE image characteristics of lymph
      nodes involved in lung cancer and sarcoidosis as well as in healthy lymph nodes. Improved
      characterization of mediastinal nodes might lead to improved diagnosis.

    <description>During the fine needle aspiration of a suspected and a non-suspected lymph node we will obtain needle based CLE (nCLE) images within the lymph node. Fine needle aspirations will be obtained after the optical biopsy measurements. We will compare the results of the optical biopsy with the cytology results, or to histology in case an additional surgery is indicated.</description>
