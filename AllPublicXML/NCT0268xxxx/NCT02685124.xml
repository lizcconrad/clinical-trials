      This study evaluates the effect of intake of two orange juice varieties in healthy adults.
      The participants will receive &quot;Bahia&quot; orange juice, &quot;Cara-Cara&quot; orange juice or a isocaloric
      control drink in a cross-over study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of fruits and vegetables is linked to a decrease in the incidence of chronic
      diseases. Citrus fruits represent the main source of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids,
      vitamin C and carotenoids in the brazilian diet.

      Unlike the &quot;Bahia&quot;, the &quot;Cara Cara&quot; variety which is a spontaneous mutation of &quot;Washington
      navel&quot; orange is characterized by a bright red pulp due to high levels of lycopene. This
      difference in the chemical composition may lead to a different biological activity and then a
      greater protective effect on health.

      Since the biological effects generated from a food intake are the result of the interaction
      of various nutrients with different metabolic pathways, the investigators will apply the
      metabolomic approach to investigate the complex relationships between fruit intake, bioactive
      compounds and human metabolism. The investigators will propose to describe the metabolic
      pathways affected by orange juice intake and to identify biomarkers that can be used in
      nutritional interventions.

    <description>Three days before the start of the study, all participants will restrict their diet avoiding citrus fruits (orange, tangerine, lemon) and its derivatives (washout period), red fruits and vegetables (strawberry, red lettuce, red grape, tomate). The day before the sample collection will be provided a controlled dinner. A fasting for 8 hours will be required before blood and urine collection. All participants will divided into three groups: I (Cara Cara), II (Bahia), III (Isocaloric control drink). They will consume 250 ml of each drink twice daily for 7 consecutive days, with a washout period of 7 days among each intervention.</description>
