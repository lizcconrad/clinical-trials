  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic problems represent one of the major health concerns which are attractive for being
      addressed by nutritional interventions, as these are directly connected to dietary
      habits.Anthocyans possess cardiovascular disease prevention, obesity control, and diabetes
      alleviation properties, but association between anthocyans and prediabetes need to be more
      firmly understood and established from robust clinical data. However, there is little human
      research that has reported on the efficacy of increased anthocyans bioactive consumption on
      insulin sensitivity in pre-diabetes.

      The investigators plan to conduct a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to
      characterize the potential effects of anthocyans, purified from bilberries and blackcurrants,
      on metabolic abnormalities commonly associated with type 2 pre-diabetes.
