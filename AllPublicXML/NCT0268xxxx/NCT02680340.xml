      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the POLARSTEM™ Ti/HA cumulative femoral
      stem revision rate at 10 years.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to provide 10 years of safety and effectiveness data
      of POLARSTEM™ Ti/HA in terms of radiographic and clinical performance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter retrospective longterm clinical outcome study conducted in up to 6
      hospitals in France. 502 subjects who have undergone THA with POLARSTEM™ from 2002 to 2005
      will be enrolled in this study and clinical and radiographically followed up for at least 10
      years. Subjects who have not reached the 10-year post surgery timepoint will be invited to a
      10-year post-operative follow-up visit to obtain the clinical and radiographic outcome
      measures.
