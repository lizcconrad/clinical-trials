      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a computerized training, &quot;Cognitive Bias
      Modification&quot; targetting appraisals (CBM-App), can reduce dysfunctional appraisals of trauma
      in patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), compared to a control condition.
      Other outcomes measured include symptoms of PTSD and trauma-relevant dysfunctional
      cognitions. Participants are recruited from inpatients with PTSD admitted to the Clinic for
      Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, LWL University Clinic of Ruhr University of Bochum.
