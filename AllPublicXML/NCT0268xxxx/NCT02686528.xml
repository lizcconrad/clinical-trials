  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if hip precautions, which are instructions that
      limit functional use of a hip replacement after surgery, affect the rate of dislocation in
      the first six weeks after primary total hip replacement surgery. The impact of hip
      precautions on a patient's return to activities of daily living and overall patient
      satisfaction will also be investigated. The overall cost effectiveness of hip precautions
      will be determined.

      This study examines the necessity of postoperative hip precautions in patients after primary
      total hip arthroplasty via the posterior approach. Precautions are instructions that limit
      the functional use of the hip and are given for the first six weeks after surgery, with the
      goal of preventing an instability event resulting in dislocation. The hip precautions that
      will be investigated in this study are: no hip flexion past 90º, no crossing the legs, and no
      twisting at the waist.

    <measure>Use of Assistive Devices After Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be surveyed in clinic after surgery about their use of assistive devices including seat extenders, extra pillows between the legs, and walkers. The use of these devices between groups will be compared and the cost per patient in each group for use of these devices will be determined, allowing for analysis of potential cost savings for patients not prescribed hip precautions.</description>
