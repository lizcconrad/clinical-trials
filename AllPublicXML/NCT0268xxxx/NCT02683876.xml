  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify metabolic signatures associated with malodor
      conditions. The investigators will perform state-of-the art metabolomics tests and
      bioinformatic data mining to explore if conditions leading to malodor can be screened by
      metabolomic profiling of urine samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, metabolite profiling analysis will be carried out on urine samples of
      individuals with malodor conditions related to metabolism inefficiencies. Metabolic profiles
      will be identified using the metabolomics equipment located in the NMR, HPLC and MS
      facilities of the Metabolomics Innovation Centre (TMIC). Multivariate statistical analyses
      will be used, as well as other approaches to mine complex data from heterogeneous sources.
