  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to treat patients with the combination of erlotinib and temozolomide.
      Patients with relapsed, recurrent, refractory, or high risk malignancies whose tumors possess
      a non-synonymous mutation in EGFR, ERBB2, or JAK2V617F (JAK2) will be eligible for the study.
      Very few phase 2 clinical trials have been performed in pediatrics using targeted agents in
      combination with conventional chemotherapy agents. Furthermore, since some combinations such
      as the combination of this study (erlotinib and temozolomide) have shown additive/synergistic
      effects in preclinical studies, therapy selecting for those patients who possess mutations
      targeted by the TKI of the study, may unveil activity that has not been previously observed.
      Thus, the investigators hope to determine whether the addition of additive/synergistic
      chemotherapy will increase efficacy of target agent and/or increase tumor susceptibility to
      targeted agent resulting in increased anti-tumor activity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One to 21 years of age

          -  Relapsed, recurrent, or refractory malignancy. All solid tumor diagnoses will be
             eligible.

               -  Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis either at original diagnosis or
                  recurrence.

               -  Known non-synonymous mutation in the following genes: EGFR, ERBB2, or JAK2V617F
                  (JAK2). Genomic sample preferably from relapse, but may be from other stage of
                  treatment if relapse sample is not reasonably obtainable. Genetic analysis for
                  determination of eligibility occurs as part of routine care and is not being
                  performed specifically for the purposes of this study.

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT or MRI scan, as ≥ 20 mm
             by chest x-ray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.

          -  Prior therapy as follows:

               -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
                  chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

               -  Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Patients must not have received myelosuppressive
                  chemotherapy within 2 weeks of enrollment onto this study (6 weeks if prior

               -  Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days must have elapsed since
                  completion of therapy with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse
                  events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period prior to
                  enrollment must be extended beyond the time during which adverse events are known
                  to occur.

               -  Monoclonal antibodies: At least 3 half-lives must have elapsed since prior

                  doses of MIBG; at least 3 months must have elapsed if prior craniospinal XRT was
                  received, if more than 50% of the pelvis was irradiated, or if TBI was received;
                  at least 6 weeks must have elapsed if other substantial bone marrow irradiation
                  was given.

          -  Stem cell transplant or rescue without TBI: No evidence of active graft vs. host
             disease and at least 2 months must have elapsed since transplant.

          -  Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Karnofsky or Lansky greater
             than or equal to 50%. Use Karnofsky for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky for
             patients ≤ 16 years of age. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but
             who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing
             the performance score.

          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcl

                  creatinine levels above institutional normal

               -  INR ≤ IULN or PT ≤ IULN

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or

             potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of the study drug(s). The use of
             the following medications should be discontinued prior to initiation of protocol
             therapy and should be avoided during protocol therapy if reasonable alternatives
             exist.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia,
             interstitial lung disease, hepatic failure / hepatorenal syndrome, GI perforation,
             cerebrovascular event, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, corneal
             perforation/ulceration, or documented Hepatitis B virus infection.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with erlotinib or temozolomide. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
