        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has provided written informed consent with HIPPA authorization before the
             initiation of any study-related procedures.

        CONTROLS:

          -  The subject is between 21-45 years of age at the time of consent.

          -  The subject has not experienced joint pain for at least 4 weeks prior to the consent
             date and is deemed to be clinically free of any inflammatory disease(s).

        ACTIVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

          -  The subject is at least 21 years of age at the time of consent.

          -  The subject has moderate to severe RA, based on either the 1987American College of
             Rheumatology (ACR) score of ≥ 4/7 or the 2010 ACR/EULAR score of ≥ 6/10.

          -  The subject has a DAS28 of &gt;4.4 (using the ESR).

          -  If the subject is on methotrexate, they have been at a stable dose for &gt; 4 weeks prior
             to the screening visit.

          -  If the subject is on biologic therapy, they have been at a stable dose &gt; 8 weeks prior
             to the screening visit.

          -  If the subject is on NASIDS or oral corticosteroids, it is ≤ 10mgmg/day or equivalent,
             and has been at a stable dose for &gt; 4 weeks prior to the screening visit.

             related condition or radiation therapy.

        Chronic or persistent infection or has any condition that would, in the opinion of the
        examining physician, preclude their participation.

          -  The subject has a known allergy to or has had a reaction to dextran exposure.

          -  The subject has received an investigational product within 30 days prior to he Tc99m
             tilmanocept administration.

          -  The subject has received any radiopharmaceutical within 7 radioactive half-lives of
             that radiopharmaceutical prior to the administration of Tc 99m tilmanocept.
