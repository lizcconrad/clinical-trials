  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative remote ischaemic
      preconditioning (RIPC) on organ damage and the functional characteristics of arteries in
      patients undergoing vascular surgery. In addition, we investigate the connection between RIPC
      and changes in the functional characteristics of arteries and low molecular weight
      metabolites.

    <masking_description>Patient, patient's physician, surgeon, anaesthesiologist and everyone else in the surgical team were blinded to study intervention. Blinding was attained with manometer's scale covered. Second arterial stiffness measurement was carried out by a study member who did not know the patient's group affiliation.</masking_description>

    <description>Ischaemia is achieved by using a blood pressure cuff on an arm by raising the cuff pressure to 200 mm Hg or to a value that is 20 mm Hg greater than the patient's systolic blood pressure - if the patient's systolic blood pressure is more than 180 mm Hg. The intervention starts simultaneously with the induction of anaesthesia or a few minutes earlier.</description>
