      To examine the quality of liver images produced when the contrast agent Eovist is used during
      MRI.

      Researchers will review data from the Eovist MRI and compare the scan with previous MRI exams
      the patient had with the same or other contrast agents.

      To determine the efficacy of Eovist contrast agent in producing MRI images of the liver. We
      will monitor patients for any unusual symptoms (adverse events) when the contrast is given.

      Patients are asked to hold their breath during an MRI scan. Eovist may interfere with the
      &quot;breath hold&quot; which could result in more breathing artifacts (based on a qualitative scale)
      on arterial images when the patients are given Eovist vs. other contrast agents.

    <description>To qualitatively assess and score MRI images during unenhanced and contrast-enhanced motion-sensitive sequences for breathing artifacts when Eovist contrast is used versus other contrast agents. Eovist enhanced MRI scans will be compared to previous MRI scans performed with other contrast agents on the same patient that included breath holding sequences. Breathing artifacts on both scans will be evaluated using a respiratory motion score between 1 and 5.</description>
