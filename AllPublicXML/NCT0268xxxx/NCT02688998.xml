  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the REaCT-Vascular Access Her2 negative study, the investigator will use a novel method to
      allow comparisons of established standard of care vascular access strategies using the
      &quot;integrated consent model&quot; as part of a pragmatic clinical trial.

      Determining the optimal vascular access strategy remains an important medical issue for
      patients, nurses, physicians and society. A novel method to allow comparison of established
      standards of care is needed as part of an increasing internationally mandated incentive to
      perform more pragmatic clinic trials.
