    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of 400 mg of
      KD025 once-daily (QD) compared to standard of care (SOC) in male and
      postmenopausal/surgically sterilized female subjects with IPF.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-six (36) male or postmenopausal/surgically sterilized female subjects with IPF who are
      eligible, will be randomly enrolled in a 2:1 ratio (KD025 to SOC) to one of two treatment
      groups. Subjects randomized to Treatment Group 1 will receive KD025 400 mg QD orally for 24
      weeks. Subjects randomized to Treatment Group 2 will receive SOC (as deemed appropriate by
      the investigator). Subjects randomized to SOC will be treated exactly the same as subjects on
      KD025 and undergo all tests in similar fashion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male and postmenopausal/surgically sterilized female subjects at least 18 years

             procedures

          -  IPF diagnosis within 5 years before study entry, proven according to the American
             Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society consensus conference criteria, with
             surgical lung biopsy. In the absence of a surgical lung biopsy, HRCT must be
             consistent with usual interstitial pneumonitis.

          -  Resting state SpO2 ≥ 88% with or without supplemental oxygen, FVC % ≥ 50% normal
             predicted value, and DLCO ≥ 30% normal predicted value at baseline

          -  Men with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 medically
             acceptable methods of contraception during the trial and for 1 month after the last
             dose of study drug. Effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD)
             plus 1 barrier method; (b) stable doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3
             months (eg, oral, injectable, implant, transdermal) plus 1 barrier method; (c) 2
             barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and
             spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) vasectomy.

          -  Have adequate bone marrow function:
