  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is not only a pathology of movements. There are many non-motor symptoms
      that complicate and impair patients' quality of life. Among those disorders are sleep
      disorders.

      Insomnia is the most frequent symptom. Most patients report 2-5 awakenings per night and long
      periods of awakening which occupy 30 to 40% of their night.

      Apomorphine is a dopamine agonist that may be administered with a pump . The objective of the
      study is to assess changes in the quality of sleep in Parkinson's disease patients treated
      with an apomorphine pump.
