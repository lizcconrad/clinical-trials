    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better define the intensive care unit population at highest
      risk for developing Hospital-Acquired and Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia
      (HABP/VABP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study of adult patients (≥18 years old)
      admitted to ICUs. Generally, all patients admitted to the ICU for any indication will be
      considered at risk for developing HABP/VABP. A subset of the at-risk patients treated with
      select respiratory modalities for at least 12 hours will be considered high risk for the
      development of HABP/VABP, will have baseline data collected, and will be screened daily for
      antibiotic treatment for suspected pneumonia. Patients not meeting high-risk criteria,
      &quot;other-ICU patients&quot;, will be screened twice weekly for antibiotic treatment for suspected
      pneumonia.

      Once a high-risk subject or other-ICU patient is treated with antibiotics for either a lower
      respiratory tract infection (LRTI) or undifferentiated sepsis, additional clinical
      information will be recorded from the subject's medical record. All subjects treated with
      antibiotics for either indication will subsequently be screened for the development of
      pneumonia, as defined by the FDA draft guidance document for drug development in HABP/VABP.
      Subjects who meet the FDA draft guidance definition of pneumonia will have vitals and
      physiologic data collected and will be followed for 4 days after pneumonia is diagnosed to
      capture the results of any microbiologic testing and changes to initial antibiotic therapy.
