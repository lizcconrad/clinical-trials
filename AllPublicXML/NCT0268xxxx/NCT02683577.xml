    <measure>Assessment of Maximum Observed Plasma Drug Concentration (Cmax) for Telotristat Ethyl and Comparison Between Each HI Group and Healthy Control Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected on Day 1 (pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours [h] post-dose), Day 2 (24 h), Day 3 (48 h) and Day 4 (72 h).</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was sampled for the purpose of determining pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for total telotristat ethyl using a validated, specific, and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalytical method. The method was selective, linear, precise and accurate within the range from 0.5 to 500 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL) for telotristat ethyl and the lower limit of quantification (LoQ) was 0.5 ng/mL. Results were derived by non-compartmental analysis of the plasma concentration-time profiles.</description>

             cigarette, pipe, cigar, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch, nicotine gum); unable or
             unwilling to refrain from smoking and tobacco use for 2 hours prior to dosing and 4
             hours after dose administration.

          -  History of any serious adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to any inactive component
             of telotristat etiprate (ie, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium
             (disintegrant), talc, silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate (nonbovine)).

          -  Existence of any surgical or medical condition that, in the judgment of the
             investigator and the sponsor's, medical monitor, might interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of telotristat etiprate.

          -  History of any major surgery within 6 months or anticipated surgery prior to Day -1.

          -  History of renal disease or significantly abnormal kidney function test.

        <title>Assessment of Maximum Observed Plasma Drug Concentration (Cmax) for Telotristat Ethyl and Comparison Between Each HI Group and Healthy Control Group</title>
        <description>Blood was sampled for the purpose of determining pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for total telotristat ethyl using a validated, specific, and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalytical method. The method was selective, linear, precise and accurate within the range from 0.5 to 500 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL) for telotristat ethyl and the lower limit of quantification (LoQ) was 0.5 ng/mL. Results were derived by non-compartmental analysis of the plasma concentration-time profiles.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples were collected on Day 1 (pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours [h] post-dose), Day 2 (24 h), Day 3 (48 h) and Day 4 (72 h).</time_frame>
        <population>The PK population (23 subjects overall) corresponded to all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication, without protocol violation affecting PK evaluation and who had a sufficient number of plasma concentrations to estimate the main PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax and AUC[0-tlast]).</population>

          <title>Assessment of Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve From 0 to Time t Corresponding to the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC[0-tlast]) for Telotristat Ethyl and Comparison Between Each HI Group and Healthy Control Group</title>
          <description>Blood was sampled for the purpose of determining PK parameters for total telotristat ethyl using a LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method. The method was selective, linear, precise and accurate within the range from 0.5 to 500 ng/mL for telotristat ethyl and the LoQ was 0.5 ng/mL.

          <description>Blood was sampled for the purpose of determining PK parameters for LP-778902 (active metabolite of telotristat ethyl) using a LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method. The method was selective, linear, precise and accurate within the range from 2 to 2000 ng/mL for LP-778902 and the LoQ was 2.0 ng/mL. Results were derived by non-compartmental analysis of the plasma concentration-time profiles.</description>
          <population>The PK population corresponded to all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication, without protocol violation affecting PK evaluation and who had a sufficient number of plasma concentrations to estimate the main PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax and AUC[0-tlast]).</population>
