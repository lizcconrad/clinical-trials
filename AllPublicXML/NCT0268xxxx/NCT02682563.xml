      Background:

      Worldwide, diabetic nephropathy or Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD), is the most common cause of
      chronic and end-stage kidney disease. With the increasing rates of obesity and type 2
      diabetes (T2DM), many more patients with DKD may be expected in the coming years. DKD is a
      multi-factorial condition, involving factors such as obesity, chronic hyperglycemia, advanced
      glycation end products, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, systemic- and
      glomerular hypertension. Large-sized prospective randomized clinical trials suggest that
      intensified glucose and blood pressure control, the latter especially by using agents that
      interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), may halt the progression of
      DKD, both in type 1 diabetes and T2DM. However, despite the wide use of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, a considerable
      amount of patients develop DKD during the course of diabetes, indicating an unmet need for
      renoprotective therapies. Sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLT-2) inhibitors are novel
      glucose-lowering drugs for the treatment of T2DM. These agents seem to exert pleiotropic
      actions 'beyond glucose control', including reduction of blood pressure and body weight. In
      addition, SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease proximal sodium reabsorption and decrease glomerular
      pressure and albuminuria in rodents and type 1 diabetes patients. In rodents, SGLT-2
      inhibitors also improved histopathological abnormalities associated with DKD. To date, the
      potential renoprotective effects and mechanisms of these agents have not been sufficiently
      detailed in human type 2 diabetes. The current study aims to explore the clinical effects and
      mechanistics of SGLT-2 inhibitors on renal physiology and biomarkers in metformin-treated
      T2DM patients with normal kidney function.

      Hypothesis:

      Treatment with the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, as compared to the sulfonylurea (SU)
      derivative gliclazide, may confer renoprotection by improving renal hemodynamics, and
      decreasing blood pressure and body weight in type 2 diabetes.

      Study Design:

      A phase 4, monocenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, parallel-group,
      mechanistic intervention trial to assess the effect of 12-week treatment with the
      sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLT)-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin versus the SU gliclazide
      on renal physiology and biomarkers in metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM)

      Study Endpoints and methods:

      Renal hemodynamics, i.e. glomerular filtration rate (GFR, ml/min) and effective renal plasma
      flow (ERPF, ml/min) will be measured by the gold-standard inulin- and para-aminohippurate
      (PAH) clearance methods, respectively, during both euglycemic- and hyperglycemic clamp; renal
      tubular function will be measured by 24-hour urine sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium,
      magnesium, phosphate and urea and glucose; markers of renal damage will include urinary
      albumin excretion, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and kidney injury molecule-1;
      blood pressure will be measured using an automated oscillometric blood pressure device
      (Dinamap®); body anthropometrics, including body weight, height, body-mass index and waist
      circumference, and body fat contents (by bio-impedance analysis) will be measured; blood
      samples will be obtained to determine glycemic variables, lipids and markers of inflammation;
      systemic hemodynamic variables (including stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral
      resistance) will be measured by continuous beat-to-beat hemodynamic monitor (NexFin®); heart
      rate will be determined by oscillometric blood pressure device; microvascular function will
      be measured by capillary videomicroscopy and Laser Doppler; arterial stiffness will be
      assessed by applanation tonometry, (SphygmoCor®); additional urine, blood and feces will be
      collected for conditional determination of various markers of renal damage/function,
      inflammation, oxidative stress and (cardiovascular)-biomarkers and DNA; cardiac autonomous
      nervous system (CANS) will be measured by electrocardiography and NexFin®; insulin
      sensitivity will be measured by glucose infusion during the euglycemic clamp (M-value);
      beta-cell function will be measured by quantification of insulin secretion during the
      hyperglycemic clamp.

      Expected results:

      This active-comparator controlled mechanistic intervention study, using state-of-the-art
      methodology will expand our knowledge regarding the potential renoprotective effects of
      SGLT-2 inhibitors in human T2DM. The investigators hypothesize that SGLT-2 inhibitors may
      confer renoprotection by improving renal hemodynamics, and decreasing blood pressure and body
      weight, all important factors in the development of DKD. Ultimately, the investigators expect
      that this study will contribute to guiding clinicians in their decision-making process of
      individualizing therapies for T2DM patients at risk for, or suffering from, DKD.

      Study design A phase 4, monocenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled,
      parallel-group, mechanistic intervention trial to assess the effect of 12-week treatment with
      the sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLT)-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin versus the
      sulfonylurea (SU) derivative gliclazide on renal physiology and biomarkers in
      metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)

      Recruitment

      Subjects will be recruited by researcher physicians involved in this trial using methods that
      are established practice for all human studies in the Diabetes Center, Vrije Universiteit
      (VU) University Medical Center (VUMC):

        -  Via advertisements in (local) newspapers

        -  Use of a Diabetes Center database to approach volunteers from previous studies, who have
           given written informed consent to be available for future studies

        -  Through the Diabetes Center website (www.diabetescentrum.nl) In case of a positive
           response, the information letter and informed consent forms will be sent to these
           individuals. They will then be contacted by telephone by the research physician to
           answer any remaining questions and make an appointment for a screening visit if the
           individual wants to participate.

      Screening and eligibility After giving extensive oral and written information, a written
      informed consent form will be obtained from the subjects before screening. Once the
      participant signs the informed consent form he/she will be assigned a unique study number
      which will be used for identification.

      The screening procedure will consist of obtaining an extensive medical history (including
      disease history, current medical conditions and use of medication, substance use, employment,
      education, family history, self-reported birth weight), complete physical examination,
      drawing blood for hematologic and biochemistry testing (Full blood count, glucose, HbA1c,
      creatinine, AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)), urine screening, urine creatinine and albumin, and a
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

      Postvoid residual urine volume will be determined by ultrasonic bladder scan. In females, the
      menopausal status will be verified by history taking (no menses &gt; 1 year) and in case of
      doubt measurement of FSH-level (cut-off defined as &gt;31 U/L). If subjects are eligible, the
      investigator will inform them within two weeks after screening. After inclusion, participants
      will enroll in a 4‐week run‐in period to allow for study effects.

      Endpoint visits: baseline and long-term follow-up During the baseline measurements, various
      tests will be performed to obtain baseline values for the predefined endpoints. The baseline
      measurements of the renal system, as well as the cardiovascular assessments, will be
      performed during one test visit and serve as reference values. The endpoint assessments will
      be repeated during long-term follow-up.

      Baseline assessments Seven days prior to this visit, subjects will adhere to a `normal-salt'
      (9 - 12 grams or 150 - 200 mmol per day) and protein (1.5 - 2.0 g/kg per day) diets, in order
      to minimize variation in renal physiology due to salt and protein intake. Participants will
      abstain from alcohol (24 hours), caffeine (12 hours) and nicotine (12 hours) and heavy
      exercise prior to and during visits 2. One day prior to the testing day, subjects will
      collect 24-hour urine.

      Following an overnight fast, participants will be instructed to drink 500 mL of water, but to
      delay all morning-time medication (apart from metformin) until conclusion of the examination
      day. Subjects will arrive at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at 07.30 ante meridiem (a.m.).
      After taking subjects history, current weight and blood pressure, intravenous catheters will
      be placed in both forearms after which blood and urine will be collected. Then, subjects will
      assume a semi-recumbent position throughout the duration of the visit and after a resting
      period, an automatic blood pressure measurement is performed. Thereupon the combined renal
      and clamp protocol will commence. During the first equilibration period, body fat content
      assessment and the cardiovascular tests are carried out.

      Safety and tolerability: Telephone consultation and follow-up The 12-week intervention study
      includes a telephone consultation and a follow-up visit. Participants will be asked about the
      occurrence of adverse events and the intake of study drugs will be checked. Furthermore,
      recent history will be taken, physical examination/anthropometric measurements performed and
      blood and urine samples collected.

      Early-term assessments At any time during the course of the study, all subjects have the
      right to withdraw without providing a reason, as required by International Conference on
      Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and Dutch laws. When participants decide to
      withdraw their participation, they will be asked to participate in 'early-term assessments'.
      During these assessments, some end-point parameters will be measured, which can possibly be
      used for final data analyses.

      Withdrawal from study

      After subjects have entered the study, participation will be stopped in case of occurrence of
      any of the following:

        -  Participants own decision

        -  The occurrence of an AE or clinically significant laboratory change or abnormality that,
           in the judgment of the investigator, warrants withdrawal of the study

        -  Subjects need medical procedures that are not allowed in the protocol

        -  Subjects cannot undergo the procedures to investigate the research questions as outlined
           in this protocol

        -  Non-compliance

        -  In addition to these requirements for study drug discontinuation, the investigator
           should discontinue study participation for a given subject if, on balance, he thinks
           that continuation would be detrimental to the subjects well-being

      The study physician can be guided by the criteria above, but may discontinue participation at
      any time based on his/her clinical judgment.

      Study Completion The study will be considered completed for an individual participant when
      he/she completes the final tests. The study as a whole will be considered completed when all
      planned randomized subjects have completed the treatment phase, followed by the final
      measurements.

      Study Procedures Renal protocol During this protocol a combined inulin/para-aminohippurate
      (PAH)-clearance technique will be performed to examine the glomerular filtration rate (GFR,
      ml/min) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF, ml/min) respectively. In order to examine
      tubular function, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, urea and
      glucose will be measured in urine (mmol). In addition, urine osmolality will be determined.
      Moreover, biomarkers of renal damage (urinary albumin excretion (UAE), Neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) will be measured
      in urine

      Clamp protocol A combined hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp will be
      performed. During the euglycemic clamp insulin will be infused at 40 microunits/square
      meter.minute (mU/m2.min) and glucose will be kept at 5 mmol/l by variable glucose 20%
      infusion. This technique allows for renal measurements during normoglycemia in all
      participants. After 3 hours of insulin infusion and an one hour rest period for exogenous
      insulin to be cleared, glucose will be infused in order to reach a plasma concentration of 15
      mmol/l. In this matter, renal tests can be performed under stable hyperglycemia. From the
      euglycemic clamp, insulin sensitivity will be determined from the amount of glucose infused
      (M-value). Blood will be stored during hyperglycemia in order to be able to obtain measures
      of beta-cell function, including 1st phase insulin secretion, 2nd phase insulin secretion and
      arginine-induced insulin secretion.

      Blood pressure:

      The investigators will use an automatic oscillometric device (Dinamap®, General Electric (GE)
      Healthcare) during the entire study to reduce possible bias. After an acclimatization period
      of &gt;5 minutes, blood pressure will be measured three times at the non-dominant arm, with the
      subject in a semi-recumbent position, using an appropriate cuff-size. The mean of the last 2
      measurements will be used as final value.

      Body fat content To measure body fat content the investigators will use the tetrapolar Soft
      Tissue Analyzer® (STA, Akern, Florence, Italy), which can perform Bioelectrical impedance
      analysis (BIA). This technique measures the resistance in the body tissues when a 50
      kilohertz (kHz) alternating current (AC) electrical current is given between four electrodes.
      Resistance can be measured by placing two electrodes on the dorsal hand and two on the foot
      at the unilateral side of the body. Extracellular water (ECW) as a percentage of total body
      water (TBW) and body cell mass (BCM) will be calculated independent of weight and height.

      Systemic hemodynamics To test drug-related changes on the cardiovascular system the
      investigators will measure hemodynamic variables (including stroke volume, cardiac output,
      total peripheral resistance) non-invasively. For this, an automated, beat-to-beat blood
      pressure and ECG recording monitor (Nexfin®, BMEYE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) will be used.

      Microvascular function Microvascular function will be measured by nail fold skin capillary
      density on the middle finger, before and after 4 minutes of arterial occlusion with a digital
      cuff, yielding data on baseline capillary density and post-occlusive reactive hyperemia,
      respectively. Moreover, vasomotion analyses will be performed, in which skin blood flow will
      be measured using a Laser Doppler probe.

      Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA) Applanation tonometry using the SphygmoCor® system (Atcor Medical,
      West Ryde, Australia) will be performed to measure variables of arterial stiffness. For PWA,
      the tonometer will be applied to the radial artery of the non-dominant arm. The SphygmoCor®
      system will calculate the Augmentation index (AIx) from the pulse waves.

      Cardiac Autonomous Nervous System (CANS) function To test drug-related changes in the
      autonomic nervous function and their impact on the cardiovascular system the investigators
      will measure resting heart rate variability (HRV) (63) and perform Cardiovascular Autonomic
      Reflex Tests (CARTs), a modified battery of the Ewing tests. Using an automated, beat-to-beat
      blood pressure and ECG recording monitor (Nexfin®, BM Eye, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) heart
      rate and blood pressure will be recorded during: resting, taking deep breaths, exhalation
      into a mouth-piece with a measurable resistance (Valsalva maneuver) and standing up from a
      supine position. Information regarding changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous
      system function can be derived from the measurements using dedicated software.

      Fecal examinations Each participant will collect a stool sample before the baseline tests and
      once before the long-term follow-up tests. At home, one feces sample must be stored at room
      temperature and one in the freezer and when arrived at the CRU, the feces will be stored at
      -20⁰C and -80⁰C, respectively. Stool samples will be stored for possible analysis of
      biomarkers, including calprotectin. Since it is becoming increasingly clear that the gut
      microbiome might be involved in the development of obesity and T2DM and chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) disease, the investigators will also store and analyze feces for microbial
      content.

      SAFETY (REPORTING) In accordance with the guidelines of ICH-GCP, the European Clinical Trials
      Directive (2001/20/EC) and the local regulations, the investigator will inform the subjects
      and the reviewing Ethical Review Board (ERB) if anything occurs, on the basis of which it
      appears that the disadvantages of participation may be significantly greater than was
      foreseen in the research proposal.

      Safety Evaluations

      The following safety measures will be collected during the study:

        -  Occurrence of adverse events (as reported by the subject)

        -  Vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature)

        -  Different end-point assessments that also serve as safety measurements: blood chemistry
           and hematology.

      Collection of adverse event information will begin at the signing of the informed consent and
      continues through 30 days after administration of the last dose of study medication.

      Reporting Each serious adverse event (SAE) will be investigated thoroughly and an assessment
      will be made whether the SAE is a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR, i.e.
      unexpected and drug-related, as indicated in the most recent Summary of product
      characteristics (SPC) provided by the drug supplier). Because this study is an investigator
      sponsored trial (IST), the investigator also acts as sponsor. Therefore, the investigator
      will be responsible for reporting the SAEs and SUSARs to the accredited ERB. This will be
      done within 15 days after first knowledge, using the specified web portal ('ToetsingOnline'),
      which automatically leads to informing the respective national health authorities. For fatal
      or life threatening SAEs and SUSARs this term will be 7 days for a preliminary report
      ('expedited') with another 8 days for completion of the report. The expedited reporting
      through the web portal 'ToetsingOnline' is sufficient as notification to the competent
      authority. Since this study is a monocenter study, no other sites have to be informed.

      The involved pharmaceutical company (AstraZeneca) will be notified of all SAEs, pregnancy,
      clinical relevant overdosing and adverse events of special interest (AESIs), if any. These
      events must be transmitted within 1 working day of the Investigator's awareness or
      identification of the event, using standardized forms. Reports will consist of patient
      identification (subject number, initials, sex, age), event (diagnosis), drug reporter
      identification (name, initials), causality and outcome and should be written in English.
      Results of any relevant complementary exams performed to obtain the final diagnosis of any
      SAE (e.g., hospital discharge summary, autopsy, consultation) will be made available to
      AstraZeneca entity upon request.

      Follow-up of AEs All AEs will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation
      has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require additional tests or medical
      procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician or a medical specialist.
      The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and
      how it was treated, and whether the patient continued or discontinued study participation.

      DATA MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Handling and storage of data and documents. In
      accordance with the Dutch law 'Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens' (WBP; Personal Data
      Protection Act) and GCP all patient data will be handled confidentially and anonymously.
      Therefore, all participants will get a study code ('RED-xxx'). The code list, with both
      identifier data and study number, will be stored securely on the server of the VUMC,
      protected by passwords only known by the responsible research physicians and principal
      investigator.

      All subject data will be recorded on printed case report form (CRF) by the authorized
      investigator (i.e. research physician) and/or personnel that is instructed in performing
      these administrative tasks and study procedures. In the latter case, data will always be
      reviewed by the investigator. All subject related data will be stored for 15 years. Subject
      data, both anonymous (e.g. CRFs) or not (e.g. source documents), will always be stored
      securely, in a locked cabinet in the Diabetes Center VUMC or on password secured computers.

      Data Management To ensure correct entrance of data from the CRF to the database which will be
      used for statistical analyses, a special database program called OpenClinica© (Community
      Edition, v3.1.2, OpenClinica©, LLC, Waltham, MA, USA) will be used. A study environment will
      be build, containing the specific visits and necessary data entry fields. Electronic-CRFs
      (eCRF) will be made, similar to the hardcopy CRFs. These eCRFs will be enhanced by safeguards
      and queries to warrant correct entry of data. The investigator, or his/her designated
      representative, will enter all data from the hardcopy printed CRF on the eCRFs, which
      automatically stores the data in the database. All changes made to the database will be
      logged ('audit trail'), which is required by GCP. On a regular basis all data from the
      OpenClinica©-database will be extracted to an Excel-file for backup purposes.

      Monitoring As required by GCP, a monitoring procedure will be performed in order to oversee
      the progress of the clinical trial and ensure that it is conducted, recorded and reported in
      accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures (SOPs), GCP and the applicable
      regulatory requirements. Because the risk classification of the current study is estimated to
      be &quot;moderate risk&quot;, 2-3 monitor visits are required per year.

      Monitoring will be performed by a GCP-certified assistant of the Clinical Research Bureau
      VUMC. The monitor will verify inclusion of patients, the use of the investigational medicinal
      products (e.g. drug accountability), source documents and reporting of adverse events
      according to a pre-defined format. The findings will be reported to the investigator.

      STATISTICS Sample Size Calculations The primary end-point is change in GFR/ERPF after 12
      weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin or gliclazide, as derived from the inulin/PAH clearance
      test. Based on literature the investigators used the following calculation to define our
      sample size: to detect a change in GFR from 89 mL/min to 75 mL/min (16%), SD 13.0 mL/min,
      assuming α = 0.05 (2-sided testing), a power (1-β) of 90%, the investigators need 19 subjects
      per group. However, taking into account a maximum dropout percentage of 15%, the
      investigators have chosen to increase the amount of subjects per group to N=22. This sample
      size was calculated using Stata-software (v.11.2, College Station, Texas, USA).

      Statistical Analysis Plan All tests of differences between treatments will be conducted at a
      two-sided significance level of &lt;0.05. In general, the null hypothesis (H0: no difference
      exists between the treatment groups) will be tested against the hypothesis H1: a difference
      exists between treatment groups, with respect to the underlying parameter of interest.

      All variables will be expressed as mean ± standard error of measurement (SEM) when normally
      distributed, or -in case of non-normal distribution- be expressed as median and interquartile
      range (IQR). Log transformation will be applied to obtain normal distribution as appropriate
      for the statistical tests.

      In case of missing data, a multiple imputation technique will be applied and compared with
      complete case analysis.

      Analysis population The efficacy analysis population will be based on the per protocol (PP)
      principle - i.e. all subjects who completed the entire treatment period using the treatment
      as originally allocated. Safety analysis will be performed in all patients who received one
      or more doses of the study medication.

      Statistical analysis of study endpoints In order to compare the effects between the two study
      arms the investigators will perform t-tests and/or multivariable linear regression models.
      The latter technique allows us to use continuous outcome variables and both continuous and
      dichotomous independent variables. The efficacy endpoint of interest will be added to the
      model as dependent variable. Treatment group will be added as independent categorical
      variable. Appropriate covariates may be added to the model. Baseline measurements of specific
      variables (e.g. age, gender) will be added to the regression models as covariates should
      differences in the baseline values of these variables occur between treatment groups.
      Moreover, corrections will be performed when relevant for the specific endpoint. The possible
      covariates will be elaborated prior to conducting the statistics. For possible confounders,
      the investigators will test whether there is an association with both the dependent and
      independent variable (p &lt;0.1). If this is the case, this confounder will be added to the
      model as covariate. Since all outcome variables - primary, secondary and exploratory - are
      continuous, this statistical technique can be applied.

      Our primary outcomes will be the most important outcomes for testing the hypothesis that
      SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin versus the SU gliclazide causes an improvement in renal
      hemodynamics. The large amount of secondary/exploratory endpoints potentially justifies the
      use of corrections for multiple tests. However, there is an increasing debate on whether this
      should be done, because of the increased risk of type 2 errors which could lead to
      prematurely discarding of potential useful observations. As recently pointed out, in a
      hypothesis-generating study - such as the current study - correction for multiple outcomes
      can be detrimental. A final decision will be made in the detailed Statistical Analysis Plan
      (SAP) prior to the conduction of the analysis.

      13. ETHICS The trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (64th
      World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013) for
      biomedical research involving human subjects and in accordance with ICH-GCP. The investigator
      will ensure that all aspects of the institutional ERB review are conducted in accordance with
      current institutional, local and national regulations.

      Ethical review Any member of the ERB who is directly affiliated with this study as an
      investigator or as site personnel must abstain from the ERB vote on the approval of the
      protocol.

      Informed consent form for trial subjects Prior to any trial related activity, the
      investigator will give oral and written information about the trial in a form that the
      subject can read and understand. It is the investigators responsibility to ensure the trial
      subject is fully informed about the aims of the trial, procedures, potential risks, any
      discomforts and expected benefits. The investigator must ensure the subject is informed and
      agrees that VUMC personnel, their representatives and possibly health authority (national or
      other) personnel can require access to the subject's data. It must be emphasized that
      participation is voluntary and that the subject has the right to withdraw from the trial at
      any time without prejudice.

      A voluntary, signed and dated 'Informed Consent' will be obtained from the subject prior to
      any trial related procedure. The written informed consent must be signed by the person who
      conducted the informed consent. If information becomes available that may be relevant to the
      subject's willingness to continue participating in the trial, the investigator must inform
      the subject in a timely manner and a revised written informed consent must be obtained.

      Unexpected findings will be reported to the participant and to his general practitioner. If
      the participant does not want to be informed, he/she cannot participate in the trial.

      A physician who is not involved nor has any interest in the performance of the trial will be
      available; this person has knowledge about the protocol and can be consulted by subjects
      potentially interested in participation.

      Financial Compensation All subjects will receive a financial compensation for their
      participation (based on the minimum wages in The Netherlands). The investigators have
      determined this to be €300 when the participant completes the entire study (as defined in
      Chapter 6). Moreover, reimbursement for travelling expenses will be given based on current
      prices of public transportation.

      Study Medication Participants will be randomized for a 12 week treatment with two different
      active study agents. Consequently, independent of treatment allocation, beneficial effects
      can be expected, as both SGLT-2 inhibitors and SU derivatives improve glycemic control. Both
      study medications have been approved for blood-glucose lowering treatment in T2DM patients
      and, based on currently available data, are considered to be safe. Furthermore, SGLT-2
      inhibitors in general may decrease blood pressure and body weight compared to gliclazide.

      The most common side effects for dapagliflozin are hypoglycemia (especially when used in
      combination with a SU derivative or insulin) and genital mycotic- and urinary tract
      infections. These side effects are usually mild and transient. In addition dyslipidemia and
      increased hematocrit have been described. Long-term (side) effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors are
      currently being evaluated in large-scaled outcome trials. For gliclazide, hypoglycemia and
      blurred vision in the initiation phase of treatment (due to changes in blood glucose levels)
      are the most common side effects. Also gastrointestinal side-effects (nausea, vomiting,
      diarrhea or constipation) have been reported. Of note, the gliclazide in this study will be
      used at a relatively low dose (i.e. 30 mg per day) for a relatively short treatment duration
      (12 weeks). Therefore, also given the inclusion- and exclusion criteria of the study
      participants, the overall risk of hypoglycemia is believed to be low. In the unlikely case of
      hypoglycemia symptoms, patients will be provided with a self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG)
      device and instructed to perform ambulatory blood glucose checks in case of symptoms, during
      the course of the study. Also, they will receive standardized diabetes education, including
      information regarding carbohydrate use and self-management / resolution of hypoglycemia. As
      in all drug intervention trials, in this study, the investigators will closely monitor
      patients for adverse drug and study events during the follow-up visit and by telephone
      consultation according to GCP. Participants can contact the research staff 24 hours a day.

      Safety issues The study examinations/tests are considered to be safe. No invasive procedures
      (besides intravenous peripheral catheters) are involved. During the study tests, two
      'diagnostic agents' (i.e. inulin and PAH) need to be administered; both agents are inert and
      have no side effects. The total amount of drawn blood will be 500 mL during a total period of
      16 weeks. Side effects are not expected because the blood volume taken per visit is
      relatively small, especially in comparison with regular blood donation, with 500 mL per
      donation (and is allowed 5 times a year for men and 3 times for women).

      Risk classification The Dutch Federation of University Medical Centers (in Dutch:
      'Nederlandse Federatie van Universitair Medische Centra') proposed a guideline for
      determination of the risk classification of a clinical trial. As stated above, the study
      medication and examinations/test are generally considered to be safe, with a small increased
      risk for hypoglycemia. For the latter, appropriate measures will be taken to minimize risk.
      Within the T2DM population, our study population can be considered as relatively low risk.
      However, sporadic serious side effects have been described (dehydration, hypovolemia, severe
      hypoglycemia), although most patients recover quickly. Therefore, while there is a low risk,
      the possible consequences might be 'moderate' to 'serious'. Therefore, the investigators feel
      that the current study has a classification of 'moderate risk'.

      ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS AND PUBLICATION Amendments

      Amendments are changes made to the research after a favorable opinion by the accredited ERB
      has been given. A 'substantial amendment' is defined as an amendment to the terms of the ERB
      application or to the protocol or any other supporting documentation that is likely to affect
      to a significant degree:

        -  The safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the trial

        -  The scientific value of the trial

        -  The conduct or management of the trial

        -  The quality or safety of any intervention used in the trial All substantial amendments
           will be notified to the ERB, the competent authority and subsidizing party/study
           (AstraZeneca). Non-substantial amendments will not be notified to ERB and competent
           authority, but will be recorded and filed by the sponsor/investigator and reported to
           AstraZeneca.

      Publication policy AstraZeneca will be provided will all intended publication(s) and
      abstract(s), preceding submission at least 30 days and 7 days, respectively, AstraZeneca can
      make suggestions to change the wording of any planned publication or abstract in relation to
      the study and/or the results. The sponsor-investigator is under no obligation to implement
      such changes, unless local regulatory requirements specify otherwise.

      The study will be part of a philosophiae doctor (PhD) project for one MD PhD student. A
      PhD-project has to fulfill the requirements of the Medical Schools at VU University,
      Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In general, a PhD-thesis has to contain at least 5 chapters,
      consisting of manuscripts published in international peer-reviewed journals. The
      investigators anticipate that this study will yield sufficient data to meet these criteria.
      Papers will be written at the end of the study, i.e. second half of 2018, and will be
      submitted to different relevant international peer-reviewed journals (Diabetes, Diabetes
      Care, etc.). Authorship of the papers will be determined using the Vancouver criteria for
      authorship.

      Data will be presented at relevant national and international scientific meetings, including
      those from the Dutch Association for the Study of Diabetes (NVDO), European Association for
      the Study of Diabetes (EASD), American Diabetes Association (ADA), etc. Since the competition
      in this field is considerable, the usual caution should be entertained when presenting
      abstracts, which usually contain preliminary results.
