    <textblock>
      The current understanding of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is that one site of bone marrow
      (BM) sampling serves as a window that represents all AML cells distributed throughout the BM,
      an assumption that has yet to be questioned. Simulation in mice led to inconsistent
      representation of the full BM, which can incorrectly suggest the absence of leukemic cells.
      Positron-emission tomography (PET) scan can detect areas of high metabolic activity in the
      body using for instance a radioactive sugar. In one report, its use in human AML has provided
      proof-of-principle evidence of unequal distribution of AML cells in BM. Accordingly, the
      alternative hypothesis is to test if PET scan can demonstrate if BM geography can alter AML
      cells spread and home them as distinct areas rather than uniform spread as if they are
      distributed in liquid state.

    <description>(Fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography) FDG-PET/CT guided bone marrow sampling will be performed at diagnosis and at the end of induction chemotherapy (like cytarabine and daunorubicin). Then, patients will be followed to assess their response, and imaging-guided bone marrow sampling will be repeated in the likely event of disease relapse.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  New diagnosis of AML according to the WHO (World Health Organization) criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior malignancy, unless the patient has been disease-free for at least five years
             following curative intent therapy, with the following exceptions: patients with
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia, regardless of the disease-free duration, if definitive treatment for the
             condition has been completed; or patients with organ-confined prostate cancer with no
             evidence of recurrent or progressive disease.

          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 3 or more

          -  Inadequate renal function (i.e., estimated GFR (glomerular filtration rate) &lt; 60
             mL/min/1.73m2).

          -  Inadequate hepatic function (i.e., serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5×ULN; AST (aspartate
             aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) &gt;
             2.5×ULN)

          -  Presence of uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infections
             (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without
             improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment).

          -  Having any other severe concurrent disease or serious organ dysfunction that may place
             the patient at undue risk to receive induction therapy.

          -  Pregnancy or lactating female.
