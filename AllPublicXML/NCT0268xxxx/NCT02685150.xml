    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging which combines Narrow-band Imaging(NBI), Autofluorescence
      Imaging (AFI) and White-light Imaging (WLI) could be used to identify the indistinct changes
      in the gut caused by reflux disease,either acid reflux or bile reflux, which make it possible
      to differentiate reflux disease from functional dyspepsia (FD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) and acid/bile reflux disease are common. These diseases share
      similar clinical manifestations. Individuals with functional dyspepsia (FD) often present
      upper abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, early satiety, loss of appetite, and no organic
      factors underlie it. Individuals suffering from acid/bile reflux disease often complain
      heartburn, upper abdominal burning or discomfort. What is more, there are always no specific
      changes on traditional endoscopy that can be used to differentiate these diseases (except
      erosive esophagitis). Though proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) test is frequently applied to
      confirm the diagnosis of acid reflux disease, but certain amounts of individuals with
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not show favorable response to PPI test. In order
      to make a distinction of these diseases, esophageal pH-metry is needed, however it is not
      always available in most clinics. Recent data showed that new endoscopic technology such as
      Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging could demonstrate indistinct lesions caused by GERD which are
      not detectable by standard endoscopy, subsequently improve endoscopic diagnosis of these
      diseases. In addition, simultaneous analysis of gastric juice can help to determine whether
      bile reflux is present or not. As it is known, pathologic refluxes underlie not functional
      dyspepsia but acid/bile reflux disease. Hence, it is hypothesized that Endoscopic Tri-Modal
      Imaging in combination with simultaneous analysis of gastric juice could be used to
      differentiate functional dyspepsia from acid/bile reflux disease.
