  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a registry study. This is an observational, non-randomized, open, long-term project
      to collect biological samples (e.g. tissue and blood samples) in addition to clinical
      information and laboratory test results, from end-stage patients who undergo LVAD
      implantation and/or heart transplantation. There are no investigational treatments, drug or
      procedures associated with participation in registry activities.

      Data collection will not immediately influence the course of treatment for any patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After informed consent is obtained from the patient, the blood samples will be obtained
      either during a procedure from access lines inserted for the procedure or they will be drawn
      when other ordered lab work is done at specific time points. While blood samples collection
      is preferred, it is not required, and the decision to collect blood samples will be left to
      the discretion of the investigator.

        -  Tissue samples will be obtained at the time of LVAD implantation by keeping the part of
           the left ventricular apex that the surgeon is removing in order to place the inflow
           cannula of the LVAD. No extra tissue sample other than the tissue that has to be removed
           as a part of a standard LVAD operation needs to be obtained.

        -  Tissue samples will be acquired from the failing heart at the time of heart
           transplantation, after it has been excised and a donor heart has been implanted in its
           place.

        -  Control tissue samples will be acquired intraoperatively during cardiac surgery wherein
           any amount of excised tissue is routinely discarded.

      In some cases, when a patient has an existing LVAD implant for destination therapy, and is
      not eligible for cardiac transplant, and is not scheduled for cardiac surgery in the
      foreseeable future, the patient will be approached for consent for blood samples. In
      addition, consent to obtain intraoperative tissue samples is requested in the event cardiac
      surgery occurs and/or the device is explanted for any reason in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be in one of the following groups:

             1.1. Patients must be eligible for a -

               -  LVAD implantation or

               -  Heart transplantation 1.2. Patients must be scheduled for another type of cardiac
                  surgery during which tissue is excised that would normally be discarded after
                  surgery.

             1.3. Patients must have a VAD already implanted as destination therapy with no cardiac
             surgery scheduled at the time of consent.

          2. Patients must agree to one or more blood and/or cardiac tissue sample donation(s), and
             longterm storage of these biological samples.

          3. Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the study if any of the following conditions are present:

             written informed consent for participation.

          2. Patients who are less than 18 years of age.
