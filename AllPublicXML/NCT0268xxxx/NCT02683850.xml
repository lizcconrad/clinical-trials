      This prospective, non-randomized, open-label study will assess if taking an Omega-3 SPM™ soft
      gel supplement for four weeks will increase the quality of life in adults with chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One third of the America population is affected by chronic pain. The societal costs
      associated with chronic pain is up to $635 billion dollars annually. Prescribed pain
      medications may have negative side effects, or cause addictions. Having alternative
      treatments that can reduce inflammation and the side effects associated with chronic pain may
      improve the quality of life for millions.

      This prospective, non-randomized, open-label study will assess if taking an Omega-3 SPM™ soft
      gel supplement for four weeks will increase the quality of life in adults with chronic pain.
      SPM™ softgels are a dietary supplement intended to reduce pain and inflammation. Up to 40 men
      and women with chronic pain will be recruited. Outcome measures will be collected at
      baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks with a primary endpoint of 4 weeks. The primary outcomes of
      this pilot study include questionnaires to assess quality of life. Exploratory outcomes
      assess safety and tolerability, changes in anxiety and depression as well as levels of pain,
      and blood markers associated with inflammation.
