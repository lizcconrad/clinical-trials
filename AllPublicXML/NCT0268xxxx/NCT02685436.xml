    <textblock>
      Wheezy infants were tested for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) using combined
      multiple channel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH), esophagogastroduodenoscope (EGD), lipid
      laden macrophage index and BAL pepsin. Wheezy infants with abnormal MII-pH or reflux
      esophagitis were given domperidone and omeprazole then re-evaluated for symptoms control and
      exacerbations recurrence.

      Wheezy infants were tested for gastro-esophageal reflux disease using combined MII-pH, EGD,
      LLMI and BAL pepsin. Wheezy infants with abnormal MII-pH or reflux esophagitis were given
      domperidone and omeprazole for 12 weeks then re-evaluated for symptoms control and wheeze
      exacerbations recurrence.

    <measure>Level of wheeze control as determined by number of days free from symptoms and use of reliever medications</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Level of control will be assessed depending on presence of daytime symptoms more than once a week, any night time awakening due to cough, any daytime activity limitation due to wheeze or use of reliever medication more than once a week. Well controlled patients had none of these, partially controlled had 1-2 of these while uncontrolled had 3-4 of these.</description>
