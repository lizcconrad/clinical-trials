  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast augmentation is among the most popular surgical procedures performed in the world with
      approximately 1,773,584 performed in 2013. This surgical intervention generates important
      pains during postsurgical recovery. A multimodal analgesia, based on the recommendations is
      proposed to the patients .The pectoral nerve block is an innovative technique of locoregional
      anesthesia that has already been successfully used in breast surgery. Its realization is
      fast, simple, and it would be superior compared with a paravertebral block within the
      framework of mastectomy. The interest of this technique has never been assessed in esthetic
      breast surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the
      association of &quot; Pecs blocks 1 and 2 &quot; on pain intensity after breast augmentation surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that the &quot;Pecs blocks 1 and 2&quot; will provide a decrease of the
      maximal pain of the first 6 post-operative hours after prosthetic breast expansion. The pain
      will be assessed according to a numerical scale. This prospective, randomized, double blind
      study will include 92 patients successively during two years, randomized into two arms : Pecs
      group and Control group, which will respectively have the block, and no block. The rest of
      the anesthesic and surgical care will be identical.

      An intervention team (which will be different from the anesthesic team), will be alone with
      the patient for 15 minutes, and will realize or not the Pecs blocks according to the previous
      randomisation so that all caregivers taking in charge the patients as well as research
      observers will be blinded.

    <description>After the anesthesic induction, the interventional team composed by at least a senior anaesthesiologist and a nurse anesthestic, will survey the patient and perform the Pecs blocks, whereas the anesthetic team is outside the room.
Realization of Pecs blocks 1 and 2 : the patient is in supine position with placing the upper limb in abduction position, a 100 mm needle is inserted under ultrasound using a linear US probe of high frequency after sheathing.
In the other group, sterilization, sheating and US are performed but the needle is not inserted.</description>
