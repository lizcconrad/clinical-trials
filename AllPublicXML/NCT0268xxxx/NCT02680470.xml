      Using modern technology, the investigators will observe participants taking their TB tablets
      three times per week using a mobile phone, iPod or computer with camera facilities in the
      participants home environment.

      Investigators will connect to the participants mobile phone, iPod or computer at a mutually
      convenient time three times per week who will observe participants taking their TB
      medication.

      The Virtual Observed Therapy will be carried out using NHS Lothian approved software (mobile
      app called POLYCOM) three times per week. This is software similar to Skype but POLYCOM is
      the approved software we use in NHS Lothian.
