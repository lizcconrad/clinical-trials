  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), many studies have been carried out
      with the goal of improving H. pylori eradication and therapies have changed from
      single-antibiotic treatments to the current multi-antibiotic treatments. However, the
      eradication rate of H. pylori is still less than 80%. The reasons for this low eradication
      rate are likely to be multi-factorial, including the reduced activity of antimicrobial drugs,
      poor patient compliance or micro-environment in stomach. In this study, to obtain the higher
      eradication of H. pylori and discover the different mechanism between the current infection
      and refractory infection of H. pylori, it is necessary to perform a prevalence survey for
      eradication of H. pylori based on the results from isolation of H. pylori strains, antibiotic
      susceptibility testing, CYP2C19 gene polymorphism, drug resistance gene sequencing and
      16SrRNA sequencing.

    <description>The biological intervention focused on the results from the antibiotic susceptibility testing. All patients should used the their susceptibility antibiotics according to antibiotic susceptibility testing of H. pylori. Considering the safety of drug usage, priority antibiotic selection was as follow: Amoxicillin &gt; Clarithromycin &gt; Levofloxacin &gt;Tetracycline &gt; Furazolidone &gt; Metronidazole.</description>

    <description>PPI selection should based on the CYP2C19 gene polymorphism of patients. Patients have different metabolizers, such as poor metabolizers (PM), extensive metabolizers (EM) and intermediate metabolizer (IM). Different metabolism of patients should select different PPI or different doses of PPI. For IM and PM, in this study, patients selected the standard dose of Omeprazole. For EM, in this study, patients selected the Esomeprazole with increasing doses 50%-100%.</description>
