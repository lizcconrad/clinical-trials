  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the management of Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR)
      gram-negative bacilli (GNB) represent a real therapeutic dilemma in intensive care unit
      (ICU). Colistin remains an effective agent against MDR GNB. However, because of its side
      effects, mainly nephrotoxicity, other modalities than the intra venous (IV) route should be
      tried. Several recent data emphasize the interest of inhaled route. The investigators purpose
      was to evaluate the effectiveness and systemic toxicity of aerosolized colistin in ventilator
      associated pneumonia.

      prospective, randomized, single-blind study comparing two groups of patients treated with
      aerosolised (AS) colistin versus colistin intravenously (IV). Included were patients who have
      mechanical ventilation over 48 hours and that have developed a VAP. A VAP was defined as a
      CPIS (Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score) &gt;6. Exclusion criteria were septic shock and/or
      bacteraemia. Included patients were divided into two randomized groups. The 1st received
      colistin in AS as 4 MU by nebulisation 3 times per 24 h. The 2nd received colistin in IV as a
      loading dose of 9 MU followed by 4.5MU two times per 24 h. Colistin was given for 14 days or
      until extubation. Patients were followed for 28 days. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by a
      primary outcome: the cure of VAP at day 14 of therapy and defined as resolution of clinical
      and biological signs of infection that means a CPIS&lt; 6 and bacteriological eradication.
      Secondary outcomes: duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay-length and mortality at day
      28. Systemic toxicity was assessed by the occurrence of acute renal failure (ARF) defined as
      increase of plasma creatinine more than 1.5 times its base value.

    <description>the intervention was: AS colistin and &quot;imipenem. the drug administered was colimycin (colistin) powder 1 million units (MU) by a flakon (Sanofi Winthrop Industry) at the dosage of 4 million units (MU) for 30 minutes 3 times per day for at least 14 days in addition to IV imipenem 1 g three times per day. Nebulisation was made via an ultrasonic vibrating plates nebulizer (Aeroneb Pro® Aerogen Nektar Corporation, Galway, Ireland). Inhaled colimycin® requires specific settings of the ventilator to limit turbulence inspiratory flow. The adjustment consisted in a volume controlled mode with a Tidal volume &lt;8 ml / kg, respiratory rate at 12 cycles / min, I / E: 1/1 and an end inspiratory break &gt; 20%.</description>
