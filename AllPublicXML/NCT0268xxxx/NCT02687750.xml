  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testing of a dual tuned proton/fluorine MRI radio frequency coil

      Images were collected from plastic fluorine phantoms taped to the upper thigh of health
      volunteers.

      This trial was performed as part of an application for a Health Canada Investigational Device
      Exemption (Protocol # 226949)

    <description>Eppendorf tubes containing 10% fluorine-19 diluted in agar were taped to the upper thigh of participants. Investigational device was used to image the phantom with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging was performed for anatomical (proton) and fluorine (agent detection). Total scan time was under 1 hour.
Objectives:
Verify RF coil functionality
Obtain preliminary detection threshold limits using a human coil loading</description>
