  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat and is associated with the development of mood and
      substance use disorders. Most medications are only moderately effective, and deep brain
      stimulation is being used to treat sever chronic neuropathic pain. However, this requires
      brain surgery. The goal is to investigate the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      directed at the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate for this disorder. These
      brain regions are in the prefrontal cortex, and research from deep brain stimulation studies
      indicated that stimulating this region may help treat pain. This is a pilot study to
      investigate the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) directed at the regions in the
      prefrontal cortex using the H7 coil, which was developed to reach these deeper brain
      structures. While previous studies have investigated rTMS for pain, none, have used this coil
      to target these brain regions. This study will investigate active vs sham treatment in
      chronic pain participants.

      Neuropathic pain is estimated to affect 3%--‚Äê4.5% of the worldwide population and is
      associated with significant loss of productivity and the development of mood and substance
      use development of mood and substance use disorders. Chronic neuropathic pain is difficult to
      treat with medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting subcortical structures
      (periaqueductal gray or thalamic nuclei) has been investigated for refractory neuropathic
      pain. However, recent work indicates that stimulation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
      (dACC) may be a new potential neuromodulatory target, given its role in affective processing
      of pain.

      In this pilot study, the investigator proposes to investigate the use of repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) directed at the medial prefrontal cortex and
      anterior cingulate as a potential treatment for neuropathic pain. Previous studies using rTMS
      for pain have shown some indicators of success, and this study will investigate the effect of
      the H7 coil, which reaches the medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate, on
      chronic pain syndromes. Using the H7 coil, which was developed to reach deeper structures in
      the prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate, this study will investigate active vs
      sham treatment in chronic pain participants.
