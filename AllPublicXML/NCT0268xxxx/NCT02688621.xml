  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether the addition of
      financial incentives to a high-quality, online behavioral weight loss intervention produces
      better weight losses than the online treatment alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants (N=416) will be recruited in
      approximately equal numbers at two clinical centers, the University of South Carolina and the
      University of Vermont. Eligible participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1)
      an 18-month, 36-session group Internet behavioral weight control treatment (Internet Only)
      which replicates the intervention the investigators have implemented previously; or 2) the
      same 18-month, 36-session group Internet treatment plus financial incentives for performance
      of 3 key self-management behaviors (Internet+ Incentive). Both conditions will have access to
      the same web-based intervention platform and the same counselor-delivered intervention
      elements; the presence of economic incentives for behavioral and weight goals is the only
      difference between the conditions. Assessments will be conducted at Baseline, 2, 6, 12 and 18
      months. Cost data will be collected to inform cost effectiveness evaluations.

    <description>Participants will be required to attend a weekly Internet chat session with your group members and one of the behavioral weight control therapists. Participants will learn the principles of managing eating and exercise behaviors in weekly, hour-long chat sessions and by completing weekly lessons. Participants are asked to self-monitor foods and exercise through the use of a smartphone ap. Participants will wear a tracking device that monitors steps. All participants will be contacted via e-mail individually, by their group leader who will monitor their progress and offer advice and encouragement. Meetings are weekly for 24 weeks and monthly for 12 months.</description>

    <description>Participants are given the same intervention as described for the internet only group, with the exception that they will have the opportunity to earn financial incentives. Financial incentives will be based on participants weight loss, and compliance with certain weight loss behaviors including meeting exercise goals, self-monitoring foods consumed, and daily weighing and reporting.</description>
