      The trial aims to investigate whether acupuncture has an effect in increasing clinical
      pregnancy (pregnancy that is confirmed by a scan) and live birth rates on women undergoing
      IVF treatment.

      Failing to conceive naturally poses significant stress to the infertile couple. It creates a
      feeling of failure and frustration. It has been found that the use of complementary therapies
      makes women feel empowered, with a sense of regaining control of the body.

      The popularity of acupuncture is increasing. A significant proportion of couples having
      fertility treatment, especially IVF (In-Vitro Fertilisation) ask their clinician about using
      acupuncture and some patients undergo acupuncture privately without reporting to their
      clinicians.

      The effectiveness of acupuncture on IVF has been extensively researched; however the results
      are varied and not conclusive. This is due to previous studies varying significantly in their
      study design, acupuncture timing and the final outcome measure. As a result of the difference
      in the studies it is not clear whether acupuncture is beneficial regarding IVF success rates
      and whether it should be offered to women undergoing IVF.
