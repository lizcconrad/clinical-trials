      Background:

      Dystonia is a movement disorder in which a person s muscles contract on their own. This
      causes different parts of the body to twist or turn. The cause of this movement is unknown.
      Researchers think it may have to do with a chemical called acetylcholine. They want to learn
      more about why acetylcholine in the brain doesn t work properly in people with dystonia.

      Objective:

      To better understand how certain parts of the brain take up acetylcholine in people with
      dystonia.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old who have DYT1 dystonia or cervical dystonia.

      Healthy adult volunteers.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and pregnancy test.

      Study visit 1:

      Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. The MRI scanner
      is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field that takes pictures of the brain. Participants
      will lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder.

      Study visit 2:

      Participants will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The PET scanner is shaped
      like a doughnut. Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner. A
      small amount of a radioactive chemical that can be detected by the PET scanner will be given
      through an IV line to measure how the brain takes up acetylcholine.

      Dystonia is a heterogeneous group of movement disorders characterized by abnormal muscle
      contractions resulting in abnormal postures and movements. The spectrum of dystonia includes
      focal, segmental, multifocal, and generalized presentations with a broad range of age of
      onset. An example of a focal dystonia is cervical dystonia. The pathophysiology of dystonia
      is unclear, but prior neuroimaging and neuropathological studies have identified a role for
      the basal ganglia. In neuroimaging studies, microstructural changes in the basal ganglia have
      been found in voxel based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and abnormal
      basal ganglia metabolism has been seen in imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography (FDG-PET) in various types of dystonia. Basal ganglia pathology has been observed,
      including a case series reporting neuronal loss in the striatum. There is further evidence
      implicating the basal ganglia in dystonia from studies of animal models. In animal models,
      experimental lesions of the basal ganglia induced dystonia. An abnormality in cholinergic
      neurotransmission has been has also been suggested because of a clinical response to
      antimuscarinic medications. The striatum is a site of acetylcholine synthesis, and expresses
      muscarinic receptors. While antimuscarinic medications are useful in the symptomatic
      treatment of dystonia, the role of muscarinic acetylcholine neurotransmission in dystonia is
      unclear.

      Objective

      The objective of this application is to determine the role played by a major basal ganglia
      neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, in the pathophysiology of primary dystonia. The central
      hypothesis is that cholinergic neurotransmission is deficient in the striatum in dystonia.

      Study Population

      We plan to examine one group of patients with a form of primary dystonia (cervical dystonia)
      to be compared with healthy volunteers without history of neurological or psychiatric
      disorders.

      Design

      This is a case-control study. Using a neuroimaging technique, position emission tomography
      (PET), the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing one specific aim: to map M2
      muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding in cervical dystonia as measured with PET using
      [18F]FP-TZTP.

      Outcome Measures

      This study will determine cholinergic neurotransmitter receptor binding in patients with
      cervical dystonia compared with healthy controls. This proposed research study is expected to
      advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of dystonia in order to identify possible
      targets for potential pharmacological treatments in dystonia and monitor disease progression.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy research volunteers and adult patients with cervical dystonia will be eligible for
        the study.

          1. Adult patients with cervical dystonia will have clinically documented cervical
             dystonia established by history and physical/neurological examination.

             --Cervical dystonia patients must not have had received botulinum toxin injections
             into neck muscles for at least about 3 months at time of study participation

          2. Healthy volunteers will be healthy subjects without neurological or psychiatric
             disorders established by history and physical/neurological examination.

          3. All participants will be at least 18 years of age. There is no maximum age limit.

          4. Participants must be able to abstain from tobacco or nicotine replacement for at least
             3 days prior to PET scan if participating in both MRI and PET scanning..

          5. Participants must be able to abstain from caffeine for at least 24 hours prior to PET
             scan if participating in both MRI and PET scanning.

          6. Participants must be able to fast for 3 hours before PET scan if participanting in
             both MRI and PET scanning.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Subjects who are incapable of giving informed consent.

          2. Employees of NINDS

          3. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Aside from history obtained at the screening,
             pregnancy status in women with childbearing potential is also established by urine
             pregnancy testing no more than 24 hours before each MRI and PET scan session.

          4. Subjects with past or present medical history of (a) neurological disorders, such as
             stroke, movement disorders (other than cervical dystonia in the patient group), brain
             tumors, traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness lasting more than a few
             seconds, ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases, alcoholism,
             drug dependence; (b) psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, major depressive
             and/or bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder; (c) ventricular arrhythmias,
             renal and hepatic insufficiency, vascular headache, or carcinoid syndrome.

          5. Abnormalities in neurological examination other what is typically associated with
             cervical dystonia, or any abnormalities in neurological examination in healthy
             volunteers.

          6. Subjects who are currently taking oral medications known to affect muscarinic
             acetylcholine receptor binding in the central nervous system. Of note, some over-the
             counter-medications are known to affect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding.
             Subjects who use medications known to affect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
             binding, such as first generation antihistamines for common cold and allergy symptoms
             and sleep aids for insomnia, occasionally on an as needed basis may be enrolled in
             this study. Furthermore, these as needed medications should be paused for at least 3
             days before PET scanning. This three-day period is equivalent to about 4 to 5 half
             lives for these medications. In addition, subjects who use topical antimuscarinic
             medications, such as eye drops for glaucoma and inhalers, may be enrolled in this
             study because topical antimuscarinic medications have negligible systemic
             bioavailability. Subjects who have contraindications to MRI, ferromagnetic objects in
             their bodies (e.g., implanted stimulators including deep brain stimulation, aneurysm
             clips, prosthesis, artificial heart valves, etc.) that cannot be removed for the
             purpose of study participation.

          7. Subjects who have claustrophobia.

          8. Subjects who are unable to lie comfortably on their back for about one hour for MRI
             scanning (and about two hours for PET scanning if participating in both MRI and PET
             scanning).

          9. Subjects with any radiation exposure in the past year that, together with the research
             PET scan, would exceed the NIH Radiation Safety Committee s annual limit (5 rem) if
             participating in both MRI and PET scanning.

         10. Cervical dystonia patients who have cervical dystonia associated with trauma
