  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both acute gallbladder pathology and diverticular disease are common conditions met in
      emergency departments in the western world and comprise the bulk of admissions throughout
      general surgical calls. On the other hand both entities need imagistic confirmation and
      description to tailor further management, which may be not readily available at the moment of
      patient's presentation in A&amp;E's doorstep or after referral to the on call general surgeon.
      These delays may lose the window of opportunity for emergency surgery or prolong unnecessary
      admission for a patient with known condition which may need just a fast exclusion of a more
      advanced stage and then be further treated conservatively or even discharged.

      The increased length of stay, as investigators know and expect is rising the costs of
      healthcare and this is a very delicate subject in nowadays medical practice. Investigators
      think that USS performed at the bedside will help in decreasing the length of stay,
      especially for weekend admissions when radiology is not readily available.

      Ultrasound scanning (USS) has become very popular over the last half century and the
      equipment has become more compact, of a higher quality and less expensive, which has
      facilitated the growth of point-of-care ultrasonography — that is, USS performed and
      interpreted by the clinician at the bedside. The concept of an 'ultrasound stethoscope' is
      rapidly moving from theory to reality.

      Since 1993 surgeon-performed US came to the attention at 79th Annual Clinical Congress of the
      American College of Surgeons. Nowadays USS was extended successfully to other acute settings,
      and in several USA residency programs and several EU countries, bed side imaging is included
      in the training curriculum or as stand alone competence for non radiological medical
      practitioners.

      Alas it is still not the norm across EU or the entire USA despite studies that proved its
      usefulness.

      As an example, currently in Ireland surgeon performed US is not a popular skill. The present
      paper proposes to address this issue at a larger scale than present studies, which tend to be
      confined on a limited number of patients and hospitals and different approaches. Currently,
      the European Society for Trauma &amp; Emergency Surgery® provides modular USS courses that imbue
      surgeons with necessary skills to perform bedside US for conditions like trauma (FAST scan),
      acute cholecystitis. Also this paper aims to leap forward, for the more skilled
      ultrasonographers in diagnosing and classifying diverticular disease.

      The paper will be divided in two parts, the general part (with an extensive literature review
      and basic science and gestures for US performing) while the second part will be the original
      research.

      The closing remark is that by learning and doing these procedures the surgeon performing USS
      doesn't undermine his/her radiologist colleague's authority and skill. The big picture is
      that some basic tasks are transferrable and if used in an appropriate and methodical manner
      the final common goal - the benefit of the patient - is readily achieved.

      The study was accepted as a Master of Surgery Thesis by Research (MCh) at the Royal College
      of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI)

      There will be two parallel studies done at the same time:

        1. Bed-side surgeon performed ultrasound scanning (USS) for biliary pathology

        2. Bed-side surgeon performed USS for suspected diverticulitis

      There will be a number of ultrasound courses in which surgeons and radiologists will teach
      other surgeons how to perform basic USS in regards to suspected cholelithiasis and
      diverticular disease. The courses are endorsed by the European Society for Trauma and
      Emergency Surgery (ESTES).

      As a note, the students are surgeons with little-to-none experience in ultrasound scanning.

      The course website is in the following link: http://www.thesoundofthebody.org

      This courses have 2 to 4 modules in which the basics of USS is taught and have a large
      hands-on experience. Then 15-20 examinations under supervision per student have to be done
      before embarking into the study.

      A good chance for that is in the induction room before elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
      in patients with known gallbladder disease.

      STUDY

      Patients with suspected biliary pathology or diverticular disease (as per inclusion criteria
      below) that are coming into the Emergency Department (ED), clinic, preoperatively or as a
      consult in the hospital will undergo an USS done by the naive surgeons trained in one of
      these courses.

      Patients will be explained the procedure, will have a leaflet with information and an
      informed consent that they will have to sign.

      Bed-side USS is performed after that usually immediately or several hours after presentation
      (depends on the type of consult request), and the results and measurements are recorded on a
      data sheet (one type of data sheet for each study -biliary or diverticular-). Pictures with
      the images are saved as well for quality control. Time, date is recorded as well.

      Then the same patients will have a departmental USS/CAT-Scan (depends on the pathology
      suspected) done by qualified radiologists. Or there are instances when the patients will have
      to undergo surgery and then the scans will be compared to the intra-operative findings.

      In Ireland this usually takes a long time, patients may come to ED on a Friday and have their
      USS done in radiology department on Monday. The radiologist performing the USS/CT/MRI does
      not know that the patient has already been scanned by the surgeon.

      In Ireland the radiologist's report is uploaded in an online system named NIMIS (The National
      Integrated Medical Imaging System), along with time and date of the actual scanning, time and
      date of reporting (reporting is not instantly).

      Data will be collected and stored anonymously, and processed with Microsoft Excel, IMB SPSS,
      R-studio

      The same rules will be applied in hospitals from other countries that will get involved in
      the study. As soon as Investigators have the names and approval from them to get involved,
      they will be uploaded on this ClinicalTrials.

    <description>The final diagnosis of the US performed by surgeons will be compared to the final radiologist report.

After the study finishes we will calculate the percentage of matching diagnoses of US performed by surgeons compared to the radiologist's report.
