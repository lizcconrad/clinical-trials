    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to analyze subjects having a normal hip and compare the in
      vivo kinematics to subjects requiring a total hip arthroplasty (THA) due to having a diseased
      hip and then later post-operative to their implanted hip. Ten subjects will have a normal
      hip, ten hips will be diseased, requiring a THA and then those ten diseased hips will be
      re-analyzed at six months post-operative after implantation of a THA.

        Inclusion Criteria for diseased/implanted subjects:

          -  Subjects will require a THA and will be implanted with either Summit/Pinnacle THA or
             Corail/Pinnacle THA.

          -  Patients must be at least six months post-operative with no other surgical procedures
             conducted within the past six months that will prohibit them from performing the study
             activities.

          -  Patients must be between 40-85 years of age.

          -  Potential subjects will have a body weight of less than 250 lbs.

          -  Participants must have Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 38.

          -  Potential subjects' THAs should be judged clinically successful with a HHS &gt;90.

          -  Subjects must have demonstrated no evidence of post-operative hip subluxation or
             dislocation.

          -  Subjects must not walk with a detectable limp and must be able to actively abduct
             their operated hip against gravity without difficulty.

          -  Participants must be able to walk on level ground, ascend and descend a ramp and rise
             from a chair without assistance.

          -  Patients from the physician's list who do not meet the study requirements will not be
             considered.

          -  Patients must be willing to sign the Informed Consent (IC)/HIPAA form to participate
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria for diseased/implanted subjects:

          -  Pregnant, potentially pregnant or lactating females. To satisfy radiation protocol,
             each female subject will be asked if she is pregnant, or possibly could be pregnant. A
             pregnant person will not be allowed to participate in the study.

          -  Subjects without one of the two types of required hip implants.

          -  Subjects who have had surgery within the past 6 months that would prohibit them from
             performing level walking, ascend and descend a ramp and rise from a chair without aid
             or support of any kind.

          -  Subjects who are unable to perform level walking, ascend and descend a ramp and rise

             from a chair without aid of any kind or have had any kind of surgical procedure within
