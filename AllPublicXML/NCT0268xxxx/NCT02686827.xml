  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low Vitamin D3 (VD3) levels have been reported to be associated with the risk of allergic
      diseases like asthma. VD3 has been demonstrated in vitro, ex vivo and in animal models to
      program the immune system towards anti-inflammatory immune responses. VD3 co-administered
      with allergen may be a promising adjuvant to improve the onset and efficacy of allergen
      immunotherapy (AIT). A clinical trial will be performed to compare the immune effects, the
      tolerability and safety of multiple doses of aVD3 analogue (registered for the intravenous
      route) administered by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route in subjects with allergic rhinitis and
      healthy controls.

      The overall aim is to provide additional (in vivo) support for the use of VD3 as an adjuvant
      in allergen-specific immunotherapy, on top of the existing pre-clinical evidence
      demonstrating that antigen-presenting cells educate the adaptive immune system towards an
      anti-inflammatory response when allergen is seen in the presence of VD3.

      Low Vitamin D3 (VD3) levels have been reported to be associated with the risk of allergic
      diseases like asthma. In addition, VD3 has been demonstrated in vitro, ex vivo
      (skin-explants) and in animal models to program the immune system towards anti-inflammatory
      immune responses, dominated by regulatory T-cells (Treg) producing Interleukin (IL)-10. In
      response to allergens, healthy individuals by default have such a protective immune response
      against innocuous allergens, whereas allergic subjects develop an inflammatory Th2-type
      response. VD3 co-administered with allergen may be a promising adjuvant to improve the onset
      and efficacy of allergen immunotherapy (AIT), by helping the allergic immune system to divert
      towards an allergen-specific response dominated by regulatory T cells (Treg) and IL-10. A
      clinical trial will be performed to compare the immune effects, the tolerability and safety
      of multiple doses of a VD3 analogue (Zemplar® 5 μg/ml - Abbvie, registered for the
      intravenous route) administered by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route in subjects with allergic
      rhinitis and healthy controls. Primary and secondary outcomes will be compared at baseline
      and at several time points during the study to investigate whether 1) the healthy controls at
      baseline have a more anti-inflammatory systemic cellular immune response to polyclonal
      stimuli and to allergens compared to birch pollen allergic subjects, and 2) whether s.c.VD3
      analogue can skew these responses in allergic subjects towards a profile more resembling the
      one observed in healthy controls. The overall aim is to provide additional (in vivo) support
      for the use of VD3 as an adjuvant in allergen-specific immunotherapy, on top of the existing
      pre-clinical evidence demonstrating that antigen-presenting cells educate the adaptive immune
      system towards an anti-inflammatory response when allergen is seen in the presence of VD3.

          3. Allergic rhinitis/rhino-conjunctivitis related to birch pollen with or without
             concomitant mild to moderate persistent asthma based on relative symptoms and allergy
             tests.

          4. A positive SPT (mean wheal diameter ≥ 3mm compared to negative control and negative
             control should be negative) for birch pollen assessed within 1 year before
             randomization OR a positive serum specific anti-birch IgE-test (&gt;0.7 U/ml)

          3. No history of respiratory allergies and no nasal symptoms at screening.

          4. A negative SPT (a positive outcome is defined as a mean wheal diameter ≥ 3mm compared
             to negative control and negative control should be negative) assessed within 1 year
             before randomization OR a negative serum specific IgE test for aeroallergens.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of allergen-specific immunotherapy (SCIT or SLIT) with any allergen(s)

         10. Severe uncontrolled diseases that could increase the risk for subjects participating
             in the study, including but not limited to: cardiovascular insufficiency, any severe
             or unstable lung diseases, endocrine diseases, clinically significant renal or hepatic
             diseases, or hematological disorders

         11. Active inflammation or infection of the target organs (nose, eyes or lower airways) at
             the start of the study

         12. Use of preparations containing calcium or magnesium such as thiazide, diuretics,
             antacides.

         13. Use of systemic steroids within 4 weeks before screening and during the study

         14. Daily use of ketoconazole cream or immunosuppressive creams at planned injection site
             less than 7 days before or during the study

         15. Pregnancy, lactation or inadequate contraceptive measures for women of child-bearing
             age (adequate contraceptive measures will be the use of a contraceptive device or
             -pill)

         16. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory parameter at screening

         17. Any physical or mental condition that precludes compliance or participation in a
             clinical trial

         18. Subjects who are employees or students of the institution or 1st grade relatives or
             partners of the investigators
