  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator evaluates whether there are age-specific diurnal changes in
      markers of cortical plasticity in children, adolescents and adults. The question will be
      investigated by the quantification of brain metabolites and structural brain volumes using
      magnet resonance imaging (MRI) and electrophysiological markers using sleep encephalography
      (sleep EEG). In a second step, it will be tested how these markers of cortical plasticity
      change depending on a modulation of sleep by applying tones during deep sleep.

    <textblock>
      Given that children and adolescents undergo entirely different maturational processes
      (children show an increase, adolescents a decrease in synapse density) larger diurnal changes
      in children are expected compared to adolescents concerning brain metabolites and structural
      markers. These cortical changes in synapse density are thought to be reflected in
      electrophysiological markers in the sleep EEG (children show a higher slow wave activity,
      adolescents a reduced slow wave activity). With the modulation of the deep (slow wave) sleep
      by playing short, low volume tones, the investigators want to test if there is a causal
      relationship between slow wave sleep and markers of cortical plasticity.
