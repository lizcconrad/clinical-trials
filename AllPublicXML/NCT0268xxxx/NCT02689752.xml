    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single-center study to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of
      HMPL-013 in approximately 6 healthy male subjects receiving a single oral 5mg dose of
      HMPL-013 containing approximately 100 microcuries of [14C] HMPL-013. This study will
      investigate the absorption, drug biotransformation and mass balance of HMPL-013, seek to
      identify the compound's major metabolites and supply information for clinical application.

      This study will be an open-label, mass balance study of fruquintinib administered orally at
      5mg (100mCi). Subjects will be screened for eligibility up to 14 days prior to entry into the
      study. For study period, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on the
      day before dosing and fast overnight (approximately 10 hours). On the morning of dosing for
      study period, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 5 mg fruquintinib in the fasted
      state. Subjects will remain at the CRU for at least 336 hours after administration of study
      drug for collection of serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and safety
      monitoring.
