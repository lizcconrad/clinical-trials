          2. Radiologically or histologically confirmed visceral dominant metastases;

          3. Patients who are expected to acquire benefit from chemotherapy: ER and/or PR positive
             patients who developed resistance after prior endocrine therapy; HER2+ patients who
             experienced disease progression on prior target therapy and are not suitable for
             subsequent target therapy; mTNBC patients who relapsed after platinum therapy;

          4. At least one measurable disease according to the response evaluation criteria in solid
             tumor (RECIST 1.1);

          5. Patients who received paclitaxol in metastatic setting should be proven effective to
             prior paclitaxol based regimen and disease progressed after at least 3 months from the
             last administration of paclitaxol; those who received paclitaxel as
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy can be enrolled if disease relapsed after at least 6
             months from the completion of neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who received

          2. Patients who are expected to acquire benefit from endocrine or target therapy;

          3. Radiotherapy of axial bones within 4 weeks before enrollment or lack of recovery from
             prior radiotherapy;

          4. Treatment with other experimental drug within 4 weeks before enrollment;

          5. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system metastases are not permitted, except
             for those with stable and asymptomatic brain metastases who have completed cranial
             irradiation, and have at least one measurable lesion outside the brain. Radiotherapy
             should be completed within 4 weeks prior to enrollment;

          6. Other active malignancies (including other hematologic malignancies) or other
             malignancies within the last 5 years, except for cured nonmelanoma skin cancer or
             cervical intraepithelial neoplasia;

          7. Patients with a history of symptomatic cardiovascular, hepatic, respiratory, renal ,
