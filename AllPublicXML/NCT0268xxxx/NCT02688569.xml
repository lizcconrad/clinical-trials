  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled clinical trial will examine the effects of Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT-) in patients with comorbid chronic widespread pain (CWP) and insomnia.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To examine the clinical and health characteristics, including sleep, pain, fatigue,
           cognitive abilities, and cardiovascular health in patients with comorbid CWP and
           insomnia.

        2. To examine changes in the primary clinical outcomes, including chronic pain, complaints
           of poor sleep, and fatigue compared to the waitlist control (WLC).

        3. To examine changes in the secondary clinical outcomes, including mood, daytime
           functioning, cognitive functioning, and cardiovascular health compared WLC.

        4. To examine the mechanistic variables, including arousal (heart rate variability, HRV),
           CS (thermal response) and neural plasticity (brain function and structure) - compared to
           WLC.

      This randomized controlled clinical trial will examine the effects of CBT in patients with
      chronic widespread pain and insomnia. Sample will include 20 patients ([18]-65 years) who
      satisfy criteria for chronic widespread pain and insomnia. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to CBT or waitlist control. All participants randomized to the cognitive-behavioral
      interventions will receive 4 treatment sessions (~50 minutes each). Baseline, posttreatment,
      [&amp; 3-mo.] follow-up assessments will include measures of sleep, pain, thermal pain response,
      heart rate variability, brain structure and functions, affect, cognitive functioning,
      cardiovascular health, and substance use.

    <description>CBT-CWP in this study involves 4 sessions of one-hour non-drug behavioral intervention. Session 1 involves education about pain and insomnia and the relationship between the two. Participants will also learn sleep hygiene and stimulus control skills. Session 3 involves teaching participants skills to limit non-sleep time in bed and thus increase sleep efficiency. Participants will also learn the relationship between pain and activity. Session 4 involves teaching participants cognitive restructuring and mindfulness skills to manage maladaptive thoughts related to pain and insomnia. Participants will also review the skills they learned and discuss the maintenance of treatment gains.</description>
