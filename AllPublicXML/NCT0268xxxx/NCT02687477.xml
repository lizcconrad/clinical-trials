    <textblock>
      This project is focused on the treatment of severe obstructive sleep apnea with pulmonary
      artery denervation (PADN). Although it has now been proved that continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) is the primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, on the other hand,
      there is evidence that 25 to 50% of patients can not tolerate CPAP.

      The investigators previously reported the safety and efficacy of pulmonary artery denervation
      (PADN) for treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Excessive sympathetic activation play an
      important role in the occurrence and development of OSA and cause cardiovascular events. It
      is worth evaluating the feasibility and tolerance of introducing PADN at the severe stage of
      obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of PADN in the treatment of severe OSA.

    <description>Contrast pulmonary artery （PA) angiography was performed to localize the pulmonary artery bifurcation level and calculate the PA diameter.Once the anatomy was deemed acceptable, the radiofrequency ablation catheter was introduced into the distal bifurcation area of the main PA.This was then maneuvered within the PA to allow energy delivery to ensure that the electrodes were tightly in contact with the endovascular surface. About two to three ablations at 1-15 W for 240 seconds each point were performed in the distal bifurcation area of the main PA.</description>
