      A prospective, open-label, multicentre phase-II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      a sequential regimen of bendamustine followed by ofatumumab and ibrutinib followed by
      ibrutinib and ofatumumab maintenance in CLL patients.

      In the CLL2-BIO trial an allcomer CLL population with indication for treatment will be
      included.

      Patient will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with bendamustin unless
      contraindications are existing or debulking is not indicated. Afterwards 6 cycles of
      induction therapy with ofatumumab and ibrutinib will be applied, each with a duration of 28
      days. Primary endpoint overall Response rate will be assessed at final restaging.

      Patients benefitting from BIO treatment will enter the maintenance phase of the trial.
      Maintenance treatment will be continued if no unacceptable toxicity occurs until three months
      after negativity of minimal residual disease (MRD) is achieved in peripheral blood in
      patients with (clinical) complete response (CR) or (clinical) incomplete complete response
      (CRi) confirmed by 2 consecutive testings of MRD within 3 months, progression of CLL, start
      of a subsequent therapy or up to 8 cycles of maintenance (each cycle with a duration of 84
      calendar days = 3 months), whichever occurs first.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented CLL requiring treatment (irrespective if first- or relapse treatment)
             according to International Working Group on CLL (iwCLL) criteria

             In case of previously treated patients, these must have recovered from acute
             toxicities and treatment regimen must be stopped within the following time periods
             before start of the study treatment in the CLL2-BIO trial:
