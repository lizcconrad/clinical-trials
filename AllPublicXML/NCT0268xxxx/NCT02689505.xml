  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-centre, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open-label, dose escalating
      study of BI 836880 administered intravenously once a week. The eligible patient population
      will be patients with advanced solid tumors.

      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase II doses for BI 836880 in patients with solid tumors. Preliminary safety
      data will be evaluated as secondary objectives.

      Subsequently, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic changes in circulating biomarkers and
      Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI), anti-tumor activity and the
      immunogenicity of BI 836880 will be explored up to a total of 40 patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

      Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with over dose control
      (EWOC) using at least 2 patients per dose cohorts.

      Safety criteria will be followed, including adverse events according to Common Terminology
      Criteria (CTCAE version 4.03), incidence of dose limiting toxicities, physical examination,
      vital signs, safety laboratory parameters and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).

                  psychiatric, infectious disease or active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin)
                  or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial
                  participation or trial drug administration, and in the judgment of the
                  investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the trial.

                  (excluding central venous catheter thrombosis and peripheral deep vein
