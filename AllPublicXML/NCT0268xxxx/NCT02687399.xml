      The purpose of this study is to determine the haemostatic efficacy of TT-173, reducing the
      total blood loss associated with the total knee arthroplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the TT-173 has been cleared for use as a topical hemostatic agent, the proposed study will
      further investigate the safety and efficacy of TT-173 in the knee arthroplasty.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who signed the informed consent.

          2. Patients affected of degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee that have to undergo a
             primary total knee replacement.

          3. Patients of both sexes older than 18 years.

          4. Female patients in childbearing age* that are not permanently sterile, should present
             a negative pregnancy test and should agree to use a medically accepted anti
             contraceptive method during its participation in the study. This includes oral,
             intravaginal, transdermal, injectable or implantable hormonal contraceptives, sexual
             abstinence, bilateral tubal occlusion, intrauterine hormone-releasing system or
             dispositive and vasectomy of the partner.

             * Includes the period between menarche and until becoming post-menopausal. A woman is
             considered post-menopausal when she has gone without a period for 12 consecutive
             months.

          5. Patients must have a haemoglobin concentration ≥ to 12.5 g/dL at the selection visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients affected of any kind of congenital or acquired coagulopathies or with
             personal history of abnormal haemorrhagic episodes.

          2. Patients subjected to knee replacement due to rheumatoid or seronegative arthritis,
             infection or other autoimmune inflammatory causes of join degeneration.

          3. Patients subjected to revision procedures of the knee, hemiarthroplasty or that will
             receive non-cemented knee prosthesis.

          4. Subjects affected of a serious medical condition that would compromise their clinical
             outcome such as hepatic, respiratory, cardiac or renal insufficiency, acute infectious
             disease and active cancer.

          5. Subjects with known history of haematological alterations which are causative of
             thrombophilia.

          6. Subjects with personal history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism,
             retinal vascular occlusion or multiple abortions.

          7. Subjects with known hypersensitivity or allergy to any component of the drug.

          8. Subjects that are currently under treatment with anticoagulant, antiplatelet or
             antifibrinolytic drugs. These subjects may be eligible if the treatment is stopped
             preoperatively according with the conditions indicated in section 9.2.

          9. Subjects who have received treatment (erythropoietin, iron, folate) to improve
             preoperative anaemia.

         10. Subjects who are not free to give informed consent or who are mentally incapacitated
             to the discretion of investigators.

         11. Subjects who participate or have participated in the past three months in another
             clinical trial with drug treatment.

         12. Subjects that are the investigators, collaborators, nurses, centre employees or any
             other person directly related to the development of the protocol.

         13. Subjects who are pregnant or lactating.
