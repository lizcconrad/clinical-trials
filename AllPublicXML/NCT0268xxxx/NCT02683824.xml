    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the use of integrin alpha-v-beta [18F]-R01-MG-F2 Positron
      Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) and Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging in (PET/MRI) in measuring response in patients with pancreatic cancer and
      healthy volunteers. Integrins, such as integrin alpha-v-beta-6 (avb6), are a family of
      membrane receptors that are overexpressed on the cell surface of pancreatic cancers.
      [18F]-R01-MG-F2 targets avb6, which may improve early detection of and better stratify
      treatment options for patients with pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the biodistribution and safety of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 in healthy volunteers.

      II. Evaluate the feasibility of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT scanning in patients with pancreatic
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT or PET/MR scan
      immediately after and at 60 and 120 minutes. Patients will be followed up at 24-48 hours.
