      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the diameter and flow of the superior
      mesenteric artery in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage undergoing hypertensive
      therapy for cerebral artery vasospasm are effected enough to justify withholding enteral
      nutrition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study measurements of the diameter and Doppler flow velocity of the superior mesenteric
      artery (SMA) using abdominal ultrasound in order to evaluate the potential additional risk of
      non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) and non occlusive bowel necrosis (NOBN) in patients
      undergoing hypertensive therapy for cerebral vasospasm in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
      (aSAH), to justify the withholding of enteral nutrition.
