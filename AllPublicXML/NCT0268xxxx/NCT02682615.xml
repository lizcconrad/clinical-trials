      Evaluation of a non-invasive technique to measure cardiac output (esCCO™) with the &quot;clinical
      goldstandard&quot; of the transcardiopulmonal thermodilution technique (PiCCO®). Effect of
      different potential interference factors to the accuracy of measurement (changing
      concentration of norepinephrine, generally severity of the basic disease - APACHE II score).

      The measurements have to estimate the agreement of esCCO™ and PiCCO® related to the cardiac
      output (cardiac index). It should consult a comparison of methods between a complete
      non-invasive cardiac output monitoring method (esCCO™) and the transcardiopulmonal
      thermodilution technique (PiCCO®). The accuracy shall carve out as well as the power of
      agreement of both measurement methods.

      It takes two simultaneous measurements at a time of critically ill patients at
      interdisciplinary surgical intensive care units. Furthermore the force of the major variables
      (1. requirement of norepinephrine and 2. APACHE II-score) to the estimators shall be
      realized.

      esCCO™ vs. (PiCCO®)

      This research shall include 100 patients which have to undergo a complex intensive care
      treatment within predefined therapy intentions.

      During a daily screening within the interdisciplinary surgical intensive care units of the
      Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel it will be opted for the inclusion of
      the patients.

      Points of time x [x ε M and M = {1, 2, 3, 4}] - two test series (measurement 1 and 2).

      According to the ability of the patient to the research the predefined point of time number 1
      will be supposed (point of time number 1: inclusion criterium). The predefined point of time
      number 2 will be supposed if the therapy concept is planned or changed. The point of time
      number 3 is defined as the re-evaluation in the course of changed therapy conceptions. If the
      medical practitioner team decides to renounce the PiCCO-system, the predefined point of time
      number 4 has arrived.

      The requirement of norepinephrine will be registered in every measurement (1 and 2). The
      APACHE II-score will be surveyed each point of time x (see above).

      The remaining treatment of the patients will be performed in the conventional way by the
      medical practitioner team within the interdisciplinary surgical intensive care units.

        The aim of this study is the estimation of the agreement between esCCO™ and the
        transcardiopulmonal thermodilution technique (PiCCO®) using Bland-Altman-treatment. The
        95%-confidence interval of the limits of agreement was selected for the design of the
        number of cases. At a number of cases by 100 you will get the width of 0,68 s (s: standard
        deviation of the differences of the measurement techniques). This is reasonable for the
        question (Bland and Altman 1986, you have to compare the recommendation of Bland:
        https://www.users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/meas/sizemeth.htm).
