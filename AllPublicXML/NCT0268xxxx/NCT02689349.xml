      The New Enrollment Post-Approval Study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      Esteem Totally Implantable Hearing System in subjects suffering from moderate to severe
      hearing loss.

      Purpose:

      To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the Esteem Totally Implantable Hearing
      System (hereafter called Esteem) in subjects suffering from moderate to severe hearing loss.

      Questions:

      The following questions are to be answered:

        -  Is Esteem effective through 1 year follow-up?

        -  Is Esteem safe through 1 year follow-up?

        -  Is the incidence of facial paresis/paralysis at 1 month follow-up no greater than 7%?
