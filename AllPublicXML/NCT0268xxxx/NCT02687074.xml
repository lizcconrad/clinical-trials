  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is the danger for the patients admitted in ICU, mechanical ventilation
      could save a lot of patients' life, however, it prolongs patients' ICU stay and hospital
      stay. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has advantages of PEEP effects, reducing dead space,
      increasing EELV and improving comfort, and it has been used to treat respiratory failure
      patients. In recent study, HFNC could improve mortality of respiratory failure patients with
      P/F&lt;200mmHg in the subgroup. The investigators want to start a randomized controlled study to
      evaluate the effects of HFNC on the patients with respiratory failure.

               -  a respiratory rate of more than 25 breaths per minute,

               -  a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) to the Fio2 of 300 mm
                  Hg or less while the patient was breathing oxygen at a flow rate of 10 liters per
                  minute or more for at least 15 minutes,

               -  a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Paco2) not higher than 45 mmHg,
