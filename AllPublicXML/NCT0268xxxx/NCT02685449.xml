  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, cross-over study. The aim of this study is to compare the post-prandial
      glycaemic variability after pure protein meal following with an administration of square-wave
      bolus of meal-insulin or without any meal-insulin bolus on the other day.

      Prolonged post-prandial glycaemic variability will be identified using the self-monitoring of
      blood glucose (10-point curve) and CGMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The square-wave bolus (for meals rich in fat and/or protein) is evenly delivered over several
      hours as programmed by the patient. The required insulin dose will be calculated based on
      patient's insulin-exchange ratio. Pure protein meal will be given 3 hours after a first
      breakfast.

      To provide the minimal impact of the previous breakfast, all patients will receive up to 120
      kcal of carbohydrates and &lt;100 kcal from protein and fat for the first breakfast (without any
      extended bolus) Patients receive a standardized pure protein meal at a second breakfast time.
      Meal insulin will be given as a square bolus or no meal -insulin will be given at all. The 5h
      post-meal glucose excursions will be recorded by self-blood glucose measurements (SMBG)
      (every 30 minutes) and continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). The intervention is
      taking part under in-patient clinical conditions.

The fat-protein-insulin ratio on both study days were identical to the patient's ratio when entering trial.
Kind of study bolus insulin will be a rapid-acting insulin analog same as previously used by the participant (before entering the trial) - insulin aspart, insulin lispro or insulin glulisine</description>
