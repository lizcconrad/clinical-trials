      OUTLINE:

      Adjuvant induction chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 28 days after prior resection,
      patients undergo radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis 5 days a week for 4 weeks and then
      conformal radiotherapy to the tumor bed 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Beginning 1 week after the
      initiation of radiotherapy, Temozolomide is applied to these patients as a chemotherapy drug
      with a dosage of 75mg/m2, daily. The chemotherapy and radiation are combined as temozolomide
      is taken 1 hour prior to every fraction of radiotherapy.

      Maintenance chemotherapy: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction
      chemoradiotherapy, patients receive eight 4-week cycles of temozolomide (dosage: the 1st
      cycle, 150mg/m2, daily × 5 days, 4 weeks a cycle; the 2-8th cycle, 200mg/m2, daily × 5 days,
      4 weeks a cycle and repeated again).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>All subjects will undergo routine surgical staging of their tumor. Treatment must begin within 28 days of surgery. Craniospinal Radiation therapy will last for 6 weeks, five days per week. Once a week during radiation, subjects will also be treated with Temozolomide. Temozolomide is applied to these patients as a chemotherapy drug with a dosage of 75mg/m2, daily. The chemotherapy and radiation therapy are combined as Temozolomide is taken 1 hour prior to every fraction of radiotherapy. In 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, temozolomide is given for 8 cycles.</description>
