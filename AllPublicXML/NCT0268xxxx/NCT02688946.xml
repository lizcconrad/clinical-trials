      Rationale: The interaction between macro and microcirculation remains uncertain.
      Microvascular alterations can occur when systemic hemodynamic parameters are within an
      acceptable range. Perfusion changes and microvascular alterations may play an important role
      in anastomotic healing and the onset of anastomotic leakage after gastrointestinal surgery.
      Nowadays, assessment of bowel perfusion is macroscopically performed by the surgeon prior to
      anastomosis creation. However, local oxygen delivery may still be compromised as little is
      known about microcirculatory alterations of the bowel during colorectal surgery. Dark Field
      (DF) imaging is a technique using a stroboscopic light-emitting diode ring-based imaging
      modality incorporated in a hand-held device, which illuminates an area of interest and
      provides high contrast dynamic images of the microvasculature. DF-imaging enables to
      visualize the bowel's microcirculation.

      Objective: To describe the human gastrointestinal microcirculation during gastrointestinal
      surgery under general anesthesia and to observe whether there is a correlation between bowel
      microcirculation and systemic hemodynamic parameters.

      Study design: A prospective, single center, observational, clinical, pilot study.

      Study population: 70 patients undergoing elective, gastrointestinal surgery during which the
      gastrointestinal tract is accessible for DF-imaging.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: To describe human gastrointestinal microcirculation on both
      the serosal and mucosal side of the bowel during gastrointestinal surgery under general
      anesthesia. Main parameter: Microvascular perfusion is quantified using the Microvascular
      Flow Index (MFI).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The extend of burden and risk associated with participation is negligible. Using
      DF imaging on the bowel is a non-invasive technique requiring a minimal amount of time as is
      described in the study procedure. Previous studies did not show any safety concerns.
      Measuring will be performed under sterile conditions and the occurrence of tissue damage is
      highly unlikely. Patients are under general anesthesia and will thus not experience any
      inconvenience.

        70 patients undergoing elective, gastrointestinal surgery. Surgical procedures included
        will be:

          -  All forms of open colorectal surgery;

          -  Pylorus Persevering PancreaticoDuodenectomy (PPPD);

          -  Other procedures requiring small bowel resection for cancer;

          -  Laparoscopic procedures with extracorporeal creation of the bowel anastomosis. These
             procedures provide unique access to different parts of the bowel. The PPPD procedure
             provides access to the mucosal and serosal side of the jejunum. Colorectal surgery
             provides access to both the serosal and mucosal side of the colon and the terminal
             ileum is sometimes also accessible. We expect to include around 2 patients per week.
