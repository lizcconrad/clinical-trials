  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital acquired acute kidney injury is an important negative outcome predictor for
      hospitalized patients. Uremic toxins accumulated after a given renal insult. Some of these
      uremic toxins are protein bound and may accumulated after renal impairment, owing to both
      impaired filtration, and inflammation. Recent animal studies have reported that accumulation
      of uremic toxins, namely indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol, would down regulate endothelial
      progenitor cells and in turn affect renal recovery. Elimination of these protein bound uremic
      toxins with an activated charcoal would help restore endothelial function. We will conduct a
      double blinded randomized placebo controlled trial, which aims to determine that if oral
      activated charcoal will retard progression of AKI. Also, a panel of markers for endothelial
      function will also be determined.

        This is a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial. All patients admitted to
        participating centers with newly diagnosed acute kidney injury (AKI) will be screened for
        eligibility. The diagnosis of AKI will be determined and staged according to the KIGO-AKI
        Guideline.11 The inclusion criteria include:

          1. Age â‰¥ 20 years old on the day of admission

          2. AKI develops during admission, as defined with KDIGO-AKI Guideline,11 namely,
             elevation of serum creatinine above 0.3mg/dL within two days, above 1.5times baseline.

        Patients with the following conditions will be excluded:

          1. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) less than 30ml/min/1.73m2 or
             greater than 90ml/min/1.73m2 according to MDRD equation.

          2. Acute kidney injury diagnosed in the indexed admission (according to baseline
             creatinine)

             inotropic agents.
