  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological difficulties, especially depression and anxiety are the most prevalent
      non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Pharmacological treatments are not as
      effective in PD. Mindfulness courses have received increased popularity and recognition as an
      effective way to manage emotional states, and there is ever growing findings of the
      effectiveness of mindfulness courses for people with long-term medical conditions. Two small
      pilot studies have indicated that mindfulness courses can be helpful for people with PD in
      improving symptoms of depression, language functioning and motor symptoms. The investigators
      propose to deliver these courses remotely, through Skype video conferences, to make it more
      accessible for people with mobility limitations and people who live in rural areas.

      This study will employ a mixed-methods design, with an experimental randomised control trial
      followed by a qualitative design. Sixty participants will be randomly assigned to the 8-week
      mindfulness course (n=30) or a wait-list control group (n=30). Block randomisation will be
      used and the randomisation scheme will be generated using the randomisation.com website.
      One-hour sessions will be delivered to groups of 5 people using Skype video-conferencing. As
      this is a pilot study analyses will largely be descriptive. Further, inferential analyses
      using mixed modelling will be conducted by intention-to-treat. At the end of the
      intervention, the investigators will interview the participants of the mindfulness group
      about their experiences of the course.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  be diagnosed with PD according to PD Brain Bank criteria by a neurologist or
             geriatrician

          -  have a computer and internet access at home, since the course will be delivered via
             Skype

             sessions and home practice of mindful meditation problematic or distressing. This will
             be assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M,
             Brandt et al., 1993).

          -  have severe psychiatric conditions (e.g. psychosis, drug/ alcohol addiction) that can
             potentially risk failure in the treatment or limit participation in the course

          -  are currently participating in other psychological therapies

          -  have prior formal training in mindfulness methods or current meditation practice
