        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diet: Able to eat standard food, no vegetarians.

          -  Compliance: Understood and was willing, able and likely to comply with all study
             procedures and restrictions.

          -  Had an estimated creatinine (CREA) clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (Creatinine clearance was
             calculated from the serum CREA value using the Cockroft &amp; Gault formula).

          -  Had no history of heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension or other known overt
             cardiovascular disease.

          -  Had no history of 'Aspirin Triad' (chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, severe asthma

             afterwards.

          -  Subject with no clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry, haematology and
             urine examination values at the Screening Visit.

          -  Subject with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen (a positive alcohol result could
             have been repeated at the discretion of the Investigator).

          -  Subject with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B (Hep B) and
             Hepatitis C (Hep C) results.

             Visit.

          -  Subject was available to complete the study (including all Follow-up Visits).

          -  Subject satisfied a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the study.

          -  Subjects were non-smokers and non-alcohol drinkers or drank alcohol in moderation

             absorption.

          -  Receipt of regular medication at the Screening Visit that may have had an impact on
             the safety and objectives of the study (at the Investigator's discretion).

          -  Evidence of renal, hepatic, central nervous system, respiratory, cardiovascular or
             metabolic dysfunction.

          -  A clinically significant history of previous allergy/sensitivity to GMC-252.

          -  A clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Inability to communicate well with the Investigator (i.e., language problem, poor
             mental development or impaired cerebral function).

          -  Participation in a New Chemical Entity clinical study within the previous 16 weeks or
             a marketed drug clinical study within the previous 12 weeks. (N.B. washout period
             between trials defined as the period of time elapsed between the last dose of the
             previous study and the first dose of the next study).

          -  Donation of 450 mL or more blood within the previous 12 weeks.

          -  Receipt of any medication since the Screening Visit that may have had an impact on the
             safety and objectives of the study (at the Investigator's discretion).
