    <description>All patients enrolled and submitted to EMR or ESD in several units of Italian endoscopy will be divided into two different groups: in a first group will be included patients at the endoscopic end of which will be applied EndoClotTM based on the lesion removed in addition to the treatment Standard (drug injection, electrocoagulation, metal clips). The second group, on the other hand, includes patients in whom EndoClotTM will not be used.
Before the end of the procedure neither the endoscopist nor the patient will know the group because the group to which the patient is assigned will be written in a sealed envelope that will be opened only at the end of the procedure before the endoscope extraction: The use of EndoClotTM will depend on the group to which the patient belongs.</description>
