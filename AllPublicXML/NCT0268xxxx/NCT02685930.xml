  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to collect prospective data on the occurrence of
      bacterial and viral pneumonia in the ICU setting. Current classification systems for
      pneumonia promote over treatment with antibiotics as they do not specifically recognize the
      presence of culture-negative and viral pneumonia. The investigators will collect data to
      determine if a novel pneumonia classification system can be developed that more accurately
      links the etiology of pneumonia (antibiotic-susceptible bacterial pneumonia,
      antibiotic-resistant bacterial pneumonia, culture-negative pneumonia, viral pneumonia) to
      clinical outcomes. Additionally, the investigators will collect data on the practice of
      antimicrobial stewardship in the ICU setting to determine if further improvements in
      antibiotic practices can be accomplished in the future.

      The investigators will be prospectively collecting data on patients admitted to the 8300 and
      8400 medical intensive care units at Barnes-Jewish Hospital requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation for support in respiratory failure from pneumonia. Data will be collected on
      patients admitted from 1/2016-12/2016. The investigators will be collecting initial patient
      characteristic data as well as reviewing microbial specimen results (tracheal aspirate,
      bronchial alveolar lavage, viral multiplex, blood cultures) and antibiotic usage in real
      time. The investigators will identify any changes in antibiotic usage demonstrated with the
      advising of the ICU antibiotic stewardship team.

    <description>The investigators will collect this information by reviewing the electronic medical record which delineates dates and times of each of the medications administered to a participant by nursing staff. The specific dates as well as total consecutive calendar days of each antibiotic administered will be charted in a database for further analysis. Antibiotics will be ranked for spectrum of activity based on microbial coverage as per the Barnes-Jewish Hospital antibiogram most recently published in 2014. De-escalation will be defined as a decrease in number and/or spectrum of antimicrobials administered. Antibiotics, antiviral, antifungals including those which fall into the following classes will be recorded: Penicillins, Floroquinalones, Macrolides, Vancomycin, Linezolid, Cephalosporins, Carbapenems, Monobactams, Aztreonam, Aminoglycocides, Tetracyclines, Metronidazole, non-specific antifungals, Azoles &amp; derivatives, antivirals.</description>
