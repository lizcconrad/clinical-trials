  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large spikes in blood glucose experienced after meals in people with type 2 diabetes are
      known to damage blood vessels. Low carbohydrate high fat diets and exercise can improve blood
      glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes but it is unclear how these two strategies
      interact to affect blood vessel function and inflammation. We will examine how following a
      short-term low carbohydrate high fat diet (4 days) with or without post-meal walking impacts
      markers of blood vessel function and inflammation. We will also examine how a single low
      carbohydrate high fat meal, with or without post-meal walking, impacts blood glucose control
      and blood vessel function. Findings will help determine the best lifestyle approach for
      improving cardiovascular health in type 2 diabetes.

    <description>Participants will engage in 4 days of high-carbohydrate low fat diet as recommended by the Canadian Diabetes Association. The macronutrients content will go as follow: 55% carbohydrate, 25% protein and 20% fat. Breakfast, lunch and dinner will be provided to the participants as part of an isoenergetic diet. Between interventions there will be at least a one-week washout, where participants are encouraged to return to their baseline dietary habits.</description>

    <description>Participants will follow the same diet as in the low-carbohydrate diet arm but also perform 15 minutes of walking beginning ~15 minutes after breakfast, lunch and dinner. Approximately 70 kcal (individualized) will be added to main meals to account for exercise energy expenditure. Between interventions there will be at least a one-week washout, where participants are encouraged to return to their baseline dietary habits.</description>
