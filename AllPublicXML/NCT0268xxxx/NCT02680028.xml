  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In England each year over 65,000 people fracture their hip. Most of these patients are
      elderly females with the fracture occurring after a simple trip or stumble. Approximately
      half of these fractures are classified from their relationship to the hip joint capsule as
      extracapsular. The majority of these fractures are treated surgically by internal fixation
      using, either a plate and screws (sliding hip screw) or nail and screws (intramedullary
      nail).

      Recent randomised studies from Peterborough involving 1000 patients have indicated that there
      are modest benefits for treating this type of fracture with an intramedullary nail in
      comparison to a sliding hip screw. This study aims to progress from these earlier studies to
      determine if a slightly thinner and shorter intramedullary nail (175mm in length), has any
      significant advantages or disadvantages to the standard length (220mm) intramedullary nail.

      Both implants to be used in this study are in routine use around the world and are being used
      within their licenced indication. The study is therefore using two different designs of
      implant within their recommended area of use, but in which there is uncertainty as to which
      is the best design.

      The trial will be run as close to the ideal trial methodology for a randomised trial as
      specified by the CONSORT statement as possible. This will include secure randomisation,
      intention to treat analysis, full reporting of outcomes and clinical follow-up by a person
      who is blinded to the prosthesis used. The trial will follow the code of good clinical
      practice as specified by the hospital trusts Research and Development Committee.

      In Peterborough all hip fracture patients are admitted to the acute trauma ward and
      transferred to the care of the Chief Investigator (Mr Martyn Parker (MJP)). Those patients
      that are willing to participant in this randomised trial are consented prior to surgery.
      Treatment follows standard evidence based protocols with follow-up of all patients in a hip
      fracture clinic. A comprehensive database is maintained for all patients containing both
      audit and research data. Included in this is a standardised assessment of outcome.
