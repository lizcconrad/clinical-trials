  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, non-randomized, single institution, observational study investigating the
      effect of dramatic weight loss secondary to bariatric surgery on biomarkers of breast cancer
      in tissue and blood as well as on imaging in women at elevated risk for breast cancer. Twelve
      months after bariatric surgery, 50% of excess weight is generally expected. Eligible women at
      elevated risk for breast cancer who are already planning to undergo bariatric surgery will be
      consented to undergo imaging (MRI and mammogram), breast tissue biopsy, and fasting blood
      draw prior to bariatric surgery, approximately 14 days after bariatric surgery, and
      approximately 1 year after bariatric surgery.

      In parallel we will also be assessing 40 normal breast tissue specimens as well as blood
      samples from the Komen Tissue Bank (elevated risk but normal BMI) to establish a normal BMI,
      elevated risk control group for our study. The KTB samples will be matched for general risk
      of breast cancer (&gt;20%), age, race and menopausal status.

      Primary Objectives

        1. The effect of bariatric surgery on Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE) on breast
           MRI through comparative analysis of images of women pre- and 1 year post-bariatric
           surgery.

        2. The effect of bariatric surgery on breast density as seen on standard four view
           mammograms by qualitative BIRADS category through comparative analysis of images of
           women pre- and 1 year post-bariatric surgery.

           Secondary Objectives

        3. The impact of bariatric surgery on obesity associated immune markers in breast tissue
           by:

             -  Comparing cellular immune infiltrate components [B cells (CD 20), cytotoxic T cells
                (CD8), helper T cells (CD4), dendritic cells (CD11c), leukocytes (CD45), and
                monocytes/macrophages (CD68)] in breast tissue lobules of obese women pre-, 14 days
                post, and 1 year post bariatric surgery, and comparing these to normal breast
                tissue of lean women from the KTB

             -  Comparing the presence of crown like structures (CLS) in breast tissue of obese
                women at pre-, 14 day post-, and 1 year post - bariatric surgery, and comparing
                these also to normal breast tissue of lean women from the KTB.

        4. The effect of bariatric surgery on aromatase expression in breast tissue of obese women
           pre-, 14 day post-, and 1 year post-bariatric surgery, as compared to levels in breast
           tissue of lean women from KTB.

        5. The effects of bariatric surgery on other blood correlatives pre- and 14 day and 1 year
           post-bariatric surgery including: 1) PGE2, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, IL-8 and IL-10 in the
           inflammatory pathway; 2) adiponectin, leptin, insulin, IGF1, and IGFBP3 in the insulin
           pathway; and 3) estradiol, SHBG, E2, T and DHEAS in the hormonal pathway. These will
           also be compared to blood samples from lean women in the KTB.

        20 total patients will be enrolled to the high risk/BMI &gt; 30 cohort. Post-menopausal women
        are defined as: (1) those ≥ 50 years of age who had not menstruated during the preceding 12
        months or who had castrate follicle-stimulating hormone levels (&gt;40IU/L), (2) those who had
        undergone a bilateral oophorectomy.

        Inclusion Criteria Twenty (20) total post-menopausal female patients are planned for
        enrollment. Post-menopausal women are defined as: (1) those ≥ 50 years of age who had not
        menstruated during the preceding 12 months or who had castrate follicle-stimulating hormone
        levels (&gt;40IU/L), (2) those who had undergone a bilateral oophorectomy.

          1. Patients must have a BMI ≥ 30 as calculated by the formula:

             Weight in pounds / height squared x 703 = BMI

             A BMI of:

               1. 18.5-24.9 is considered normal;

               2. 25.0-29.9 is considered overweight;

               3. 30.0+ is regarded as obese.

          2. Patients must be planning to undergo primary bariatric surgery (no revisions).

          3. Patients must be willing to provide a core tissue biopsy at baseline and with repeat
             tissue collection after 2 weeks and 12 months post-bariatric surgery.

          4. Patients must have ECOG Performance Status of 0 - 1 within 28 days of registration
             (see Appendix I).

          5. Patients must be aged 18-75 years at the time of informed consent.

          6. Patients must be accessible for treatment, adverse event tracking and follow-up as
             determined by the treating physician.

          7. Patient consent and authorization for the release of health information must be
             obtained according to local institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. History of any malignancy except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumors curatively
             treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years. History of breast cancer is not
             allowed.

          2. Concurrent or planned participation in randomized trials of weight loss or exercise
             interventions or trials targeting insulin, IGF-1 or their receptors. These
             interventions would interfere with the endpoints.

          3. Weight greater than 500 lbs at the time of imaging.

          4. Known allergy to gadolinium which is used for MRI contrast.

          5. History of life threatening allergic reaction to local anesthesia (lidocaine,
             xylocaine).

          6. For the purposes of invasive breast biopsies, women must not have received therapeutic
             anticoagulation in the 1 month prior to enrollment.

          7. Prior history of breast irradiation.

          8. Use of chemopreventatives such as tamoxifen or raloxifene at any time prior to
             enrollment.
