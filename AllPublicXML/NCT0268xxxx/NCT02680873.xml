    <textblock>
      the investigator modified the Sanator's operation by performing a loop rather than Roux-en-Y
      bipartition reconstruction and the investigator are reporting the first clinical results of
      the outcomes of SASI bypass as a mode of functional restrictive and neuroendocrine modulation
      therapeutic option for obese type 2 diabetes mellituspatients.

      All patients were subjected to thorough history, clinical examination and laboratory
      investigations including basic preoperative investigations, lipid profile, thyroid and
      suprarenal hormonal evaluation. In addition, patients may undergo further assessment for
      pulmonary functions or gastroesophageal disease including endoscope. . Abdominal ultrasound
      was done to exclude calcular cholecystitis and to evaluate the degree of fatty liver.
      Reduction the size of fatty liver was done by putting all patients on low-calorie protein
      diet for 6 weeks. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis started 12 h before surgery with low
      molecular weight heparin subcutaneous injections . Preoperative data included age, gender,
      initial weight, initial body mass index (BMI), obesity comorbidities and treatment
      medications used (chest problems, diabetes, arterial hypertension and cardiac ischaemia,
      hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, gall stones, urinary stress incontinence,
      joint pain, depression, infertility and heart burn). Postoperative data included hospital
      stay, early postoperative complications during the first month (e.g. fever, collection,
      bleeding, vomiting, leak and port site problems .Long-term complications more than 1 month
      after surgery (e.g. nausea, vomiting, reflux, stricture, intestinal obstruction ,
      hypoalbuminemia , anemia and calcium or iron or vitamin D , vitamin B12 deficiency and),
      excess weight loss and BMI were collected.

    <description>he operation was done under general anesthesia. The technique commences with the devascularization of the greater curvature of the stomach with the harmonic scalpel.junction. The stomach is then tubularized over a 36 French calibration tube, with a linear stapler charged with a green cartridge, commencing 6 cm proximal to the pylorus. The ileocecal junction is identified and 250 cm is measured upwards. The selected loop is ascended antecolic without division of the greater omentum, and a stapled isoperistaltic side-to-side to the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach just cranial 3 cm away from the pylorus with a linear stapler charged with a green cartridge.</description>
