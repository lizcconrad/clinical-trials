    <textblock>
      As part of Yale's Play2Prevent (www.Play2Prevent.org) program to develop videogame-based
      interventions targeting risk reduction and prevention in youth and young adults, this study
      is designed to develop a paper prototype and intervention design manual of an online
      social-network game, One Night Stan, with the goal of risk reduction and HIV/STI prevention
      in young black women. The ultimate plan is to incorporate focus group participants input and
      feedback into the development of a conceptual model, intervention manual, and videogame
      intervention prototype. This prototype will then be tested using 20 participants and will
      utilize a pre-post design to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are to:

      Develop an online social network game for HIV/STI risk reduction and prevention by conducting
      a first set of focus groups with a total of 25 participants (5 focus groups with 5
      participants each) in order to better understand preferences for online social network and
      gaming platforms, characteristics and design.

      These collected data, established theoretical constructs, and the literature will be
      harnessed to develop a conceptual model for HIV/STI risk reduction and prevention in this
      specific population of women.

      From the data collected and the new conceptual model, an intervention manual will be created
      that will incorporate a culturally and socially-tailored online social network game
      intervention paper prototype and design manual. In an iterative fashion, a second series of
      focus groups will be conducted (5 groups with 5 participants each for a total of 25
      participants) to refine the intervention.

      To pilot test the prototype intervention we will determine, in a pre-post design: (a) the
      intervention's acceptability and feasibility based on self-report data on the game experience
      and (b) preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the intervention collecting data on 1)
      HIV/STI knowledge 2) intentions/attitudes regarding condom use and HIV/STI partner testing 3)
      self-efficacy to insist on condom use and HIV/STI partner testing 4) self-efficacy and
      beliefs related to sexual risk behaviors, 4) perceived social norms, and 5) behaviors related
      to condom use and partner HIV/STI testing.

      The focus of this registration record will be the participants and collected outcomes used to
      assess the prototype of the social network game. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 2
      weeks after playing the game and at 4 weeks post follow up.

    <description>Items from the validated instruments the HIV-KQ and STD-KQ were compiled into 12 item questionnaire measuring knowledge of HIV and STI's. These items are true/false responses in nature and the total score is based on the number of correct responses. The highest score possible is 12, which indicates superior knowledge of HIV/STI related information.
The HIV Knowledge Questionnaire (18-item version) is a brief self-administered measure of the individual's HIV-related knowledge. (http://www.midss.org/content/hiv-knowledge-questionnaire-hiv-kq-18)SRB
The STD-KQ is a comprehensive 27-item index that attempts to measure knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases. It is intended for use in research and applied settings (http://www.midss.org/content/sexually-transmitted-disease-knowledge-questionnaire-std-kq).</description>

    <description>The multi-dimensional condom attitudes scale (MCAS) was adapted for use in the study. The MCAS contains 25 items that assess attitudes toward condoms using 7-point Likert scales; higher scores indicate more favorable attitudes toward condoms. Sample items include: &quot;Women think men who use condoms are jerks&quot;; and &quot;If a couple is about to have sex and the man suggests using a condom, it is less likely that they will have sex.&quot; Prior research confirmed that the scale is multidimensional, with a five-factor structure: (a) Reliability and Effectiveness, (b) Pleasure, (c) Identity stigma, (d) Embarrassment about Negotiation and Use, and (e) Embarrassment about Purchase (Helweg-Larsen &amp; Collins, 1994). Each item uses a 5 point scale (5 = strongly agree) to assess condom attitudes. The average of the items is used, where a 5 would indicate a superior overall attitude concerning the construct being measured.</description>

    <description>The validated instrument the SRBBS was used to create items as part of a questionnaire. The Sexual Risk Behavior Beliefs and Self-Efficacy Scales (SRBBS; Basen-Engquist et al., 1996) taps into major constructs addressed within condom use theory (health belief model, theory of reasoned action, and social learning theory), and thus the current study results would easily extend to multiple theoretical approaches. The SRBBS contains 22 self-report, Likert-type items that assess five subscales of interest: condom use attitudes (e.g., I believe condoms should always be used if a person my age has sex), self-efficacy in using and obtaining condoms (e.g., How sure are you that you could use a condom correctly or explain to your partner how to use a condom correctly?), and barriers to condom use (e.g., I would feel uncomfortable carrying condoms with me).</description>
