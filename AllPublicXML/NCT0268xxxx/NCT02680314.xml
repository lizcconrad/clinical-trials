  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether inducing labor with just one dose of
      misoprostol, followed by treatment with oxytocin, will still be effective enough to increase
      the chances of having a successful vaginal delivery as compared to using more than one dose
      of misoprostol, followed by treatment with oxytocin.

      This study involves a comparison of two different regimens of prostaglandin use for &quot;cervical
      ripening&quot; prior to induction of labor. Women admitted to the hospital for induction of labor
      who are found to have &quot;unripe&quot; cervixes at the time of admission, and who agree to
      participate in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. In one
      group, a single dose of 25 µcg of misoprostol will be administered vaginally and four hours
      later oxytocin induction will be started if clinically indicated. In the second group of
      women, repeat doses of misoprostol will be given every four hours up to six doses unless
      labor or cervical ripening occurs sooner. At this point, oxytocin will be started as needed.
      Success of vaginal delivery by 24 hours, time from initiation of protocol to delivery and
      cesarean section rates will be compared. Complications such as postpartum hemorrhage,
      episodes of tachysystole with fetal compromise and chorioamnionitis and endometritis will be
      monitored.
