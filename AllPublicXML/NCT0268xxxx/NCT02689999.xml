  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to investigate the effect of dexrabeprazole on gastric acid primarily, and then
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, intraesophageal acidity (reflux) and
      impedance kinetics.

      The participants will be on one week medication after two-weeks observation period.
      Intragastric and intraesophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (pH-MII) monitoring
      will be performed before and after medication. The pre- and post-treatment data will be
      compared. The safety tests will be performed during study in terms of possible side effects.

    <description>Multichannel intraluminal esophageal impedance pH-meter will be applied to cases in screening and second visit in order to evaluate the effect on 24-hour intragastric and intraesophageal acid values. 24-hour pH values of cases will be measured with pH-meter. Combined impedence pH catheter will be placed to 10 cm under and 5 cm upper of inferior esophageal sphincter of cases under local anesthesia. Cases will be informed about adherence to the diet list, not to take anti-acids and need to press symptom button on device when complaints occur during 24-hour measurements. After 24 hours, results will be recorded and reported by transferring to computer environment. These results will be compared with measurement obtained in screening visit and then efficacy assessment will be done.</description>
