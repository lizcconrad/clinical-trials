  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-armed, Phase I/II trial aims to compare bone marrow and leukapheresis as
      sources for purified, autologous CD34+ and CD133+ stem cells (SCs), to be utilized in
      treatment of patients with chronic complete spinal cord injuries (SCI). The study focuses on
      the safety and efficacy of transplanting un-manipulated, autologous, purified stem cells into
      the injured spinal cords of patients.

    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to apoptosis of oligodendrocytes at the injury site resulting
      in demyelination and neuronal degeneration. This degeneration causes severe functional
      sensory and motor mutilations that remain an immense challenge to physicians and in which
      stem cell (SC) transplantation represents a viable alternative. This study is a phase I/II
      trial aimed at describing a method for treating patients with chronic complete spinal cord
      injuries (SCI) by utilizing autologous, purified CD34+ and CD133+ stem cells (SCs). The study
      focuses on the safety and efficacy of transplanting un-manipulated, autologous, purified stem
      cells in treated patients during a 5-year follow-up period.
