    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, multiple center, open label, single-dose study in otherwise healthy
      adolescent subjects with a history of acute migraine. Subjects will each receive one Zecuity
      patch application. Subjects will be admitted 2 hours prior to dosing on Day 1, and will
      remain in the clinical unit under supervision until the last pharmacokinetic (PK) sample is
      obtained. Blood will be obtained at prescribed times for PK analysis and safety assessments
      will be performed, including adverse event monitoring, 12-lead ECG test, patch adhesion
      evaluations, skin irritation evaluations, and vital signs.
