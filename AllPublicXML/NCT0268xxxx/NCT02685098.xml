      Patients undergoing semi-elective below knee amputation from complications associated with
      atherosclerotic limb ischemia will received intra-muscular injections of allogeneic
      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in the leg above and below the point of amputation to prevent
      ischemic wound complications after surgery and decrease the incidence of conversion from
      below knee to above knee amputation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I single center open label trial study that will enroll sixteen patients
      requiring semi-elective below knee amputation (BKA) within a 30 day period for non-infectious
      complications related to critical limb ischemia (CLI). After enrollment patients will be
      randomized to BKA at 3,7,14, or 21 days after MSC administration. The investigational
      treatment uses allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at the point of care.
      Allogeneic MSCs will be injected in the thigh muscles and the gastrocnemius muscle of sixteen
      patients undergoing BKA. Through a review of treatment related adverse events over 6 months
      we will test the hypothesis that allogeneic MSCs do not result in significant cardiovascular,
      respiratory, or infectious treatment related adverse events. Through an exploratory
      investigation we will assess the efficacy of MSCs in promoting freedom from gangrene,
      conversion to AKA, and death after BKA.

    <time_frame>Primary follow up in a 6 month period</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-related adverse events will be categorized in overlapping systems of cardiovascular, respiratory, or infectious and severities of serious adverse events (SAE) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The sum and difference between routes of delivery will be reported. Confidence intervals will be generated and summarize the data by the method of the Wilson Score Interval. Binomial confidence intervals at the 95% confidence level and p-values for these groups will be calculated. Continuous confidence intervals at the 95% level will be constructed to explore the effect of administration of MSCs on the composite endpoint at 6-months of death, (AKA) conversion and gangrene, and will be compared to historical cohorts. The critical levels for the multiplicity adjustment will be determined by simple Monte Carlo simulation.Unanticipated SAEs and those affecting the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects will be documented and reported immediately upon discovery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gene and protein arrays, IHC staining, and multiparametric flow cytometry will measure the time period of retention of allogeneic MSCs in harvested human skeletal muscle tissue post-MSC implantation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary follow up in a 6 month period</time_frame>
    <description>Quantities over time of MSC will be fit to an exponential decay curve using a residual pseudo-likelihood procedure and cell half-life (λ) will be estimated. Binomial confidence intervals at the 95% confidence level and p-values will be calculated for the presence or absence of MHC expression and SDF-1activation. The correlation between capillary density (CD31 counts) with tissue perfusion (ICA) for each time point will be estimated by Spearman's rank coefficient. The gene and protein expression profiles and histological findings will be used to test the hypotheses that MSCs have limited survival post-injection.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recruitment of proangiogenic hematopoietic cells into sites of ischemia will be measured and reported as assessed by the role of MSCs injected in human skeletal muscle at the time of below knee amputation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary follow up in a 6 month period</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous confidence intervals at the 95% level will be constructed to explore differences among the time-tiered administration of MSC for (1) the CD34+CD133+ pro-angiogenic hematopoietic cells recruitment of HIF-1α/SDF-1/CXCR4 to ischemic muscle, (2) the quantify of capillary density in muscle fibers using hematoxylin phloxin saffron and CD31 counts, (3) VEGF-A,C,D, hepatocyte growth factor, angiopoietin-1 to characterize angiogenic cytokine expression, (4) percent coverage, fiber diameter and cross-sectional area to examine changes in morphology. The gene and protein expression profiles and histological findings will be used to test the hypotheses that MSCs act to recruit CD34+CD133+ proangiogenic hematopoietic cells.</description>
