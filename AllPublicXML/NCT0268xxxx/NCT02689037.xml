      Background: Effectiveness of Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) on
      prevention of events of stroke and death in patients with symptomatic intracranial
      atherosclerosis (ICAS) is controversial.

      Aim: to determine whether PTAS plus medical treatment (MT) are superior to MT alone in
      preventing events of stroke and death in patients with symptomatic ICAS.

      Methods: The investigators will carry out a randomized controlled trial in 3 hospitals in
      China. A total of 198 patients with ICAS will be randomized into 2 groups: PTAS+MT and MT
      group. All patients will receive aspirin (100 mg daily) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily)
      immediately after randomization, and patients in PTAS+MT group will receive surgery within 5
      days after randomization. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after randomization and
      assessed for events of stroke and death at 30 days and 1 year after randomization, the
      incidence of recurrent ischaemic stroke in the stenting-involved vascular territory at 30
      days and 1 year after randomization, incidence of in-stent restenosis at 1 year after
      randomization,etc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged from 18 to 70 years.

          -  Complaints of a Symptomatic ICAS: a history of recurrent transient ischemic attacks or
             an ischemic stroke within 1 year owing to a 70%-99% stenosis in an internal carotid
             artery, middle cerebral artery, vertebral artery, or basilar artery.

          -  A length ≤ 15mm of a stenosis in the target vessel and a vessel size &gt;2.5mm.

          -  Hypoperfusion in the territory of the target vessels, which is determined by CT or MRI
             in 14 days before stenting.

          -  CT or MRI scans show no massive cerebral infarction (beyond half of the territory of
