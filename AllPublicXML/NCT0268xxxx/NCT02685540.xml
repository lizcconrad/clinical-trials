    <textblock>
      Death rate in anesthesia is one of the most valuable methods to assess the safety of
      anesthesia practice among different types of patients.

      In the investigators study, the investigator will review the death rate in anesthesia whether
      regional or general over the past five years from 2010 to 2014, by examining the patients
      records from the hospital database.

      Death rate in anesthesia is one of the most valuable methods to assess the safety of
      anesthesia practice among different types of patients. Most of the studies of death rate in
      anesthesia are retrospective. Although retrospective studies suffer many draw backs in their
      design and results, but they are still common method to evaluate the safety of anesthesia
      practice for surgical patients.

      In the investigators study, the investigators will review the death rate in anesthesia
      whether regional or general over the past five years from 2010 to 2014, by examining the
      patients records from the hospital database.

      The cause of death will be grouped into: totally anesthesia related, partially anesthesia
      related, surgery related or patient condition related.

      The records and files of dead patients will be examined by committee from the researchers to
      estimate the cause of death.

      The end point of the investigators study will be anesthesia death rate inside the hospital.
