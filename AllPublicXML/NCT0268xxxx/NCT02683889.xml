      This study will evaluate the use of Acthar in patients to undergo renal transplantation and
      will measure the rate of FSGS recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study enrolling renal transplant recipients with the primary native
      kidney disease of FSGS.

      Primary endpoint is rate of recurrence of FSGS as seen in renal transplant biopsies and in
      rate of proteinuria. Secondary endpoint is renal function after transplantation The target
      subject number is 20 patients and the target population is primary FSGS patients. By the
      current data, FSGS should recur in 23% of patients. Therefore, it would be expected that at
      least 4 patients will develop recurrent FSGS after renal transplantation.

      Screening will be performed by the Principal Investigator during the kidney transplant
      evaluation clinics and during the wait list kidney transplant evaluation clinic. All patients
      with FSGS will have maintenance immunosuppression with belatacept (if EBV positive), prograf,
      cellcept and prednisone. If after one year the patient has been stable and there has not been
      rejection, will stop the prograf and continue solely with belatacept, cellcept and
      prednisone.

      Dosage and Administration of Acthar The dose of acthar to be given to every enrolled patient
      will be 80 units twice a week for 6 months.
