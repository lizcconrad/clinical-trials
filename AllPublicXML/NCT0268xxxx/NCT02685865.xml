      The research design is a randomized prospective clinical trial comparing EUS-guided drainage
      of WON using FCSEMS and plastic stents. The trial will be conducted at the Florida Hospital
      Center for Interventional Endoscopy, Orlando, Florida.The sample size estimated for this
      study is 60 patients. All patients will undergo EUS-guided drainage of WON and be randomized
      to either FCSEM or plastic stents in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomized
      sequence. It will not be possible to blind the endoscopist to the stent type being inserted
      due to the differences in stent appearance. The statistician will be blinded to the stent
      type utilized.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the number of interventions performed between metal and plastic stent groups to achieve treatment success at 6 week follow-up. Re-intervention is defined as the need for repeat EUS-guided drainage of WON using the same stent type and/or DEN and/or insertion of percutaneous catheter due to inadequate treatment response following initial WON drainage. As FCSEMS have larger diameter than plastic stents, the investigators hypothesize that the no. of re-interventions performed will be lower in the FCSEMS group compared to the plastic stent group.</description>

    <description>WON is first identified using EUS and punctured using a 19 gauge needle. 10 ml of fluid is aspirated and sent for gram stain and culture with sensitivities. Using a catheter-based stent delivery system with a 15mm AXIOS stent mounted onto it is inserted into the echoendoscope, and introduced into the WON cavity so that the stent lies within both the WON and enteric lumen. The stent is then deployed so that one flange of the stent is located within the WON cavity and the other flange is located within the enteric lumen.</description>

    <description>WON is first identified using EUS, and punctured using a 19 gauge needle. 10 ml of the WON fluid is aspirated and sent for gram stain and culture with sensitivities. A 0.025 or 0.035 inch guidewire is inserted into the WON through the fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle. A transmural tract is created using an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography(ERCP) catheter (with the use of a needle knife catheter ± cautery if needed), and then dilated using a 12-13.5-15mm Controlled Radial Expansion (CRE) balloon to a maximum size of 15mm if technically possible. Two or three 7 French plastic stents are inserted through the transmural tract into the WON cavity.</description>
