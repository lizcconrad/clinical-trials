      Our study addresses a previously selected population or by physical activity but not for
      semen quality semen donor candidates donation program within the clinic.

      Total physical activity was analyzed according to the universally accepted international
      physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) The existence of confounding factors associated She
      purge age, snuff, weight, BMI, alcohol, drugs, type of sport and associated blood parameters
      determinations will be made to exercise.

      The level of physical activity recommended great unknown and its influence from the
      therapeutic point of view to improve semen quality.

      For it will be held:

        -  3 groups of physical activity are established, according to their score in the IPAQ:
           High, minimum of physical activity between &gt; 1500 MET week Moderate: minimum of physical
           activity of between 600- 1500 MET week Low : until &lt; 600 MET week

        -  Implementation of a double analysis: Seminal and hormonal

        -  Standardization of confounding factors associated with the individual

    <description>Semen parameters will be evaluated according to WHO criteria blinded on clinical and data analyst.
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) offers before sperm donation quantifying the activity &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;activities of moderate intensity&quot; and &quot;vigorous intensity activities&quot; assigned to each activity about energy requirements defined in METs, being multiples of the rate of metabolic rate equivalent to kilocalories for a 60 kg.
The median and interquartile range (between Q1 and Q3) is calculated for walking (W), activities of moderate intensity (M), activities of vigorous intensity (V) and a combined result of total physical activity. All results must be expressed as continuous METminutos / week.</description>

    <measure>Existence of confounding factors associated with physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The existence of confounding factors such as age, tobacco, weight, BMI, alcohol, drugs, type of sport will be cleaned and blood parameters associated with physical activity will be defined.
A data tab/sheet for each donor was made . The existence of related factors such as age, tobacco, weight, BMI, alcohol, drug and the type of sport exercised were been analysed.
It categorizes the population into quartiles depending on their activity and determine which is which is associated with a better seminal quality the same debugging is made confounding previously mentioned.
