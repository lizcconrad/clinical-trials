      This is a blinded cross-over study to see if extended wear insulin infusion sets can prolong
      insulin infusion set wear up to 7 days in adults with Type 1 Diabetes.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a double blinded cross-over study. Subjects will be asked to wear infusion set either
      a standard infusion set or an extended wear infusion set. They will wear each infusion set
      twice, and the order of infusion set wear will be randomized with the first infusion set wear
      and then alternated over 4 weeks. By performing a cross over study using both experimental
      infusion sets and standard infusion sets, the investigators hope to see whether there is a
      benefit to using an extended wear infusion set.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year and using an insulin pump
             for at least 12 months

          2. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment; C-peptide
             level and antibody determinations are not needed.

          3. Age 18 to 55 years

          4. Hemoglobin A1c level less than or equal to 8.5%

          5. Willing to use Novolog insulin while they are participating in the study

          6. Total daily insulin dose is at least 0.3 units/kg/day

          7. For females, not currently known to be pregnant

          8. An understanding of and willingness to follow the protocol and sign the informed
             consent

          9. Willingness to wear the experimental insulin infusion sets throughout the study

         10. Must be able to understand spoken and written English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 3 months

          2. blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Creatinine, or liver function test (ALT or AST) more than
             three times the upper limit of normal, or thrombocytopenia

          3. Severe hypoglycemia resulting in seizure or loss of consciousness in the 3 months
             prior to enrollment

          4. Pregnant or lactating females

          5. Known tape allergies

          6. Current treatment for a seizure disorder

          7. Cystic fibrosis

          8. Active infection

          9. A known medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere
             with the completion of the protocol such as the following examples:

         10. Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months for either the subject or the
             subject's primary care giver (i.e., parent or guardian)

         11. Presence of a known adrenal disorder

         12. If on antihypertensive, thyroid, anti-depressant or lipid lowering medication, lack of
             stability on the medication for the past 2 months prior to enrollment in the study
