  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-market clinical study is to evaluate efficacy outcomes and
      complication rates in patients who have received the Fibulock™ Intramedullary Nail.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective/prospective, multi-site observational study, designed to evaluate the
      clinical outcomes and complication rates in subjects who were previously implanted with a
      Fibulock™ intramedullary nail.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility and subgroupings. Informed consent will be obtained
      from those who meet screening criteria and are interested in participating in the study.

      Sites will be asked to enroll subjects according to past treatment, with the Fibulock™
      intramedullary nail for unstable fibula fracture. The sites will enroll subjects in the study
      based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Patient pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative records will be reviewed
      retrospectively. Once enrolled, subjects will undergo an evaluation of fracture outcome and
      complete a VAS pain score, SF-12, and Foot Function Index at 26 weeks and again at 52 weeks
      post-treatment.
