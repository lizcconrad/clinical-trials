  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of integrating an intensive pre- post-surgical
      smoking cessation intervention (i.e., varenicline + monetary incentives + brief counseling)
      into a hospital setting by recruiting elective bariatric surgery patients and assessing
      theoretically relevant baseline characteristics (e.g., factors influencing smoking decisions,
      such as smoking motivation, delayed discounting, and distress tolerance) that may predict
      smoking cessation and post-surgical recovery outcomes. Participants will be required to
      attend a screening visit at the Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU) located on the
      Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Campus, during which they will answer questionnaires, complete
      computerized tasks, and undergo sensory testing. Participants will then attend approximately
      6 weekly study visits leading up to their bariatric surgery, and approximately 6 more weekly
      study visits after the surgery, as well as a 30-day follow-up visit, all located at the BPRU
      at Johns Hopkins Bayview. During the 6 pre-surgery visits and 6 post-surgery visits,
      participants will undergo an intensive smoking cessation treatment that includes
      administration of a medication called varenicline that has been FDA-approved for smoking
      cessation, as well as behavioral counseling sessions and monetary incentives for remaining
      smoke-free. After completing all study visits, participants will be asked to return for a
      30-day follow-up visit, during which they will complete several study measures once more.
      Throughout the study, participants will be asked to periodically complete questionnaires,
      computerized tasks, and sensory testing. Investigators will also track outcomes associated
      with post-surgical recovery, including duration of hospital stay, hospital readmission,
      post-surgical complications, and prescription pain-killer use post-surgery.

    <description>Smoking abstinence will be defined as a negative biochemical sample + self-report of no smoking for the past 7 days, mean % negative samples, and mean continuous negative samples. Smoking will be evaluated within each pre and post-surgical phase, and collapsed over the 11-week targeted cessation period (following the target quit day during week 2). Point prevalence smoking abstinence at the follow-up will be defined as a negative cotinine sample + self-report of no smoking for the past 7-days.</description>
