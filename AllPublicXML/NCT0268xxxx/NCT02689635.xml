  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients over 18 years of age, admitted to the hospital with HF exacerbation, will be
      eligible for randomization to low salt or regular diet. Laboratory tests are routinely
      obtained on admission and on the day (or the day before) of discharge (comprehensive
      metabolic panel and NT-proBNP) and will be recorded for the study. Daily weights are
      routinely recorded, and intake/output will be monitored. At discharge, a Diet Acceptability
      Questionnaire will be performed.

      After the discharge, participants will return for follow-up visits as needed for clinical
      indications. Our study coordinator will document changes of symptoms, changes in therapies,
      and capture clinical events like unscheduled hospital visits or visits to the Emergency Room.
      Once during the study patients will be asked about their specific food consumption on a prior
      day, and the Sodium content will be estimated. The final visit will occur in a year
      (approximately 11-13 months after enrollment). Weight, other vital signs, CMP, BNP, and Diet
      Acceptability Questionnaire quality of life questionnaire will be collected at this point, if
      clinically indicated.

      The majority of study information will be collected from routine care for standard clinical
      indications. The only components added for study purpose are Diet Acceptability Questionnaire
      and collection of the information on consumed foods.
