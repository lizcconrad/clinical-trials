  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-sequence study to determine the pharmacokinetics,
      safety and tolerability of lofexidine HCl in the presence of paroxetine in healthy adults.
      Lofexidine HCl is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist under development for the treatment of acute
      withdrawal from short-acting opioids. Paroxetine HCl is an orally administered psychotropic
      drug indicated in the treatment of major depressive, obsessive compulsive, panic, social
      anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders. Paroxetine is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor.
