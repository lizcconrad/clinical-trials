  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a combination of enzalutamide and
      paclitaxel can help to control triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by shrinking the tumors
      in the breast and/or lymph nodes before they are surgically removed. The safety of this
      treatment combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Paclitaxel is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of breast cancer that does not respond to chemotherapy. Enzalutamide is not
      FDA-approved for breast cancer. It is currently being used for research purposes only in
      breast cancer patients. The study doctor can explain how these study drugs are designed to
      work.

      Up to 37 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, you will take enzalutamide by mouth
      every day for 12 study cycles. Each cycle is 7 days (1 week).

      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 2 hours.

      If you have side effects, the study doctor may decide to lower your study drug dose level or
      have you stop taking the drug for a short time. If your dosing is stopped, you may be able to
      restart the study drug later at the same dose or a lower dose. The study doctor will discuss
      this with you.

      Study Visits:

      Before treatment begins, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for biomarker testing
      (including genetic biomarkers). Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related
      to your reaction to the study drug.

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

      °Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 5 &amp; 9:

      °You will have a physical exam and your weight, vital signs, and performance status will be
      recorded.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 7, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for CTC and biomarker tests.

      Any time during the 12 study cycles, you may have imaging scans (the same ones that were
      performed at Screening) to check the status of the disease, if the doctor thinks they are
      needed.

      At the end of 12 cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, CTC tests, and biomarker
           testing.

        -  You will have imaging scans of the breast and lymph nodes to check the status of the
           disease.

      After 12 cycles of study drugs on this study, you may then have surgery to remove the
      tumor(s). You will be given a surgery consent form that describes the procedure and its
      risks. If you do not have surgery, you may still have a lymph node biopsy or removal, based
      on standard care. Your doctor can discuss this with you.

      Leftover tissue/blood from study testing will be banked at MD Anderson. Before your samples
      can be used for research, the researchers must get approval from the Institutional Review
      Board (IRB) of MD Anderson. The IRB is a committee of doctors, researchers, and community
      members. The IRB is responsible for protecting study participants and making sure all
      research is safe and ethical.

      Your samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked
      to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code
      numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the
      samples to be updated as needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 12 cycles of chemotherapy. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 30 days (+/- 3 days) after surgery/biopsy, you will have a follow-up visit. During
      this visit, you will be asked about how you are doing, and blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be
      drawn for routine tests.
