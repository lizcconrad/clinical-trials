    <textblock>
      Clinical and genetic assessment of treatment response in patients with age-related macular
      degeneration using intravitreal aflibercept injection. This study seeks to determine if
      different genetic polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and HtrA
      serine peptidase 1(HTRA1) and other genes correlate to the response to intravitreal
      aflibercept injection therapy.

    <description>The primary endpoint in the study is the correlation of CFH, HTRA1, VEGFA, C3, TIMP3, APOE, CETP, LIPC, TGFBR1, CFI, and CFB allele frequencies and VEGA expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines with response to intravitreal aflibercept injection treatment, based on anatomic outcomes:
Early response (at Month 3) - o On optical coherence tomography(SD-OCT)
Reduction in central retinal thickness by ≥ 50%, OR
Central retinal thickness &lt;300 um, OR
Absence of retinal fluid
Later response (at Month 12) -
o On SD-OCT
Reduction in central retinal thickness by ≥ 50%, OR
Central retinal thickness &lt; 300 um, OR
Absence of retinal fluid
Poor response, defined as no reduction of fluid or central retinal thickness at Month 12.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <description>The secondary endpoints are a correlation of CFH, VEGF, HTRA1, VEGFA, C3, TIMP3, APOE, CETP, LIPC, TGFBR1, CFI, and CFB allele frequencies:
With visual outcomes -
Early response, defined as a gain ≥ 0 letters at Month 3
Later response, defined as a gain ≥ 0 letters at Month 12
Poor response, defined as loss of visual acuity (gain &lt;0 letters) at Month 12
With change in characteristics on fluorescein angiography and fundus photography (lesion size, lesion type, etc)
With number of injections through Month 12
o Mean number of intravitreal aflibercept injections required through Month 12 will be calculated for the group overall, and separately by response group (early, later, and no response to treatment).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 50 years

          2. Naïve neovascular wet-AMD (has not received treatment before)

          3. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          4. Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous therapy in study eye for AMD or other retinal disease which may be used in
             the treatment of AMD

          2. Previous subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation involving the foveal center in the
             study eye

          3. History of vitrectomy, submacular surgery, or other surgical intervention for AMD in
             the study eye

          4. Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g. diabetic retinopathy or
             glaucoma) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either 4.1 require medical
             or surgical intervention during the study period to prevent or treat visual loss that
             might result from that condition, or 4.2 if allowed to progress untreated, could
             likely contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of best corrected
             visual acuity over the study period

          5. Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye, or history of
             idiopathic or autoimmune-associated uveitis in either eye

          6. Current vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye

          7. History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the
             study eye

          8. Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either
             eye

          9. Aphakia, ACIOL, or unstable PCIOL

         10. Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure ≥30 mmHg
             despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication)

         11. Pregnant or breast-feeding women

         12. Sexually active men* or women of childbearing potential** who are unwilling to
             practice adequate contraception during the study (adequate contraceptive measures
             include stable use of oral contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical
             contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device
             [IUD]; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or
             jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)

         13. Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the patient if the investigational therapy were initiated *Contraception is not
             required for men with documented vasectomy. **Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months in order not to be considered of child bearing potential.
             Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation.
