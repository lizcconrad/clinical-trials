  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending
      intravenous doses and single subcutaneous (sc) doses of ASP6294 in healthy young male and
      female subjects.

      This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (pk) of single ascending intravenous doses
      and single ascending sc doses of ASP6294; determine the effect of ASP6294 administered
      intravenously and sc on the serum levels of circulating total Nerve Growth Factor (NGF);
      explore a potential gender difference in safety, tolerability and pk of single intravenous
      dose and single sc doses administrations of ASP6294 as well as determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of single intravenous doses and single sc doses of ASP6294.

      Part 2 will also evaluate the relative bioavailability of ASP6294 when administered sc.

      The study consists of two parts: Part 1 (ascending intravenous dose) and Part 2 (ascending
      subcutaneous dose). Subjects will participate in either Part 1 or Part 2. Subjects in Part 1
      and Part 2 will have a residential period of 6 days followed by outpatient visits.

    <description>A dose escalation design will be implemented. Successive cohorts of patients (8 participants/cohort) will each be started on a fixed dose of ASP6294 or Placebo intravenously. If no dose limiting toxicities are observed escalation to the next higher dose is planned approximately every 3 weeks. Within the planned dose range, a dose lower than the next planned dose may be tested, or a dose level may be repeated, depending on emerging safety, tolerability and/or other relevant data, such as available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of previous dose levels.</description>
