      A stepped-wedge cluster design will be used, with the duration of the trial being 50 weeks.
      The 'stepped-wedge ' cluster randomised trial is a form of cross-over design with
      unidirectional cross-over ( from control to experimental ) but with randomisation of when
      each cluster undertakes this transition. In the stepped-wedge design, there is a staggered
      roll-out of the intervention, where the time and hence the sequence of units (clusters) that
      will start the intervention at each period is determined by random allocation.

      The randomisation occurs before the start of the trial. All clusters start the trial in a
      control phase with no intervention being delivered at any site, then sequentially cross over
      from the control group to the intervention group, until all sites are receiving the
      intervention. Outcomes are measured on the study participants in all clusters at every time
      period, hence measurement of outcomes takes place at each step in the wedge; each cluster
      provides data points in the control and intervention conditions allowing each site to act as
      its own control.
