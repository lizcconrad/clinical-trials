  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through a series of sequential analyses, retrospective database exploration looking for
      linkages and associations between the use of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) and/or
      cerebral saturation monitoring and patient outcomes post-cardiothoracic surgery will be
      explored.

      The purpose of this study is to mine the Premier Healthcare Database to:

        1. define the incidence of post-operative cognitive complications, acute kidney injury and
           stroke after specific cardiac surgical procedures (defined as: coronary artery bypass
           graft [CABG], Aortic Valve Replacement, Mitral valve repair, Mitral valve replacement,
           thoracic aortic operation, combined CABG and Valve replacement or repair ; and

        2. Determine the incremental increase in the length of hospitalization and cost of
           hospitalization among cardiac surgical patients who suffer postoperative cognitive
           complications, acute kidney injury and stroke; and

        3. Determine the effectiveness of intraoperative neuromonitoring with cerebral saturation
           and/or processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring on the incidence of
           post-operative cognitive complications, acute kidney injury and stroke as a consequence
           of specific cardiac surgery procedures.

      The Premier Healthcare Database is a privately owned database that represents approximately
      1/5th of all United States hospitalizations annually. It includes all International
      Classification of Diseases-9th Revision (ICD-9) and International Classification of
      Diseases-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes recorded by the
      hospital, as well as a limited set of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-4 codes. Within
      the database, discharge-level data include information on patient and provider
      characteristics, diagnoses and procedures, hospital resource utilization, and charges/cost
      data for all entries, including pharmacy charges.
