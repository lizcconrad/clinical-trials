  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to study the effects of athrectomy followed by percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty using Paclitaxel coated Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB) in treating de
      novo or re-stenotic lesions in the femoral-popliteal artery in patients with symptomatic
      peripheral vascular disease in an Asian population. The intention is to study the effects of
      debulking athrectomy followed by application of DEBs to prevent restenosis, resulting in
      improved patency rates The study will prospectively recruit 8 cases treated with athrectomy
      followed by DEB. This project is a pilot to investigate the effects of athrectomy and DEB in
      reducing re-stenosis rates. It will be a primer for a larger scale randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) involving multiple institutions to demonstrate the benefit of athrectomy and DEB
      technology to treat de novo versus plain balloon angioplasty with bail-out stenting, which is
      currently the most commonly used modality to treat femoral-popliteal lesions. There are no
      studies combining the effect of rotational athrectomy and DEBs.

      Patient will undergo an intervention under anaesthesia. After common femoral artery sheath
      access, a diagnostic angiogram will be performed. After pre-arthrectomy Intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS) of the affected arterial segment, patient will undergo treatment of the
      lesion with arthrectomy, followed by post-arthrectomy IVUS analysis. Following arthrectomy,
      the affected vessel will be treated by supplementary Ranger Drug Eluting Balloon (DEB).
      During post-procedure, patients will be started on dual antiplatelets for 3 months followed
      by Aspirin for life unless contraindicated. Clinical follow-up, duplex ultrasound (to assess
      for re-stenosis) and Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) will be performed at 1-month,
      6-month and 12-month post intervention. Assessment of the symptoms, pulse, and clinical
      patency will be performed at each visit.
