  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized phase II clinical trial where patients who are receiving
      enzalutamide in the pre-chemotherapy space are randomized upon objective progression
      (radiographic and/or clinical per PCWG2 criteria) to docetaxel/prednisone alone or the same
      combination plus enzalutamide.

      The primary aim is to evaluate whether continuing enzalutamide in combination with docetaxel
      in patients who failed or progressed while on enzalutamide would increase progression-free
      survival (PFS) by 4 months. The secondary end points are PSA responses, percent of patients
      alive at 1 and 2 years, decline in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and quality of life (QOL)
      using validated scales.
