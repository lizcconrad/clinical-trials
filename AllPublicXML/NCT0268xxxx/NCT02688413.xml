  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomised controlled multi-centered study using MindMotionPRO, an immersive virtual reality
      based system for upper limb motor rehabilitation in early post-stroke patients. The study
      aims to evaluate the ability of MindMotionPRO technology to increase the rehabilitation dose.
      Effectiveness will be evaluated by validated rehabilitation performance scales.
      Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by the resource utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to show that MindMotionPRO is a tool that allows a patient to
      increase the amount of rehabilitation therapy performed. This study will measure the
      rehabilitation dose, as measured by the duration of the rehabilitation session and the number
      of exercises performed by the patient. The study hypothesis is that patients in the
      MindMotionPRO group will spend more time performing rehabilitation exercises than in the
      Self-Directed Prescribed exercises group. The effectiveness of the MindMotionPRO versus
      Self-Directed Prescribed Exercises will also be measured, based on the change in
      rehabilitation performance measures. The cost-effectiveness will be measured by the resource
      utilization, as defined by the time spent by the therapist providing the rehabilitation
      session.

    <description>The MindMotionPRO, a certified device for medical use, is a virtual reality based system to train upper limb activities in a game scenario. The participant will receive 5 exercises sessions with the MindMotionPRO per week over 4 weeks. This is done in addition to standard practice for upper limb rehabilitation which should be at least 30 min five times per week.</description>
