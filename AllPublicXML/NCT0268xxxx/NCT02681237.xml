  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept study (a study to initially assess the benefit a new drug
      indication) of the combination of two investigational drugs cediranib and olaparib in
      patients with ovarian cancer whose cancer worsened despite previously receiving a poly
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (such as olaparib).

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether taking cediranib and olaparib at the same
      time will be able to stop tumors from growing further or shrink it.

      Cediranib works by blocking (inhibiting) several specific proteins in cancer cells called the
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. These proteins are important in the
      formation of blood vessels to the tumor. It is believed that many tumors survive because the
      blood vessels on the tumors bring oxygen and nutrients to the cancer cells which enable them
      to grow. If the formation of the blood vessels is blocked, the tumor cells may die.

      Olaparib, works by blocking a protein called poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase
      (PARP). PARP is an important protein which tries to fix damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA,
      molecules that contain important instructions for the development of cells). Many cancers are
      thought to develop from damaged DNA. By blocking PARP from fixing damaged DNA, the tumor
      cells may die.

      Adding cediranib to olaparib, and therefore blocking several different mechanisms for cancer
      growth, may stop tumor growth.
