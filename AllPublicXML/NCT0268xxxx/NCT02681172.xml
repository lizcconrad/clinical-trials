  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 4 study will explore, in the context of the present French clinical practice, the
      impact of florbetaben 18F (FBB) in patients evaluated for AD who require a biomarker for
      etiologic determination of the cognitive and functional impairment, but in whom:

        1. lumbar puncture was not feasible for medical conditions

        2. results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were considered ambiguous by treating
           physicians

        3. lumbar puncture was refused by the patient
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It will be conducted in an outpatient setting at the tertiary memory clinics (CMRR) in France
      in patients with a preliminary diagnosis based on the completion of a prior, full diagnostic
      workup, not more than 12 months previously - which could include, but will not be limited to
      brain imaging if needed (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT)),
      neuropsychological evaluation including a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), CSF
      examination and other examinations according to &quot;Haute Autorité de santé&quot; (HAS, National
      Authority of Health, France) Recommendations - and in whom:

        1. lumbar puncture was not feasible for medical conditions

        2. results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were considered ambiguous by treating
           physicians

        3. lumbar puncture was refused by the patient

      For all subjects the study will comprise 3 outpatient clinic visits to record information on
      previous work ups and to perform the FBB Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan (Visit 1:
      screening/ baseline, Visit 2: PET scan, Visit 3: subject informed on the FBB PET scan
      result).

      At Visit 1, the initial diagnosis based on previous work up will be collected and rated on a
      five-point Likert confidence scale by the Physician.

      At Visit 2, the FBB PET scan will be performed. Adverse events will be reported during the
      exam and up to 7 days after the PET procedure.

      At Visit 3, based on the amyloid PET scan results, change of diagnosis will be collected, in
      addition to physician confidence.
