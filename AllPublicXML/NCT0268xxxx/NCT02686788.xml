  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of TMP001 in the treatment of patients with
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Therefore the average total number of contrast
      enhancing lesions (CELs) on brain MRI scans at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24 during treatment with
      TMP001 is compared to the average total number of CELs on brain MRI scans at week -4 and
      baseline in these patients .

      Based on promising preclinical results, the investigators assume a comparable effect of
      TMP001 on reduction of contrast-enhancing lesions as shown for other immunomodulatory
      substances in recent clinical studies.
