  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breath analysis is a non-invasive procedure to detect and monitor diseases and it is
      particularly attractive for patients who have to routinely check biomarkers, such as
      diabetics (blood glucose) or end-stage renal disease patients (creatinine). Preliminary data
      in a small study with healthy subjects showed a high correlation between blood glucose levels
      and acetone. Therefore, the objective of this study is to correlate biomarkers (glucose level
      and creatinine, respectively) with the corresponding target breath components (acetone and
      NH3, respectively) detected by portable gas sensors in the general population and to assess
      possible predictive models for biomarker estimations from the corresponding target breath
      component and predictive models to estimate abnormal biomarker concentrations.

      Breath analysis is a non-invasive procedure to detect and monitor diseases and it is
      particularly attractive for patients who have to routinely check biomarkers, such as
      diabetics (blood glucose) or end-stage renal disease patients (creatinine). The proposed
      breath sensors analyse breath in real-time with on-line display of breath parameters, are
      portable, simple to operate, inexpensive and offer a sufficiently low limit of detection for
      the target breath markers, thus making them of high interest for daily clinical practice.
      Preliminary data in a small study with healthy subjects showed a high correlation between
      blood glucose levels and acetone.

      The primary objective of this study is to correlate biomarkers (glucose level and creatinine,
      respectively) with the corresponding target breath components (acetone and NH3, respectively)
      detected by portable gas sensors in the general population. The secondary objectives of the
      study are to assess possible predictive models for biomarker estimations from the
      corresponding target breath component and predictive models to estimate abnormal biomarker
      concentrations.
