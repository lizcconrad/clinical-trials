  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect physiologic data from patients with severe brain
      injury who require mechanical ventilation in order to describe the impact of ventilation,
      specifically positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), on intracranial pressure (ICP).

    <description>Enrolled patients will receive a sequential, step-wise increase in positive end-expired pressure from 5 cmH2O to 15 cmH2O. Intracranial pressure, transpulmonary pressure, vitals, and mechanical ventilator data will be measured at each increment. PEEP will be increased by increments of 5 cmH2O. The mode of mechanical ventilation (pressure or volume control), inspiratory time and fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) will be determined by the critical care team caring for the patient. In the event that PEEP is set &gt; 5 cmH2O, measurements will be obtained from that starting point and increased to a maximum of 15 cmH2O. The physiologic measurements will be obtained at regular intervals (within 5 minutes at each PEEP level) throughout the PEEP titration period.</description>
