    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients were enrolled who meet the following criteria:

          -  A healthy infant who received, or whose mother had received antibiotics and the infant
             is asymptomatic. For example, the baby has no signs of cardio respiratory distress and
             is feeding well. Symptomatic infants are excluded (see Exclusions, below).

          -  Born at the study hospital site and admitted to the well-baby nursery or admitted to
             the intensive-care nursery for less than12 hours for post delivery observation
             (delayed transition, temperature or dextrose instability, meconium staining and/or
             parental concern).

          -  All babies on oral feeding with stable cardio respiratory status and deemed &quot;healthy&quot;
             upon clinical examination, with normal perfusion as defined by capillary filling of
             the fingernail.

          -  Term neonate (â‰¥38 weeks of completed gestation), OR

          -  Near-term neonate (&gt;36&lt;38 weeks of completed gestation; &gt;2,000g birth weight), OR

          -  Near-term neonate (&gt;35&lt;38 weeks of completed gestation; &gt;2,500g birth weight)

          -  Care provided (primarily) in the well-baby nursery population;

          -  Absence of concurrent cardio respiratory distress, sepsis, major congenital anomalies
             or need for care in an intensive care nursery;

          -  Not participating in another concurrent unrelated study.

        Exclusion Criteria

        The study enrolled patients who did not have any of the following exclusion criteria:

          -  Parents or legal guardians unwilling to sign written, informed consent.

          -  Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient
             unsuitable for the study.

          -  Infants receiving antibiotics who are also symptomatic are excluded. For example, a
             baby who is feeding poorly or is in cardio respiratory distress is excluded.

          -  Mother has received phenobarbital in past 30 days.
