  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is not uncommon in male patients under general
      anesthesia, and it may cause patient agitation and exacerbated postoperative pain. In this
      study, the investigators will enroll male patients undergoing elective prostate surgery with
      urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction, and compare the efficacy of pudendal
      nerve block (PNB) and intravenous tramadol in prevention of CRBD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PNB trial is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized controlled trial that
      will test the superiority of pudendal nerve block with 0.33% ropivacaine to intravenous
      tramadol 1.5mg/kg for CRBD prevention. A total of 94 patients undergoing elective prostate
      surgery at lithotomy position with urinary catheterization (16 G Fr Foley catheter) after
      anesthetic induction under general anesthesia will be enrolled at West China Hospital of
      Sichuan University. Patients will be divided randomly into two groups:

      The PNB group: patients will be given bilateral pudendal nerve block with 30ml of 0.33%
      ropivacaine (15ml for each side) after the completion of surgery before extubation.

      The TRAM group: patients will be given tramadol of 1.5mg/kg after the completion of surgery
      before extubation.

      All patients will be evaluated by a research nurse who were blinded to the group assignments
      for outcomes at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6h after patients' arrival in PACU, and after extraction of
      urinary catheter.

      The primary outcome is the incidence of postoperative CRBD. The secondary outcomes include
      the severity of postoperative CRBD, postoperative tramadol requirement and number of patients
      with requiring postoperative tramadol, numeric rating scale (NRS) for postoperative pain,
      postoperative sufentanil requirement and number of patients with requiring postoperative
      sufentanil, postoperative side effects, and acceptance of indwelling urinary catheter after
      extraction of the catheter.

      All primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Analyses
      are performed with the use of SPSS 18.0 software. The Student-t test is used to analyze
      demographic data in the two groups. The incidence of CRBD and side effects between groups are
      analyzed by Chi-square test, whereas the severity of CRBD (mild, moderate, and severe) is
      analyzed by Fisher's exact test. NRS scale is analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test.
      Postoperative tramadol and sufentanil requirement is analyzed by Z test, and the number of
      patients requiring tramadol for CRBD rescue treatment and sufentanil for postoperative pain
      will be analyzed with Fisher's exact test. A P value&lt;0.05 is considered significant.

    <description>It's assessed according to the following scaling system: no CRBD indicates that there are no complaints of CRBD at all; mild indicates that complaints of CRBD exist only if the patient was asked about it; moderate indicates that patients complain of CRBD spontaneously; and severe indicates that CRBD causes a spontaneous behavioral response such as flailing limb, strong vocal response, or attempt to pull out the catheter.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>When moderate or severe CRBD is reported, intravenous tramadol 1.5mg/kg will be administered as a rescue treatment to reduce the bladder discomfort, and tramadol requirement will be recorded and compared.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked for evaluating pain intensity by themselves using this single 11-point numeric scale ranged between 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; [17]. If the patient complains about pain with NRS greater than 4, intravenous sufentanil 5 μg will be administered as rescue analgetic treatment.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to answer the question &quot;Will you worry about urinary catheterization if you undergo another operation next time?&quot;. The answer &quot;No&quot; meant acceptance of indwelling urinary catheter, and the answer &quot;Yes&quot; meant unacceptance of indwelling urinary catheter.</description>
