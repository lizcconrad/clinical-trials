  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic excision of endometriotic cysts is the main stream surgical intervention for
      treatment of endometriosis. However there is evidence that intervention may effect ovarian
      reserve by destruction of healthy ovarian tissue during surgery. Available evidence on the
      topic are contradictory and employed research methodology are diverse. There is need for an
      adequately powered research with proper methodology to assess actual effects of surgery.

    <description>Women with endometrioma lesions will undergo laparoscopic removal. Cysts will be enucleated with blunt dissection of the cyst capsule and following traction, counter traction maneuver. Bipolar coagulation will be used sparsely and suturing will be the predominant choice for achieving bleeding control.</description>
