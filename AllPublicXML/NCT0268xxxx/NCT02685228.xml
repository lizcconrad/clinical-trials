      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of very low dose decitabine combinate
      with gemcitabine in the first-line treatment of locally advanced, unresectable and metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

      This study intends to advanced pancreatic cancer with row standard with district group random
      way is divided into two groups, a group for the gemcitabine monotherapy in the treatment
      group, another group of gemcitabine combined with low dose of decitabine treatment group. The
      overall survival, progression free survival, and disease control rate were observed in
      patients treated with combined therapy. At the same time, its safety and tolerance were
      observed. The methylation status and its influence on the immune function were also detected
      by biological test.

             pancreatic cancer patients. Or clinical compliance, but the pathological specimens
             were difficult, can be fully communicated with patients, selected clinical research.

          -  in the treatment of advanced cancer with no anti tumor drug.

          -  the damage had been recovered by other treatments, in which patients received surgery

          -  according to RECIST standard 1.1 there is at least one measurable lesion, and the
             lesion is irradiated with at least one measurable lesion. Any of the following methods
             can accurately measure the diameter of the lesions, the abdominal computed tomography
             CT or MRI, the conventional method of diameter of at least 20mm or the application of
             spiral CT diameter at least 10mm.
