  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residents of rural and frontier counties experience significant disparities in health care
      access and outcomes when compared to their urban counterparts. The organization of health
      care delivery contributes significantly to these disparities. For rural residents with
      multiple chronic conditions, transitioning along the continuum of care, between systems of
      treatment and support, and between dispersed locations present significant challenges. One
      critical challenge involves hospitalization for treatment because it requires travel to
      locations at a significant distance from home and disrupts personal and family routines. The
      transition back home is also problematic because discharge planning does not adequately
      account for limited access to care in rural areas. Indeed, discharge planning has been
      recently described as a &quot;black hole;&quot; fragmented and uncoordinated, and contributing to poor
      outcomes and patient dissatisfaction. The specific aim of this research is to ascertain rural
      patients' actual experience of the discharge planning process and to involve patients and
      rural providers in designing and testing a contextually appropriate rural options discharge
      model (ROADMAP) that improves patient outcomes and reduces re-hospitalizations.

      Residents of rural counties experience significant disparities in health care access and
      outcomes when compared to their urban counterparts. These disparities are structural; based
      in our market-based medical care delivery system. For rural residents with multiple chronic
      conditions, transitioning along the continuum of care, between systems of treatment and
      support, and between dispersed locations both expose and produce disparities. The transition
      home from hospitalization for treatment exposes the current urban bias. Indeed, discharge
      planning is fragmented and uncoordinated, and contributes to poor the disparities. The
      specific aims of this research is to ascertain rural patients' actual experience of
      discharge; then to involve patients and rural providers in using those data to design a
      contextually appropriate rural options at discharge model of active planning (ROADMAP) that
      improves patient outcomes and reduces disparities. Objectives include:

        1. Ascertain actual patient experience in the rural discharge process.

        2. Design the ROADMAP model to fit the emerging health services context.

        3. Test the ROADMAP's efficacy in enhancing patient defined outcomes.

        4. Design the components for rapid diffusion.

      Researchers will work in four counties of the Missoula Hospital Referral Region with a total
      population of 53,116 living on 12,342 square miles (4.3 persons per square mile). Researchers
      will recruit patients seeking treatment from St. Patrick Hospital. Patients and patient
      advocates will serve on an Innovations Design Team (IDT) to create the ROADMAP. Researchers
      will first interview patients (n = 40) who have been discharged to one of the rural counties.
      Researchers will compare their experiences to guidelines. Next, they will conduct a Design
      Survey (n=600) to verify goals important to patients. The IDT will use these findings to
      develop design requirements for ROADMAP. Finally, we will use a quasi-experimental research
      design to compare the patient designed rural ROADMAP to standard practice. The primary
      outcome measures are measures that reflect the patient's values for health-related quality of
      life and functional status, as well as hospital re-admissions. An independent statistician
      will use Hierarchical Linear Modeling to examine the complex relationships. This approach
      accounts for patients nested in four counties and the correlated errors inherent in within
      subject analysis. Health care reform sets the occasion for rapid diffusion of ROADMAP. This
      can provide an incremental reduction in rural disparities. Incorporating patient and provider
      input increases the likelihood it will fit within the emerging reimbursement model.
      Researchers expect that ROADMAP will reduce re-hospitalizations by as much as 30%, and
      improve patient recovery and return to participation in daily life.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were recruited from those admitted from one of four rural counties. In the initial phase, all patients enrolled from any county were assigned to a baseline condition. After enrollment stabilized, patients from one county were enrolled in the intervention while patients from the other three counties remained in baseline. Subsequently the intervention was introduced to the other counties sequentially while others remained in baseline. A return to baseline conditions followed a period after the intervention had been introduced in all counties.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Enhanced rural discharge and transition involved conducting a functional needs assessment before discharge. Identified needs were shared with a Local Community Transition Coordinator (LCTC). Needs include such patient centered issues as housing, transportation, emotional support, support for completing daily chores, and assistance in securing local follow-up appointments. Once a patient returned home, the LCTC conduct a review of discharge orders to insure a patient can meet those recommendations. Then the LCTC worked with the patient to develop and implement a transition plan that linked the patient to local resources he or she can use to address needs. The LCTC also provided direct supports. This plan was implemented over the course of the first 30 days after discharge.</description>

          <title>Patient Activation Measure (PAM10)</title>
          <description>Patients completed the 10-item Patient Activation Measure (PAM10) questionnaire measuring a patient's confidence in their knowledge, skills, and abilities to manage their health once they were discharged from a hospital. Patients indicated whether they strongly agreed, agreed, disagreed, or strongly disagreed with each statement. A patient could also indicate that a particular item was not applicable to their situation. Total scores ranged from 0.0 to 100.0. Higher scores indicated greater confidence in their capacity for self-management.</description>

          <description>The LACE+ uses a proprietary algorithm to calculate the likelihood of a patient's hospital readmission based on information derived from the patient's electronic medical record. Generally, higher scores reflect higher risk. Scores range from 0 to 100. A score of 28 or less is categorized as low risk. A score of 29 to 58 is categorized as medium risk. A score of 59 or higher is categorized as high risk.</description>
          <population>We analyzed LACE+ data for 112 patients as the electronic medical record did not establish this measure until after the study started.</population>

Enhanced Transitions Planning: While in the treating hospital, patients from small towns and rural communities are engaged in a process designed to improve the transitions home, including a functional needs assessment that produces a plan that matches available rural community service providers to a patient's transitions needs. Once home, a Local Community Transition Coordinator provides support to address needs.</description>

Enhanced Transitions Planning: While in the treating hospital, patients from small towns and rural communities are engaged in a process designed to improve the transitions home, including a functional needs assessment that produces a plan that matches available rural community service providers to a patient's transitions needs. Once home, a Local Community Transition Coordinator provides support to address needs.</description>

        <description>The SF12 is a twelve-item standardized questionnaire that measures overall, physical health, and mental health. Patients rate each item on an ordinal scale. Data are analyzed using a proprietary algorithm. Scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores reflect a better health status. The analysis creates an overall health score and sub scores that reflect physical health and mental health. Both Physical and Mental Health Composite Scales combine the 12 items in such a way that they compare to a national norm of a mean score of 50.0 and a standard deviation of 10.0.</description>

          <title>Short Form (SF12) Physical Health Score</title>
          <description>The SF12 is a twelve-item standardized questionnaire that measures overall, physical health, and mental health. Patients rate each item on an ordinal scale. Data are analyzed using a proprietary algorithm. Scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores reflect a better health status. The analysis creates an overall health score and sub scores that reflect physical health and mental health. Both Physical and Mental Health Composite Scales combine the 12 items in such a way that they compare to a national norm of a mean score of 50.0 and a standard deviation of 10.0.</description>

        <description>The RTM14 is a fourteen-item questionnaire to measures patients’ perspectives on the delivery of transition services and supports after discharge from a regional hospital to a small town or rural community. Patients respond by indicating whether they strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree with each of the 14 items. Patients may also indicate whether an item is not applicable to their situation. Ratings are converted to a scale that ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores reflect better transition service performance.</description>

          <title>Enhanced Discharge Planning and Rural Transition Supports</title>
          <description>The intervention consists of a package of procedures that enhances supports during the transitions from the hospital to recovery at home, including a structured needs assessment that produces a plan that matches available rural community service providers to a patient's transition needs and the provision of recovery supports to the patient.
Enhanced Transitions Planning: While in the treating hospital, patients from small towns and rural communities are engaged in a process designed to improve the transitions home, including a functional needs assessment that produces a plan that matches available rural community service providers to a patient's transitions needs. Once home, a Local Community Transition Coordinator provides support to address needs.</description>
