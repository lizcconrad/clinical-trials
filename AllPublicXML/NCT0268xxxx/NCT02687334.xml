      The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the cerebral oxygen
      saturation (rSO2) and pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and oxygen (PaO2) in arterial blood
      and to identify the covariates between rSO2 and PaCO2 and PaO2 during the period of
      anesthesia induction.
