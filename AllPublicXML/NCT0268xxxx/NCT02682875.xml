    <textblock>
      Pain of these patients' will be evaluated by many pain scales in the postoperative period.
      These scales include OUCHER, Visiuel Analog Scale, FLACC, Faces Pain Scale revise, Wong Baker
      Faces Scale, Faces Pain Scale, Numeric rating Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, CHEOPS and also
      age, blood pressure, respiratuar rate, heart rate will be recorded.

      In the first step of this study, the parameters taken into account on widely used each pain
      scale practically and importance level of each parameter will be examined. The parameters
      taken into account in determining the degree of pain and degree of each pain scale will be
      recorded. Independent t-test of the pain scales will be analyzed whether different
      statistically. Pain scales used in the application at conclusion statistical analysis will be
      grouped.

      In addition, parameters considered to be effective on pain (pulse, blood pressure, etc.) will
      be determined and also recorded. The degree of importance on pain of the current scales and
      other parameters to be determined and as result, new pain scale will be created. While
      determining the the level of importance will be utilized from the analytic hierarchy process
      (AHP). Making binary comparisons between AHP and parameters, the level of importance and
      weightiness score of each parameter will be determined. The mathematical formulation of the
      pain points will be presented considering AHP weightiness score of each parameter.

      Although pain scores obtained mathematically, pain score with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
      will be estimated considering the parameters that impact on the pain score.

      The final step, the creation of new pain scale comparing the pain scores obtained by
      mathematical formulation and Artificial Neural Network and, it is intended to be compared
      with the current scales.
