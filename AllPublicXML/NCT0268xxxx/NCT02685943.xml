    <textblock>
      Although suicide risk is highly prevalent among the patient population in mental health care,
      remarkably little research exists on effective treatments. Among a small set of novel
      approaches, CAMS is particularly promising. The investigators compare CAMS to TAU in a
      randomized controlled trial at four departments in Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, hypothesizing
      CAMS to be the superior approach. Primary outcome measures are suicidal ideation and suicide
      attempts, with secondary outcome measures including general symptoms of mental health
      problems. Changes in the outcome measures are compared between the two groups from baseline
      to 6 and 12 months after patients are included in the study. The study has the potential to
      impact the science of treating suicidal individuals and it could benefit the general public
      by establishing CAMS as an effective clinical approach for rapidly reducing suicide risk.
