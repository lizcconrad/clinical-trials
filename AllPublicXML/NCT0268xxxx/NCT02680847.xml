    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study designed to characterize the PK and to
      evaluate the safety of ALO-02 in children and adolescents 7 to 17 years of age who require
      opioid analgesia for moderate-to-severe pain. The study consists of 4 study periods
      (screening, titration, maintenance, follow-up) occurring over a period of up to 9 weeks. The
      study will enroll approximately 140 children and adolescents with at least 100 subjects once
      stabilized during the titration period to complete a minimum of 2 of the 4 weeks study
      duration in the maintenance period to satisfy the PK endpoint. A safety follow-up visit is
      required at 1 week post-last dose.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
