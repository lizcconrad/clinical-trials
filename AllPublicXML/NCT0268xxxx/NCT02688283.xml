    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to compare a snack with ingredients (whole grains and dietary
      fiber) to slow carbohydrate digestion to a similar control snack without such ingredients and
      evaluate the effect of the snack on glycemic response and subjective satiety. The test
      product will be compared with a control product as well as white bread in a randomized,
      controlled, crossover trial including 20 healthy males or females between the ages of 18 and
      70 and having a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 30 kg/m2. Following an overnight fast,
      participants will be given each of the study products in a random order at least a week
      apart. Glucose and insulin will be measured before product consumption and over a period of
      four hours. Visual analog scales to measure subjective satiety will also be administered over
      a period of four hours.
