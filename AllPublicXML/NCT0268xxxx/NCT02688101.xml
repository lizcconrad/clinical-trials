      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study of DpC administered orally to patients with advanced
      solid tumors. The study will be conducted in two parts. In the first phase successive cohorts
      of patients (3+3) will receive escalating doses of DpC until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is reached. MTD is based on tolerability observed during the first 28 days of treatment. The
      second part of the study involves treatment of expansion cohorts (10-15 patients each) in
      specific indications to confirm the tolerability of treatment at the recommended phase 2 dose
      and schedule and evaluate evidence of anti-tumor activity.
