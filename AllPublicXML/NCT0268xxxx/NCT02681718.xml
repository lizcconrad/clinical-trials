  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of three approaches in diabetes
      management: (1) community health worker (CHW) education; (2) text messaging; and (3) usual
      hospital-based care. The goal is to determine the most cost-effective method of diabetes
      management among an economically-disadvantaged, minority population.

    <textblock>
      The CHAMP study will test the efficacy of two interventions designed to decrease uncontrolled
      hyperglycemia (defined as Hemoglobin-A1C (A1C) at or above 9%) among adults with diabetes.
      Patients from a safety-net hospital will be randomized into three groups: 1) a control group,
      2) an intervention providing diabetes self-care text messages, or 3) an intervention using
      community health workers to provide diabetes education and linkage to care. Secondary
      objectives include increasing diabetes knowledge, improving diabetes self-management, and
      increasing use of primary care (i.e., make one visit to the physician in 6 months) among the
      intervention participants. A cost-effectiveness analysis will determine the most appropriate
      way to reduce the burden of uncontrolled diabetes.

    <description>During a six-month intervention period, the CHWs will conduct six home-based visitations and provide individualized diabetes education using an intensive diabetes lifestyle curriculum called Diabetes Learning Circle (DLC), developed and used by the Sinai Diabetes Education Program. At each visit, lasting for approximately one hour, the participants will be motivated to set SMART behavioral goals for diabetes self-management. At each visit after the initial visit, CHWs will follow-up with each participant to check their progress on their behavioral SMART goals. In addition, the CHWs will conduct intermittent phone calls (at least one monthly) and home visits as needed.</description>
