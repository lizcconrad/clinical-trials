    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: To assess the relative bioavailability of RBP-7000 formulated with 2
      different molecular weights (MW) (low and high MW as test treatments) of poly
      (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) with a carboxylic acid end group (PLGH) polymer compared to
      intermediate MW PLGH polymer following single subcutaneous (SC) injection of RBP-7000 in
      subjects with stable schizophrenia.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single SC injections of RBP-7000 using a PLGH
      polymer of 2 different MW (low and high MW as test treatments) compared to intermediate MW
      polymer in subjects with stable schizophrenia.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel-group study in subjects
      with clinically stable schizophrenia who are not currently taking risperidone. A total of
      approximately 48 subjects (16 per group) will be randomized to receive a single subcutaneous
      (SC) injection of RBP-7000 120 mg formulated with PLGH polymer of either 21 kilodaltons (kDa)
      (low MW group), 29 kDa of PLGH polymer (high MW group), or 26 kDa of PLGH polymer
      (intermediate MW group).

             prior to screening, or a corrected QT interval (Fridericia - QTcF) &gt;450 msec (male) or
             &gt;470 msec (female) at screening (Visit 1).
