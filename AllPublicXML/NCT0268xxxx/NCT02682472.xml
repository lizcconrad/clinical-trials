  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Admission into a care home for people with dementia has been linked with both positive and
      negative psychological outcomes for both the resident and their carers. Whilst some people
      with dementia adjust quickly, many never adjust at all or adjustment is complex and linked to
      cognitive and behavioural decline (Wilson et al, 2007). Therefore, support for healthy
      adjustment is needed.

      Recent research (Aminzadeh et al., 2013; Sury, Burns and Brodaty, 2013, Sussman and Dupuis,
      2013) has identified factors that influence different relocation outcomes and prevent adverse
      reactions. There are currently no interventions that support successful adjustment by
      emphasising the positive factors found to influence relocation outcomes while mitigating the
      effects of negative influences and addressing any missed pre-admission procedures, reported
      in the literature.

      The current project seeks to design an intervention that predominantly builds on the work of
      Sury et al (2013) and focuses on promoting healthy adjustment through an enhanced best
      practice based admission process.

      The intervention will be developed through systematic review of the literature and
      consultation with professional experts, service users, care home staff and carers. The
      current study will serve as a feasibility (pilot) study and test the acceptability of the
      intervention design, examine recruitment and dropout and establish sample size for future,
      larger studies. It also aims to examine whether the intervention indicates an improvement in
      residents' quality of life, mood, overall adjustment and carer satisfaction with care.

      All participants will receive a subset of the same intervention, specifically tailored to
      their needs and with elements delivered by staff, carer or psychologist. Staff and
      researchers will assess the improvement indicators mentioned above using relevant
      psychometric measures at baseline, post intervention completion and at one-month follow up.
      Indirect measures (interviews and staff field notes) will also be used to indicate
      intervention fidelity and feasibility.
