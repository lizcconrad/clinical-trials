  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single site cross-sectional comparison of paired diagnostic imaging modalities.

      This study will show the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS in detecting the various types
      of endoleaks, in comparison to tCTA, following EVAR. It will collect data to allow comparison
      of diagnostic accuracy across modalities including CDU, CEUS and tCTA. It will collect time
      taken to perform the various types of scan, to allow healthcare costs to be calculated for
      each imaging modality.

      This study will show the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS in detecting the various types
      of endoleaks, in comparison to tCTA, following EVAR. It will collect data to allow comparison
      of diagnostic accuracy across modalities including CDU, CEUS and tCTA. It will collect time
      taken to perform the various types of scan, to allow healthcare costs to be calculated for
      each imaging modality.

      Collected data will be analysed regarding two novel hypothesised methods of using CEUS
      information:

      The first is recording temporal delay between contrast in graft and contrast in endoleak to
      define endoleak type. Potentially this could be used as a faster method of defining endoleak
      type in a surveillance programme.

      The second is to identify/refute correlation between CEUS contrast to appear in endoleak vs
      tCTA contrast to appear in endoleak. If an association can be established, CEUS timings could
      potentially then be used to time 'standard' CTA phases to improve CTAs diagnostic accuracy.
