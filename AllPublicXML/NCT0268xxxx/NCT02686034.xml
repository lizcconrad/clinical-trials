    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled
      investigation designed for comparison of two parallel treatment groups: gammaCore (active
      nVNS treatment) and a Sham device (control treatment), for the acute treatment of migraine
      attacks
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Period 1: 4-week observational run-in period; no stimulation treatment. Subjects use standard
      of care (SoC) medication to treat their migraine attacks, according to their individual
      prescriptions.

      Period 2: 4-week randomized/controlled period. After the run-in period, subjects are
      randomized (1:1) to receive either an nVNS device or a sham device to treat up to 5 migraine
      attacks.

      Period 3: 4-week open-label (active treatment) period. After the randomized period, subjects
      continue to the open-label period where all subjects receive an active gammaCore device to
      treat up to 5 migraine attacks.

    <time_frame>2 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to compare the treatment response for nVNS and Sham therapies at two hours post-treatment, for the first treated migraine attack during study Period 2. Treatment response is defined as no pain at 2 hours post-treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nausea/Vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>• Presence or absence of nausea/vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia (baseline pre-treatment vs 2-hours post-treatment) for nVNS and sham therapies for the first migraine attack treated during study Period 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Response - No Pain or Mild Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>• Response of no pain or mild pain on the 4-point headache pain scale for the nVNS and sham therapies at 2 hours post-treatment for the first migraine attack treated during study Period 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained Treatment Response</measure>
    <time_frame>24 and 48 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>• Sustained treatment response at 24 and 48 hours post-treatment for nVNS and sham therapies for the first attack treated during study Period 2. Sustained treatment response is defined as achievement of treatment response and no subsequent increase on the 4 point headache pain scale. A new migraine attack is defined as an attack starting more than 48 hours after relief of the prior migraine attack.</description>
