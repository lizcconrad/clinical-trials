      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, chronic-dosing (7
      days), two-period, two-treatment, cross-over study to evaluate the treatment effect of PT003
      compared with that of Placebo MDI on Cardiovascular Hemodynamics following chronic-dosing (7
      days) in subjects with moderate to severe COPD.

    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <description>RVEDVI is a measure of the volume of blood in the right ventricle at the end of diastole, normalized over body surface area and was measured using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging. RVEDVI is calculated as the right ventricular end diastolic volume (RDEDV) divided by the body surface area (BSA).</description>
