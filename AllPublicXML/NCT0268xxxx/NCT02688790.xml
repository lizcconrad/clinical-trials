      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion dose of dalbavancin, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      a single dalbavancin IV infusion.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized male and female patients who are preterm neonates (gestational age

             ≥32 to &lt;37 weeks, aged ≤28 days), term neonates (gestational age ≥37 weeks, aged ≤28
             days) or young infants (aged 28 days to 3 months inclusive) who will be receiving at
             least 24 hours of appropriate non-investigational intravenous antiinfective treatment
             other than glycopeptide antibiotics for known or suspected bacterial infections.
             Patients with urinary tract infections due to Gram-positive organisms may be enrolled

          -  Each patient's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) must be willing and able to provide a
             signed and dated written informed consent document indicating that they have been
             informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial

          -  Each patient's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) must be willing and able, if patient is
             discharged from the hospital, to return the patient to the hospital or a designated
             clinic for scheduled visits, or allow a nurse to come to the patient's home for
             laboratory tests, PK and other out-patient procedures as required by the protocol

          -  Patients must be expected to survive with appropriate antibiotic therapy and
             appropriate supportive care throughout the study

          -  Sufficient intravenous access (peripheral or central) to receive Investigational
             Product (IP)

          -  Patients must have an audiologic assessment within 7 days prior to the investigational
             product infusion consisting of ear specific hearing testing utilizing distortion
             product evoked otoacoustic emissions,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days preceding the dose of IP

          -  Patients who are currently receiving intravenous vancomycin or other glycopeptide
             antibiotics. Dalbavancin may be administered 8 hours after the last dose of
             vancomycin. Vancomycin or other glycopeptide antibiotics should not be given during
             the 7 day period following administration of dalbavancin. If intravenous vancomycin or
             other glycopeptide use is unavoidable during the 7 day period following administration
             of dalbavancin, this should be documented as a concomitant medication

          -  Have aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) or total bilirubin
             level &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal (neonates with elevated total bilirubin could
             participate if conjugated bilirubin was normal)

          -  Albumin &lt; half lower limit of normal

          -  Have received a blood or blood component (eg, red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma,
             platelets) transfusion during the 24-hour period before dosing

          -  Have any condition (eg. Septic shock, burns, cystic fibrosis, acute hemodynamic
             instability including those conditions requiring pressor support) that would make the
             patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study (eg, would place
             the patient at risk, compromise the quality of the data; or interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of dalbavancin)

          -  Patients known to have hypersensitivity to glycopeptides

          -  Moderate or severe renal impairment defined as serum creatinine ≥2 times the upper
             limit of normal (× ULN) for age OR urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/h (measured over at least 8
             hours) OR requirement for dialysis)

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical condition or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
             study
