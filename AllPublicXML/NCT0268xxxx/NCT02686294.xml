      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of bepotastine
      after multiple oral administration of TALION tab., a IR formulation of bepotastine as
      reference drug and HL151, a SR formulation of bepotastine as test drug in healthy male
      adults. Additionally the safety and tolerability of two drugs will be evaluated.
