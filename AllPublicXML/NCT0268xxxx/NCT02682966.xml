    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study in patients who undergo routine postoperative troponin assessment
      after major (semi-)elective noncardiac surgery. Two groups are created based on postoperative
      troponin levels: Postoperative myocardial injury (PMI) group with troponin I levels ≥ 60 ng/L
      and a control group with troponin levels &lt; 60ng/L. The primary aim of this study is to assess
      the association of PMI with pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the association between PMI and
      obstructive CAD will be investigated.

    <description>Pulmonary embolism (PE) on either Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) or Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) scan. PE on CCTA is defined as a sharply delineated pulmonary artery filling defect in at least two consecutive image sections of the CCTA, either located centrally within the vessel or with acute angles at its interface with the vessel wall. PE on V/Q scan is defined as at least one segmental or two subsegmental perfusion defects without corresponding abnormality on chest X-ray.</description>

        Patients of 60 years or older that undergo major (semi-)elective noncardiac surgery are
        eligible for study participation. Major (semi)-elective noncardiac surgery is defined as
        all surgical procedures requiring ≥ 24 hours of hospital admittance that have been preceded
        by a preoperative evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 60 years old

          -  Major noncardiac surgery, defined as non-cardiac surgical procedures requiring
             hospital admittance &gt; 24 hours

          -  Semi-elective surgery, defined as surgery that that has been preceded by a
             preoperative evaluation.

          -  ≥ 1 troponin assessment in the first 3 postoperative days as a part of the routine
             'postoperative troponin assessment' protocol.

          -  For patients who undergo surgery more than once, the first surgery will be included in
             the analysis. Reoperations will not be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Typical anginal complaints

          -  Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or new left bundle branch block
             (LBBB) on ECG

          -  Patients unable to fully comply to study needs (e.g. incompetent patients or patients
             unable to communicate in Dutch or English)

          -  Severe claustrophobia.

          -  Patients who have a life expectancy of less than three months.

          -  Patients who are too ill to undergo a CCTA or Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) scan.
