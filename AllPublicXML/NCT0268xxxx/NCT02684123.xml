    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata is a medical condition, in which the hair falls out in patches. The hair can
      fall out on the scalp or elsewhere on the face and body.

      Alopecia areata is an autoimmune skin disease, which means that the immune system is
      recognizing the hair follicles as foreign and attacking them, causing round patches of hair
      loss. It can progress to total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis) or complete body hair loss
      (alopecia universalis). The scalp is the most commonly affected area, but the beard or any
      hair-bearing site can be affected alone or together with the scalp. Alopecia areata occurs in
      males and females of all ages, and is a highly unpredictable condition that tends to recur.
      Alopecia areata can cause significant distress to both patients and their families.

      In this study, the aim to assess the effects of a new treatment called apremilast in patients
      with alopecia areata. A total of 30 patients will be included in the study, which will run
      for a total of 52 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study consisting of two phases.
      A total of 30 subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata (including universalis and
      totalis) involving 50-100% of the scalp will be enrolled. A possible maximum of 15 patients
      (approximately 7 patients each) with current episodes of AA totalis / universalis may be
      included in this study.

      In Phase 1, subjects will be randomized (2:1) to either receive apremilast or placebo for 24
      weeks.

      In Phase 2, eligible subjects will receive apremilast from Week 24 through Week 48. The
      following subjects will be eligible to enter into Phase 2:

        1. Subjects who received placebo in Phase 1 of the study

        2. Subjects who received apremilast in Phase 1 of the study, and who achieved a minimum of
           50% regrowth (SALT50) at Week 24, compared to Baseline.
