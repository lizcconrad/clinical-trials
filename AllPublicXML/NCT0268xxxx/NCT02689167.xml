      Patients who are candidates for first line treatment with Sunitinib 50mg 4/6 regimen in
      accordance with the Marketing Authorisation who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      offered participation in this study during the consultation as part of their usual care. The
      patients will be included before Sunitinib treatment is started. Thereafter, sunitinib is
      initiated 50 mg/day; regimen 4/6 (Marketing Authorisation Indication), 4 weeks &quot;on &quot;
      alternating with 2 weeks &quot;off &quot;

      As soon as a dose or schedule adjustment is required, regardless of cause, the patient will
      be randomised 1/1:

        -  Either into arm A and will receive 37.5mg of Sunitinib per day by the 4/6 regimen (in
           accordance with the Marketing Authorisation); 4 weeks &quot;on &quot; alternating with 2 weeks
           &quot;off &quot;

        -  Or into arm B and will receive 50mg of Sunitinib per day by the 2/3 regimen
           (investigational arm); 2 weeks &quot;on &quot; alternating with 1 week &quot;off &quot;

          -  Patients whose clinical state and comorbidities are not consistent with administration
             of Sunitinib at the initial dose of 50mg/day 4 weeks out of 6.

          -  Grade 3 haemorrhage within 4 weeks before starting treatment with Sunitinib (according
             to the NCI-CTCAE toxicity score version 3.0).

             study

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks before sunitinib initiation

          -  Past history of symptomatic cerebral metastases, spinal cord compression or meningeal

             transient ischemic attack.

          -  Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis within 3 months of inclusion (unless it's
             stable, asymptomatic and treated with a low molecular weight heparin for at least 6
             weeks before inclusion).

          -  Any known acute or chronic disorder (such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease) which in the opinion of the investigator could impact on the patient's
             capacity to receive the study treatment or make interpretation of toxicity or adverse
             events difficult.

          -  Known HIV infection.

          -  History of chronic active hepatitis including subjects who are carriers of the
             hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) virus.

          -  Existence of uncontrolled infection.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as a blood pressure of &gt; 150 mmHg systolic or &gt; 100
