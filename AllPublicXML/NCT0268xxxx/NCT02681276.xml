      Aim: To compare the clinical antimicrobial and adverse effects of irrigation with Sodium
      Hypochlorite (NaOCl) 0.5% versus NaOCl 3% during root canal treatment.

      Methodology: Consecutive patients referred to a specialist clinic of endodontics are randomly
      assigned to have the root canal treatment performed with a concomitant irrigation either with
      a buffered 0.5 % NaOCl (Dakin's solution) or 3 % NaOCl. Teeth with vital or necrotic pulps
      and retreatment cases were included. Root canal treatment procedures varied but followed the
      routines of the Specialist Clinic of Endodontics, Public Dental Health, Gothenburg, Sweden.
      Immediately before the root canal filling a microbial sample is taken from the operative
      field and the root canal. The bacterial samples were processed at the laboratory as outlined
      by Möller (1966). After each visit each patient was instructed to fill in a questionnaire and
      assess his or her post-operative pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS), with endpoints 0= &quot;no
      pain&quot; and 10= &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;, for seven consecutive days. The Fischer's exact test
      was used for statistical analyses of the differences in outcome between the groups.

      The aim of the present study is to compare the antimicrobial and immediate clinical effect of
      NaOCl 0.5% with the effect of NaOCl 3% in the endodontic treatment of teeth referred to the
      Specialist Clinic of Endodontics, Göteborg, Public dental Health, Västra Götaland. The
      efficiency of the treatment will be evaluated with sampling and cultivation methods and the
      assessment of patients' symptoms with a visual analogue scale.

      The sample size calculation was performed with a type I error of 0.05 and statistical power
      of 80 %. The investigators expected 70 % of the samples to be free from bacteria growth in
      the control group and the investigators considered clinically relevant a difference of 15 %
      between the groups in order to demonstrate significant differences attributable to the
      experimental therapy used. The investigators want our sample size to be two hundred sixty
      four patients, 132 to each group.

      A detailed explanation of the purpose of the study was given. Patients were also informed
      about the confidentiality of the data to be collected and about the voluntary participation.
      Every patient gets assigned a code that indicates which group they belong so the same
      irrigant is used in case of more than one visit.

      Root canal treatment followed the standard principles of the Specialist Clinic of
      Endodontics, Göteborg, Public dental Health, Västra Götaland but the treatments were not
      restricted to a single protocol.

      The recommended minimum or optimal apical size of canal preparation is size 25. All the
      operators are informed to perform the endodontic treatment the way operators normally do. The
      only variation during treatment was the concentration of the sodium hypochlorite solution for
      irrigation of the root canal. One group was irrigated with Sodium Hypochlorite 0.5 % (Dakin's
      solution) and the other group with Sodium Hypochlorite 3 %.

      Operators were free to choose any additional irrigant as clinically perceived necessary. The
      irrigants available at the clinic were 17% ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and
      iodine-potassium-iodide (IPI) 5% used as a short duration antimicrobial agent as intracanal
      medication for 10 minutes.

      Canal irrigation was carried out using 27 gauge side-cut open end needles (Monoject Luer lock
      syringe) with supplementation by ultrasonic agitation. Calcium hydroxide was the standard
      inter-appointment medicament. After sampling procedures gutta-percha and AH-plus sealer were
      used for root filling.

      The access cavity was filled with Intermediate Restorative Material (IRM) or a permanent
      filling with composite after each appointment and after finished root canal treatment.

      After bacterial sampling of the root canal, the samples were processed at the laboratory as
      outlined by Möller. Anaerobic incubation was done in a semi liquid medium (Hunton medium)
      inoculated under flow of oxygen-free gas. The mediums are checked daily for 14 days or until
      there is signs of microbial growth.

      Fischer's exact test will be used for comparisons between groups regarding growth / no
      growth. For assessments of pain on the VAS t-test and 95% confidence intervals will be used.
      All hypothesis tests will be conducted at the 0.05 level of significance.

      The outcomes will be analysed in term of positive Cultures and post operative pain. This is
      discussed further elsewhere in this application.

    <description>Bacterial sampling was taken just before the root canal filling. The sodium hypochlorite solution and the iodine-potassium-iodide were inactivated with 5 % sodium thiosulfate solution for 30 sec. The canals were then filled with VMGA I, dentinal shavings were produced with H files ISO #25. The entire canal content was absorbed by means of charcoal points and transferred to VMGA III.</description>

    <time_frame>7 consecutive days after each appointment</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient was instructed to fill in a questionnaire after each visit. This questionnaire contains seven visual scales (VAS) based on a 10 cm line determining the pain level. The patient is asked to estimate the pain they have 7 days after the endodontic procedure where 1 is very mild pain and 10 the worse pain they can imagine. The questionnaires were measured with a plastic ruler and the recordings will be transposed to numbers and registered in the excel file by the main investigator.</description>
