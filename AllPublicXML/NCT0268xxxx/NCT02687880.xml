  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many chemotherapy and radiation-containing regimens for cancer or prior to bone marrow
      transplantation can cause sterility in children and young adults. In addition, some human
      disease conditions (e.g., Klinefelter's) are associated with infertility. Semen
      cryopreservation is available as a fertility-preserving option for post pubertal boys and
      adult men, but many do not take advantage of this option due in part to lack of information,
      illness, and/or time constraints relative to their treatment plan. Currently, no
      fertility-preserving options are available for prepubescent boys who are not yet producing
      sperm. The primary objective of the proposed study is to 1) Optimize techniques for
      cryopreserving testicular tissue, 2) Assess malignant contamination in testicular tissues and
      3) develop methods to enrich spermatogonial stem cells and remove malignant contamination
      from testicular tissue. In addition, this study will process and cryopreserve tissue and/or
      cells for participating patients as a resource for future elective procedures to attempt
      fertility restoration.

      This study will provide a pool of research tissue that will be used to develop and test
      methods for manipulation and cryopreservation of testicular tissue. Progress in these
      investigations may open up a range of new fertility preservation techniques to patients that
      currently have no options. At the same time, a substantial portion of the patient's tissue
      will be cryopreserved and reserved for his own future use.

        Males scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for the
        treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing permanent
        and complete loss of subsequent testicular function.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male age 30 days (non-inclusive) to 39 years (inclusive).

          2. Scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for the
             treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing
             permanent and complete loss of subsequent testicular function.

          3. Have a medical condition or malignancy that requires removal of all or part of one or
             both testicles.

          4. Have newly diagnosed or recurrent disease.

             a) Those who were not enrolled at the time of initial diagnosis (i.e., patients with
             recurrent disease) are eligible if they have not previously received therapy that is
             viewed as likely to result in complete and permanent loss of testicular function.

          5. Have two testicles if undergoing elective removal of a testicle for fertility
             preservation only.

             b) Note: removal of both testicles will limit fertility preservation options.

          6. Fully executed approved informed consent and authorization permitting the release of
             personal health information.

             c) The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized guardian must acknowledge in
             writing that consent for specimen collection has been obtained, in accordance with
             institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

          7. Consent for serum screening tests for infectious diseases [HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B,
             hepatitis C, RDR (syphilis), CMV, HLTV-1, and HTLV-2], to be performed at the time of
             testicular tissue harvesting.

          8. Undergo a full history and physical examination.

          9. Obtain standard pre-operative clearance (based on the most recent ACC/AHA Guideline
             for Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation for Noncardiac Surgery) as determined by
             their primary surgeon.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with psychological, psychiatric, or other conditions which prevent giving
             fully informed consent.

          2. Diagnosed with an underlying medical condition that significantly increases their risk
             of complications from anesthesia and surgery.
