      The primary purpose of this research study is to see whether adding bavituximab (an
      investigational drug) to the standard chemotherapy drug taxane, will improve the results of
      the treatment for early- stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer followed by Standard- of- Care
      surgery

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized trial in patients with early- stage Triple Negative Breast
      Cancer. Patients will be treated with either paciltaxel alone or paclitaxel with bavituximab.
      Paclitaxel will be given weekly, and bavituximab will be given weekly. All therapy will
      continue for up to twelve doses of treatment followed by standard of care definitive surgical
      resection.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         12. Investigational therapy within 28 days prior to Day 1.
