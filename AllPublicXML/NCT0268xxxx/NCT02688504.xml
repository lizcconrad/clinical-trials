    <textblock>
      In France, drugs affecting driving ability directly or by indicating at-risk diseases are
      classified in a 4-level standardized classification associated with a graded pictogram.

      When the French authorities required this graded pictogram, they commissioned the CESIR-U1
      study, a study designed to describe the use of labelled medicines by drivers involved in
      serious road accidents (hospitalization &gt; 24h). This study, conducted in Bordeaux, Limoges
      and Toulouse, recruited 679 drivers involved in serious road accidents. When the
      responsibility of the driver is taken into account, it appears that the association of risk
      factors (alcohol, sleep, ...) and the use of labelled drugs increases this responsibility.
      Even though labelled medicines seemed slightly more at risk than unlabelled ones, this did
      not reach significance.

      This conclusion is different from the conclusion of CESIR-A, a data linkage study of the
      police and the health insurance databases which showed a correlation between the use of grade
      2 or 3 labelled medicines and driver responsibility.

      This difference between CESIR-U and CESIR-A could be related to a lack of power or to the
      characteristics of the subjects included (mostly young men and motorcycle drivers). That is
      why it was thought interesting to increase the size of the sample and to include non serious
      road accidents (hospitalization &lt; 24 hours) that represent around 73% of accidents.

        This study is a multicentre observational study that will include 2 populations: drivers
        involved in serious road accidents (hospitalization &gt; 24 hours) and non-serious road
        accidents (hospitalization &lt; 24 hours). The drivers involved in road accidents and admitted
        in an emergency department will be identified during daily visits (except on week end) by
        Clinical Research Associates (CRA) of the different centres. As soon as possible, a
        structured validated interview will done by a trained CRA.
