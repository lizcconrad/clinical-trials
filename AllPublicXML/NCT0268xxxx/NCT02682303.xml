      Purpose: To report the immediate and prolonged (one week) effects of elastic bandage on
      balance control in subjects with chronic ankle instability.

      Material and methods: Twenty-eight individuals successfully completed the study protocol, of
      whom 14 were randomly assigned to the elastic bandage group (7 men, 7 women) and 14 were
      assigned to the non-standardized tape group ( 9 men, 5 women). To objectively measure
      postural sway we used computerized dynamic posturography with Sensory Organization Test and
      Unilateral Stance test. We analyzed the following Sensory Organization Test parameters: the
      composite Sensory Organization Test score, the composite Sensory Organization Test strategy
      and the Sensory Organization Test condition 2 and its strategy. In addition, we studied the
      centre of gravity sway velocity with open eyes and close eyes during the US test.

    <description>The CDP device employed in this study was Smart Equitest® version 8.2 (NeuroCom International Inc., Clackamas, OR, USA). Posturography analysis was conducted using the SOT. This test assesses postural control through the use of external stimuli on the visual and proprioceptive system.
Participants were instructed to stand on the force-plate facing the visual surround. A safety harness was fixed to prevent injury from falls. Their bare feet position on force-plates was adjusted according to the height of the patient, as marked on the equipment. Subjects had to maintain their COG stable in 3 consecutive series of 20s duration for each of the 6 conditions in the test.</description>

    <description>Elastic bandage
One anchor strip is applied around the ankle with no tension applied to the tape to avoid restricting blood flow. A supporting stirrup strap is applied from the inside of the ankle, under the heel with no tension up to this point. As the tape is passed up the outside of the ankle tension is applied to the tape with the foot in slight dorsiflexion and secured to the anchor strap (black arrow).
For heel lock, a second strip is applied on the outside of the ankle, taken across the front of the ankle and just above the bony part on the inside of the ankle and back towards the heel (red arrow). Then taken around and under the heel back the way you have just come and around the front of the ankle (orange arrow). The tape then passes above the bony part of the ankle on the outside and diagonally towards the heel, across to the inside of the ankle then around the top to finish</description>

    <description>Pretape cramer® was used.
The individual is in supine position keeping the foot and ankle in a neutral position.
The strip (I) is applied with not stretch in the outside of the leg just above the ankle, and then the rest of the strip is applied on the outside of the ankle and under the heel.
This is the only intervention carried out in this group.</description>
