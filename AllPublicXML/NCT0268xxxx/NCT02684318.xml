    <textblock>
      The study will be split into 2 parts: an open label Phase I dose escalation part followed by
      a non-randomized Phase II part, as an expansion study, in patients with selected tumors at
      the recommended doses and schedule determined in the phase I.

      Phase I: A dose escalation study will be performed in patients with advanced or metastatic
      solid tumors without established standard therapeutic alternatives.

      Phase II: An expansion dose study selecting patients with potential tumors with possibly
      sensitivity to PARP inhibitors according to histology, including triple negative breast
      cancer, high grade serous platinum-resistant ovarian and endometrial cancer patients, or
      patients with molecular features such as endometrial cancer with PTEN loss, breast or ovarian
      cancer with PTEN loss, known BRCA1/2 germline, somatic mutation or somatic methylation.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary objectives:

      Phase Ib: To establish the safety [dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and recommended Phase II doses (RP2D)], of orally administered olaparib in combination with
      PM01183 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors without established standard
      therapeutic alternatives.

      Phase II: To assess the efficacy in terms of Tumor response rate according to RECIST v1.1
      criteria of PM01183 in combination with olaparib in the selected populations.

      Secondary objectives

      Phase Ib:

      To explore the pharmacokinetics of PM01183 and olaparib when administered in combination. To
      determine the effects of the study treatment on the level of PARP activity and

      DNA damage in:

        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

        -  Circulating tumor cells (CTC).

        -  Tumor biopsy samples. To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity (overall response
           rate) by RECIST of the combination in the exposed population.

      Phase II:

      Progression free survival. Overall Survival. Toxicity profile of the combination in patients
      enrolled in the study. To explore the possible correlation between the expression of certain
      biomarkers and the efficacy of this therapeutic approach.

      STATISTICAL PROCEDURES

      - Sample size. Justification

      Phase I:

      Between 18-48 patients are expected to participate in the Phase Ib part of the study. The
      number of patients may vary depending upon the tolerability of the combination and the number
      of dose levels required to identify the MTD.

      Phase II:

      A total accrual up to 73 subjects would be required, according to an MinMax two-stages Simon
      design. With an α-error 0.05 and a power 90%, RR with a poor scenario according previous one
      would be 24%, and in a favourable scenario RR would reach 40%.

      Progression-free survival according to previous reported is 3.5 months and the objective for
      the study is 6.5 months (n=56). According to this objective, the maximum sample size is 73
      patients, and first sample size is 61 patients (upper limit for first stage rejection: 18).

      Two stages are established:

        1. In the first step 61 evaluable patients will be included in the study. If 18 or fewer
           responses are observed, the study will be stopped due to an inadequate response rate.

           Efficacy data for the patients included at this first step will be reviewed by an
           independent assessment committee (IAC).

        2. If 19 or more responses are observed recruitment will continue until the group has 73
           evaluable patients. If 23 or fewer responses are detected among these 73 patients, it
           will be concluded that the regimen is not sufficiently active to warrant further
           testing. If 24 or more responses are observed it will be concluded that the regimen is
           sufficiently active to warrant further testing in posterior Phase III.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are
        fulfilled:

          -  For patients included in the phase I of the study, previous treatment with olaparib or
             PM01183. For patients included in the phase II of the study, any previous treatment

             reasons), within 2 weeks from the last dose prior to study treatment (or a longer
             period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). The patient can
             receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates for bone metastases, before and during the

             drug.

          -  Olaparib and PM01183 are metabolized mainly by CYP3A4. Therefore, concomitant use of
             known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketokonazole, itraconazole, telithromycin and
             clarithromycin are forbidden. Concomitant use of known CYP3A4 strong inducers. (See

          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia.

          -  Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence
             of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of

             days prior to treatment.

          -  Major surgery within 14 days of starting study treatment and patients must have
             recovered from any effects of any major surgery. Patients considered a poor medical
             risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant systemic disease
             or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not limited to,
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction,
             unstable spinal cord compression (untreated and unstable for at least 28 days prior to
             study entry), superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on HRCT
             scan or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with

          -  Patients with known active hepatic disease (i.e., Hepatitis B or C) due to risk of
             transmitting the infection through blood or other body fluids.

          -  Patients who present any contraindication or suspected allergy to the products (or any
             of the excipients) under investigation in the study.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures.

          -  For patients included at the phase II part of the study: patients with second primary
             cancer, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated insitu
