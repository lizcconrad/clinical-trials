        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written consent prior to any study-specific evaluation

          2. Males and females aged 18 years to 75 years, inclusive

          3. A clinical diagnosis of secondary Raynaud's Phenomenon (defined as Raynaud's
             Phenomenon (RP) significant enough to cause a patient to modify daily behavior) as
             determined by a history of cold sensitivity with pain, numbness, and/or tingling along
             with pallor or cyanosis of the fingers, or by such an event observed by the study
             physician and a diagnosis of a disease state known to be associated with RP. Secondary
             RP may be due to scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue
             disease, or other connective tissue diseases

          4. Agree to apply the study drug to their fingers as specified in the protocol

          5. Agree to the controlled cold exposures as described in the protocol

          6. Willing to discontinue current vasodilator therapies used specifically for the
             treatment of Raynaud's

          7. Agree not to use any other investigational medications or approved or unapproved
             therapies to treat RP and its symptoms while participating in this study. Such
             medications include, but are not limited to: other dosages forms of nitroglycerin, eg,
             isosorbide dinitrate, fenoldopam mesylate, milrinone lactate, nifedipine, diltiazem,
             felodipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, fluoxetine, pregabalin, and verapamil. Use of
             phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) is excluded
             unless being used intermittently for male erectile dysfunction and not taken within 48
             hours of scheduled study drug dosing

          8. Negative urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential prior to the first
             study treatment and who agree to use effective contraception throughout the study

          9. Able to comply with all study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past history of RP attacks of sufficient severity as to require inpatient
             hospitalization

          2. Presence of an active digital ulcer defined as a painful ulcer with visible depth and
             loss of epithelialization. Ulcers covered with eschar wherein depth and
             epithelialization cannot be judged are said to be &quot;indeterminant&quot; and are not
             exclusionary.

          3. Raynaud's Phenomenon secondary to non-connective tissue disorders including
             thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease), hemorheologic disorders, major
             arterial occlusive disease, past exposure to vasopathic agents (including vinblastine,
             cis platinum, and bleomycin), ongoing therapy with vasoconstrictive agents (eg,
             beta-blockers), and past frostbite injury amongst others. Subjects with hepatitis C
             should also be excluded.

          4. Patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension requiring specific therapy.

          5. Concurrently using any nitrate medication or medications known to interact with
             nitroglycerin such as sildenafil, and other treatments for erectile dysfunction beyond
             screening. Subjects may participate in the study once these drugs have been
             discontinued for at least 5 half-lives

          6. Concurrently using any medication or device which might interfere with the study
             medication (including RP therapies, drugs used for hypertension, arrhythmia,
             depression, and pain), specifically calcium channel blockers and the compounds listed
             in prohibited concomitant medications beyond screening, unless such medication is
             required for a condition other than Raynaud's. Subjects may participate in the study
             once these drugs have been discontinued for at least 5 half-lives.

          7. Known allergy to nitroglycerin or common topical cream ingredients

          8. History of migraine, cluster, or vascular headaches, or chronic pain (defined as pain
             of 3-hour duration or longer on a daily basis) with greater intensity than the pain
             associated with RP or other chronic pain condition in their fingers

          9. Any unstable medical problem or any current medical condition that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would contraindicate the administration of the study medication,
             interfere with the study evaluations, or interfere with the subject's ability to
             comply with the study protocol

         10. Cognitive or language difficulties that would impair completion of the symptom
             assessment instruments

         11. Within the past 3 months, have had a myocardial infarction, uncontrolled congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina, uncontrolled hypotension, or uncontrolled hypertension
             (defined as subjects not being treated medically to control these conditions)

         12. Participated in a study of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to visit 1

         13. Screening laboratory values are 20% or more from the upper or lower limit of normal
             and that are considered to be clinically significant to the investigator

         14. Had major abdominal, thoracic, or vascular surgery within 6 months of visit 1

         15. Pregnant or nursing women

         16. Women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to comply with the
             contraceptive requirements during the study period

         17. History of relevant drug and/or food allergies that resulted in a systemic reaction
             that required medical treatment

         18. History of alcohol abuse or drug addiction which in the estimation of the principal
             investigator would affect the subjects ability to participate in the study

         19. Consumption of alcohol on day before a visit and day of the visit.

         20. Consumption of two or more alcoholic beverages on a daily basis.

         21. Use of tobacco products of any type and at any level in the preceding 6 months and for
             the duration of the study.
