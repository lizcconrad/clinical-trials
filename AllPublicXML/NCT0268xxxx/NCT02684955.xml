  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest remains a leading cause of death, currently affecting &gt;250,000 Europeans
      outside the hospital each year. Manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provides between
      15 to 30 % of normal blood flow to the heart and brain. For out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,
      the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is possible only for 20-40% of patients with
      trained resuscitation teams. However, only 5-10% of patients will survive with good
      neurological status. A good quality CPR, a short time before initiation of the resuscitation
      and a short delay before the first defibrillation have been associated with improved
      neurological outcome. Unfortunately it is currently impossible to obtain reliable information
      on the quality of the perfusion and oxygenation of organs during CPR. The current monitoring
      during CPR is limited to heart rhythm analysis, pulse rate evaluation and end tidal CO2
      (EtCO2). The last one is the only parameter which have been linked with probability of ROSC
      and its value gives no indication of the long-term prognosis nor the neurological status.

      Cerebral spectroscopy (near-infrared spectroscopy - NIRS) allows to measure with a
      noninvasive method the local oxygen saturation of the prefrontal cortex (rSO2), reflecting
      the balance between need and supply of brain oxygenation. This technique has been recently
      used in cardiac arrest showing a possible association between rSO2 measured during CPR and
      the occurrence of ROSC or survival. The quantitative measurement of the pupillary light
      reaction has been described to predict neurological outcome in the hospital for patient
      successfully reanimated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Recently, a feasibility
      study has shown that its use was also possible during CPR in the pre-hospital setting.

      The investigators aim to study a composite prognostic factor combining quantitative rSO2 and
      automated pupillometry measured during CPR. The investigators hypothesized that the rate of
      survival with good neurologic outcome at 30 days will be lower in patients with rSO2 &lt;30% for
      more than 5 min and an absent pupillary reflex more than 5 min or decreasing during CPR .
