  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, non-randomized, multi-center trial, with each site
      following a common protocol in Japan. A maximum of 20 subjects will be implanted at a maximum
      of 10 sites in Japan. The trial will include male and female patients of legal age to provide
      informed consent in Japan, requiring replacement for a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning
      native or prosthetic aortic valve. Patients will be followed and assessed after implant for
      up to 5 years.

         14. Patient has documented bleeding diatheses

         15. Patient has had an acute preoperative neurological deficit or myocardial infarction
             and has not returned to baseline or stabilized ≥30 days prior to enrollment

         16. Patient requires emergency surgery

         17. Patient is in NYHA Class I

         18. Operative Exclusion Criteria:

               -  1.) Prior to attempted implant of MDT-2215 valve, it is identified the patient
                  requires a concomitant procedure not allow per the enrollment exclusion criteria

               -  2.) Patient anatomy is not suitable for implant of a size 17mm MDT-2215 aortic
                  valve bioprosthesis
