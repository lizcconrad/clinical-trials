  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to better understand patterns of recovery after Total
      Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). The study will evaluate how pain, activity and cognitive (i.e.,
      thinking style) responses determine patterns of recovery, and the study will evaluate the
      efficacy of gabapentin versus placebo for improving recovery after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a two-site, longitudinal, double-blind, randomized clinical
      intervention study to examine three specific aims:

      Aim 1: Characterize the dynamic pain experience, activity, and cognitive response after TKA
      and determine patterns of recovery in these domains

      Aim 2: Test whether gabapentin alters time course of recovery after TKA in a manner dependent
      on its interaction with pre-drug pupil diameter and preferred style in the
      catastrophizing-optimism dimension

      Aim 3: Test whether gabapentin increases pupil diameter in patients undergoing TKA who are on
      high dose opioids preoperatively and to examine whether opioid use moderates the associations
      in Aim 1

      Primary Hypothesis: Novel variance beyond established associations in recovery from pain
      following TKA surgery is accounted for by the interaction between pupil diameter and
      Cognitive-Affective (C-A) state, and this interaction predicts efficacy of gabapentin to
      speed recovery.

      Key secondary hypotheses: Disability, impulsivity, and attentional deficits recover after TKA
      surgery follow a log of time pattern, and are predicted by C-A state and its interaction with
      pupil diameter. Gabapentin increases resting pupil diameter in patients scheduled for TKA who
      are receiving high doses of opioids.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized, stratifying for norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitor (NSRI) use, to equal number to receive gabapentin or placebo pills. Drug treatment will begin 2 weeks prior to surgery and continue 3 weeks afterwards. Subjects randomized to gabapentin will receive 900 mg/day for the first week, 1800 mg/day for the next 3 weeks, and 900 mg/day for the last week.</description>
