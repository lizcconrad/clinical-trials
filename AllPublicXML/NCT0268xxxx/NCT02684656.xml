  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The health care burden of CKD is substantial and growing with 10-15% of the population
      affected in both developed and developing countries. It is well established that CKD is
      associated with systemic inflammation, which promotes cardiovascular disease and body
      wasting. However, causal therapies to treat systemic inflammation, and treat its adverse
      consequences remain sparse. As kidney function declines in all forms of CKD, oxalate levels
      increase in the plasma, leading to increased systemic exposure to oxalate and consequent
      tissue injury. Work from the investigators has shown that elevated plasma oxalate levels
      activate the NLRP3 inflammasome which in turn leads to the processing and release of
      cytokines. The investigators seek to test the hypothesis that oxalate contributes to the
      systemic inflammation observed in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The
      investigators plan to define the association between plasma oxalate levels and signs of
      systemic inflammation in patients on hemodialysis. In a second step the investigators will
      examine whether hemodiafiltration lowers plasma oxalate more efficiently than hemodialysis
      and reduces signs of systemic inflammation. Confirmation of the hypothesis may lead to the
      identification of oxalate as a novel therapeutic target for interventional trials aimed at
      reducing plasma oxalate in patients with ESRD.

      The positive interaction between diffusive and convective flux has suggested that
      hemodiafiltration (HDF) has a higher oxalate extraction rate as compared with hemodialysis
      (HD). However, it has not been evaluated whether HDF can lower predialysis oxalate levels
      below the level of supersaturation. By using an intra-individual approach with the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria listed for the study, we plan to determine plasma oxalate and
      cytokine levels in 20 patients (10 on regular duration HD, 10 patients on extended duration
      HD) before dialysis. Subsequently, patients will be switched to HDF and plasma oxalate
      concentration and cytokines will be analyzed again two weeks following HDF treatment. Plasma
      oxalate (Pox) will be measured at beginning of treatment, mid, end and 2 hrs post treatment
      (to determine rebound) in order to provide oxalate kinetics on HD/HDF treatment. Cytokines
      will only be measured pre HD/HDF treatment to assess steady state inflammation.
