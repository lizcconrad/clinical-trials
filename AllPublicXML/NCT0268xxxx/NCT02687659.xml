  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a major public health issue. Prescription of physical activity appears
      necessary in some situation with cardiovascular risk. It is important to both qualify and
      quantify daily physical activity.

      The aim of this project is to evaluate the TEMIS system (based on a smart T-shirt)
      performance in 12 healthy subjects, wearing this system over the daytime during one week.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects have to make different physical activities, wearing the TEMIS system like
      slow and fast walking, biking, running.

    <description>Investigators will during the seven days of the protocol, when the system TEMIS is hold, evaluate the concordance between the activity really performed by the subject (questionnaire) and the activity calculated by the TEMIS System (Kappa test). Investigators will evaluate the following activity:
lying position, sitting position, standing position, walking activity, running activity, bicycle activity, use of a vehicle (car, bus)</description>
