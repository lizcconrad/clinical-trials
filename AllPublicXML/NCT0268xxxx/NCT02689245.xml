    <textblock>
      Data for stool microbiome will be collected for all the chronic hepatitis B subjects (pre
      cirrhotic,compensated,decompensated and reactivation). All the in and out patient with
      Hepatitis B reactivation will be recruited and randomized into two arms.

      Group 1 Tenofovir Group 2 Tenofovir with FMT (Fecal Microbiota Transplant).

      Tenofovir would be given 300 mg once daily FMT through NJ (Naso-Jejunal) tube for 7 days.
