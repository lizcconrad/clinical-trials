  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder problems cause substantial disability in daily living, work, leisure activity, and
      exercise. The presence of shoulder problem such as rotator cuff pathology reported was highly
      predictive of impaired health-related quality of life.

      Many tests were used for physical examination of the shoulder. The reliability and validity
      of the tests have been studied before. However, a systemic review concluded that there was
      conflicting evidence in reliability of each or combined tests. Functional examination of the
      shoulder by Cyriax is composed of a series of tests to evaluate a shoulder problem. It
      includes three arm elevation, three tests for glenohumeral joints, and six resisted tests.

      As far as the investigators know, correlation of Cyriax functional examination with the
      ultrasonographic findings has never been reported before. Therefore, the aim of this study is
      to compare the clinical diagnosis by Cyriax's functional examination with ultrasound findings
      in patients with shoulder pain.

      There are two groups with fifty patients in each group. First group is patients who have
      unilateral or bilateral shoulder pain from the outpatient clinic of Department of Physical
      Medicine and Rehabilitation in Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital. The other group is
      control group who has no shoulder problems. Both groups will receive Cyriax's functional
      examination of the shoulder after history taking, and will be examined by shoulder ultrasound
      in one week.
