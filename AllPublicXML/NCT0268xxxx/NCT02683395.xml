      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
      and preliminary efficacy of the investigational drug PLX51107 in subjects with advanced solid
      tumors (including lymphoma), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or high-risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS).

          -  Adequate organ function as demonstrated by the following laboratory values (collected
             within 10 days of treatment initiation) and as appropriate for the disease under

             metastases within 30 days of Screening.)

             blast crisis

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agent or any agent given in

             who require anti-arrhythmic therapy (excluding beta blockers or digoxin). Subjects
             with controlled atrial fibrillation are not excluded.

          -  Congenital long QT syndrome or subjects taking concomitant medications known to
             prolong the QT interval except treatment required for infections with a low risk of
             QTc prolongation.
