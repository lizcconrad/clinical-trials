      Evaluation of safety and performance of the SPINNER device and wound dressing in the
      treatment of donor-site wounds (DSW)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SPINNER is a hand held, portable electro-spinning device that produces personalized
      in-situ nanofiber dressings for the treatment of external burns and wounds.

      The dressing has non-adherence, high absorbance, bacterial protection, easy and pain-free
      peel characteristics and shows excellent conformability and optimal coverage of the wound.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the SPINNER device
      and wound dressing in the treatment of donor-site wounds (DSW) at size of 10-200 cm2.

      The study will include four sites in Israel:

      Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba Kaplan Medical Center,
      Rehovot Souraski Medical Center, Tel Aviv

      Study primary endpoints:

        1. Dermal Safety

        2. Wound healing and time to complete re-epithelialization at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days
           post operation

      Study secondary endpoints:

        1. Ease of use

        2. Pain assessment at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days post operation

        3. Infection assessment from 3 days post operation up to 21 days

        4. Device related adverse events of the SPINNER device and wound dressing

      Extended exploratory follow up:

      Assessment of itching and scarring from wound closure time and up to 12 months follow up with
      an optional further examination at 24 months.
