  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease concerns some defects in carbohydrates metabolism involved in the
      progress of the pathology. Ketogenic diet has been largely studied as treatment on
      drug-resistant epilepsy and other neurologic diseases, but there is little information on the
      impact of this kind of diet in clinical aspects of Parkinson's disease. The aim of our study
      is thus to evaluate the effect of a lipid and protein controlled diet on resting energy
      expenditure, body composition and symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.
