  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is one of the most common obstetrical medical procedures performed today.
      Iatrogenic stimulation of uterine contractions prior to the onset of spontaneous labor is
      undertaken for various maternal and fetal indications and spans 20% of deliveries today.

        1. During the past years there has been an additional rise due to elective inductions

        2. Induction is undertaken when potential risks of prolonging pregnancy outweigh the risks
           of induced delivery, particularly those associated with post-term pregnancy, rupture of
           membranes, oligohydramnios and additional fetal and maternal conditions that pose risks
           to mother and fetus.

      In many circumstances of women with an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score of 7 or less)
      sequential induction with more than one agent is necessary. To date, no trial has compared
      the optimal subsequent ripening method after the preliminary use of dinoprostone
      (prostaglandin E2). In this trial investigators aim to compare the obstetrical outcomes of
      subsequent induction in women admitted for induction of labor with Bishop score &lt;7 or less 24
      hours after the insertion of vaginal prostaglandin insert (Propess). Two methods of routine
      induction of labor will be compared: An additional Propess induction for another 24 hours vs.
      intravenous oxytocin infusion combined with intra-cervical balloon insertion.

Eligibility assessment
Explanation regarding the study protocol
Signed informed consent (at VAS&lt;3)
Women agreeing to continued induction of labor 24 hours after insertion of Propess, will be randomized using sealed envelopes to the subsequent method of induction of labor (additional vaginal insert vs. oxytocin infusion with intracervical balloon insertion with 60ml saline). Treatment will be given according to the pre-existing and approved departmental protocol. The protocol for oxytocin infusion is 4 units of Pitocin in 10 cc 0.9% NaCl, infused at a rate of 0.4 ml/hour. Infusion rate will be increased every 20 minutes until 3-4 contractions every 10 minutes are produced.
Follow up on all women will be performed from the time of second agent induction until discharge from hospital postpartum.</description>
