  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this pilot study is to make a first assessment of the discriminating
      ability of a dosage of S100B protein for differential diagnosis between primary headaches and
      secondary headaches.

      For this, the investigators will compare serum S100B protein between two groups of headache
      patients presenting at the emergency department: 1 group of primary headache patients and 1
      group of secondary headache patients.

      If the difference between the two groups proves potentially discriminating, the investigators
      will seek to determine the discriminating ability of the S100B protein by calculating the
      area under the ROC curve.

      The reference diagnostic will be set at one month across the entire clinical picture and
      imaging by an expert committee composed of a neurologist, a radiologist and an emergency
      physician.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To seek an association between S100B protein levels and the onset of pain depending on
      whether it is more or less than 3 hours.

      B. To assess the association between S100B protein levels and mortality at day 28.

      C. To evaluate the association between S100B protein levels and hospital care: average length
      of stay in the emergency department, lumbar puncture, brain imaging, average length of
      hospital stay.

      D. To evaluate the prognostic value of determination of S100B protein on the occurrence of a
      secondary headache at 1 month.
