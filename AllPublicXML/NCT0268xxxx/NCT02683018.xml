  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of cannabis for severe medical conditions is being legalized in different states,
      increasing the mandate to make cannabis legal for medically ill patients. However, there is a
      lack of placebo-controlled studies investigating the efficacy of cannabis. Dronabinol
      (synthetic, oral Δ-9-THC) is FDA approved for the appetite stimulation in AIDS-related
      anorexia and nausea/vomiting in chemotherapy patients. Nabilone, a synthetic analogue of THC,
      is approved for nausea/vomiting in chemotherapy patients. These medications have been found
      to be effective for these disorders, but there remains an interest in studying cannabis,
      partly due to the numerous cannabinoids contained within the cannabis plant. Among these is
      cannabidiol, which does not produce subjective effects, but has been shown to have potent
      anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, there is data indicating that cannabidiol may be
      effective for neuropathic pain and nausea/vomiting.

      The goal is to investigate the effects of high CBD/low THC cannabis on symptoms such as pain,
      nausea/vomiting, and quality of life in seriously ill participants. While there is data
      beginning to emerge that cannabis may have a beneficial effect on these symptoms, there are
      few placebo controlled, double-blind studies. Additionally, the administration of cannabis to
      medically ill patients may be limited by its subjective effects, such as anxiety,
      intoxication, or paranoia. Most cannabis available today has high levels of Δ-9-THC (about
      15%). By using cannabis that is high in CBD, but low in - Δ-9-THC, it is hypothesized that
      some of these effects can be avoid, while maximizing the therapeutic effects, if any.

      The goal of this study is to perform a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate
      the efficacy of cannabis, compared to placebo, in medically ill participants seeking relief
      symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting. Participants who meet criteria for severe
      conditions will be referred from their clinicians . Cannabis that has a high concentration of
      cannabidiol, which is a cannabinoid that does not change perception or produce intoxication,
      and low in Δ-9-THC will be used. In this way, the hope is to maximize the benefit of
      cannabis, while lowering the possible side effects of cannabis in medically ill participants.

      The overall goal of this study is to compare active high cannabidiol (CBD)/ low (−)-trans-Δ9-
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) cannabis vs placebo cannabis in patients with serious medical
      disorders. Participants will be referred from clinicians and will come to the laboratory
      daily (3-5 times weekly) for cannabis (15.76% CBD; 3.11% Δ-9-THC) vs placebo (0.0% CBD/ 0.01%
      Δ-9-THC). The cannabis will be vaporized or smoked as a cannabis cigarette. The participants
      can choose which option they prefer. The cross-over design will be used where participants
      receive 2 weeks of active cannabis vs two weeks of placebo in counterbalanced order, with
      participants blinded to the condition. The outcome measures primarily include measures of
      pain, with secondary measures of mood, nausea/appetite, quality of life, and the both the
      potentially positive and negative subjective effects of cannabis (e.g., high, mellow,
      anxious, paranoid).
