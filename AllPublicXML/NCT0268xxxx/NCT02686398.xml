  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the 2013-2014 influenza season, CKD patients undergoing HD participated in the study.
      The patients were randomized into two groups (MF59-adjuvanted vaccine group or non-adjuvanted
      vaccine group) and were immunized with the respective vaccine. Sera were collected prior to
      vaccination and at 1and 6 months post vaccination. Levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
      antibodies were measured.
