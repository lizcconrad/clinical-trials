      In women with first trimetric-missed miscarriage, sublingual misoprostol may be as vaginal
      misoprostol in achievement of successful miscarriage so our aim was to compare the
      effectiveness of vaginal versus sub-lingual misoprostol for medical treatment of first
      trimester missed miscarriage.
