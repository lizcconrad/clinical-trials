    <textblock>
      Successfully develop and confirm with the Higher School of Electronics West Plethysmographic
      a multichannel recorder to perform measurements staggered volume of the lower limbs at rest,
      walking and recovery (6 storied measures on members lower).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Validate the measurement made by EAP (Electroactive polymer) during walking tests in venous
      insufficient subjects and healthy subjects by comparing the measurement made by the reference
      technique by mercury gauge.
