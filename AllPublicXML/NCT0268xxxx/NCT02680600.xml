  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several population pharmacokinetic (PK) models for cefepime in critically ill patients have
      been described, all indicating that variability in renal clearance is the main determinant of
      observed variability in exposure. The main objective of this study was hence to determine
      which renal marker best predicts cefepime clearance.

    <textblock>
      Timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy, sufficient to guarantee adequate antibiotic
      concentrations in blood and tissues, is one of the most important interventions in critically
      ill patients with infections.1,2 Cefepime is a fourth generation cephalosporin with broad
      spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria that is used as empirical and directed
      therapy for severe infections like sepsis and pneumonia. Nevertheless, administration of
      adequate antibiotic doses is a real challenge in critically ill patients because the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of these drugs may be influenced by the complex pathophysiological
      changes that occur during sepsis.2 Recent reviews described the enormous pharmacokinetic
      variability of beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients.3,4 Therefore, strategies
      for dose individualization are explored in an attempt to better control a patient's exposure
      to the antibiotic, thereby potentially improving the prognosis of critically ill patients
      with infection. On the one hand, several smaller studies have already shown that better
      outcomes for critically ill patients can be expected with higher drug exposures, at least for
      less severely ill patients.5,6 This conclusion was supported by the DALI study, a large
      multi-center prospective study.7 On the other hand, it was shown that insufficient antibiotic
      exposure may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.8 This link was initially shown
      with inappropriately low quinolone exposures, but more recently with other classes of
      antibiotics including beta-lactams.9,10 In addition to ensuring that plasma levels are high
      enough for optimal antimicrobial activity and suppressing emergence of resistance,
      individualized dosing might offer a perspective to prevent potential side-effects originating
      from toxic plasma levels. This seems particularly relevant for cefepime, a beta-lactam
      antibiotic, as it was shown that cefepime is an underappreciated cause of neurotoxicity,
      especially in intensive care unit (ICU) patients,11,12 patients with impaired renal
      function,13-16 and patients with brain disorders.17 Population pharmacokinetic models provide
      a quantitative view of the effect of particular individual factors on the plasma
      concentration time profile of a drug. Population PK models thereby help to establish
      individual treatment regimen in patients, depending on the specific patient covariates that
      were included in the model. As cefepime is a hydrophilic compound, drug elimination is mainly
      determined by renal clearance and to a lesser extent by non-renal clearance. Therefore, renal
      markers have been explored as the main determinant to predict cefepime variability in
      population PK models.18-24 However, none of the published PK models was developed using both
      plasma and urinary data, though having access to both matrices may be an advantage to
      identify clinically relevant covariates. Moreover, only creatinine-based markers were used as
      covariates and, up to now, it was unclear whether the newer markers to assess renal function
      (e.g. cystatine C, uromodulin and Kidney Injury Moleclure-1 (KIM-1)) are more accurate to
      predict cefepime clearance.

      In this study, a clinical trial was conducted to develop a population PK model for cefepime
      in critically ill patients assessing renal and non-renal clearance separately, based on both
      plasma and urinary cefepime concentrations. This model then served as a tool to compare the
      adequacy of six different renal markers as predictors for renal cefepime clearance. After
      integrating the most adequate predictor into the PK model, the final model was used to
      evaluate current dose recommendations for cefepime.

From day two onwards, samples will be taken at the end of the infusion and just before the next dose.

    <description>Creatinine (modified Jaffe method) and urea in serum will be determined using an Architect c16000 analyzer (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA). Cystatin C will be determined using a particle-enhanced immunonephelometric assay (N Latex Cystatin C, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany) by use of a BN II nephelometer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). This assay has a calibration traceable to the first certified reference material for cystatin C in human serum (ERM-DA471/IFCC). Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) in urine and uromodulin in serum will be determined using commercially available ELISA assays: Quantikine ELISA Human TIM-1/KIM-1/HAVCR (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Uromodulin ELISA (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany), respectively.</description>

    <description>The cefepime concentration versus time data will be fitted using the FOCE-I estimation algorithm in NONMEM® (Version 7.3; GloboMax LLC, Hanover, MD, USA). R® (R foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used to graphically assess the model's goodness-of-fit and to evaluate the model's predictive capabilities. As a measure of prediction error, the absolute prediction error (APE) will be used. In short, the measured cefepime concentrations for each individual i at time point j were compared against the population predicted cefepime concentrations, i.e. the predictions for each individual without taking into account the between-subject variability (PRED in NONMEM). The distribution of APEs will be summarized by the median and 90% percentile.</description>
