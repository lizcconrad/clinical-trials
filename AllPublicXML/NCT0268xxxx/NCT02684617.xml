  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) used in combination with dinaciclib (MK-7965) in the treatment of
      relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (rrCLL), multiple myeloma (rrMM), or
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (rrDLBCL) in up to 138 participants from multiple sites.

      During an initial Dose Evaluation phase (first 2 cycles) to determine Dose Limiting
      Toxicities (DLTs), dose combinations of pembrolizumab 200 mg followed by dinaciclib 7 mg/m^2,
      pembrolizumab 200 mg followed by dinaciclib 10 mg/m^2, and pembrolizumab 200 mg followed by
      dinaciclib 14 mg/m^2 will be evaluated. Following safety review of the Dose Evaluation Phase,
      approximately 30 participants each will be enrolled in rrCLL, rrMM, or DLBCL cohorts during
      the Signal Detection phase. For each disease type objective response rate (ORR) will be
      determined by disease specific criteria.

      The rrMM cohort was closed to enrollment on 07-AUG-2017 due to lack of efficacy.

    <description>During the Dose Evaluation phase of the study, 12 participants will receive an infusion of pembrolizumab 200 mg followed by infusion of dinaciclib 7mg/m^2 on Cycle 1 Day 1 and infusion of dinaciclib 10 mg/m^2 alone on Cycle 1 Day 8. Participants will then receive an infusion of pembrolizumab 200 mg followed by infusion of dinaciclib 14mg/m^2 on Day 1 and infusion of dinaciclib 14mg/m^2 alone on Day 8 on Cycles 2 through 35. The study design will be revised based on the number of DLTs in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. If ≤4 DLTs occur, 30 participants per disease type will be enrolled in the Signal Detection Phase. If &gt;5 DLTs occur, a lower dose will be evaluated in up to 24 additional participants.</description>
