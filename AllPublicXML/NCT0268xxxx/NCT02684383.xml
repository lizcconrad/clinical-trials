    <textblock>
      Infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children
      in many tropical Asian countries, and the development of a dengue vaccine is a top health
      priority. This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated
      monovalent dengue virus vaccine (rDEN3Δ30) in healthy adults with no history of previous
      flavivirus infection.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated
      monovalent dengue virus vaccine (rDEN3Δ30) in healthy flavivirus-naive adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the rDEN3Δ30 vaccine or placebo at Day 0.
      Study visits will occur on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 180. Visits
      will include physical examinations and blood collection. All participants will record their
      temperature 3 times a day from Day 0 through Day 16. Some participants may be admitted to the
      clinic for an inpatient (overnight) stay during the first 16 days of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male or female between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Good general health as determined by physical examination, laboratory screening, and
             review of medical history.

          -  Available for the duration of the study, approximately 26 weeks post-vaccination.

          -  Willingness and availability for potential inpatient admission in the inpatient unit
             following receipt of rDEN3Δ30.

          -  Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent
             document.

          -  Females Only: Female subjects of childbearing potential willing to use effective
             contraception beginning long enough before dosing to ensure method specific efficacy
             for the duration of the trial. Reliable methods of contraception include hormonal
             birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical
             sterilization, intrauterine device, and abstinence (greater than or equal to 6 months
             since last sexual encounter). All female subjects will be considered having
             childbearing potential except for those with hysterectomy, tubal ligation, tubal coil
             (at least 3 months prior to vaccination), or post-menopausal status documented as at
             least 1 year since last menstrual period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females Only: Currently pregnant, as determined by positive beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (HCG) test, or breastfeeding.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic,
             rheumatologic, autoimmune, or renal disease by history, physical examination, and/or
             laboratory studies.

          -  Behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the investigator
             affects the ability of the subject to understand and cooperate with the requirements
             of the study protocol.

          -  Confirmed screening laboratory values of Grade 1 or above for absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum creatinine, as defined in this
             protocol. Confirmation will be obtained by repeating the test to ensure the abnormal
             value was not due to aberrancy.

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the
             safety or rights of a subject participating in the trial or would render the subject
             unable to comply with the protocol.

          -  Any significant alcohol or drug abuse in the past 12 months that has caused medical,
             occupational or family problems, as indicated by subject history.

          -  History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.

          -  Severe asthma (emergency room visit or hospitalization within the last 6 months).

          -  HIV infection, by screening and confirmatory assays.

          -  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, by screening and confirmatory assays.

          -  Use of anticoagulant medications.

          -  Use of corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or immunosuppressive drugs within
             28 days prior to or following vaccination. Immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids
             is defined as greater than or equal to 10 mg prednisone equivalent per day for greater
             than or equal to 14 days.

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 28 days or a killed vaccine within the 14 days prior
             to vaccination or anticipated receipt of any vaccine during the 28 days following
             vaccination.

          -  Asplenia.

          -  Receipt of blood products within the past 6 months, including transfusions or
             immunoglobulin or anticipated receipt of any blood products or immunoglobulin during
             the 28 days following vaccination.

          -  History or serologic evidence of previous dengue virus infection or other flavivirus
             infection (e.g., yellow fever virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, or West Nile
             virus).

          -  Previous receipt of a flavivirus vaccine (licensed or experimental).

          -  Known allergy to antipyretics.

          -  Refusal to allow storage of specimens for future research.

        Other Treatments and Ongoing Exclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria will be reviewed on days 28 and 56 post-vaccination. If any become
        applicable during the study, then the subject will not be included in further
        immunogenicity evaluations, as of the exclusionary visit. The subject will, however, be
        encouraged to remain in the study for safety evaluations for the duration of the study.

        Ongoing Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational drug or investigational vaccine other than the study
             vaccine during the 28-day period post-vaccination.

             prednisone equivalent of greater than or equal to 10 mg per day), immunosuppressants,
             or other immune-modifying drugs initiated during the 28-day period post-vaccination
             (topical and nasal steroids are allowed).

          -  Receipt of a licensed vaccine during the 28-day period post vaccination.

          -  Receipt of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the 28-day period post
