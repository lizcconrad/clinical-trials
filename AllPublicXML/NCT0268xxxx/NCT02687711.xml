    <textblock>
      Study is the first study after commercialization of brivaracetam. It is designed to collect
      real world information on the effectiveness of brivaracetam in patients with Partial Onset
      Seizure epislepsy who are treated in standard clinical practice.

      EP0077 is a 12 months, multicenter, noninterventional study (NIS) conducted at specialized
      sites in approximately 10 European countries. Patients will be treated according to usual
      medical diagnostic procedures and therapy; commercially available brivaracetam will be
      prescribed according to normal clinical practice and the current Summary of Product
      Characteristics (SmPC) in Europe for brivaracetam (BRV). The prescription of BRV is clearly
      separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or
      monitoring procedures are applied to the patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine BRV retention over a 12 month period as a
      measure of effectiveness in a real world setting. The secondary objective of this study is to
      assess seizure control with BRV treatment.

        Patients (male or female ≥16 years of age) with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy with
        Partial Onset Seizures with or without secondary generalization. The patients have never
        been treated with brivaracetam and the decision by the treating physician (neurologists) to
        prescribe brivaracetam is made independently of the participation in the study and prior to

        to the current SmPC in Europe. Patient is using a seizure diary as part of their standard
        of care.
