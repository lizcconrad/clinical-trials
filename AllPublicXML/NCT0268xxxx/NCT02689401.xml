  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a new imaging method using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
      to evaluate lymph nodes for evidence of tumor spread from esophageal cancer. This MRI study
      involves an intravenous contrast called Ferumoxytol (FerahemeTM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot clinical trial, which is the first time investigators are
      examining this study intervention.

      This study tests the safety of the investigational intervention (MRI imaging with
      Ferumoxytol) and assesses the feasibility of identifying malignant lymph nodes (lymph nodes
      that have tumor in them) by comparing the experimental MRI findings with the final pathology
      report from surgery.

      This iron-based agent currently has approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for use in iron replacement therapy, however, its use in MRI imaging is not FDA-approved and
      is thus experimental in this trial.

    <description>Feasibility is determined by the ability of the radiologist to identify esophageal associated lymph nodes and which ones may be metastatic based on the uptake of ferumoxytol. Positive nodes are identified by the radiologist based on altered signal in those with ferumoxytol uptake compared to the signal normal lymph nodes on MRI</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants may have histologically confirmed esophageal cancer or lesion suspicious
             for esophageal cancer which is deemed surgically resectable.

          -  Patients eligible for the trial may have previously completed neoadjuvant
             chemoradiation per standard protocols prior to MRI imaging, without any limitations on
             dose, duration or type of prior treatment as this is not the focus of the current
             study.

          -  Eligible patients must be 18 years or older in order to consent for this trial.
             Individuals under the age of 18 are excluded because safety studies including dosing
             or adverse event data in this population are currently not available.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known allergies or hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iron,
             parenteral dextran, parenteral iron-dextran, or parenteral iron-polysaccharides

          -  Individuals who are pregnant or lactating. As part of their routine preoperative
             testing, all women of child bearing age receive a pregnancy test. The research staff
             will follow up on these results in order to determine eligibility. Women who have had
             a hysterectomy or have not had menses for &gt; 24 months will not be required to undergo
             a pregnancy test. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because there is unknown
             risk associated with Ferumoxytol (US FDA Risk Category C: there are no controlled
             studies in women, or no studies are available in either animals or women). Because
             there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding women will be excluded from this study

          -  Iron saturation above the upper limit of normal

          -  Individuals with known clinical conditions that may lead to iron overload including
             hemochromatosis, cirrhosis, or sickle cell disease

          -  Individuals with a contraindication to MRI, such as the presence of metallic
             prostheses or implanted metal device (e.g. infusion pump, defibrillator)
