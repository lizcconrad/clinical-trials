  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate canagliflozin use in the treatment of type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and generate evidence of its effectiveness, safety and
      patient-reported outcome (PRO) in a usual clinical practice in Canada.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, nation-wide, multicenter (more than one study
      site) study to evaluate the treatment of T2DM with canagliflozin in a usual clinical practice
      in Canada. Approximately 535 participants will be enrolled into this study. The planned study
      duration for each participant will be 12 months [plus or minus (+/-) 4 weeks], including 4
      study visits in accordance with the usual clinical practice: enrollment and visits at 3, 6
      and 12 months (+/- 4 weeks). Participants will primarily be observed for effectiveness,
      safety and PRO over an observational period of 12 months.

        physicians.
