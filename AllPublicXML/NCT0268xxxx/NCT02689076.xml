      Among older VA patients who have Medicare coverage, 43% use both VA and non-VA
      (Medicare-covered) services. VA and non-VA providers are often uninformed about encounters,
      treatments and test results provided in the other system. The overall objective of this
      project is to examine the impact of VA provider notification of non-VA hospitalization or
      emergency department (ED) visit using electronic health information exchange (HIE), along
      with provision of post-hospital care coordination services. The investigators will examine
      the impact of these approaches on preventing hospital readmission, increasing provider
      follow-up, improving patient's self-knowledge, and preventing medication errors. The
      investigators will also examine the effect of these approaches on VA and non-VA costs.
      Finally the investigators will examine the acceptance of these approaches among VA and non-VA
      providers. The study sample will consist of Veterans followed in geriatrics or primary care
      clinics at the Bronx and Indianapolis VAs who are older than 65. The investigators will
      monitor patients for non-VA hospital admission or ED visit using technology provided by
      health information exchange organizations. Patients will be assigned to enhanced or control
      treatment groups. For both groups the VA provider will receive an electronic notification of
      a non-VA hospital admission or ED visit if it occurs. For the enhanced group, a care
      transitions coordinator will deliver post-hospital coordination services during a home and/or
      VA facility visit and follow-up phone calls over 1 month. The investigators' analyses will
      compare effects of notification-plus-coordination versus notification-only on health care
      outcomes. The investigators will conduct interviews with intervention team members, patients,
      VA and non-VA staff, and other stakeholders to ascertain the barriers and facilitators to
      implementation of these approaches.

      Background: Among older VA patients who have Medicare coverage, 43% use both VA and non-VA
      (Medicare-covered) services. VA and non-VA providers are often uninformed about encounters,
      treatments and test results provided in the other system. In particular, the absent or
      delayed notification of a non-VA hospital encounter is a missed opportunity for the VA to
      provide post-hospital transitional care services that have been shown to be effective in
      preventing adverse events and hospital readmission after hospital discharge.

      Objectives: The overall objective of this project is to examine the effectiveness, cost, and
      implementation acceptance of VA provider notification of non-VA hospitalization or emergency
      department (ED) visit using electronic health information exchange (HIE), with or without
      provision of evidence-based post-hospital transitional care services. Specific Aim 1 is to
      examine the impact of these approaches on preventing hospital admission or readmission as the
      primary outcome, and, as secondary outcomes, increasing provider follow-up, improving
      patient's condition self-knowledge, and preventing medication errors after discharge.
      Specific Aim 2 is to examine the effect of these approaches on VA and non-VA costs. Specific
      Aim 3 is to examine the acceptance of these approaches among VA and non-VA stakeholders.

      Methods: The study sample consists of Veterans followed in geriatrics or primary care clinics
      at the Bronx and Indianapolis VAs who are older than 65. The investigators will monitor
      patients for non-VA hospital admission or ED visit using technology provided by regional HIE
      organizations (i.e., the Bronx Regional Health Information Organization and the Indiana
      Health Information Exchange). Patients will be cluster-randomized 1:1 to
      notification-plus-coordination or notification-only groups by PACT team, stratified by
      facility. For both groups the PACT provider will receive real-time notification of a non-VA
      hospital admission or ED visit if it occurs. For the notification-plus-coordination group, a
      care transitions coordinator will deliver coordination activities during a home and/or VA
      facility visit and via follow-up phone calls over 1 month. Coordination activities will
      consist of: reconciliation of and counseling on the patient's VA and non-VA medications,
      education on signs of condition worsening, coordination of VA and non-VA follow-up
      appointments, and counseling on communicating with VA and non-VA providers, using structured
      protocols. All information-gathering by the transitions coordinator will include the HIE as
      an information source. The notification-only group will receive usual care after the
      notification. Multivariable regression models will be estimated to compare effects of
      notification-plus-coordination versus notification-only on primary and secondary outcomes and
      costs (Aims 1 and 2). The investigators will conduct interviews with intervention team
      members, patients, VA and non-VA staff, and other stakeholders to ascertain the barriers and
      facilitators to implementation of these approaches (Aim 3).

    <description>A measure of condition self-knowledge and transitional care quality from the patient's perspective is ascertained by patient or caregiver interview 30 days after non-VA hospital discharge. The investigators will use an adapted 3-item version which includes items such as: &quot;After I left the hospital, I had all the information I needed to be able to take care of myself&quot; with the response options strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree, and don't know. The investigators chose to use the 3-item rather than a 15-item version as the shorter instrument demonstrates excellent correlation with the longer version but with lower respondent burden.</description>
