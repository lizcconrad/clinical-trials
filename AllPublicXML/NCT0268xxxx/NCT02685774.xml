      This study is a randomized, open-label, single dose, 2-way crossover study to compare the
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of CKD-395 0.25/500 mg in healthy male volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To healthy male subjects of twenty six(26), following treatments are administered dosing in
      each period fed condition(high fat meals) and wash-out period is a minimum of 7 days.

      Treatment A(Reference Drug): DuvieTM Tab. 0.5mg 1T + Glucophage XR Tab. 500mg 2T Treatment
      B(Test Drug): CKD-395 0.25/750mg Tab. 2T

      Pharmacokinetic blood samples are collected up to 48hrs. Safety and pharmacokinetic are
      assessed.
