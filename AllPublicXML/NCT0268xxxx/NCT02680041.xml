      This prospective study will enroll up to 330 men with PSA-persistent or PSA-recurrent
      prostate cancer after curative-intent primary therapy and negative or equivocal findings on
      standard-of-care imaging. Consenting participants will be imaged with 18F-fluciclovine
      PET/CT. Site clinicians will manage study subjects per standard practices and will document
      any change in treatment based on review of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT findings. All participants
      will be followed for up to 6 months, with clinical data collected for this study. An
      interdisciplinary panel will provide expert guidance to local readers on request. The final
      reporting of the PET/CT scan will be a single report by the local reader following any such
      discussion.

             and either CT or MRI of the pelvis (or the abdomen and pelvis).

          -  Being considered for salvage therapy

          -  Any non-surgical local treatment such as previous cryotherapy, external beam
             radiation, or HiFU (Ultrasound) must have occurred at least 1 year in the past.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing treatment with any systemic therapy intended for the treatment of prostate
             cancer (e.g., antiandrogen or LHRH agonist or antagonist)

          -  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the past 3 months

          -  History of bilateral orchidectomy
