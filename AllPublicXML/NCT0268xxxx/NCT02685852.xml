      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of exenatide in adults experiencing
      episodes of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia following Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) is one of the most common bariatric surgeries in the
      United States and is generally highly effective for weight loss. Unfortunately, among the
      potential complications is hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Though the prevalence of this
      disorder has not been fully characterized, it can be associated with debilitating symptoms
      which severely impact quality of life and can be life-threatening. The underlying
      pathophysiology of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia likely involves a mismatch in the amount of
      insulin secreted in response to mealtime carbohydrate absorption. It has been observed that
      the ingestion of a high carbohydrate load often leads to a modest rise in post-prandial
      glucose levels followed by an inappropriately exaggerated insulin release among individuals
      with this condition. Low carbohydrate diet sometimes provides full or partial relief of the
      symptoms.

      Standard medical management for RYGB associated postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
      includes acarbose, which partially reduces carbohydrate absorption from the gut, and
      diazoxide, which directly inhibits insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. However, the
      medical options are not reliably effective, leading some individuals to reverse RYGB, which
      also may not be effective, or even undergo partial pancreatectomy, risking additional
      complications such as diabetes. Much more reliably effective treatments are needed for this
      special population who develop this bariatric surgical complication.

      Potential mechanisms contributing to the mismatched insulin secretion post RYGB include
      decreased systemic and adipose tissue inflammation, and increased insulin receptor expression
      in liver and skeletal muscle, and increases in adiponectin.
