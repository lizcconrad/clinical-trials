  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acinetobacter species have emerged as agents of serious nosocomial infections in critically
      ill patients. Only a few effective antibiotics are currently available for the treatment of
      this pathogen and, therefore, sulbactam is being considered as an alternative treatment
      option. The aims of this study were to i) reveal the population pharmacokinetics and ii)
      assess the probability of target attainment (PTA) of sulbactam in septic critically ill
      patients caused by Acinetobacter spp. infections.

      The study was conducted in septic critically ill patients caused by Acinetobacter spp. Each
      patient received 2 g every 12 h of sulbactam for 10 days, after which PK studies were carried
      out on day 4 of sulbactam therapy and a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the
      probability of attaining a specific pharmacodynamic target.
