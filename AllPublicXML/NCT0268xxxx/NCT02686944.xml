  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective single armed, open label phase I study. Patients with advanced or
      metastatic GIST and tumor progression despite ongoing treatment with second, third or fourth
      line TKI treatment, and with at least one measureable tumor lesion, will be eligible for the
      study. A maximum of 12 patients will be included in this study. The patients will continue
      with TKI treatment until the 3 months follow up visit. If further tumor progression TKI will
      be withdrawn but if stable disease or objective response the patient will continue with TKI
      until progress. The investigational product Intuvax will be injected into a tumor lesion at
      two or three treatment occasions; day 1, 14 days (±3 days) after the first vaccination, and
      28 days (±3 days) after the second vaccination (patient 7-12 only). Intuvax will be injected
      in a viable part of the tumor, using ultrasound-guided or CT technique for correct
      administration.
