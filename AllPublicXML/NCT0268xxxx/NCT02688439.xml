  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the leg positioning or distal
      tourniquet used during the injection of local anesthetic may decrease the onset time and
      prolong the duration of analgesia of ultrasound-guided Sciatic Nerve Block (SNB) with
      popliteal approach. Patients will be divided randomly into three groups: group 1 will receive
      sciatic nerve block, with leg kept in a neutral position after anesthesia (control group);
      group 2 will receive the same anesthesia, with leg raised 30° by placing the back of the foot
      over a support placed on the OR table and maintained in that position for 15 min; and
      patients in group 3 will receive the same anesthesia, and distal tourniquet placed on the
      lower part of the leg (upper part of the tourniquet being about 4-6 inches from the ankle)
      with the leg in a neutral position
