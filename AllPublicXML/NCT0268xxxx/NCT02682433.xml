  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine cavity diseases can cause mild to severe symptoms, and may indicate the functional
      problems of the female reproductive system. Many articles examine the efficacy of diagnostic
      hysteroscopy compared to sonohysterography in the diagnosis of uterine cavity diseases. Most
      of the articles are from the last decade, but the subject has been laid aside in the recent
      years. Antonio Simone Lagana and his group have found that there is 100% correlation in
      uterine cavity structure between diagnostic hysteroscopy and sonohysterography, and only 78%
      correlation when it comes to intrauterine fibroids and polyps. Walid El-Sherbiny, MD and his
      group have found that there is a significant advantage to three-dimensional sonohysterography
      over two-dimensional in the diagnosis of uterine cavity diseases. No significant difference
      was observed, and 97% correlation was found, comparing three-dimensional sonar and
      hysteroscopy. Work rationale is that there is a reason to reconsider the status of the
      diagnostic hysteroscopy to sonohysterography due to evolving technologies, and an improvement
      in resolution and three dimensional technologies.

      in resolution and three dimensional technologies.

      Purpose of the study:

      Comparison of the sensitivity, specificity, and the amount of information between diagnostic
      hysteroscopy and sonohysterography (Two and three-dimensional, in abdominal and vaginal
      access).

      The comparison will be will be made immediately after the completion of diagnostic
      hysteroscopy test, while using liquid drizzled earlier during the hysteroscopy, in order to
      simulate sonohysterography which is considered less intrusive and is made As part of standard
      treatment.

    <description>Women who were routinely referred to perform diagnostic hysteroscopy. As part of the procedure, clear liquid is inserted into the uterine cavity. After the hysteroscopy, and in the same position, abdominal and vaginal sonar will be performed, and the findings will be recorded and will be compared. Immediately after completion of the office hysteroscopy, two-dimensional and three-dimensional sonar to demonstrate the uterine cavity and its walls will be performed while using the liquid which is left in the uterine cavity. It is important to note that no additional invasive operation will be performed beyond what is necessary to perform hysteroscopy. It should be emphasized that the sonar test will be performed immediately and in the same position as the hysteroscopy test. All procedures will be performed in women clinics or day hospitalization. It should be noted that the medical examinations will not be performed unless there are medical reasons.</description>
