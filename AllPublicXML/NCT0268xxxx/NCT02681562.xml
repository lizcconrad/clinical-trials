  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment selection for breast cancer is still largely empiric and guided by large randomized
      clinical trials on populations of patients. This approach is inadequate for the selection of
      individualized chemotherapy regimens. Estimates of benefits for individuals are
      extrapolations from the effects seen in these large trials, and do not necessarily apply to
      individual patients. The revolution in genomics promises to transform oncology care. By
      better defining cancer subtypes, a better understanding of breast cancer biology should help
      to guide treatment.

      The up-front phase we have decide to adopt play a pivotal role as it is useful for testing a
      targeted therapeutic drug such as olaparib wich also requires development of new biomarkers
      which may be useful for future studies. With this approach it could be possible to
      demonstrate drug target or biomarker effect in clinical setting and models the relationship
      between the pharmacodynamics and the pharmacokinetics. Additional benefits of this approach
      include the following:

        -  It could facilitate rational drug selection, identify therapeutic failures early, and
           compress timelines for anticancer drug development.

        -  It could provide initial rationale and guiding principles for further drug development
           based on studies in humans (rather than xenografts, where tissues of one species are
           transplanted to another species).

        -  As it focuses on extensively characterizing how a drug works and whether it hits its
           intended target (including molecular imaging studies) in a limited number of patients it
           could yield results that would optimally inform and expedite the subsequent development
           of molecularly-targeted agents

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          2. Patients (female) must be 18 years of age.

          3. Clinically or radiologically measurable or evaluable disease defined as: presence of
             bidimensionally or unidimensionally measurable breast lesion by physical or
             radiological examination.

          4. Estrogen receptor &lt; 10% for ARM A only

          5. Progesterone receptor = 0 for ARM A only

          6. HER2 negative on primary tumor (HER-2 score of 0 or 1+/2+ with FISH not amplified) for
             ARM A only

          7. Mutation of BRCA 1 and/or 2 for ARM B only

               -  Germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation that is considered deleterious or suspected
