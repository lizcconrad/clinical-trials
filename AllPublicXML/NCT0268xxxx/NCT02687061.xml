      The project aims to retrieve patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B (cHB) and hepatitis
      C (cHC) who are lost to follow-up.Data files of the Public Health System and microbiology
      laboratories will be explored for registered cases of cHB and cHC. Subsequently the
      investigators will compare the registered cases with the list of known cHB and cHC patients
      in hospital care. Patients lost to follow up will be informed and approached via either the
      Public Health Service (PHS) or their primary care physician. Identified patients will be
      invited for re-evaluation at the regional hepatitis centre (The North Western Hospital,
      formerly Medical Centre Alkmaar) to assess the current status of their chronic disease.
      Evaluation will be performed in accordance with (inter-)national guidelines, no extra
      interventions will be performed.

      After completion of re-evaluation, a final report will be made and send to both patient and
      primary care physician with recommendations for further follow-up.

        The groups will be selected from registries of the Public Health Service (PHS) and medical
        microbiology laboratories. All positive anti-HCV and HBsAg will be checked and if patients
        with positive HBsAg or HCV are not known in specialised/hospital care, they will be
        included in our database.
