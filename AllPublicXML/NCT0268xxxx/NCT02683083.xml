      Primary purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the safety, biodistribution and
      radiation dosimetry of [131I]-SGMIB Anti-HER2 VHH1 in healthy volunteers and patients with
      HER2+ breast cancer.

      Secondary purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the tumor uptake of [131I]-SGMIB
      Anti-HER2 VHH1 in patients with HER2+ breast cancer.

          -  Subject with blood parameters within normal ranges

          -  Age: at least 18 years old

        Patients will only be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Patients who have given informed consent

          -  Age: at least 18 years old

          -  Patients with local, locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast carcinoma as
             diagnosed on biopsied tissue by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ
             hybridization (FISH).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will not be included in the study if one of the following criteria applies:

          -  Patients that received radiolabeled compounds with a long half-life (&gt;7h) for
             diagnostic or therapeutic purposes within the last 2 days.

          -  Patients with absolute contra-indications for thyroid blockage with potassium iodide.

          -  Patients with abnormal liver: ALT/AST &gt; 2 times normal values; bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time
