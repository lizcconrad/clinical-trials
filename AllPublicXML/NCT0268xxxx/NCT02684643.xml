      This study is designed to study and compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
      individualized phosphate-lowering therapy in comparison with regular guideline-recommended
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients has been one of the most difficult conundrums for
      nephrologist for the past two decades. Elevated phosphate contributes to secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, elevated FGF23 levels, and vascular calcification, which in turn
      predispose to mortality in this population. Current guidelines recommend limiting dietary
      phosphate intake, strengthening dialysis and using phosphate binders as three therapies for
      treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Yet exact clinical implication remains ambiguous: how intense
      restricted phosphate intake should be and how dosage of phosphate binders and dialysis should
      be adjusted accordingly. Thus, treatments of hyperphosphatemia have not been effective
      enough, but appear to be refractory. In the current study, the investigators designed
      individualized phosphate-lowering therapy based on each patient's phosphate-clearing ability,
      in order to observe and compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the individualized
      therapy and the regular guideline-recommended therapy.

    <description>Phosphate binders and calcitriol would be prescribed according to the guidelines. Phosphate binders included in the study are calcium acetate, calcium carbonate or sevelamer. Dosage is based on patients serum phosphate and calcium level. Calcitriol prescribed in the study is Rocaltrol and the dosage is based on PTH, serum phosphate and calcium level. Patients' diet habit will not be altered.</description>
