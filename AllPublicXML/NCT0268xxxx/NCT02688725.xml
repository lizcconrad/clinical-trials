  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no standard recommendation for using imaging studies to check patients
      for breast cancer recurrence who have been treated with mastectomy. The investigator proposes
      performing in-office ultrasound examinations of these patients to determine if this would be
      helpful in identifying an expected 5-7% of patients with breast cancer recurrences following
      mastectomy.

      The investigator hypothesizes that surgeon-directed ultrasound is a feasible, accurate, and
      cost-effective strategy for local recurrence surveillance in breast cancer patients after
      mastectomy. Toward examining these hypotheses, the investigators propose the following
      Specific Aims:

      Aim I: To determine the number of breast cancer recurrences following mastectomy detected by
      surgeon-performed ultrasound.

      Aim II: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of surgeon-performed ultrasound for the
      detection of post-mastectomy breast cancer recurrence.

      Aim III: To estimate the cost of performing surgeon-directed ultrasound for the detection of
      post-mastectomy breast cancer recurrence from the perspective of a third party payer relative
      to standard surveillance alone.
