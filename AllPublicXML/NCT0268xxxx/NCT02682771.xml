  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, due to excess fat in the thoracoabdominal region, can promote changes in respiratory
      function and lung function, leading to reduction in lung volume and capacity. Such
      dysfunctions are worsen after bariatric surgery to be associated with factors inherent to
      this procedure. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of the
      application of bilevel positive airway pressure and exercises with inspiratory pressure with
      linear load in thoracoabdominal mobility, pulmonary function, inspiratory muscle strength,
      respiratory muscle strength and prevalence of pulmonary complications after bariatric
      surgery.

      This is a clinical trial, randomized, blinded, in which 60 volunteers, after evaluation
      preoperatively, consisting of: cirtometry to measure thoracoabdominal mobility, spirometry
      for measures of lung function, nasal inspiratory pressure to inspiratory muscle strength and
      endurance incremental test for evaluation of respiratory muscle strength, were randomized and
      allocated into three groups, with 20 volunteers each. The interventions were performed in the
      immediate postoperative period and the first day after surgery. The first group, called the
      control group received care by Conventional Respiratory Physiotherapy (CRP), consisting of
      breathing exercises, incentive spirometer and ambulation. The second group, called Positive
      Pressure Group received two-level positive airway pressure for one hour, addition of CRP. The
      third group, called Load Inspiratory Group held exercises with inspiratory pressure with
      linear load, linked also to the CRP. Treatments were applied twice in the immediate
      postoperative period and shortly after returning to the ward and after 4 hours of the initial
      treatment and three times a day on the first day after surgery. On discharge, the second day
      after surgery, the volunteers performed chest x-ray and underwent the same evaluations
      performed preoperatively.

    <description>Spirometry was carried out according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) (2005). Three types of maneuver were used in order to evaluate the lumg volumes and flows: slow vital capacity, forced vital capacity and maximum voluntary ventilation. The maneuvers were carried out until three acceptable and reproducible curves were obtained, not exceeding more than eight attemps. The values extracted from each maneuver were selected according to Pereira (2002) and the predicted values calculated using the equation proposed by Pereira et al (1992( for Brazilians.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thoracoabdominal mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of thoracoabdominal mobility was performed by using a tape scaled in centimeters. In the standing position, the measurement were made at levels axillary, xiphoid and abdominal during rest and at maximal inspiration and maximal expiration. At each level, the measurements were performed three times. It computed the highest value of inspiration and lowest of expiration. The absolute difference between these values was considered the thoracoabdominal mobility.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of inspiratory muscle endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The endurance test was performed using the PowerBreathe K3. An incremental test was performed, initiating at 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure for 30 respiratory cycles and then, added 10 cmH20 for each respiratory cycle. The test was finished when the individual was unabled to promote inspiratory effort.</description>

    <description>The Sniff is an alternative non-invasive technique for the assessment of inspiratory muscle strength by sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (PNSN). The measurement is performed using a peak pressure generated by nasal nostril during a maximal sniff from functional residual capacity</description>
