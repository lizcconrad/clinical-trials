      and after operation.

      Patients who have consent to undergo to total thyroidectomy with sutureless technique
      (regardless of attending to study or not) for benign thyroid diseases in the institution are
      asked to participate to this study. Patients are informed that participating to this study
      will not alter their treatment method. Patients were operated either with Ligasure SmallJaw
      or Harmonic Focus according to availability in hospital. Same surgical team performed all
      operations and they did not know if the patient was participated in study or not.

      Patients willing to participate in this study are being questioned for their quality of life
      (QoL) with a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire before surgery and 4 weeks after
      surgery. For assessment of quality of life Thy-PRO-39 questionnaire is being used. Responses
      of patients to QoL questionnaire is being recorded to a secure online database. After data
      completion answers of patients will be exported as anonymous to principal investigator for
      analysis. Effect of two energy based devices (EBD) on QOL will be compared.
