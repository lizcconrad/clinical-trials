  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For surgery involving the shoulder, anesthesiologists will often inject local anesthetic
      numbing medication near nerves supplying the shoulder in what is called a &quot;supraclavicular
      nerve block&quot;. These nerve blocks cause numbness and weakness in the shoulder leading to
      relaxation of the joint which is helpful to the surgeon and allowing for painless surgery
      without general anesthesia. After surgery, pain relief is sustained for the duration of the
      nerve block.

      The primary purpose of this study is to clarify the duration of pain control provided by
      supraclavicular blocks when supplemented with varying doses of the steroid anti-inflammatory
      dexamethasone when given through the intravenous line (IV). IV dexamethasone is commonly used
      for both nausea prevention and block prolongation, but a detailed study of the effect of
      varying doses of this medication on duration of pain relief and weakness from the block has
      not been studied. The study investigators seek to identify what association, if any, is noted
      between IV dexamethasone doses and changes in blood glucose levels after shoulder surgery
      with regional anesthesia and sedation. Finally, the study investigators will collect data on
      side-effects and postoperative complications, if any, in patients receiving a range of doses
      of IV dexamethasone.
