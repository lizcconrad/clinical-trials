    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy on blood pressure reduction, safety and tolerability of two
      different dosages of canrenone as add-on therapy in patients already treated with Angiotensin
      Converting-Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and diuretics
      at the maximum dosage.

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy on blood pressure reduction, safety and tolerability of two
      different dosages of canrenone as add-on therapy in patients already treated with Angiotensin
      Converting-Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and diuretics
      at the maximum dosage.

      In this multi-centre, phase IV, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel groups trial,
      180 Caucasian patients affected by uncomplicated, essential hypertension, not well controlled
      by concomitant administration of ACE-I or ARBs and diuretics at the maximum dosage will be
      enrolled.

      At baseline patients will be randomized to canrenone, 50 mg, or canrenone 100 mg once a day,
      in addition to their current therapy, for three months.

      At the baseline, and after 3 months will be evaluated: systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), heart rate, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), homeostasis
      model assessment insulin (HOMA-index), total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides,
      LDL-cholesterol, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, uric acid, estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR), plasmatic urea, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), aldosterone, and
      galectin-3.
