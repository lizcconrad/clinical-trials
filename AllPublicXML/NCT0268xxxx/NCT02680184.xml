      Objectives:

      Primary (Part 1):

      • To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of CMP-001 when given in combination with
      pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced melanoma.

      Primary (Part 2):

      • To assess and describe the safety profile of CMP-001 when administered as monotherapy

      Methodology:

      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b clinical study of intratumoral administration of
      CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab or as a monotherapy in subjects with advanced
      melanoma. The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 (CMP-001 + pembrolizumab) is
      comprised of two phases: 1) a Dose Escalation Phase and 2) a Dose Expansion Phase. Part 2 of
      the study is designed to assess the CMP-001 as a monotherapy.

      The Part 1 dose escalation phase of the study will evaluate two treatment schedules of
      CMP-001 (at doses of 1 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg or 10 mg) administered in combination with
      pembrolizumab, designated as Schedule &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;. There will be approximately 60 subjects
      enrolled into the Part 1 dose escalation phase of the study.

        -  Schedule A: CMP-001 will be administered once a week for 7 weeks (total of 7 doses) then
           administered once every 3 weeks until discontinuation.

        -  Schedule B: CMP-001 will be administered once a week for 2 weeks, then once every 3
           weeks for 5 additional doses (total of 7 doses). Thereafter it will be administered once
           every 3 weeks until discontinuation.

      The Part 1 dose expansion phase of the study will evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of CMP-001 + pembrolizumab on treatment Schedule A. There will be approximately 80
      subjects enrolled in the Part 1 dose expansion phase.

      Part 2 will evaluate CMP-001 as a monotherapy on treatment Schedule A. There will be up to 20
      subjects enrolled in the monotherapy arm.

      There will be a total of approximately 160 patients enrolled in this study.

             10 mg/day; replacement doses, topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational steroids are
             permitted. Subjects who have a history of adrenal insufficiency and are receiving
             greater than 10 mg/day coticosteroid may be eligible but only after Sponsor
             consultation. Subjects who are currently receiving steroids at a dose of ≤10 mg/day do
             not need to discontinue steroids prior to enrollment.

          7. Active (i.e., symptomatic or growing) central nervous system (CNS) metastases.
             Subjects with CNS metastases are eligible for the trial if

               -  the metastases have been treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy,

               -  the subject is off corticosteroids &gt; 10 mg/day and is neurologically stable for
                  at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.

               -  brain MRI completed within 3 months of screening

          8. Any concurrent uncontrolled illness, including mental illness or substance abuse,
             which in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unable to cooperate
             or participate in the trial.

          9. Severe uncontrolled cardiac disease within 6 months of Screening, including but not
             limited to uncontrolled hypertension; unstable angina; myocardial infarction (MI) or
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

         10. Requires prohibited treatment (i.e., non-protocol specified anticancer
             pharmacotherapy, surgery or conventional radiotherapy for treatment of malignant
             tumor).

         11. Women of child-bearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use an acceptable
             method of contraception.

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible:

          1. Not eligible, as determined by Investigator, for treatment with pembrolizumab when
             given in combination with CMP-001 (i.e., unable to receive combination treatment given
             in Part 1).

          2. Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma. Ocular
             melanoma subjects are not eligible.

          3. Male or female subjects age 18 or older.

          4. Previously received any anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, alone or in combination. Subjects
             must have received a minimum of 4 doses of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy prior to study
             entry.

          5. Subjects must have at least one tumor lesion with a longest diameter of ≥0.5 cm that
             can be easily palpated or detected by ultrasound to facilitate intratumoral injection
             of CMP-001 (i.e., tumor in skin, muscle, subcutaneous tissue or accessible lymph
             node).

          6. Subjects must have measurable disease by RECIST Version 1.1.

          7. Capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements.

          8. A life expectancy of greater than 24 weeks at Screening.

          9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

         10. Most recent laboratory values (within 3 weeks prior to Week 1 Day 1 (W1D1)) before
             study entry meet the following standards:

               -  Bone marrow function: neutrophil count ≥1,000/mm3, platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 and
                  hemoglobin concentration &gt; 8.0 g/dL.

               -  Liver function: total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
                  ranges of each institution, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
                  aminotransferase ≤ 3 times the ULN range of each institution.

               -  LDH ≤2.0 times the ULN range of each institution.

               -  Renal function: serum creatinine ≤1.5 times the ULN range of each institution.

         11. The subject must sign a written informed consent form prior to the initiation of any
             study procedures. Adult subjects unable to provide written informed consent on their
             own behalf will not be eligible for the study.

             W1D1. However, if an investigational therapy has a short half-life, a reduced wash out
             period may be acceptable with Sponsor approval.

          3. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV).

             10 mg/d; replacement doses, topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational steroids are
             permitted. Subjects who have a history of adrenal insufficiency and are receiving
             greater than 10 mg/day of corticosteroid may be eligible but only after Sponsor
             consultation. Subjects who are currently receiving steroids at a dose of ≤ 10 mg/day
             do not need to discontinue steroids prior to enrollment.

          6. Active (i.e., symptomatic or growing) central nervous system (CNS) metastases.
             Subjects with CNS metastases are eligible for the trial if:

               -  the metastases have been treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy.

               -  the subject is off corticosteroids &gt;10 mg/day and is neurologically stable for at
                  least 2 weeks prior to Screening.

               -  brain MRI completed within 3 months of screening, if clinically indicated.

          7. Any concurrent uncontrolled illness, including mental illness or substance abuse,
