    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study evaluating the pharmacodynamics and safety of single agent
      olaparib administered at 300mg bid (twice a day) for 14 days orally in patients with human
      papillomavirus (HPV) -positive and human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous
      cell carcinoma (HNSCC)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Level of IHC-Ki-67 expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue biopsy sections will be analyzed for proliferation (IHC-Ki-67) Ki-67 is a nuclear non-histone protein that is present at low levels in quiescent cells but is increased in proliferating cells. Thus, Ki-67 reactivity, defined as percent tumor cells staining positive as measured by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, is a specific nuclear marker for cell proliferation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tissue apoptosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue biopsy sections will be analyzed for apoptosis. For example using the IHC-cleaved caspase-3 assay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in DNA repair pathways</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue biopsy sections will be analyzed to determine effect on DNA repair pathways (PARP activity). Specifically Poly(ADP-ribose) immunohistochemical staining of tissue biopsies will be performed and PAR intensity scored as 0 (no signal), 1 (weak), 2 (strong intensity in &gt;50% of tumor cells).</description>
