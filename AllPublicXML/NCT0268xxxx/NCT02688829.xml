  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small-scale pilot clinical study of the Rapamycin-Eluting Coronary Stent System of
      Microport for the first time to assess the preliminary safety and feasibility used in the
      human body. And provide evidence for subsequent large-scale, multi-center, randomized
      controlled clinical trials, then provide the basis for the formal application of the product
      in China.
