      Objective:

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible effects of green-plant thylakoid
      supplementation to a restricted diet intervention study in overweight to obese men.

      Methods:

      Overweight-obese men (BMI 25 - 35) were treated to a 30 E% restricted diet for one month,
      followed by one month of stabilization. Then they were divided in two treatment arms of one
      month each; one thylakoid-enriched diet (n=10) and one control diet (n=10). Body measurements
      and blood samples were taken throughout the study.

      Twenty healthy, non-vegetarian, non-smoking Caucasian men were included in the study.
      Inclusion criteria: men aged 40 to 70 years with a BMI of 25 to 35. Exclusion criteria:
      Metabolic disturbances, bariatric surgery, recent diet, food allergies or treatment with
      antibiotics. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Lund University,
      Sweden (#2006/361).

      The trial consisted of three periods: 1) diet-restriction period (one month) 2) stabilizing
      period (one month) 3) diet-restriction period with supplementation of thylakoids or placebo
      (one month). The two weight-losing periods included strict diet recommendation with -30
      energy % (E%), and macronutrient composition: 55-65 E% carbohydrates, 10-15 E% protein and
      25-35 E% fat. Sixty minutes of low intensive exercise per day was also required.

      During the stabilizing month participants were instructed to eat a healthy diet to be able to
      keep their achieved weight-loss.

      Day 0, 28, 56 and 84 the participants arrived after 12-hour fasting for blood sampling and
      anthropometric measurements. The blood samples were analyzed for plasma-glucose, insulin,
      HbA1c, inflammation markers, cholecystokinin, ghrelin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol,
      HDL-cholesterol, and triacylglycerol.
