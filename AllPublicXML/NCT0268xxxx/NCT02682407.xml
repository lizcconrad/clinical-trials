      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OMS721 in subjects
      with IgA Nephropathy (IgAN), Lupus Nephritis (LN), Membranous Nephropathy (MN), and C3
      Glomerulopathy (C3G), including Dense Deposit Disease. The study will also evaluate
      Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD), anti-drug antibody response (ADA), and
      neutralizing antibodies (Nab).

      This is a Phase 2, multicenter study of OMS721 in subjects with the following diseases: IgA
      Nephropathy (IgAN), Lupus Nephritis, Membranous Nephropathy (MN), or C3 Glomerulopathy,
      including Dense Deposit Disease. Three cohorts will be enrolled. Cohort 1 will be subjects
      with corticosteroid dependent IgAN, LN, MN, or C3 Glomerulopathy. Cohort 1 subjects will all
      receive OMS721 in an uncontrolled, open-label design. Cohort 2 and 3 will be subjects with
      IgA nephropathy who are not receiving corticosteroids. These cohorts will be randomized to
      receive either OMS721 treatment or D5W vehicle in a randomized double-blind design.
      Approximately 44 subjects will be enrolled (16 in Cohort 1, 10 in Cohort 2, and 18 in Cohort
      3).
