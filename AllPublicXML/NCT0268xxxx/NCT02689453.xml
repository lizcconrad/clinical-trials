  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a rare blood cancer. Researchers want to see if a combination
      of two drugs - recombinant human interleukin 15 (rhIL-15) and alemtuzumab - is a better
      treatment for ATL.

      Objectives:

      To test if giving rhIL-15 combined with alemtuzumab improves the outcome of therapy for ATL.
      Also, to determine the safe dose of this combination and identify side effects and effects on
      the immune system.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 years and older with chronic or acute ATL who have not been helped by other
      treatments.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with tests that are mostly part of their usual cancer care.
      They will sign a separate consent form for this.

      Weeks 1 and 2: Participants will have a total of 10 visits. They will:

        -  Get rhIL-15 under the skin by needle.

        -  Have a physical exam and vital signs measured.

        -  Give blood samples.

        -  Answer questions about their health and their medicines.

      Week 3: Participants will stay in the clinic. They will:

        -  Get alemtuzumab infusions in a vein through a small catheter on days 1, 2, 3, and 5..

        -  Take medicines to decrease side effects.

        -  Have a computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate the treatment.

        -  Have a physical exam and vital signs measured.

        -  Give blood samples.

      Answer questions about their health and medicines.

      Weeks 4, 5, and 6 will repeat week 3, without the CT scan. Some patients will just have
      outpatient visits these weeks.

      After treatment, participants will have follow-up visits every few months for up to 2 years.
      At these visits, participants will give blood samples and have CT scans.

      Background:

        -  A previously reported Lymphoid Malignancies Branch (LYMB) trial administering
           alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1) to patients with chronic, acute and lymphomatous subtype HTLV-1
           associated ATL showed appreciable initial activity but no clear long-term impact.

             -  Overall response rate of 52% (n=15) in 29 patients.

             -  Median duration of response 3.4 months.

             -  Median overall survival 5.9 months.

        -  Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with polymorphonuclear neutrophils
           (PMNs), monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells acting as the effector cells is
           alemtuzumab s primary in vivo mechanism of action for depleting malignant leukemic or
           lymphomatous cells.

        -  The immunologic effects of Interleukin-15 (IL-15), a stimulatory cytokine that promotes
           the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and long-term CD8+ memory
           Tcells, has been assessed in several phase I trials in cancer patients.

        -  Administration of recombinant human (rh) IL-15 as an intravenous bolus (IVB), continuous
           intravenous infusion (CIV) or subcutaneous injections (SC) into adult cancer patients
           has produced 5 to 50 fold expansion in the number of circulating NK cells at well
           tolerated doses in these patients.

        -  Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy models have shown efficacy from the
           administration of IL-15 and monoclonal antibodies.

        -  In a syngeneic model, immunocompetent mice bearing an EL4 cell line transfected with
           human CD20 showed increased ADCC and improved survival for the mice treated with IL-15
           and rituximab compared to mice treated with either agent alone or to controls.

        -  In xenograft human MET-1 model, mice treated with alemtuzumab and IL-15 also had
           improved survival.

      Objective:

      -Determine the safety, toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of s.c. rhIL-15
      administered in combination with standard three times per week IV alemtuzumab treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  ECOG Performance Status less than or equal to 1

        -  Diagnosis of adult T-cell leukemia (HTLV-1 associated, chronic or acute), peripheral
           T-cell lymphoma (angioimmunoblastic, hepatosplenic, or not otherwise specified), or
           cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Stage III or IV, with leukemia involvement or erythrodemia)

        -  Measurable or evaluable disease

        -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined in the Eligibility Section of the
           protocol.

      Design:

        -  This is a single institution nonrandomized Phase I dose escalation study evaluating
           increasing doses of SC rhIL-15 in combination with alemtuzumab using a standard 3 + 3
           dose escalation.

        -  Treatment Schedule

             -  rhIL-15 weeks 1 and 2 (s.c. Monday through Friday) all dosing cohorts.

             -  Alemtuzumab initiation dosing week 3 (day 1: 3mg, day 2: 10mg, day 3: 30mg and day
                5: 30mg IV over 2 hours). The escalating doses are indicated by down arrows in the
                Schema below.

             -  Standard alemtuzumab weeks 4, 5, and 6: 30 mg three times a week (Monday, Wednesday
                and Friday.)

        -  rhIL-15 dose levels

             -  Cohort 1-1 mcg/kg/dose

             -  Cohort 2-2 mcg/kg/dose

             -  Cohort 3-3 mcg/kg/dose

        -  Up to 24 patients will be enrolled in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have received any systemic corticosteroid therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             the start of therapy, or 12 weeks if given to treat graft versus host disease (GVHD),

             equivalent.

          -  Patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation and have required
             systemic treatment for GVHD (including but not limited to oral or parenteral
             corticosteroids, ibrutinib, and extracorporeal phototherapy) within the last 12 weeks

          -  Clinical evidence of (parenchymal or meningeal) CNS involvement or metastasis. In
             subjects suspected of having CNS disease, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of

        NOTE: HIV-positive patients are excluded from the study. Alemtuzumab may produce a
        different pattern of toxicities in patients with HIV infection; in addition, the depletion
        of T cells produced by alemtuzumab may have adverse effects on HIV-positive individuals.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, moderate/severe graft versus host disease, cognitive impairment, active
             substance abuse, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the view of the
             Investigator, would preclude safe treatment or the ability to give informed consent
             and limit compliance with study requirements.
