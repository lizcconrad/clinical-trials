      Pregnant Women beyond the date of birth. will be followed while coming to routine monitoring.
      physiological parameter of cervical length will be measured as the differential predictor to
      determine their due date. the cervical length will be measured as part of routine gynecologic
      examination to women who come for routine over due date follow up.

      additional medical data will be collected from the patient medical record.- demographic data,
      and all the routine prenatal medical care the women will receive up to the delivery.and
      delivery outcomes.

      The clinical part of the study: the first visit of pregnancy monitoring is carried out at 40
      full weeks. First visit to make sure the gestational age to receive full medical anamnesis ,
      perform physical examination and vaginal and NST and BPP. Also, assess the clinical weight
      and when the need arises assessment of weight sonography. monitoring fetal movements . The
      women are ordered to return for routine check ups every 3 days. from - 41 full weeks the
      women should come every two days and 42 weeks should be referred for induction. In practice,
      the women offered induction at 41 weeks + 3 or 4 days.
