      This study aims to examine if structured skills training group therapy for ADHD in adults has
      beneficial effects superior to 'treatment as usual' including medication in a controlled
      outpatient setting on clinically relevant outcomes including symptoms, functioning and
      quality of life measures.

      The trial is designed as a multicenter randomized controlled, parallel group study. Patients
      are randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms with 14-week duration: one arm with initial
      intervention by structured skills training groups by weekly sessions or one with control
      condition (treatment as usual). Then after 15 weeks patients in the control condition arm are
      switched to the active intervention by 14 weeks of structured group therapy. All patients are
      assessed for defined outcomes after six months.

      Background: The focus in recent years on evidence for non-pharmacological treatment in adults
      with ADHD raises the question of potential effects of structured group therapy. Structured
      skills training groups have shown beneficial effects in some studies in an outpatient
      psychiatric context by reduction in ADHD symptoms in individuals who remained stable
      regarding medication status.

      Aims: The main objective for the trial is to investigate the potential effects of structured
      skills training groups in a clinically relevant but still controlled setting on broader
      outcomes including both symptomatic, functional and health related quality of life measures.

      Methods/Design: The trial is designed as a multicenter randomized controlled parallel group
      design. At each outpatient site the enrolled patients are randomized into two groups for
      either Group 1 (G1) with start of weekly treatment in active structured skills training group
      lasting for 14 weeks or allocated to Group 2 (G2) with treatment as usual/clinical management
      and with 15 weeks delayed start of their group treatment for comparison wth patients in the
      other arm. Those patients in the control condition arm receiving treatment as usual or
      clinical management of individual patients (G2), are thereafter switched to active structured
      skills training group therapy.All patients are followed up after six months with assessments
      of primary and secondary outcomes.

    <description>Weekly 2-hours sessions for 14 weeks follow the Norwegian translation of the Swedish version of the ADHD skills training manual/workbook (Hesslinger 2010; Hirvikoski 2011; Morgensterns 2015) which is based on an adaption of Marsha Linehan's dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for borderline personality disorder into a group-based skills training program for adults with ADHD (Hesslinger 2002; Philipsen 2007). The groups embrace 7 - 10 participants, and two group leaders trained in group therapy, cognitive-behavioral treatment or DBT. Each session contains an initial short repetition and feedback on the previous session, followed by review of the homework during the first hour. After a break, a new topic with exercises and homework for the following week is introduced.</description>
