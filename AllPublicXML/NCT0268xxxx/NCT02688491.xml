      Whether patients with stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma(ccRCC) should receive
      adjuvant targeted therapy or not is still on debate. The investigators invented a assay
      consisting of 5 CpGs: cg00396667（PITX1）, cg18815943 （FOXE3）, cg03890877（TWF2）, cg07611000
      （EHBP1L1）and cg14391855（RIN1）that was successfully categorise patients with stage III clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma into high-risk and low-risk groups with Harzard Ratio(HR) of 4.93.
      Here the investigators randomly assign assay-defined high risk patients of locally advanced
      ccRCC into adjuvant targeted therapy group and observation group.Disease free survival and
      overall survival are the end points of observation.

      The investigators' CpG-methylation-based assay contains 5 CpGs: cg00396667（PITX1）, cg18815943
      （FOXE3）, cg03890877（TWF2）, cg07611000 （EHBP1L1）and cg14391855（RIN1）. The investigators
      evaluate the CpG methylation status of surgical specimens using pyrosequencing and calculate
      their risk score[risk score=(0.0066×PITX1)+(0.0034×FOXE3)－(0.027×TWF2)
      －(0.018×EHBP1L1)－(0.03×RIN1)], risk score ≥－0.1 as assay-defined high risk status and risk
      score＜－0.1 as assay-defined low risk status. The investigators randomly assign assay-defined
      high risk patients of stage III ccRCC into intervention group and control group. The
      intervention group should receive adjuvant targeted therapy while the control group deserve
      observation. Primary endpoint is the disease free survival and overall survival.
