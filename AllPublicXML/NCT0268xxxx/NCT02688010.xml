  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noise is a hazard for newborn. In 1997, the American Academy of Pediatrics determined that
      safe sound levels in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) should not exceed 45 dB which
      has been rarely achieved. High intensities of noise have several negative effects on preterm
      newborns. Also, they are exposed to either continuous bright light continuous near darkness
      or unstructured combination of the two during their hospitalizations. The investigators
      primary objective is to determine the impact of reduced noise levels and cycled light on
      growth parameters and visual development in preterm infants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Flash visual evoked potentials (FVEP) at 4 weeks of age</measure>
    <time_frame>at 4 weeks of age</time_frame>
    <description>FVEP is recorded from each eye individually after they fall asleep. Three silver-sliver chloride electrodes are placed according to 10-20 International system with active electrode at Oz (1-2 cm above inion), reference electrode at Fz and ground electrode at Cz. Scalp-electrode impedance is usually below 5kΩ but always below 10kΩ. Flash stimulus (2 Hz.) is given by light emitting diode goggles simulator at a distance of 2 cm to one eye at a time. 100 responses are averaged for each eye automatically in the Nicolet Viking Quest visual electrophysiological device at 1s total sweep time. Band pass filters are set at 0.1-75 Hz. The reproducibility of the responses is ensured by repeating the test two or more times. Responses with excessive artifacts are automatically rejected. The parameters of P1, N1, P2, N2, P3, and N3 of the FVEP are stored and subsequently assessed by ophthalmologist blinded to the infant's clinical course.</description>

    <measure>Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID-III) at 18 months of age</measure>
    <time_frame>at 18 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>Neurodevelopment outcome is measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID-III) at corrected gestational age of 18 month, assessed by the physician from department of child health care who was blinded with respect to the subjects. Mental and motor scores were calculated by the BSID-III Mental Developmental Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI). The subject's neurodevelopmental outcome was classified as delayed if either score was less than 70.</description>
