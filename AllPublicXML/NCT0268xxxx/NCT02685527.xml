    <textblock>
      Isolation of contagious patients is expensive, requires more caregiver time, most of the
      patients perceive isolation as a mental strain and it has been shown that the level of care
      and observation is lower than in a normal ward. But isolation of contagious patients is
      necessary to protect other patients, hospital staff and relatives to prevent spreading of
      infection and, in worst case out-break.

      There are different isolation regimes available depending on causative agent and mode of
      transmission. A community-acquired acute gastroenteritis (GE) is most often caused by
      Norovirus while a hospital-acquired acute GE is often caused by toxin producing Clostridium
      difficile. Patients infected with Norovirus or Clostridium difficile have to be isolated in
      single rooms with strict contact precautions. Patients infected with acute GE caused by other
      pathogens can be isolated in a multi-bed room if there is a private toilet.

      However, at the time of arrival to hospital it is not known if the patient is contagious. The
      indication of isolation has to be made based of a clinical evaluation in risk of isolating to
      few or too many patients.

      Aim of the study:

      To identify anamnestic, clinical and paraclinical variables that can be used as indicators of
      the aetiology of infectious GE, thus giving an indication for isolation.

      To clinically evaluate a combined RNA (Norovirus) and DNA (Clostridium difficile) fast PCR
      analysis test to identify infectious GE compared to gold standard methods.
