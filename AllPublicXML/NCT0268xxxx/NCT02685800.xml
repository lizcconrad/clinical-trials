  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) are widely used in couples with fertility problems.
      However, despite ART treatment options have evolved over time, the implantation rate remains
      rather low.

      A possible role for inherited and acquired thrombophilias has been invoked, especially in
      women with previous implantation failures. However, several factors could play a role in
      these conditions.

      A potential benefit of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in improving ART outcomes,
      independently of the presence of thrombophilia, has been recently suggested.

      This register is designed in order to better define all possible variables influencing ART
      outcome and improve clinical management of women with previous implantation failures. During
      this study the investigators will collect and evaluate clinical data regarding the first
      cycle in women with previous ART failures.
