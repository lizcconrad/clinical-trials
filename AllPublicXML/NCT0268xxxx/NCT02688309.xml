  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine potential factors in the aqueous humor that may contribute to the
      development or progression of macular edema or fibrosis (due to any underlying disease) in
      patients suffering from these conditions.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the correlation of pro-permeability and
      pro-fibrosis factor levels and downstream receptor/signaling molecule activation with disease
      activity in patients with macular edema or fibrosis secondary to any underlying disease.

      120 patients will be enrolled from both the clinic and OR, with the latter patients
      undergoing surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
      with PVR, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment without PVR, macular pucker, or macular hole.
      Clinic patients must be receiving an intraocular injection of a steroid as part of standard
      of care for macular edema or progressive fibrosis.

      Surgical patients will receive an anterior chamber (AC) tap at the beginning of surgery,
      while clinic patients will receive an AC tap prior to the intraocular injection of steroid
      with a second AC tap at a follow-up visit 6 +/- 2 weeks after the first injection. The
      aqueous sample will then be analyzed by measuring the levels of various pro-permeability and
      pro-fibrosis factors and/or their downstream receptor/signaling molecule activation.

      We will also determine the correlation between reductions in foveal thickness or improvements
      in visual acuity with changes in the aqueous levels of pro-permeability and pro-fibrosis
      factors from baseline to week 6 in the clinic group.

    <description>A paracentesis removing about 0.1 ml of fluid from the front part of the eye (the aqueous chamber) will be performed in the operating room just prior to surgery or in the clinic. In the operating room, the AC tap is done after the eye is anesthetized and cleaned with 5% povidone iodine for the surgery. A 30-gauge needle attached to a tuberculin syringe is inserted into the AC and 0.1 ml of aqueous is removed. The wound is self-sealing and has no effect on the surgery. In the clinic, the AC tap is done after drops of proparacaine and 5% povidone iodine is placed in the eye and a lid speculum is inserted. The patient is seated at a slit lamp and a 30-gauge needle attached to a tuberculin syringe is inserted into the AC and 0.1 ml of aqueous is aspirated and then the needle is removed.</description>
