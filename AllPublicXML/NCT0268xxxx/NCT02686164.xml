  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized Phase 1 study in participants with advanced
      solid tumors, excluding hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), that have progressed after treatment
      with approved therapies, or for which there are no standard therapies available. The study
      will also include participants with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer
      (RR-DTC). Its primary intent is to determine the effect of lenvatinib on CYP3A4 activity as
      well as to assess the safety and activity of lenvatinib in these participants. The study will
      be conducted in the following 3 phases: Pretreatment Phase, Treatment Phase, and Extension
      Phase.

         16. Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially
             increase the risk associated with the participant's participation in this study.

         17. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding as well as all females of childbearing
             potential who:

               1. have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry,

               2. do not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, total
                  abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method [such as condom plus
                  diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or
                  have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire
                  study period and for 28 days after study drug discontinuation,

               3. are currently abstinent, and do not agree to use a double-barrier method (as
                  described above) or refrain from sexual activity during the study period and for
                  28 days after study drug discontinuation,

               4. are using hormonal contraceptives but are not on a stable dose of the same
                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and who do not
                  agree to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 28 days after study
                  drug discontinuation. All females will be considered of childbearing potential
                  unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrheic, in
                  the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have
                  been sterilized surgically (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or
                  bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing).
