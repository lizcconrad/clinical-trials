  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An oral highly potent P binder Velphoro is a mixture of polynuclear iron(III) oxyhydroxide,
      sucrose, and starches. It was well tolerated in the clinical development program. The
      approved indication in the European Union (EU) is to control serums phosphorus (sP) levels in
      adult CKD (Chronic kidney disease) patients on HD (Haemodialysis) or PD (Peritoneal
      dialysis).

      It is of major interest to observe the drug in daily use outside of controlled trial
      settings. The Marketing Authorisation Holder wishes to obtain further systematic data within
      a non-interventional study to investigate short and long-term safety.

      Effectiveness and Treatment adherence during real-life use will be evaluated.

    <description>The non-interventional design allows the observation of patients in a broad range of settings reflecting routine clinical practice. All decisions on therapeutic or diagnostic procedures, treatments, management of the disease, or resource utilisation will be at the full discretion of the treating physician without interference by a sponsor or study protocol. All treatment decisions will follow the real-life treatment behaviour.</description>
