      Outpatients attending the hospital clinics/study centres will be recruited. Patients with
      moderate to severe COPD airflow obstruction according to GOLD 2015 criteria.

      A total of approximately 300 patients will be enrolled.

      Patients are followed during 3 different treatment periods of 4 weeks separated each by 3
      weeks wash-out period. The study lasts approximately 21 weeks for each patient and a total of
      11 clinic visits is performed during the study.

      The primary endpoint is the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) Area Under the Curve
      (AUC) 0-12h normalised by time on Day 28.

               -  a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 and,

               -  a change in FEV1 from the pre-bronchodilator value (reversibility) of at least 5%
                  at screening

          5. Patients under bronchodilators with long-acting muscarinic antagonist or long-acting 2
             agonist (monotherapy or dual therapy), or patients under ICS + LABA (long-acting
             beta2-agonist) or ICS (Inhaled Corticosteroids) + LAMA (Long Acting Muscarinic
             Agonist) for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

         15. Patients with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities indicating a significant
             or unstable concomitant disease that might, in the judgement of the investigator,
             place the patient at undue risk or potentially compromise the results or
             interpretation of the study.
