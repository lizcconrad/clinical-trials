  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational non-randomized, multi-center, prospective assessment of the clinical utility
      of the WEB Aneurysm Embolization System in subjects with ruptured intracranial aneurysms
      deemed appropriate for endovascular treatment. The population being treated in this Registry
      is a subset of the CE marked indication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible subjects presenting to the participating Registry Center will be considered for
      entry into the Registry. Up to 70 evaluable subjects meeting the Registry entry criteria will
      be enrolled.

      An intermediary analysis will be performed when the first forty (40) subjects reaching the
      planned one month follow-up.

      subjects will be followed per Institution's standard of care.

    <description>Re-bleeding rate after treatment of the target aneurysm with WEB, during the period extending from post-procedure up to 1 month.
Definitions:
Re-bleeding from target aneurysm is defined as patent evidence of hemorrhage on CT or MRI AND hemorrhage is depicted in the same territory as the initial bleeding AND hemorrhage has increased in size compare to initial pre-operative CT
Screening for re-bleeding: During hospital stay of the patient and up to 1-month, any worsening of the clinical status should lead to perform a non-enhanced CT or MRI.
Or, as per-center standard care, non-enhanced CT or MRI might be performed systematically during hospital course.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The decision to use a WEB device to treat the patient has been made before and
             independently of the decision to include the patient in this Registry

          2. Subject must be ≥ 18 years and &lt; 80 years of age

          3. Subject must have a single intracranial aneurysm ruptured within 30 days requiring
             treatment according to a multidisciplinary decision Definition: For the purposes of
             this study a ruptured IA patient is defined as a patient with computed tomography
             (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or lumbar puncture (LP) evidence of
             subarachnoid hemorrhage attributed to the index aneurysm within the last 30 days.

          4. If the subject has one or more additional aneurysm, the additional aneurysm must not
             require treatment in emergency or within 30 days of the index procedure

          5. Subject with Hunt &amp; Hess Score of I, II or III

          6. Conventional or Flat-panel CT is performed within 6hrs prior to femoral puncture (or
             just before WEB placement if any clinical worsening is noted before the treatment) to
             assess absence of re-bleeding prior the treatment

          7. Aneurysm to be treated must have the following characteristics i. Morphology -
             saccular ii. Location

               -  Basilar apex (BA), or

               -  Middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation, or

               -  Internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus, or

               -  Anterior communicating artery (ACom), or

               -  Anterior cerebral Artery (ACA), or

               -  Posterior Communicating (PCom) iii. Diameter and height of the aneurysm is
                  appropriate size for treatment with the WEB Aneurysm Embolization System per
                  device Instructions for Use: Max width diameter 10mm iv. Aneurysm is a priori

          9. Subject must be able to comply with all aspects of the screening, evaluation,
             treatment, and the post-procedure follow-up schedule

         10. Subject, or its legal representative, must have received information regarding the
             data collection and data protection within this clinical evaluation, or must have

          8. Subject has lesion with characteristics unsuitable for endovascular treatment

          9. Subject has vessel, tortuosity or morphology which could preclude safe access and
             support during treatment with clinical evaluation device

         10. Subject has physical, neurologic or psychiatric conditions, which preclude Subject's
             ability to comply with all aspects of the screening, evaluation, treatment, and the
             post-procedure follow-up schedule

         11. Subject has known hypersensitivity, which can not be treated, to any component of the
             clinical evaluation device, procedural materials, or medications commonly used during
             the procedure

         12. Subject has received any investigational device for treatment of the target
             intracranial aneurysm prior to entry into this trial

         13. Subject has an acute life-threatening illness other than the neurological disease to
             be treated in this trial

         14. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 1 year due to other illness or condition
             (in addition to an intracranial aneurysm) Imaging Exclusion criteria

         15. An additional aneurysm need to be treated during the index procedure

         16. Microcatheter cannot reach Subject's aneurysm to allow necessary access to treat with
