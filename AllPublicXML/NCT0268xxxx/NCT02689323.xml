  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the modulatory effects of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on functional connectivity with the insula. Functional
      connectivity (FC) measures the interaction between brain regions, and recent neuroimaging
      studies have used FC to investigate how addiction affects FC among pertinent brain regions.
      rTMS, which can excite cortical neurons, has shown promise as a method to manipulate brain
      connectivity and could be used therapeutically to treat addiction. However, investigators
      first need more information on brain FC and how it relates to behavior, in order to guide
      rTMS target selection.
