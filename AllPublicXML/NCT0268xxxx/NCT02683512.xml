      The long term goal of the proposed project is to develop a repository of information with the
      long term goal of expanding the understanding of the disease manifestation and natural
      history of GSD IV.

      Specific Aims: To establish a repository of clinical, laboratory, and biochemical information
      on individuals diagnosed with glycogen brancher enzyme deficiency. In the long term, this
      information will permit a better understanding of the long term complications and clinical
      course in GBE deficiency.

      The medical records will be reviewed and participant information will be collected using
      REDCapâ„¢ software, hosted through the Duke Translational Medicine Institute (DTMI). The
      database will serve as the repository for retrospective and prospective clinical information
      and results on all participants.

      Data to be collected: Name, DOB, Sex, Age, Method of diagnosis, Liver, skin, or muscle biopsy
      histology, Initial symptoms and/or reason for referral, Past medical history, Past surgical
      history, Family history, Pregnancy history, Developmental history, Developmental assessments,
      and Results of liver function testing. All patients with GSD-IV regardless of age, gender or
      ethnicity, are eligible for the database.

      This research project will enroll individuals from outside institutions. The goal is increase
      the robustness of data collection and analysis with a large number of participants.

                  clinician

               -  abnormal liver tissue with tubular glycogen suggestive of amylopectin, consistent
                  with GSD IV per the clinician.
