  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open-label phase I/II study to determine the relative superiority of
      αCD19-TCRζ-CD28 and αCD19-TCRζ-CD137 CAR-T Cells in safety, efficacy and engraftment
      potential in patients with CD19+ B-lineage leukemia and lymphoma. Recently, cancer
      immunotherapy, treatments aiming to arm patients with immunity specifically against cancer
      cells, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Clinical trials utilizing CARs
      against B cell malignancies have demonstrated remarkable potential. In this trial, all
      subjects will be competitively infused with αCD19-TCRz-CD28 and αCD19-TCRz-CD137 CAR-T cells
      in equal number to test a hypothesis that CD137-costimulation can promote the persistence and
      engraftment of CAR-T cells and this superiority can lead to improved progression-free
      survival.

      Primary objectives

      1. To determine the safety and feasibility of adoptive transfer of T cells modified to
      express CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CD19CAR) for treatment of leukemia and
      lymphoma

      Secondary objectives

        1. To measure the efficacy of anti-tumor responses after CD19CAR T cell infusion

        2. To determine if CD19CAR T cells engineered with 4-1BB signaling domain is superior to
           that with CD28 signaling domain for their homing and persistence after CD19CAR T cell
           infusion
