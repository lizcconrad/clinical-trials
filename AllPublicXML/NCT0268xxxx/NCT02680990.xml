    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of, adherence to, and early efficacy of
      Band Together, a strength-training and walking program (intervention arm) vs. education on
      the benefits of exercise (control arm) in patients with aggressive gastrointestinal (GI)
      malignancies (gastric, gastroesophageal, and pancreatic cancer) undergoing neoadjuvant
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests host resilience (lack of frailty, skeletal muscle
      reserve, etc.) may impact early healing, recovery following neoadjuvant therapy and surgery,
      and long-term cancer-free survival. It is well-recognized that resilience is enhanced in
      individuals with proper diet, sleep habits, and exercise. However, it is unknown whether such
      resilience can be enhanced by training programs initiated at the time of cancer diagnosis.
      Although exercise interventions may contribute to these improvements, it is unknown how
      willing and able these patients are to comply with an exercise regimen during the neoadjuvant
      therapy period. The aim of this study, therefore, is to evaluate compliance with and the
      efficacy of Band Together, an exercise program combining strength-training and aerobic
      exercise, in patients with aggressive GI malignancies undergoing neoadjuvant therapy.

    <description>The mean adherence rates (percentage of prescribed sessions completed) in the intervention group will be determined based on weekly activity diaries. Activity diaries will be completed by the subject throughout their participation in the study and collected upon the end of participation. The mean contamination rates (completed exercise sessions) in the control group will also be determined based on weekly activity diaries.</description>

    <description>Potential subjects will be screened using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire; those who may not be ready to begin an exercise program will be ineligible. The proportion of patients who are PAR-Q ineligible will be compared to the proportion of patients who are eligible based on their PAR-Q results. The proportion of patients who are ineligible due to other exclusion criteria will also be compared. All eligible patients who decline to participate in the study will be asked to provide a reason for their decision; the proportion of potential subjects who decline will be compared to the proportion of subjects who do consent and are eligible.</description>

    <description>Band Together is a strength training program utilizing resistance bands with progressively increasing resistance, ranging from 3 to 35 pounds. Sessions are to be completed 3 times a week and involve 3 sets of 6 exercises: 1. chair stands, 2. chest press, 3. shoulder press, 4. arm curls, 5. pulls, and 6. calf raises. In addition, Band Together participants will be asked to work up to a walking goal of 10,000 additional steps per week.</description>
