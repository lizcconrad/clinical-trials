  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proposed is a 6-month randomized controlled trial, in 200 overweight or obese Stage I-IIIC
      breast cancer survivors examining 6-month changes in: 1) body weight, 2) diet, 3) physical
      activity, and 4)quality of life in women randomized to receive the modified LEAN intervention
      compared to women randomized to wait-list control (i.e., the wait-list control will receive
      the modified LEAN intervention after completing the 6-month study).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of modifying the LEAN intervention
      (NCT02110641) to make it more cost effective by reducing or eliminating the counseling
      sessions. To guide the modification of the intervention one or more focus group sessions with
      former LEAN participants will be conducted. The purpose of these meetings will be to gain
      input on enhancing the LEAN book.

      The LEAN book will be central to the modified intervention, but the LEAN book will be
      modified based on feedback from the focus group(s) and experience gained from the LEAN study.
      The reading level of the LEAN book will also be assessed to ensure acceptability to those
      with a low literacy level.

      Once these changes have been finalized, the efficacy of the modified program will be tested
      using the methods described in the Brief Summary.

    <description>QOL will be self-reported and collected at the baseline and 6-months. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire will be administered to assess overall quality of life. The FACT-B measures physical, emotional, social, and functional well-being as well as quality of life issues specific to breast cancer survivors. The overall score will be used for assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint measures of diet change will be mean, group level changes in daily caloric intake, based on a 120-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which was developed for the Women's Health Initiative Study and has been validated against 4-Day Food Records and 24-hour Dietary Recalls. The FFQ is used to generate the Healthy Eating Index score (HEI). The HEI will be used to assess dietary intake.</description>
