  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been used in many inflammatory disorders.

      More recently the LLLT was associated with an improvement in the muscle strength, endurance
      and functional capacity.But, these effects were described only in health or athletic
      individuals. In this randomized and controlled clinical trails, the investigators will study
      the effects of LLLT on functional capacity of the patients with Coronary artery bypass
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducing in a large hospital that is reference in Coronary artery bypass
      surgery. 15 patients will be randomized for placebo or low-level laser therapy (LLLT). The
      functional capacity will be test by test six-minute walk test before and after de LLLT.
      Moreover the application of LBP or placebo will be followed by assessments of muscle damage
      and oxidative stress. One-week interval between the LLLT will gave to reduce the influence
      between the treatments.

    <description>Oxidative stress will be used a measure of tissue damage, the protein oxidation (method of carbonyls) and two defense measures, an enzyme superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity. Oxidative damage (nmol / mg) of protein carbonylation was determined according to the method proposed by Levine &amp; Stadtman, 1990, using whole blood. The enzymatic activity of SOD (SOD / mg protein) was determined by the inhibition of autooxidation of adrenaline measured spectrophotometrically (480nm) under Bannister and Calabrese (1987).</description>
