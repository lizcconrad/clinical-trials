  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brief and cost-effective interventions teaching emotion regulation techniques can be feasibly
      applied to promote mental health in University students. The tools of mindfulness (i.e.,
      objective awareness and acceptance) and positive reappraisal (i.e., positive re-evaluation of
      negative events) can mutually benefit one another to promote well-being. The current study
      explored the effects of a randomly-assigned Mindful-Reappraisal intervention (n=36) compared
      to Reappraisal-Only (n=34) and an active control (n=36) on university students' daily affect
      over five days. Time by condition interactions were analyzed with planned contrasts and
      multilevel growth modelling.

    <textblock>
      The University student lifestyle can lead to heightened stress, anxiety, and burnout. To
      promote mental health, brief and cost-effective interventions teaching beneficial emotion
      regulation techniques can not only counteract the negative but also foster positive
      functioning. The tools of mindfulness (i.e., objective awareness and acceptance) and positive
      reappraisal (i.e., positive re-evaluation of negative events) can mutually benefit one
      another to promote well-being. However, there is currently little research testing the
      viability of brief, self-administered interventions combining training of mindfulness and
      positive reappraisal. The current study explored the effects of a randomly-assigned
      Mindful-Reappraisal intervention (n=36) compared to Reappraisal-Only (n=34) and an active
      control (n=36) on university students' daily affect over five days. Time by condition
      interactions were analyzed with planned contrasts and multilevel growth modelling.

    <description>Participants were instructed to independently practice the Self-Administered Reappraisal-Only Exercise in the evening for five days. First, participants recalled a negative event from that day and then followed the positive reappraisal instructions available online. This involved thinking about how one could grow, learn or benefit from the negative event in any way possible.</description>

    <description>Participants were instructed to independently practice the Self-Administered Mindful-Reappraisal Exercise in the evening for five days. First, participants recalled a negative event from that day and then followed the Mindful-Reappraisal instructions available online. This involved thinking about the negative event in an objective, non-judgmental way, then following the Reappraisal-Only instructions, and closing off with a brief mindfulness breathing technique.</description>
