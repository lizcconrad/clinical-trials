      Children with developmental disabilities and children's rehabilitation common case
      investigation: Long-term follow-up study.

    <textblock>
      Three fundamental goals of early rehabilitation for children with DD are: optimizing body
      function within each child's prognostic potential, preventing the development of secondary
      conditions that impact life-long health, and promoting children's participation in their
      lives. Knowledge of these developmental patterns of FPLA may be helpful in understanding,
      anticipating, and managing the problems of these patients. The investigators hypothesize that
      the course of developmental patterns in Function and Participation in Life Activities (FPLA)
      of patients with DD evolves with their age. The levels of functional recovery included
      developmental function, activity, participation, and quality of life (QOL). The aim of this
      study is to investigate the longitudinal outcomes in patients with DD evaluated by
      developmental function, activity, participation, and QOL. Additionally, the predictors in the
      initial stage in determining the final developmental patterns in FPLA of these children will
      be identified.
