  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin, an FDA-approved drug for the
      treatment of type II diabetes, is a safe and effective treatment to decrease the progression
      of geographic atrophy in non-diabetic patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-blind, randomized, evaluation of the safety and efficacy of
      metformin use to decrease geographic atrophy (GA) progression in non-diabetic patients with
      dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Approximately 100 study subjects throughout four
      separate study sites will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment group and the
      observation group. The treatment group will be assigned to the study intervention (oral
      Metformin) for 18 months while the observation group will receive no intervention for 18
      months, instead continuing with standard of care ophthalmic exams and close monitoring of
      their disease. Throughout the 18 month study period, the progression of subjects' GA or
      drusen growth will be measured via ocular imaging taken at standard of care follow-up
      examinations, including fundus autofluorescence imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT),
      and fundus photography.

    <description>Subjects assigned to the Metformin study arm will be assessed at each follow-up eye exam to confirm ocular safety of metformin. The Data Safety and Management Board for this study will also assess the safety of metformin at different time points throughout the study. They will formally meet to discuss study subject safety at 25% enrollment and 75% enrollment. The potential for ocular side effects due to metformin is thought to be very low, due to the large number of diabetic patients who take this drug and are followed closely for diabetic retinopathy or other ocular disease.</description>

Infrequent side effects of metformin (severe):

Reaction due to an Allergy
Subjects assigned to the Metformin study arm will be assessed for these side-effects at each follow-up eye exam to confirm ocular safety of metformin. The Data Safety and Management Board for this study will also assess the safety of metformin at different time points throughout the study.

    <description>This arm will be receiving the study drug, Metformin, for the duration of the 18 month study. They will begin this drug on a low dose of Metformin, increasing the dosage in a step-wise fashion to avoid unwanted gastrointestinal discomfort, a common side effect when patients begin taking Metformin. During the 18 month study, subjects assigned to this arm will have 3 follow-up exams after the initial enrollment exam, at 6 month intervals.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be &gt;/= 55 years of age

          -  Subject must have evidence of advanced dry AMD, defined by the characteristic presence
             of drusen and/or pigmentary changes as well as geographic atrophy

          -  Subject must have clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation

          -  Subject must be able to swallow capsules

          -  Study eye must have best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20-20/400

          -  Subject must be willing and able to pay for monthly prescription of Metformin HCl for
             18 months in the event that their insurance carrier will not cover the cost of the
             drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with insufficient baseline size of geographic atrophy, less than 1.25 mm2
             (0.5 Macular Photocoagulation Study Disc Areas). GA is defined as one or more
             well-defined and often circular patches of partial or complete depigmentation of the
             RPE, typically with exposure of underlying choroidal blood vessels. Even if much of
             the RPE appears to be preserved and large choroidal vessels are not visible, a round
             patch of RPE partial depigmentation may be classified as early GA. The GA in the study
             eye must be able to be photographed in its entirety, and it must not be contiguous
             with any areas of peripapillary atrophy, which can complicate area measurements.

          -  Subjects who are already taking metformin for another purpose

          -  Subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes

          -  Subjects with compromised kidney function:

          -  Serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL for males and ≥1.4 mg/dL for females

          -  Subjects with moderate to severe heart failure (Class III or IV, New York Heart
             Association Functional Classifications)

          -  Subjects with Child's class C cirrhosis

          -  Evidence of retinal atrophy due to causes other than atrophic AMD.

          -  Subjects who have had anti-VEGF injections or active choroidal neovascularization in
             the study eye during the last 12 months

          -  Current evidence or history of ocular disorders in the study eye that in the opinion
             of the investigator confounds study outcome measures, including (but not limited to):

               1. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy involving 10 or more hemorrhages or
                  microaneurysms, or active proliferative diabetic retinopathy

               2. Branch or central retinal vein or artery occlusion

               3. Macular hole

               4. Pathologic myopia

               5. Uveitis

               6. Pseudovitelliform maculopathy
