    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the clinical results of patella resurfacing or not under subvastus
      approach in total knee arthroplasty. Even though the excellent results of total knee
      arthroplasty(TKA), there is persistent controversy over whether or not to replace the
      patella. Anterior knee pain continued to be a unsolved problem of TKA patients. Some surgeons
      always performed patella resurfacing during total knee arthroplasty but the others didn't do
      that. It's up to surgeon's preference. There were several studies of patellar resurfacing or
      not in TKA. But previous studies almost have been done under other approach, not a subvastus
      approach.

      This study prospectively randomized patients receiving bilateral TKA with patellar
      resurfacing or not in each knee. Patients preference and clinical results was investigated in
      both knee of same patients who received patellar resurfacing or not during minimum 2 year
      follow up.

      The primary objective of this work was to compare pain, stiffness and function between groups
      at minimum 2 year postoperatively. Secondarily, we compared pain, patient preference at
      minimum 2 year postoperatively. The investigators hypothesized that there would be no
      difference between the two groups of subjects in the measured outcomes.

      Patients receiving TKA were prospectively enrolled before surgery and randomized
      intraoperatively to either receive patella replacement or not in both knee of same patients.
      Subjects were assessed pre-operatively and at 6 months, 1, 2 years postoperatively for pain,
      function, and stiffness using a disease-specific (Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis
      Index [WOMAC]) . Other measurements like Knee Society score, Feller's score, Patient
      satisfaction (VAS) also checked pre-operatively and at 6 months, 1, 2 years postoperatively.
