  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether carnosine supplementation in overweight/obese
      individuals can improve insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance by decreasing sub
      clinical inflammation.

      The investigators hypothesise that carnosine supplementation will reduce type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular risk factors by lowering chronic low-grade inflammation (CLI), oxidative
      stress, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and advanced lipoxidation end products
      (ALEs).

      Aim :To determine the capacity of carnosine supplementation to decrease major risk factors
      for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and identify metabolic pathways involved,
      specifically by:

        1. Reducing diabetes risk (insulin sensitivity; secretory function and glucose tolerance)

        2. Improving cardiovascular risk factors (lipids; arterial (aortic) stiffness; central
           blood pressure (cBP); endothelial function).

        3. Decreasing the CLI, oxidative stress, AGEs, and ALEs, and increase detoxification of
           reactive carbonyl species (RCSs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular risk factors including type 2 diabetes underpin a major threat to the globe
      and result in a heavy health and financial burden across the healthcare system. Treating type
      2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is expensive and often unsatisfactory. Current
      medications bring unwanted side effects, and often merely delay rather than prevent type 2
      diabetes complications and cardiovascular disease. As a further concern, the micro- and
      macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes often start developing before actual
      diagnosis. Diabetes prevention and treatment through weight loss and exercise programs is a
      difficult and costly public health measure, leaving the tidal wave of type 2 diabetes to
      swell even more. An alternative is urgently needed: a low-cost safe approach, easy to
      implement at population level.

      Could carnosine be that alternative? The evidence suggests carnosine has significant
      metabolic impact and presents such an alternative. A naturally occurring dipeptide, carnosine
      is already emerging as a human therapy in exercise physiology, heart failure, cataract
      prevention and treatment, neurology, and psychiatry. A promising further use may derive from
      its effect on cardiovascular risk factors. Metabolic research, though confined to animal
      studies, strongly suggests that carnosine supplementation aids the prevention and treatment
      of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease - by virtue of its anti-inflammatory,
      antioxidative, and anti-glycating effects. The investigators conducted the first pilot data
      in human and demonstrate relationships among carnosine, obesity, insulin resistance, and
      dyslipidemia. Put briefly, the pilot weighs strongly in favour of carnosine as a means of
      reducing cardiovascular risk in humans.

      Too good to be true? Apart from its excellent side-effect profile, carnosine is inexpensive
      and seemingly safe (available as an over-the-counter food additive), making it prima facie
      ideal for population use. In this setting research is now urgently needed - to test the
      significant metabolic potential of carnosine to address a major health problem.

      The investigators propose a comprehensive double-blind placebo-controlled human trial to
      investigate the effects of carnosine supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors. If the
      investigators demonstrate a role in reducing risk factors for type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese non-diabetic humans, the public health
      implications will be revolutionary, offering the world a genuine low cost, accessible,
      intervention to curtail the advance of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

    <measure>Change in insulin sensitivity measured by euglycaemic glucose clamp</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The clamp will be used to measure insulin sensitivity. The clamp is initiated by an intravenous bolus injection of insulin (9milliUnit/kg). Insulin is then constantly infused at a rate of 40 milliUnit.m-2.min-1 for 120 min into an arm vein, whilst glucose is variably infused to maintain euglycaemia. Plasma glucose values will be monitored every 5 minutes during the clamp and the variable infusion rate of glucose is adjusted to maintain blood glucose at a constant value of 5mmol/L.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in markers of endothelial dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is done using non-invasive peripheral arterial tomography (PAT; endothelium-dependent digital pulse amplitude testing (EndoPAT), Itamar Medical Ltd, Israel), which records continuous plethysmo¬graphic signals of the finger arterial pulse wave. Finger plethysmographic probes are placed on each index finger; and after a 5 min equilib¬ration period, a blood pressure cuff on the non-dominant arm is inflated to 60 mmHg above systolic for 5 min and then deflated to induce reactive hyperaemia. Measurements of post-occlusion changes (reactive hyperaemia PAT: RH-PAT) are continued for 10 min. Results are normalised to the non-occluded arm, compensating for potential systemic changes (RH-PAT ratio).</description>
