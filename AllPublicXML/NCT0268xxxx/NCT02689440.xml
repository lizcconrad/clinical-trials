  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving half of the recommended FDA
      approved dose of dasatinib can help to control CML as effectively as the full dose of
      dasatinib.

      Researchers also want to learn if combining venetoclax with dasatinib after 3 months of
      dasatinib alone is helpful in controlling CML compared to dasatinib alone.

      The safety of the combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of CML. It is considered investigational to give a lower dose of dasatinib to
      treat CML. Venetoclax is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is considered investigational to give venetoclax in
      combination with dasatinib to patients with CML.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 140 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      treatment based on when you join the study.

        -  If you join the study before April 1, 2018, you will receive dasatinib alone.

        -  If you join the study after April 1, 2018, you will receive dasatinib alone for 3 months
           and then dasatinib in combination with venetoclax.

      If you are assigned to receive venetoclax, the dose of venetoclax you receive will also
      depend on when you join the study. The first group of 6 patients to receive venetocax will
      take 3 different doses of venetoclax for the first 3 days (called a &quot;ramp-up&quot; period) and
      will be watched closely for up to 24 hours after receiving venetoclax. If side effects are
      seen in the first 6 patients, the next group will receive 3 different doses of venetoclax
      starting and ending at a lower dose than the first group for 3 weeks. Based on the results
      seen, researchers will choose a dose of venetoclax to give to future patients enrolled. This
      is called the highest tolerable dose.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take dasatinib tablets
      by mouth one (1) time each day. You should take each dose of dasatinib with a meal.

      The dose of dasatinib you receive may be changed if the study doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest.

      If you are assigned to receive it, after receiving dasatinib for 3 months, you will begin to
      take venetoclax by mouth every day with dasatinib for up to 3 years. You should take your
      dose of venetoclax at the same time as your dose of dasatinib, when possible. This is called
      combination therapy. The dose of venetoclax you receive may be changed, if the study doctor
      thinks it is in your best interest.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue to take dasatinib for up to 15 years and venetoclax for up to 3 years. After
      3 years of combination therapy, you may be able to stop taking both drugs or you may continue
      to take dasatinib alone as maintenance therapy. Your doctor will discuss this with you. You
      will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after your last dose of study drugs.

      Study Visits:

      While you are receiving dasatinib alone, every 1-2 weeks for the first 4 weeks , every 2-6
      weeks after that for the first 3 months, then every 3 months after that during Year 1, and
      then every 3-6 months until Year 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      While you are receiving combination therapy, every 1-2 weeks for 4 weeks, then every 2-4
      weeks until 3 months after the start of combination therapy, then every 3 months for the
      first year from the start of therapy, then every 3-6 months until Year 2, then as needed
      after that, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests

      You may have this blood draw more or less often, if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      If it is more convenient to you and the study doctor agrees, you may be able to have these
      blood draws and physical exams performed at a local lab or by a doctor closer to your home.
      The results of these tests will be sent to the study doctor at MD Anderson for review. The
      study doctor will discuss this option with you.

      At Months 3, 6, 9, and 12, then every 3-6 months for the first 3 years, then every 6-12
      months after that blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease.
      If the disease appears to be responding to the study drug(s), you will not need these blood
      draws after Year 1.

      You will have a physical exam every 3 months for the first year, then every 6-12 months after
      that. You may also be called to ask if you have had any side effects. Each phone call should
      take about 5 minutes.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Ph-positive or BCR-ABL positive CML in early chronic phase CML (i.e.,
             time from diagnosis is12 months). Except for hydroxyurea and/or 1 to 2 doses of
             cytarabine patients, patients must have received no or minimal prior therapy, defined
             as &lt;1 month (30 days) of prior FDA approved TKI. -- Clonal evolution defined as the
             presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities other than the Ph chromosome has
             historically been included as a criterion for accelerated phase. However, patients
             with clonal evolution as the only criterion of accelerated phase have a significantly
             better prognosis, and when present at diagnosis may not impact the prognosis at all.
             Thus, patients with clonal evolution and no other criteria for accelerated phase will
             be eligible for this study.

          2. ECOG performance of 0-2.

          3. Adequate end organ function, defined as the following: total bilirubin &lt;1.5x ULN, SGPT
             &lt;3x ULN, creatinine &lt;1.5x ULN.

          4. Patients must sign an informed consent indicating they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study, in keeping with the policies of the hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. NYHA cardiac class 3-4 heart disease

          2. Cardiac Symptoms: Patients meeting the following criteria are not eligible unless
             cleared by Cardiology: 1. Uncontrolled angina within 3 months. 2.Diagnosed or
             suspected congenital long QT syndrome. 3. Any history of clinically significant
             ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or
             Torsades de pointes). 4. Prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (&gt; 460
             msec). 5.History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including:
             Diagnosed congenital bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease) Diagnosed
             acquired bleeding disorder within one year (e.g., acquired anti-factor VIII
             antibodies)

          3. Patients with active, uncontrolled psychiatric disorders include: psychosis, major
             depression, and bipolar disorders.

          4. Subject is known to be positive for HIV. (HIV testing is not required.)

          5. Evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not
             limited to: 1) Uncontrolled and/or active systemic infection (viral, bacterial or
             fungal). 2) Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) requiring treatment.
             Note: subjects with serologic evidence of prior vaccination to HBV (i.e. hepatitis B
             surface (HBs) antigen negative-, anti-HBs antibody positive and anti-hepatitis B core
             (HBc) antibody negative) or positive anti-HBc antibody from intravenous
             immunoglobulins (IVIG) may participate.

          6. Women of pregnancy potential must practice an effective method of birth control during
             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to
             study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the
             importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Women must continue
             birth control for the duration of the trial and at least 3 months after the last dose
             of study drug. Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded. All WOCBP must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to first receiving investigational product. If the
             pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive investigational product and
             must not be enrolled in the study.

          7. Patients in late chronic phase (i.e., time from diagnosis to treatment &gt;12 months),
             accelerated or blast phase are excluded. The definitions of CML phases are as follows:
             a.Early chronic phase: time from diagnosis to therapy 12 months. Late chronic phase:
             time from diagnosis to therapy &gt; 12 months. b. Blastic phase: presence of 30% blasts
             or more in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. c.Accelerated phase CML: presence of
             any of the following features: • Peripheral or marrow blasts 15% or more • Peripheral
             or marrow basophils 20% or more • Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 x 109/L unrelated to therapy
             • Documented extramedullary blastic disease outside liver or spleen.
