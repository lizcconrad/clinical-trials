    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with liver metastases or liver cancer. SBRT is
      a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Combining MRI
      with SBRT may help doctors to highlight the tissues surrounding the tumor better.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of utilizing an MRI-guided tri-60Co teletherapy system for liver
      SBRT, as determined the treating radiation oncologist's ability to accurately visualize and
      align to the target lesion(s).

      II. To assess the feasibility of using a three versus five fraction scheme, for one versus
      multiple (i.e., =&lt; 5) target lesions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tumor local control (LC), disease specific survival (DSS), and overall
      survival (OS).

      II. To gather biomarkers that may elucidate differential immunogenic responses from the three
      versus the five fraction SBRT regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MRI-guided Tri-60Co teletherapy SBRT 3-5 fractions over 1-2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 4-6 weeks, and
      then every 3 months for 2 years.
