  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of Pigment Epithelial Detachments (PEDs) in neovascular Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (nAMD), Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) and idiopathic Poplypoidal
      Choroidal Vasculopathy (iPCV) can present a diagnostic challenge in the elderly population;
      despite detailed diagnostic testing to differentiate these three conditions, misdiagnosis and
      mistreatment still occurs. One potential way of differentiating these three conditions might
      be to compare cytokine profiles in nAMD versus CSR versus iPCV. This information may be
      useful in creating a diagnostic aqueous cytokine and hormone profile to differentiate between
      nAMD, CSR and iPCV.

      The primary goal of this study is to compare baseline aqueous cytokine and cortisol levels
      between nAMD, CSR, and iPCV patients and age-matched cataract controls. The secondary
      objective is to assess intra-group changes in visual and anatomical outcomes in nAMD, CSR and
      iPCV patients with PED treated with aflibercept and correlate these changes to baseline
      cytokines. We will not be comparing visual and anatomical changes between groups after
      treatment in this study.
