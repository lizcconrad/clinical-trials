      Thirty male monk volunteers who matched with the including criteria were divided randomly
      into two groups. Both groups were practiced to brush their teeth with scrubbing method for
      one week. Then, each group were instructed to do different additional protocol regimen- group
      A have to do mouth washing and tooth brushing and group B have to practice tongue cleaning
      addition to tooth brushing for three weeks. At the fifth week, both groups were instructed to
      practice tooth brushing, mouth washing and tongue cleaning. Three different volatile sulfur
      compounds were measured by oral chroma. Tongue characteristics, oral examination were checked
      as the outcomes of this study.
