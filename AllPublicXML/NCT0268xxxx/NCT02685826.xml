    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study to determine the recommended dose and
      regimen of durvalumab in combination with lenalidomide (LEN) with and without dexamethasone
      (dex) in subjects with Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM).

      The study will consist of a dose-finding phase as well as a parallel dose-expansion phase to
      determine the optimal regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose-finding phase will determine recommended dose (RD) for durvalumab in combination
      with lenalidomide (LEN) with and without dexamethasone (dex) in a 28-day treatment cycle.
      Three treatment Cohorts (A, B, and C) will be enrolled in parallel:

        -  Cohort A: durvalumab + LEN +dex on high risk Transplant non-eligible (TNE) Newly
           diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) subjects;

        -  Cohort B: durvalumab + LEN +dex (Dex for up to 12 cycles) on ≥ 65 years old TNE NDMM
           subjects who are not high risk;

        -  Cohort C: durvalumab + LEN as maintenance on post-transplant high risk NDMM subjects;
           Based on experience with durvalumab for other indications, the initial dose of
           durvalumab will be 1500 mg for each treatment cohort. The dose of durvalumab might be
           de-escalated to 750 mg level.

      The dose of LEN will be 25 mg (adjustable per the CrCl) value on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day
      treatment cycle for subjects on Cohort A and B. The dose of LEN will be 10 mg on Days 1 to 21
      of each 28-day treatment cycle for subjects on Cohort C.

      The dose of dex will be 40 mg/day (for subjects ≤ 75 years old) or 20 mg/day (for subjects &gt;
      75 years old) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle for Cohort A and Cohort B (for up to
      12 cycles).

      Initially, 6 subjects will be enrolled into each cohort and each will receive 1500 mg
      durvalumab.

      The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period will be the first treatment cycle.

        -  If ≤ 1 of the 6 initial subjects experience a DLT within the first cycle, then the
           doseexpansion phase may be initiated with durvalumab 1500 mg as the recommended dose
           (RD);

        -  If 2 or more of the 6 initial subjects experience a DLT within the first cycle, then the
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been exceeded and de-escalation to durvalumab 750 mg
           level after review of safety and PK/Pd of the initial 6 subjects by the DRT.

      Any of the cohorts may be removed from the study based on emerging PK, Pd, efficacy or safety
      data.

      Dose de-escalation will only occur after review of safety (DLT) and possibly PK/Pd data by
      the Dose Review Team ( DRT).

      Note: In the US, two treatment arms (A and B) will be enrolled in parallel. Cohort C will
      enroll upon completion of at least 4 cycles of follow-up for safety assessment of Cohorts A
      and B.
