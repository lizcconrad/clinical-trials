  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic examinations and particularly long-lasting interventions can be uncomfortable for
      patients. Pain and vasovagal reactions are common. Therefore, the implementation is generally
      recommended under sedation and also carried out in practice here.

      The vital signs monitoring to avoid complications is dictated by current national guidelines.
      Necessary measures of monitoring include pulse oximetry and blood pressure measurements. In
      patients with severe heart disease an ECG recording should be used additionally. Moreover,
      the guidelines require that the sedation is clinically monitored continuously to avoid an
      unwanted anesthetic stage. Such evaluation, however, is often difficult under clinical
      conditions and even counterproductive, since a constant response and tactile stimulation of
      the patient (to check clinically the depth level of sedation ), interrupts endoscopic complex
      intervention. However, clinical most relevant aspect is the avoidance of unrecognized
      transition of patients from the stage of deep sedation in an anesthetic stage.

      Current recommendations do not take into account new study results from a gender perspective,
      which showed that women and men need a different wake-up time using the EEG derivation means
      by using the Narcotrend after total intravenous anesthesia, which may be due to different
      total doses of sedatives needed. However, the research group has been demonstrated in a
      previous study that most likely caused by the use of EEG monitoring (Narcotrend) an effective
      adaptation of sedation, in particular a more rapid recovery time by a lower dose of the
      administered sedative for a continuous sedation stage D0-D2 endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography-(ERCP).

      In the presented study the investigators evaluate the extent of gender differences in the
      wake-up time after sedation with propofol during colonoscopy when using EEG monitoring.

      Endoscopic examinations and particularly long-lasting interventions can be uncomfortable for
      patients. Pain and vasovagal reactions are common. Therefore, the implementation is generally
      recommended under sedation and also carried out in practice here.

      In interventional and longer lasting interventions (for example colonoscopy, endoscopic
      ultrasonography, ERCP) as opposed to purely diagnostic examinations is often deep
      sedation.Use of propofol in terms of sedation efficacy and the wake-up time or quality is
      superior to the use of benzodiazepines (plus opiates) , while patient safety is the same.

      The vital signs monitoring to avoid complications is dictated by current national guidelines.
      Necessary measures of monitoring include pulse oximetry and blood pressure measurements. In
      patients with severe heart disease an ECG recording should be used additionally. Moreover,
      the guidelines require that the sedation is clinically monitored continuously to avoid an

      time after sedation with propofol during colonoscopy when using EEG monitoring.

      Included are patients who undergo diagnostic or therapeutic colonoscopy, which is performed
      under sedation with propofol.
