  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the usability of long-term stored H5N1 antigen
      and adjuvant. The study is designed to assist in stockpile management by assessing the
      safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity long-term stored influenza A/Vietnam/H5N1 vaccine
      when administered with or without MF59® adjuvant.

      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and
      immunogenicity of 2 doses of long-term stored inactivated monovalent influenza A/Vietnam/H5N1
      virus vaccine administered intramuscularly with or without MF59 adjuvant in healthy males and
      nonpregnant females, aged 18 to 49 years, inclusive. This study is designed to assist in
      stockpile management and will assess the usability of long-term stored H5N1 antigen (ie,
      stored &gt;10 years) and adjuvant (ie, stored &gt;5 years).
