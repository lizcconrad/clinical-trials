      Renamezin Capsule (an oral adsorbent) lowers indoxyl sulfate levels in patient with chronic
      renal failure.

      120 patients with chronic renal failure(baseline serum creatinine:1.5-5.0mg/dl).

      Renamezin is administered 6.0mg/day. The treatment period is 2 months. The change in serum
      indoxyl sulfate will be evaluated.
