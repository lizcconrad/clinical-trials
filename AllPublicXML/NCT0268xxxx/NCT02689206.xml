  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1278863 is an orally available, hypoxia-inducible factor - prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor,
      currently being investigated as a treatment for anemia associated with chronic kidney
      disease. GSK1278863 has been given as a once daily regimen in clinical studies to date.
      However, physicians in countries that use a three-times weekly hemodialysis schedule prefer
      to give the anemia medicine at the same time as the dialysis session. This study will test
      how well GSK1278863 can maintain hemoglobin levels when given three-times weekly, for 29
      days.

      This study will describe the relationship between hemoglobin and GSK1278863 given three-times
      weekly. The data from this study will allow for conversion of once daily doses to three-times
      weekly doses.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants on Hemodialysis (HD) with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) switching from Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent (ESA) treatment were recruited in this randomized, dose-ranging study. Participants with hemoglobin (Hgb) values between 9.0- 11.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) were considered as eligible for recruitment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 211 participants were screened; of which 108 were screen failures and 103 were randomized to receive at least one dose of either placebo or 10, 15, 25 or 30 milligrams (mg) of daprodustat (dapro). One participant who was randomized to the placebo group, erroneously received 25 mg dapro treatment throughout the 29-day treatment period</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hgb Levels at Day 29</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for measurement of Hgb values. Baseline is the average of Hgb measured at Week -2 and Day 1 visits. Change from Baseline at Day 29 was defined as post dose value at Day 29 minus Baseline value. The analysis was performed on intent-to-treat (ITT) Population which comprised of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, had a Baseline and at least one corresponding on treatment assessment, including Hgb.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were collected at Day 1, Day 15 and Day 29 for pharmacodynamic analysis of effect Dapro three times weekly dose regimens on CHr. Day 1 values were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. The change from Baseline at Day 29 post-Baseline time point was calculated.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC[0-t]) and AUC From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC[0-inf]) of Dapro</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of dapro. The data from each PK sampling day was combined to generate a single profile, and normalized to a 24-hour period to create a “Day 1” profile for non-compartmental analysis (NCA). Metabolite plasma concentrations were analyzed but PK parameters could not be calculated as the metabolites were partially eliminated through dialysis and the dialysis start and end times were not consistent on both PK days. Therefore, a representative metabolite PK profile could not be generated. The analysis was performed on PK Population, which comprised of all participants from whom a PK sample has been obtained and analyzed. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate clinical chemistry parameters including sodium, potassium, glucose, calcium and phosphate. Change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters at Day 15, Day 29 and Day 43 are presented. Day 1 values were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate clinical chemistry parameters including albumin and protein. Change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters at Day 15, Day 29 and Day 43 are presented. Day 1 values were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate clinical chemistry parameters including bilirubin, direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin. Change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters at Day 15, Day 29 and Day 43 are presented. Day 1 values were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Indirect Bilirubin Levels</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate clinical chemistry parameters including bilirubin, direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin. Change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters at Day 15, Day 29 and Day 43 are presented. Day 1 values were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>
          <population>Safety Population. One participant who was randomized to the placebo group, erroneously received 25mg daprodustat treatment throughout the 29-day treatment period. This subject is counted within the Daprodustat 25mg treatment group for all PK population and safety population analyses.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Leukocytes, Neutrophils, Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Platelets Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate clinical hematology parameters including leukocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets. Change from Baseline in clinical hematology parameters at Day 15, Day 29, Day 43 are presented. Day 1 values were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Single measurements of 12-lead ECG were obtained in supine position using an ECG machine to measure PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval and QTcB. Week -4 values were considered as Baseline values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values at Day 29 minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Vital sign measurements including SBP and DBP were taken in a seated or semi-supine position in the dialysis chair. SBP and DBP were measured pre-dialysis and post-dialysis. Pre-dialysis Baseline value was defined as SBP and DBP value obtained pre-dialysis on Day 1. Post-dialysis Baseline value was defined as SBP and DBP value obtained post-dialysis at Week -2. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pulse Rate Value at Pre-dialysis and Post-dialysis</title>
        <description>Vital sign measurements including pulse rate were taken in a seated or semi-supine position in the dialysis chair. Pulse rate was measured pre-dialysis and post-dialysis. Pre-dialysis Baseline value was defined as pulse rate value obtained pre-dialysis on Day 1. Post-dialysis Baseline value was defined as pulse rate value obtained post-dialysis at Week -2. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

          <description>Vital sign measurements including weight were taken in a seated or semi-supine position in the dialysis chair. Weight was measured post-dialysis. Post-dialysis Baseline value was defined as SBP and DBP value obtained post-dialysis at Week -2. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting post-Baseline visit values minus Baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>
