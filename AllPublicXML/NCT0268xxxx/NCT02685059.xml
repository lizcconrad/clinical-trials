    <textblock>
      To date no targeted agents are available to treat TNBC. Therefore chemotherapy is the only
      treatment option. TNBC often has a high amount of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes.
      Stimulating the immune cells of TNBC might therefore be an option for these patients to
      increase the pathological complete response. pCR is highly correlated with outcome in TNBC.

      Therefore the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to chemotherapy might be an
      additional option for these patients.

      To date no targeted agents are available to treat TNBC. Therefore chemotherapy is the only
      treatment option. TNBC often has a high amount of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes.
      Stimulating the immune cells of TNBC might therefore be an option for these patients to
      increase the pathological complete response. pCR is highly correlated with outcome in TNBC.

      Therefore the addition of a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to chemotherapy might be an
      additional option for these patients.

      The primary objective therefore is to compare the pathological complete response (pCR= ypT0
      ypN0) rates of neoadjuvant treatment of sequential, nab-Paclitaxel followed by EC +/- the
      PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 in patients with early triple negative breast cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent for all study according to local regulatory requirements
             prior to beginning specific protocol procedures.

          -  Complete baseline documentation must be sent to GBG Forschungs GmbH.

          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not
             allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively
             which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint.

          -  Tumor lesion in the breast or the nodes must be measurable in two dimensions,
             preferably by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation
             can be used as measurable lesion.

          -  Patients must be in the following stages of disease: cT1b - cT4a-d irrespective of
             nodal involvement.

        In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should be
        measured.

          -  Triple negative disease with centrally confirmed ER negative/PR negative/HER-2
             negative, and centrally confirmed Ki-67 value. ER negative is defined as &lt;1% stained
             cells, PR negative is defined as &lt;10% stained and HER2-negative is defined as either
             IHC 0/1+ or IHC 2+ and in-situ hybridisation (ISH) of either ratio &lt;2.0 or less than 6
             copies of HER2 per tumor cell. Stromal TILs will be evaluated in three groups: low
             immune infiltrate (0-10% stromal TILs) intermediate immune infiltrate (11-59% stromal
             TILs), LPBC 60-100% stromal TILs. PD-L1 status and other predefined markers will be
             prospectively assessed during the study. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
             breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the GBG central pathology
             laboratory prior to randomization.

          -  Age &gt;=18 years.

          -  ECOG Performance status 0-1.

          -  Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or
             shortening fraction) within 3 months prior to randomization. Results must be above the
             normal limit of the institution.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all
             women of childbearing potential. Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive
             potential (ie, post-menopausal by history: &gt;=60 years old and no menses for &gt;=1 year
             without an alternative medical cause; OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of
             bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.

          -  Complete staging work-up within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must
             have had breast imaging by breast ultrasound plus either bilateral mammography or
             breast MRI (one of those &lt;= 21 days). All patients must have had chest X-ray (PA and
             lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan (according to
             guidelines). In case of positive bone scan, bone X-ray is mandatory. Other tests may
             be performed as clinically indicated.

          -  Patients must be available and compliant for central diagnostics, treatment and
             follow-up.

          -  Laboratory requirements: Hematology, Hepatic function, Renal Function, Thyroid

          -  Inadequate general condition (not fit for dose-dense, dose-intensified
