  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoschisis is usually a rare self-limited disease and seldom shows progression. There a
      splitting of the neurosensory retina occurs usually in the inferior temporal. Patients
      usually have good visual acuity and are asymptomatic. Combination of an inner and outer layer
      hole is considered high risk factor for development of a schisis detachment. The most
      important differential diagnosis is an retinal detachment, since if misdiagnosed unnecessary
      treatment is provided. In clinical examination, both can appear very thin and transparent.

      Therefore exact diagnosis of retinoschisis and retinal detachment has to be assessed and
      regular follow-up controls have to be conducted for sufficient recognition of progression.
