    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, Phase IIa, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group
      study with the primary objective to assess the efficacy potential of GSK3196165 on pain, in
      subjects with active inflammatory hand osteoarthritis (HOA).

      Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled into the study, following a screening period of up
      to 4 weeks. The total treatment period will be 12 weeks, with the follow up period completing
      at Week 22. At least 40 subjects will be randomized across the two treatment arms, to either
      placebo or GSK3196165 in a 1:1 ratio.

             risk.

          -  A history of malignancy.

          -  Hereditary or acquired immunodeficiency disorder, including immunoglobulin deficiency.
