    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic
      cells(DC) vaccine combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with Advanced
      Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer with bone metastases. Experimental DC was transfected Ad5 vector
      coding mRNAs including suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1, MUC1 and Survivin,are used
      for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our previously preclinical study with DC
      vaccine combined with CIK cells, the investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.
