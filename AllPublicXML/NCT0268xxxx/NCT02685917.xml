  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of cartilage regeneration after marrow stimulation is well documented to be
      unpredictable, because they do not regenerate consistent amount of cartilage. To overcome the
      shortcomings of the microfracture technique, various augmentation techniques using synthetic
      collagen matrix, scaffolds or plug devices have been developed. However, their efficacy
      remains unclear. The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled study is to evaluate
      whether the microfracture in combination with collagen gel augmentation could improve the
      quality of cartilage regeneration in patients undergoing medial open wedge high tibial
      osteotomy (HTO) for the treatment of medial unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis (OA).

      CartiFill™ (atelocollagen, Sewon Cellontech, Seoul, Korea) was developed to to provide a
      matrix stability and to maintain the blood clot in the defect site, which promoted the
      cartilage regeneration by mesenchymal stem cell . It was a atelocollagen, highly purified
      porcine derived type collagen І that has been modified to virtually eliminate the risk of
      rejection by removal of telopeptide.

      The investigators randomized patients undergoing HTO in combination with microfracture to
      receive either microfracture alone (control group, n = 5) or microfracture with collagen
      augmentation (experimental group, n=6). At postoperative one year, the clinical outcome in
      terms of Visual Analogue Scale of pain level (VAS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome
      Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner scores were
      evaluated. In addition, second look arthroscopic examination and biopsy of regenerated
      cartilage were carried out when the HTO plate was removed at postoperative one year. Biopsy
      specimens were graded by International Cartilage Repair Society Visual Assessment Scale (ICRS
      II scores). Finally, radiologic outcome in terms of Magnetic Resonance Observation of
      Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scores was assessed using follow up MRI undertaken at
      postoperative one year.
