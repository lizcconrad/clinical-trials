  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find blood plasma based biomarkers of disease progression in
      neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is associated with the development of benign cutaneous
      tumors as well as a variety of malignancies. Analysis of plasma DNA and chemical composition
      may provide tools for diagnosis and follow-up of NF1. The hypothesis of the study is that
      NF1-associated tumor burden and malignant transformation of tumors can be detected in plasma.
      To test this hypothesis, Finnish patients with NF1 are recruited and blood sample is taken.
      Blood plasma is separated and analyzed chemically. DNA is then also extracted and quantified.

    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant hereditary multiorgan disease that causes both
      benign cutaneous neurofibromas and malignant tumors. Timely detection of malignant
      transformation in NF1 tumors is of great clinical importance. Also methods to easily monitor
      individual's overall tumor burden would be useful. Blood plasma is collected from NF1
      patients and age- and gender-matched controls. The samples are stored at -80 C until
      analysis. Free circulating plasma DNA is extracted and quantified using commercial reagents.
      Also a previously described chemical detection method to observe overall changes in plasma
      composition is utilized. The analysis results are compared between NF1 patients and healthy
      controls, and also correlated with NF1 tumor burden and diagnosis of malignancy during
      five-year follow-up.
