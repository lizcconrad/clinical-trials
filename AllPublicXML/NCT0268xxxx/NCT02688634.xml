  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cleft Lip and Palate surgical repair is one of the most common procedures performed by
      Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in the World. With this in mind, it is curious that no
      consensus exists regarding the usage of postoperative antibiotics or the effects this might
      have on wound complications such as cellulitis, dehiscence, or fistula formation. The
      surgical bed in cleft lip/palate repair is known to harbor a myriad of pathological
      organisms, indeed the human bite is one of the more clinically and microbiologically
      significant injuries to treat. This research study is to elucidate the role, if any, that
      prophylactic antibiotics have in the prevention of complications post cleft palate (CP) and
      VPI repair and potentially establish a new paradigm of care.

      This will be a randomized prospective research study. Participants who will undergo an
      elective CP or VPI surgery will be randomized to receive either 1) antibiotics or 2) nothing
      postoperatively. All participants will be evaluated for infection, fistula formation, and
      dehiscence upon discharge and at 30-day follow-up based on standards of care.

    <description>Analysis of infection is based on a 7 point scale to allow for broadened data but can be evaluated in a binary fashion for ≥ 4 indicating infection and &lt;4 as no infection. A χ2 test and Fisher's exact test for p&lt;0.05 will be used to determine significance of the difference in complication (cellulitis and upper respiratory infection) rates between the two groups.</description>
