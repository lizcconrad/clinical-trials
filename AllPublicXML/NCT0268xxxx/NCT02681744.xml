    <textblock>
      To examine the effects of resistance training on sarcopenic obesity in older women, a
      representative sample of older women from Brasília, Brazil (n&gt;244 subjects), will be
      recruited and invited to undergo body composition measurement using dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry. Moreover, the Sarcopenic Obesity index and isokinetic strength evaluations
      will be performed. It will be a single-blind randomized, controlled 24-week clinical trial,
      in which experimental group will receive a progressive resistance training program, meanwhile
      control group will receive instructions to maintain their lifestyle habits. Randomization
      will be conducted by computer-generated list in blocks of 10. Additionally, body composition,
      strength assessment, and sarcopenic index will collected and compared after the intervention
      period.

    <description>Participants from the experimental group will assign to the resistance training program undergo physician screening at rest and under cardiopulmonary exercise test conditions before starting the program. Following a three-week familiarization process, participants undergo one repetition maximum (1-RM) testing for each of the exercises of the training program. This procedure intended to determine exercise load and will be systematically repeated in four-week intervals. Volunteers will train thrice per week during 24 weeks. The training program will involve the following exercises: chest press, lat pulldown, knee extension, hamstrings curl, leg press, hip abduction.</description>
