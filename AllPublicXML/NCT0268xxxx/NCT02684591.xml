    <textblock>
      A subset of patients with NAFLD that have not been extensively studied are those infected
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for
      NAFLD or NASH. Additionally, there have been no significant clinical trials for HIV patients
      with NAFLD and there are no approved treatment options. We plan to conduct a randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the efficacy of 600 mg of
      Aramchol daily (including 200 mg tablet and 400 mg tablet) versus identical placebo given
      over 12 weeks to improve HIV-associated hepatic steatosis as measured by a validated and
      accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based technique.

      We plan to conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine
      the efficacy of Aramchol at 600 mg/day orally versus identical placebo given over 12 weeks to
      improve HIV-associated hepatic steatosis as measured by a validated and accurate magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI)-based technique. In this study, we propose to randomize up to 50
      patients with HIV-associated NAFLD to either Aramchol or placebo for 12 weeks. We plan to
      enroll a total of 55 patients, expecting some drop outs prior to randomization. After an
      initial evaluation for insulin sensitivity, liver fat measurement by MRI, and total body fat
      content by DEXA, patients will be randomized to receive either Aramchol 600 mg/day or placebo
      orally for 12 weeks. Patients will be monitored at regular intervals for symptoms of liver
      disease, side effects of medication, and serum biochemical and metabolic indices. Patients
      will also be assessed for continued HIV viral load suppression and continued tolerance of
      antiretroviral therapy. At the end of 12 weeks, patients will have a repeat medical
      evaluation, liver fat measurement, and total body fat content measurement. Pre and post
      treatment liver fat by MRI, ALT/AST, HbA1c, CRP, insulin sensitivity, and DEXA for whole body
      fat will be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be improvement in
      liver fat by MRI. Secondary end points will be improvement in total body fat, insulin
      sensitivity and liver biochemistry.

             American Diabetes Association Criteria

          3. Lipodystrophy will be confirmed on both clinical and radiologic assessment and defined
             as: Clinical history and/or exam by the study physician with signs of either
             facial,temporal, upper or lower extremity lipo-atrophy, Documented abdominal fat
             accumulation with presence of hepatic steatosis on MRI

          4. An MRI-determined fat fraction classification threshold (≥5%) will be used to confirm
             subjects. MR examinations will include four research sequences (three imaging
             sequences and one single-voxel spectroscopy sequence) that have been developed and
             refined by Dr. Sirlin, allowing for the measurement of liver fat fraction and newer
             candidate MR biomarkers for future NAFLD studies. MR examinations will last 20-30
             minutes and will be performed without contrast agents. Subjects will be scanned at
             1.5T. To assess sequence repeatability, two sequences per subject, block randomized,
             will be run three times. For MR elastography, MR imaging will be done which will
             include placing a vibrating paddle over the abdomen while images are obtained. A
             comprehensive screening questionnaire will be utilized prior to subjects having an
             MRI. Experienced research MR technologists will perform MR examinations under the
             supervision of Dr. Sirlin.
