  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade optical coherence tomography (OCT) extended the possibilities for in
      vivo macula diagnostic and was increasingly used for pre- and post-operative imaging of
      retinal diseases. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) with its increased
      scanning speed and image-resolution provides more detailed information of microstructures in
      the macula.

      Epiretinal membrane (ERM), lamellar macular hole, macular hole and vitreomacular traction
      syndrome are disorders involving the posterior pole of the eyeball with consecutive vision
      loss. In patients with loss of vision and metamorphopsia disturbing their lifestyle,
      vitrectomy and membrane peeling is usually performed to remove traction and the ERM.

      Different study groups showed that intraoperative use of SD-OCT is possible and improves the
      quality of peeling surgery.

      The aim of the study is to assess the benefits and limits of intraoperative OCT (i-OCT), for
      example whether I-OCT assisted membrane peeling is possible without use of dyes for enabling
      better localistion of the ERM during surgery and to compare that scheme with different &quot;gold
      standard&quot; dyes for peeling such as membrane blue dual and triamcinolone. Rationale for that
      study is to work out which setting enables best visualisation of ERM and ILM (ILM) in i-OCT.
      A limitation of that method seems to be visualisation of the inner limiting membrane, so that
      dying of the ILM will probably be still necessary in all cases where ILM-peeling is sheduled.
