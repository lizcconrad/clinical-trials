      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound for kidney
      malignancies

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, prospective study designed to evaluate the accuracy of
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with microbubble contrast agent (perflutren lipid;
      Definity®) to identify malignancy in patients with kidney disease, a known risk factor for
      kidney malignancy, in whom a conventional ultrasound (US) shows an indeterminate cystic
      kidney lesion.

      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the sensitivity of CEUS in diagnosing
      kidney malignancy in patients with a risk factor for kidney malignancy and compare it to the
      current gold standard test in this patient population. Secondary analysis will include more
      optimal contrast-enhanced imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) in a subset of patients who can receive these studies. The study outcome will lead to
      immediate clinical application in patients with chronic kidney disease. Given the
      cost-effectiveness and adverse event profile, it has excellent potential to become
      established as first line diagnostics in the general patient population as well.

    <description>Activate by shaking for 45 seconds using VIALMIX. Use activated product within 5 minutes. Infusion: The recommended infusion dose for activated perflutren is via an IV infusion of 1.3 mL added to 50 mL of preservative-free saline. The rate of infusion should be initiated at 4.0 mL/minute, but titrated as necessary to achieve optimal image enhancement, not to exceed 10 mL/minute per P.I. approval</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for the present study, patients must meet the following criteria:

          1. Able to provide written informed consent

          2. Willing to comply with protocol requirements

          3. At least 18 years of age

          4. Have kidney disease, defined as either CKD II-VI, determined by estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;90 and derived from serum creatinine measurements, or
             albuminuria/proteinuria, determined by albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to
             creatinine ratio of &gt;30mg/gm, or having received a kidney transplant

          5. Have at least one kidney lesion identified but incompletely characterized on a
             non-contrasted US, CT, or MR exam for which the patient's provider recommends
             follow-up studies or further evaluation with an additional imaging tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded for enrollment:

          1. Critically ill or medically unstable and whose critical course during the observation
             period would be unpredictable (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
             requiring oxygen)

          2. Known hypersensitivity to sulfur hexafluoride or to any component of perflutren lipid
             (Definity®)

          3. Right to left shunt, severe pulmonary hypertension (Pulmonary artery pressure
             &gt;90mmHg), or adult respiratory distress syndrome

               -  Severe arrhythmia (i.e. ventricular tachycardia, flutter fibrillation;
                  ventricular premature complexes occurring close to the preceding T- wave,
                  multifocal complexes).
