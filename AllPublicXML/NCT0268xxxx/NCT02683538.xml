      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical feasibility and short-term outcome of
      switching monopolar RFA using a separable cluster electrode in patients with primary and
      secondary liver malignancies.

    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of minimal invasive treatment methods and it has been
      showing comparable overall survival with surgery in early or small hepatocellular carcinomas
      (HCCs) and better cost-effectiveness. However, it is suffering from high local tumor
      progression (LTP) rate. To reduce LTP rate, creation of large ablative zone has been
      attempted in various strategies. A separable cluster electrode is a new type of RFA
      electrode. It consists of three individual applicators and the applicators can be
      incorporated as a single handle such as a cluster electrode, and can be separated as three
      electrodes, depending on operators' needs. It allows high flexibility to operators and the
      preclinical results were promising. Herein, we want to evaluate the clinical feasibility of
      the electrodes by observing major complication rates, technical success rate and 12-months
      LTP rate.
