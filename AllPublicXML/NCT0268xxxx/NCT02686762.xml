    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving subjects
      with a diagnosis of &quot;definite NASH&quot; with fibrosis (excluding cirrhosis) as determined by the
      central histopathologist. Upon successful screening, subjects will be randomized to receive
      either emricasan 50 mg BID or emricasan 5 mg BID or matching placebo BID.

             syndrome

          5. Willingness to utilize effective contraception (for both males and females of
             childbearing potential) from Screening to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug

          6. If on vitamin E or pioglitazone, subjects must have been on a stable dose for at least
             3 months prior to the biopsy (whether historical or qualifying biopsy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or history of significant alcohol consumption, defined as more than 20 g/day
             for females and more than 30 g/day in males on average, or inability to reliably
             quantify alcohol consumption based on investigator's judgement

          2. Use of the following drugs (which may have potential hepatotoxic effects) within 6
             months prior to Day 1: amiodarone, methotrexate, tamoxifen, valproic acid, estrogens
             at doses greater than those used for hormone replacement or contraception, anabolic
             steroids, or systemic glucocorticoids for more than 4 weeks at doses greater than
             replacement doses

          3. Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c ≥9%) within 60 days prior to Day 1
