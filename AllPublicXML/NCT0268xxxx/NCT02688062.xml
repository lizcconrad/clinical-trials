      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of NeuroRegen Scaffold
      with bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) on neurological recovery following chronic and
      complete spinal cord injury, compared to the treatment of surgical intradural decompression
      and adhesiolysis only.
