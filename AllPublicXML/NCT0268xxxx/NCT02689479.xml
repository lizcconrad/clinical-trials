  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In people with type I diabetes, the insulin producing cells in the pancreas have been
      destroyed. Presently one can only evaluate the function of the graft through laboratory
      tests, blood sugars and the insulin requirements. The mass of the insulin producing cells and
      their location are not known. The possibility to study the mass of insulin producing cells is
      of importance when developing new treatment regimes, in order to evaluate their efficacy on
      this parameter.

      The researchers in this study are aiming to develop methods to measure the mass of insulin
      producing cells. A method (positron emission tomography, PET) previously used for the
      diagnosis of tumors of insulin producing cells may also be used to measure the amount of
      insulin producing cells in patients with type I diabetes. They plan to evaluate participants
      with type 1 diabetes that have undergone islet transplantation, to evaluate if PET can be
      used to measure the beta cell mass after islet transplantation.
