      This study for a six-month trials, Randomized, open, and parallel comparison before and after
      its own, Stage test includes screening stage, treatment period and follow-up period. In
      accordance with chronic wound criteria for the patient, By producing the principle of random
      number, Were randomly divided into UC-MSCs Gel group or Gel group, The researchers according
      to the situation of wound healing time and decided to use the secondary treatment, To observe
      the clinical efficacy and safety.
