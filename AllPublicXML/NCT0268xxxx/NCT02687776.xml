        Male and female patients &gt;18 years undergoing major vascular surgery will be invited to
        participate. Specifically, patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,
        suprainguinal and infrainguinal vascular surgery, as well as carotid surgery will be
        included. After the first 30 patients, the population is to be expanded to elevated-risk
        surgeries in general.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults &gt;18 years

          -  Type of surgery for patients 1 to 30: abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal
             and infrainguinal vascular surgery, carotid surgery

          -  Type of surgery for patients 31 to 500: surgeries with elevated risks in general (as
             specified by 2014 ESC/ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery:

        cardiovascular assessment and management [Kristensen])

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  acute coronary Syndrome (ACS) at presentation (clinical assessment or documentation)

          -  Congestive heart failure at presentation (clinical assessment or documentation)

          -  Documented severe aortic stenosis (valve area &lt;1cm2)

          -  Kidney dysfunction (clearance &lt;50ml/min)

          -  Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt;40%); if no LVEF is available, it
             will be assumed to be &gt;40%

          -  Cancelled surgery

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide consent

          -  Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to language problems,
             psychological disorders, dementia, etc. of the participant
