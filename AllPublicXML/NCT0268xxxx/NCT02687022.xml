    <textblock>
      Wavefront scans are a common form of diagnostic test applied in preparing patients for laser
      eye surgery. An optical map of the eye is created by wavefront scanning, and information from
      these maps is used to program lasers used to correct focusing errors in the eye. Here the
      investigators are comparing how repeatable measurements are with a new wavefront scanner and
      one that is already in widespread use.

      Aberrometers are used to measure each element of defocus (aberration) in an optical system.
      In LASIK, information derived from aberrometry (scans performed using aberrometers) is used
      to program the pattern of laser pulses delivered by an excimer laser in therapeutic reshaping
      of the cornea to correct defocus. To do this accurately, aberrometry findings need to be
      repeatable and correspond closely to manifest refraction. Here the investigators compare
      repeatability of measurements for a new aberrometer (Peramis) versus the aberrometer most
      widely used in contemporary wavefront guided laser vision correction (iDesign).

      The test aberrometer will be:

      Peramis (Schwind Eye-tech Solutions, Kleinostheim, Germany).

      Control aberrometer will be:

      iDesign (AMO, Santa Clara, CA)

    <description>M, J0, J45, Coma, Trefoil, Spherical Aberration. Different types of defocus or aberration can be defined and measured by wavefront scanning. Aberrations are classified and quantified by a mathematical treatment called Zernike analysis in which harmonic elements of the waveform of the light detected by the wavefront sensor (aberrometer) are quantified in sequence, starting with simple (lower order) waveforms such as sphere and cylinder (M, J0, J45) corrected in a normal spectacle prescription, and progressing through more complex (higher order) waveforms including, coma, trefoil and spherical aberration which may influence quality of vision. The amount of each aberration varies as a function of pupil size. So pupil size is standardised at 5mm diameter for quantification.</description>
