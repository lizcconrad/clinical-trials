  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-interventional study is to describe patient's perception of anticoagulant
      treatment when using Pradaxa to prevent stroke and systemic embolism while suffering from
      atrial fibrillation (according to its approved indication in the approved dosages of 110
      milligrams or 150 milligrams twice daily) in comparison to standard care using Vitamin K
      Antagonist (VKA).
