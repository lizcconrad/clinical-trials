  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with short bowel intestinal failure are recommended to aim for a diet high in energy
      and protein. Some patients have difficulties in achieving recommended intakes and additional
      nutrition may be provided by oral nutritional supplements. There is very little research
      completed on which is the best oral nutritional supplement for patients. The aim of the study
      is to see the effect different oral nutritional supplements have on your stoma or fistula
      output and levels of hydration.

      After written consent is obtained, patients will be asked to fast from 12.00am on day one. At
      08.00am patients will be asked to pass urine and to empty their stoma bag. After this they
      will be asked to drink 200ml of the ONS which they have been randomised to test on day one
      over a 30 minute period. Urine and intestinal output will be collected into two separate
      containers over the next 6 hours. During this time the patient will not be permitted to eat
      or drink other fluids. After 6 hours the patient will be able to eat and drink normally. The
      urine and intestinal output will be weighed and then an aliquot will be stored in a -20oC
      freezer before being sent for analysis. Day two is a washout day when the patient will be
      able to eat and drink normally. Day three will be the same as day one but the patient will
      have the other ONS that they did not have on day one. No changes will be made to the
      patient's usual anti diarrhoeal and/or anti motility agents or parenteral support during the
      study.
