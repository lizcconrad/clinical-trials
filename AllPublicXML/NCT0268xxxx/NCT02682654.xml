    <textblock>
      This study will look to examine the overall performance of a custom fit knee or ankle brace
      as a means of providing ankle or knee joint support in subjects that have determined the need
      for bracing based upon chronic joint instability and/or joint swelling and pain following
      daily activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must indicate that they currently have weakened ankles or knees and that they
             experience chronic discomfort after performing daily activities.

          -  Subjects must suffer from pain assessed on a 100 mm (10 cm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
             of ≥20 mm to ≤ 90 mm for subjects with either unstable ankle or unstable knee, at
             Visit 1 and 2.

          -  Subjects must be able to walk unaided by cane or walker.

          -  Subjects must not have a noticeable limp or other permanent ailment that interferes
             with normal gait.

          -  Subjects free of other types of health problems that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could influence their ability to participate.

          -  If subjects are taking pain medication (prescription or Over-the-counter (OTC)) for a
             chronic condition, they may continue that medication as long as they have been on a
             stable dose for at least 2 months, and agree to continue their regular dose and
             regimen for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects must be willing to undergo a 1-week period without a brace and then willing
             to wear a brace for a 1-week period, that is: 8 ±2 hours a day for a minimum of 5 out
             of 7 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with an ankle or knee pain and instability which is due to a recent sprains,
             strains, or other non-reversible injury to the knee or ankle.

          -  Subjects who have diabetes, circulatory problems, open wounds, and lack of sensation
             in the ankles, knees, or feet or any problems that would make brace wear uncomfortable
             or inappropriate.

          -  Subjects who wear a physician-prescribed orthotic device, prescription shoes or back
             braces.

          -  Subjects who are undergoing traction or manipulative back adjustments or have had a
             traumatic injury to the lower extremity (deemed of non-overuse nature), which in the
             opinion of the examining Investigator would interfere with the study evaluations.

          -  Subjects whose condition requires surgery or other medical intervention or who have
             undergone foot back or knee surgery within the past 3 months or with any planned
             surgeries and/or invasive medical procedures during the course of the study.

          -  Subjects who are currently taking an opioid based pain medication or have taken such
             medication within 2 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Subjects who are taking any chronic pain medication (prescription or OTC) for at least
             2 months, who do not agree to continue taking it at the same dose and regimen
             throughout the study.

          -  Subjects who have severely painful bunions, warts, corns and/or calluses, severely
             overlapping toes or lesions on the bottom of their foot.

          -  Subjects who have sensitivities or allergies to plastics or adhesives.
