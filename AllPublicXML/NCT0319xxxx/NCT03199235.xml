  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and barriers to Lucky
      Iron Fish™ (LIF) utilization among families with young children in a Latin American community
      with a high prevalence of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the acceptability of cooking with an iron ingot (Lucky
      Iron Fish™) compared to traditional oral iron supplementation methods among preschool aged
      children in a Dominican community with a high prevalence of anemia (&gt; 50%). Data will be
      collected to characterize the natural history of iron deficiency and anemia in pre-school
      aged children in a Dominican community. The study will involve a randomized control trial to
      assess the primary objective: children &gt; 1 year and &lt; 5 years of age will be randomized into
      two study arms: LIF plus citrus (LIF arm) versus standard iron-supplementation (enhanced
      standard of care). Participants enrolled in the both study arms will have study labs drawn
      every 3, 6, and 12-months (hemoglobin, serum ferritin, c-reactive protein) to assess the
      natural history of iron deficiency in these children. Concomitant to study labs,
      parents/guardians will be surveyed on acceptability, compliance, and barriers to use of their
      assigned iron supplementation method.

      Primary study outcomes are the change in hemoglobin within the LIF group and then difference
      in change in hemoglobin between study arms over a 12-month study period. Secondary outcomes
      include changes in serum ferritin within and between study arms and exploring the
      relationship between changes in hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein

    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Using a questionnaire with several likert-scale questions, we will assess adherence to iron ingot use. Questions include &quot;When was the last time you used the Fish&quot;, &quot;how often do you use the fish for meal preparation&quot;, &quot;how often do you use the fish to prepare water&quot;, &quot;how long do you typically boil the fish&quot;. The answer to each question has between 4-5 possible ordinal responses which will be converted into numerical data (1,2,3,4,5) and cumulative scores will be created to assess degree of use/adherence.</description>

    <description>Using a questionnaire with several likert-scale questions, we will assess adherence to oral iron supplementation. Questions include: &quot;How many doses were missed each week&quot;, &quot;Do you recall dose and frequency of oral iron you were prescribed&quot;, &quot;If doses were missed, was this accidental, intentional, or both&quot;. The answer to each question has between 4-5 possible ordinal responses which will be converted into numerical data (1,2,3,4,5) and cumulative scores will be created to assess degree of use/adherence.</description>

    <description>We will assess changes in hemoglobin WITHIN iron ingot study arm. Hemoglobin will be measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL) and measured at enrollment, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months. If data is normally distributed, a paired/dependent t-test will be used, if non-normal, a non-parametric test like Wilcoxon's Matched pairs test will be used.</description>
