  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine and dexamethasone have been known to be effective postoperative pain. Many studies
      also have reported these two drugs might change mood such as depression. This study aimed to
      investigate the effect of each drug individually with their combination on perioperative
      change of mood in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery

      After receiving by IRB approval and obtaining informed consent from patients, 93 patients who
      are aged between 18 and 70 years old and classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists
      (ASA) classes I and II.

      Afterward, the patients will be randomly (sealed envelopes) allocated into one of three
      treatment; Group K (n = 31) will receive a single dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg i.v. plus 2 ml
      normal saline, Group D (n = 31) receive dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg i.v. and a maximum dose of 8
      mg plus 2 ml saline, and Group KD (n = 31) receive ketamine 0.5 mg/kg i.v. and dexamethasone
      0.5 mg/kg i.v. at 5 minutes after the induction of anesthesia in a double-blinded method.

    <description>Anesthesiologist performed the assessment of perioperative depressed mood change with use of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day) with a total score ranging from 0 to 27; 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe depressed mood</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>for 48 h after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS consisted of a straight line with the left end of the line representing no pain and the right end of the line representing the worst pain. Patients were asked to mark the position on the line corresponding to their perception of pain. The VAS score for pain was measured with intervals of 1, 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>patient controlled analgesia (PCA) consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>for 24 h after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient was administered analgesics using a PCA pump containing morphine (60 mg), ketorolac (150 mg), and ramosetron (0.6 mg) in a total volume of 100 ml of saline. This device was set to deliver a basal infusion of 2 ml/hr and bolus doses of 0.5 ml with a 15 min lockout period.</description>
