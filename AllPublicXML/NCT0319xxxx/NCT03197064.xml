  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if intravenous fosaprepitant can interfere with
      nervous system monitoring signals in patients having surgery under general anesthesia. This
      medication has numerous effects on the sensory nerve transmission which can theoretically
      have effects on the ability to accurately measure somatosensory evoked potentials.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if intravenous fosaprepitant can interfere with
      nervous system monitoring signals in patients having surgery under general anesthesia.
      Fosaprepitant is a drug commonly used to prevent post-operative nausea and vomiting, and
      works by inhibiting &quot;substance P&quot;, which is found in the brain and spinal cord.
      Theoretically, fosaprepitant could interfere with nervous system recordings because of its
      effect on substance P,but it is not known if this actually occurs. The drug will be given
      after the patient has been anesthetized but before surgical incision so that if there are any
      changes on the intraoperative neuromonitoring signals they can only be attributed to
      fosaprepitant.

      If fosaprepitant alters intraoperative neuromonitoring signals during surgical procedures
      under general anesthesia, it would be important because anesthesiologist's who administer
      this drug would want to give it at the beginning of surgery when changes in intraoperative
      neuromonitoring signals would be unlikely to mean that these changes were due to surgical
      damage to the nervous system.

    <intervention_model_description>A single group of up to 50 patients will be administered a standard dose of fosaprepitant 150 mg IV after induction of anesthesia. A standard neuromonitoring setup utilizing motor evoked potentials, and somatosensory evoked potentials will be used as indicated for the type of surgery. After baseline neuromonitoring measurements have been made, but prior to surgery starting, we will administer the fosaprepitant to determine if there are any effects on the motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials measurements.</intervention_model_description>
