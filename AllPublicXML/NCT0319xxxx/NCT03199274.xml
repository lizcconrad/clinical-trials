  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well perflutren protein-type A microspheres
      and contrast-enhanced ultrasound work in improving response to radioembolization therapy in
      patients with liver cancer. Ultrasound contrast agents, such as perflutren protein-type A
      microspheres, use gas microbubbles to improve image quality. Using contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound imaging will &quot;pop&quot; these microbubbles and cause tumors to become more sensitive to
      radiation therapies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the ability of localized ultrasound contrast agent destruction to improve
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response to yttrium Y-90 (Y90) radioembolization.

      II. Determine if contrast-enhanced ultrasound estimated tumor perfusion can reliably predict
      HCC response to radioembolization 1-14 days post treatment.

    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be tested with a non-parametric Mann- Whitney U-test of the difference in response distributions between control (radioembolization alone) and experimental group (ultrasound-triggered microbubble destruction [UTMD] + radioembolization). The outcome variable in this analysis, the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) score, is treated as an ordinal variable in this analysis</description>

    <measure>Tumor perfusion measured by contrast-enhanced ultrasound between ultrasound-triggered microbubble destruction pulses</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Perfusion will be characterized in terms of contrast replenishment time intensity curves fit with a 2-parameter exponential recovery curve. The relationship between the normalized perfusion values from this image processing and the patients' subsequent mRECIST scores in the UTMD
+ radioembolization group will be evaluated with Spearman's rank order correlation.</description>
