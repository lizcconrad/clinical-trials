  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial in Obstetrics and Gynecology department (MULTI-CENTRIC).To
      measure the effect of coffee consumption on intestinal motility after caesarean section for
      the patient who fulfills the criteria. Then they will be randomized to 3 groups. The primary
      outcome and secondary outcome will be measured.

    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial. Participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria (elective
      caesarian section, singleton pregnancy, term, viable fetus), and exclusion criteria (medical
      disorders, known intestinal diseases, past history of intestinal surgery, intraoperative
      diagnosis of extensive adhesion, intraoperative complications &quot;e.g., intestinal injury and
      ureteric injury intraoperative complication that can lengthen the operation time,
      postoperative complications like anesthesia complication and electrolytes imbalance ) Then
      they will be randomized to 3 groups. Group 1, will start to drink coffee 6 hours
      postoperative for maximum 3 doses (100ml), 8 hours apart, diet will start after 1st audible
      bowel sound.

      Group 2, will drink water 6 hours postoperative. Diet will start after 1st audible bowel
      sound.

      Group 3 is the control group and they will be (NOTHING PER ORAL) for 24 hours on intravenous
      fluid (3 LITRES/24 HOURS). Diet will start after 1st audible bowel sound.

      Primary outcome: passage of stool. Secondary outcome: passage of flatus, audible intestinal
      sound time, feeding time, pain scale by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), amount, and type of
      analgesia needed, breastfeeding time, mobilization and hospital stay.
