  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      A new cancer therapy involves taking white blood cells from a person, growing them in the
      lab, genetically modifying them, then giving them back to the person. This therapy is called
      gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells.

      Objective:

      To see if anti-KRAS G12 V mTCR cells are safe and can shrink tumors.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old with cancer that has the KRAS G12V molecule on the surface of
      tumors.

      Design:

      In another protocol, participants will:

      Be screened

      Have cells harvested and grown

      Have leukapheresis

      In this protocol, participants will have the procedures below.

      Participants will be admitted to the hospital.

      Over 5 days, participants will get 2 chemotherapy medicines as an infusion via catheter in
      the upper chest.

      A few days later, participants will get the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells via catheter.

      For up to 3 days, participants will get a drug to make the cells active.

      A day after getting the cells, participants will get a drug to increase their white blood
      cell count. This will be a shot or injection under the skin.

      Participants will recover in the hospital for 1 2 weeks. They will have lab and blood tests.

      Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months.

      Participants will have visits every few months for 2 years, and then as determined by their
      doctor.

      Visits will be 1 2 days. They will include lab tests, imaging studies, and physical exam.
      Some visits may include leukapheresis or blood drawn.

      Participants will have blood collected over several years.

      Background:

        -  We generated an HLA-A1101-restricted murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that specifically
           recognizes the G12V-mutated variant of KRAS (and other RAS family genes), expressed by
           many human cancers and constructed a single retroviral vector that contains its alpha
           and beta chains that confers recognition of this antigen when transduced into PBL.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A1101+ target cells expressing this mutated oncogene, mTCR
           transduced T cells lyse target cells and secrete IFN-gamma with high specificity.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

        -  Phase I: determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12V mTCR
           in concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;
           aldesleukin).

        -  Phase II:To determine if anti-KRAS G12V mTCR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression
           of tumors harboring the RAS G12V mutation.

      Eligibility:

      Patients must be/have:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  HLA-A*1101 positive

        -  Metastatic or unresectable RAS G12V-expressing cancer which has progressed after
           standard therapy (if available).

      Patients may not have:

      -Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide or fludarabine.

      Design:

        -  This is a Phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12D mTCR in
           HLA-A*11:01 positive patients with advanced solid tumors expressing G12D mutated RAS.

        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant
           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lympho-depleting preparative regimen of
           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  On day 0 patients will receive their PBL transduced with the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR and
           will then begin high dose aldesleukin.

        -  A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks)
           after treatment.

        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II Simon minimax design, with two separate
           cohorts for the Phase II component: Cohort 2a, patients with pancreatic cancer and
           Cohort 2b: all other RAS G12V non-pancreatic cancers

        -  A total of 110 patients may be required; approximately 24 patients in the phase I
           portion of the study and 86 (41, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable per phase II
           cohort) patients in the phase II portion of the study.

             disorders or any other major medical illnesses.

          4. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).
