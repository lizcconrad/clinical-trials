  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study conducted
      at one study center in the United States. Four (4) cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 active and 2
      placebo). Subjects will participate in only one cohort.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial ECGs and serial blood samples will be
      collected for the safety and PK assessment of sutezolid.

      Dose escalation to the next cohort (i.e., dose level) will not take place until the Sponsor,
      in conjunction with the Principal Investigator, has determined that adequate safety,
      tolerability and PK from the previous cohort has been demonstrated to permit proceeding to
      the next cohort.

      Interim PK analyses will be performed for the dose escalation decisions to reconsider the
      sampling time points as the study progresses. All samples will be sent for analysis and the
      bioanalytical lab will be unblinded and only run the analysis on active treatment subjects.
      Data from the analysis used for the escalation meetings will only include active treatment
      subjects, and will be blinded by subject.

      Subjects will be housed in the clinic from at least 24 hours prior (from Day -2), until 48
      hours (Day 3) after dosing. Subjects will be contacted via a phone call for follow-up
      questioning about adverse events 7 days later (Study Day 10).
