  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nocturnal enuresis is common problem in children who are from 5 to 18 years old and do not
      spontaneously urinate at least 2 times a week for more than 3 months. It can lead to major
      distress for the children and their parents. The investigators hypothesize that the 3-day
      voiding diary as the same as the 7-day voiding diary could be a diagnostic tool to provide
      information on the diagnosis and classification of nocturnal enuresis. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate the reliability and sensitivity of 3-day versus 7-day voiding diary
      to diagnose nocturnal enuresis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the first visit to a doctor, a questionnaire about nocturnal enuresis will be filled
      in and additional tests will be done according to the standard procedure to screen out who
      have monosymptomatic enuresis.Then participants will complete a 3-day voiding diary or a
      7-day voiding diary before treatment. During the second visit to a doctor, doctors will
      diagnose by voiding diary which type of enuresis is present. Participants need to fill in the
      3-day or 7-day voiding diary at 1, 3 and 6 months after standard treatment. About 800
      patients from 5 to 18 years old will be included in this prospective, randomized, controlled,
      multi-center and large sample study and will be followed up at the outpatient clinic.

    <description>According to the results of urinating diary, the subtype of primary nocturnal enuresis would be diagnosed and classified in 400 patients with 3-day diary and 400 patients with 7-day diary, respectively. Then the difference in results of classification accuracy can be evaluated in patients with 3-day diary, compared with 7-day diary which is the golden standard for classification of the subtype of primary nocturnal enuresis.</description>

    <description>The recovery rate would be evaluated when the 3-day diary and 7-day diary were collected in all patients. The compliance rate of two type of urinating diary was evaluated by the recovery rate of diary between 3-day diary and 7-day diary.</description>
