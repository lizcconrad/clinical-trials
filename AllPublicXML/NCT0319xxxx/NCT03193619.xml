      The objective of this study is to assess the clinical use of the Bard® UltraScore™ Focused
      Force PTA balloon in a heterogeneous patient population in a real world, on-label clinical
      application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, real-world study to assess the
      clinical use of the Bard® UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon for the treatment of stenotic
      lesions of the superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery, and infra-popliteal
      arteries (posterior tibial, anterior tibial and peroneal arteries). Follow-up for all treated
      subjects will be performed at hospital discharge, 30 days, and 6 and 12 months post-index
      procedure.

    <time_frame>Index procedure (Day 0); approximate duration of procedure is 90 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Optimal result is defined as ≤30% residual stenosis without major flow-limiting dissection, as measured by angiographic imaging. Major flow limiting dissections are classified by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) as Grade D (Spiral luminal filling defects), Grade E (Appearance of new and persistent filling defects with reduced flow), and Grade F (Total occlusion without distal flow).</description>

    <time_frame>Index procedure (Day 0); approximate duration of procedure is 90 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Technical success is determined subjectively by the investigator according to delivery location of the study device relative to the target lesion, as assessed by angiographic imaging, and inflation without movement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of bail-out stenting due to dissection</measure>

    <measure>Freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR).</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post-index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>TLR is defined as a revascularization procedure (e.g. PTA, stenting, surgical bypass, etc.) in target vessel after the index procedure</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Freedom from major amputation of the target limb</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post-index procedure</time_frame>

    <time_frame>30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post-index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Resting ankle brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford classification for chronic limb ischemia measurements will be assessed clinically at follow-up and compared with baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary patency for Above the Knee (ATK) subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post-index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>ATK subjects have a target lesion of the SFA or popliteal artery only. Primary patency is measured by duplex ultrasound (DUS) core lab; a peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) ≥2.5 suggests 50% restenosis and loss of patency.</description>

    <intervention_name>PTA (UltraScore Focused Force PTA Balloon)</intervention_name>
    <description>Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) will involve the insertion of a catheter into one of the femoral arteries. Once the catheter is in place, a tiny balloon on the end of the catheter will be inflated to press against the narrowing (or blockage) in the artery to try to open the blockage, and allow more blood to flow through the artery. The balloon may need to be inflated several times in order for the narrowed area to open up sufficiently to improve the blood flow. The area will be viewed with specialized x-ray or other imaging devices to see if the artery has opened enough.
The UltraScore Focused Force PTA balloon through the blood vessel to the narrowed area to be treated.</description>

        This study will include a maximum of 350 subjects at up to 45 U.S. sites. All subjects will
        have peripheral arterial disease (PAD; a stenotic lesion of the SFA, popliteal, or
        infra-popliteal arteries).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must voluntarily sign and date the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to
             collection of study data or performance of study procedures.

          2. Subject must be either a male or non-pregnant female ≥ 21 years of age with an
             expected lifespan sufficient to allow for completion of all study procedures.

          3. Subject must be willing to comply with the protocol requirements, including the
             follow-up procedures.

          4. Subject must have a target lesion (de novo lesion or prior failed treatment) that can
             be treated with the UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon according to the
             Instructions for Use (IFU). Only a target lesion in the SFA, popliteal, or
             infra-popliteal arteries (posterior tibial, anterior tibial, or peroneal arteries) may
             be treated for this study.

          5. Subject must have an Above the Knee (ATK) or Below the Knee (BTK) target lesion with
             at least one vessel run-off.

          6. The target lesion must be able to be crossed using a guidewire (use of chronic total
             occlusion (CTO) or atherectomy is allowed).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects that are to receive one or more stents as adjunctive therapy at the target
             lesion (bail out stenting is allowed).

          2. The subject has a single target lesion that involves both ATK and BTK arteries.

          3. The subject has a target lesion in a previously placed stent or stent graft (in-stent
             restenosis).

          4. The subject has a lesion, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude
             safe use of the UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon.

          5. The subject has a flow limiting dissection at the target lesion prior to use of the
             UltraScore™ Focused Force PTA balloon.

          6. The subject has acute limb ischemia.

          7. The subject has been assessed Rutherford category 6.

          8. The subject has a known allergy or sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated.

          9. The subject has another medical condition or is currently participating in an
             investigational drug or another device study that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may cause him/her to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data
             interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the
             completion of study procedures and follow-up.
