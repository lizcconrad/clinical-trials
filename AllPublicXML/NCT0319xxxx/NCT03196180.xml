  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects of topical fluorouracil and imiquimod
      ointment in treating patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Topical
      fluorouracil may kill precancerous cells. Imiquimod ointment may stimulate the immune system.
      Applying topical fluorouracil and imiquimod ointment may cause fewer side effects and may be
      a better way to treat patients with precancerous cervical lesions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety and tolerability of self-administered weekly intravaginal topical
      fluorouracil (5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) and imiquimod used on alternating weeks for 16 weeks in
      women with biopsy confirmed high grade cervical intraepithelial lesions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the response to intravaginal 5-FU and imiquimod. II. Describe type-specific human
      papillomavirus (HPV) clearance after treatment with intravaginal 5-FU and imiquimod.

      III. Measure biomarkers of local immune activation.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of imiquimod.

      Patients receive topical fluorouracil intravaginally via applicator at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
      11, 13, and 15 and imiquimod intravaginally via applicator at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
      and 16. Patients who are menstruating will delay application until the end of the menstrual
      cycle.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 8 months.
