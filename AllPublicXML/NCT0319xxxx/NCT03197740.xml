      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of donepezil transdermal
      patch in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the test drug, IPI-301
      (donepezil transdermal patch), to the comparator, Aricept tablet, after 24 weeks of treatment
      in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in terms of improvement in cognitive
      function as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-cog) and
      in terms of global assessment as assessed by Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change
      plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus).
