      This is a single-center, open-label, single arm，exploratory clinical trial evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with local progressive/metastatic refractory
      thyroid cancer.

      The primary endpoint is objective response rate(ORR),the secondary endpoints include
      progression-free-survival(PFS)；disease control rate(DCR);serum Tg、TgAb、calcitonin；safety.

      If any case happens as following,including withdrawing informed consent form(ICF)、unbearable
      toxicity or adverse reactions、other conditions which investigators think the patients are
      unsuitable to go on trail,the patient will not go on trial any longer,or every subject will
      obtain study treatment until tumor progress with CT/MRI proof.The indicators of efficacy and
      safety will be always observed during the trail process.
