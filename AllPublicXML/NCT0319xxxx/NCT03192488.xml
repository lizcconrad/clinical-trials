  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine whether a simple, single intervention of Cetirizine / Zyrtec®
      use can improve exercise performance of active individuals when acutely exposed to altitude.
      For this project, healthy subjects will perform steady state and progressive work rate
      exercise, endurance performance time trials, and repeated sprint performance time trials in
      the laboratory at a simulated altitude of 3000m (9900ft) after dosing with 10 mg of
      Cetirizine or a placebo in a repeated measures design.

      This study seeks to determine whether a simple, single intervention of Cetirizine / Zyrtec®
      use can improve exercise performance of active individuals when acutely exposed to altitude.
      For this project, healthy subjects will perform steady state and progressive work rate
      exercise, endurance performance time trials, and repeated sprint performance time trials in
      the laboratory at a simulated altitude of 3000m (9900ft) after dosing with 10 mg of
      Cetirizine or a placebo in a repeated measures design. Non-invasive techniques (pulse
      oximetry, near-infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) will be utilized to measure changes in arterial
      oxyhemoglobin saturation and skeletal muscle oxygenation at the level of the microvasculature
      during exercise. It is expected that after Cetirizine, blood and muscle microvascular
      oxygenation during heavy exercise will improve compared to placebo, ultimately improving
      exercise performance at altitude. Subjects will be asked to report to the laboratory on a
      three occasions, separated by a minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of 14 days. For each
      subject, all testing sessions will be performed at the same time of day. Prior to each
      testing session, subjects will be asked to abstain from caffeine consumption for 12 hours.
      Subjects will also be asked to avoid alcohol consumption for 24 hours before testing, be at
      least 3-hour post prandial and avoid high-intensity exercise during the 24 hours leading to
      the exercise testing. Finally, subjects will be asked to consume a similar diet the night
      before, and the morning of, Sessions 2 and 3.
