    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if participating in a program with another family
      member in their household can help participants eat healthier and become more physically
      active.

      Study Groups:

      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you and your family member will be randomly
      assigned (as in a flip of a coin) to in 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being
      in any group.

      If you are assigned to Group 1, you and your partner will have 6 meetings with a community
      health worker who will talk to you about how you can be more physically active and eat
      healthier. The community health worker will come to your home 1 time a month for 6 months.

      If you are assigned to Group 2, you and your partner will have 6 meetings with a community
      health worker who will talk to you about ways to help your home be a safe and healthy place
      to live. Topics will include addressing lead hazards, indoor air quality, home safety, and
      pesticides. The community health worker will come to your home 1 time a month for 6 months.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over after you complete the 3rd in-person visit
      (described below).

      Study Visits:

      Study visits will take place at a community center, MD Anderson, or at your home. You will
      have 3 visits during the study -- 1 time at the beginning of the study, 1 time about 6 months
      after you begin the study, and 1 time about 12 months after you begin the study. The first
      study visit may last up to 2 hours. After the first visit, you will be randomly assigned to
      your Study Group. The visits at 6 months and 12 months may last up to 90 minutes. The
      following procedures will be performed at each study visit:

        -  You will complete questionnaires about your feelings, moods, your motivation for
           physical activity and eating healthy, any social support you may receive from others,
           the neighborhood you live in, and other physical activity-related topics. The
           questionnaires should take about 45 minutes to complete. For the 2nd and 3rd visits, you
           will have the option of completing the questionnaire online before your scheduled visit.
           This may reduce the length of your 2nd and 3rd visits.

        -  You will be asked about your diet.

        -  Your height, weight, and waist and hip circumference will be measured. To measure your
           waist and hip circumference, you may be asked to lift your shirt to expose your stomach
           area and lower your pants to expose your mid-hip area. The height, weight, and waist and
           hip circumference measurements should take about 10 minutes and will be performed in a
           private area.

        -  You will be given an accelerometer at each visit. An accelerometer is a small device
           (about the size of a deck of cards) that measures your physical activity including how
           many steps you take. You will wear the accelerometer for 7 days and then return it in an
           pre-addressed envelope provided to you.

      Additional Information and How Your Data Is Used:

        -  You may be contacted by phone or mail while you are taking part in this study to remind
           you about study visits, study procedures, and counseling calls.

        -  You will be asked to give the names and contact information of family members and/or
           friends for the study staff to contact in the event they cannot reach you first.

        -  All information collected during your screening questionnaire will need to be shared
           with the study chair, the research team, and the community health workers since all
           three will be working on various components of the study.

        -  Your home address may be used to access public information about the area where you
           live. This is to help researchers learn about how your neighborhood encourages physical
           activity. The results from this study will only be reported as a group and you will not
           be identifiable from any products resulting from this study (such as research papers).
           Your home address will never be released or published in any form. Your address will be
           stored separately from other study data, and only the study chair, the research team,
           and the community health workers will be able to see the data after the neighborhood
           information has been collected.

        -  De-identified responses to all study questionnaires along with de-identified
           anthropometrics information (e.g., height, weight, and waistline measurements) from
           baseline, 6 month, and 12 month study visits will be made available to the study chair
           and the research team but not the community health workers.

        -  You may be contacted in the future to see if you would agree to take part in other
           research studies.

        -  If the accelerometer is lost or stolen, you will not be responsible for the replacement
           cost, but you should tell the study staff right away.

      After the study has been completed and the results are published, the study staff and
      collaborators will have access to the de-identified data files for up to 10 years. These
      files will be stored on a password-protected MD Anderson computer server, in case further
      questions about the study results and publications need to be addressed. At 10 years, the
      data will be completely deleted (destroyed) from the institutional server.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 600 participants may be enrolled in this study. All
      will take part at MD Anderson.
