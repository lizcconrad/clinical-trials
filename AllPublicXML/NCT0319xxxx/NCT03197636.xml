  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational single center study designed to identify response-related biomarkers of
      anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy to advanced melanoma patients and to investigate if
      vitamin D levels are related to treatment response. 40 patients diagnosed with advanced
      melanoma will be included. Patients are included at the Department of Oncology, Aarhus
      University Hospital (AUH). All patients will be treated with Pembrolizumab as a standard
      procedure at the Department of Oncology. The protocol comprises blood samples at baseline, 3
      and 6 weeks after treatment initiation with anti-PD1 therapy and three years of observational
      follow-up. A total amount of 217 ml blood will be drawn during the study period. The study
      period is 6 weeks followed by 3 years of follow-up. Medical history, symptoms, response to
      treatment regarding the RESIST criteria and side affects will be recorded at each visit in
      both the study period and in follow-up. Biochemical markers will be obtained according to
      normal procedure during study and follow-up visits.

      20 Healthy volunteers (HV) are included, matched by age and gender. Collected blood samples
      (serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells) will be analyzed after the last patient
      has ended the week 6 visit.

        40 patients with metastatic melanoma are included. Patients are admitted to Department of
        Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital (AUH). The patients are recruited to the study from
        the outpatient clinic of the Department of Oncology when they are about to begin treatment
        with pembrolizumab. Patients are informed that participation is voluntary and they can
        withdraw the informed consent at any time without a reason and without consequences.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible for participation in this trial, the subject must:

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          2. About to be treated with pembrolizumab as standard of care and first line treatment

          3. Be ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          4. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          5. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Ocular metastatic melanoma

          3. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          4. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          5. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          6. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with

         13. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of treatment. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
