  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a phase 2 randomized double blind 8-week treatment trial of
      intranasal OXT vs. placebo in 50 subjects aged 5 to 17 years with PWS in order to assess
      IN-OXT's affect on measurements of (1) eating behaviors (2) repetitive behaviors (3) weight
      and body composition (4) quality of life (5) salivary OXT and hormone levels (including
      ghrelin, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide YY, GLP-1, insulin, glucagon, testosterone, and
      estrogen). If superior to placebo, this data will add to the current knowledge that OXT is an
      effective treatment for hyperphagia as well as other symptoms of PWS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female pediatric outpatients aged 5 to 17 years

          2. Must be in PWS nutritional phase 2b or 3 as determined by PI

          3. Must be on growth hormone treatment and have been receiving stable doses of growth
             hormone treatment for at least one year prior to screening date. Treatment cannot have
             been interrupted for more than one week within 3 months of screening.

          4. Diagnosis of PWS confirmed by exam, genetic testing and patient medical records.

          5. A score of at least moderate severity on the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical
             Trials at both screening and baseline visits.

          6. Stable dosages of hormone treatments (including testosterone and estrogen supplements)
             for 4 weeks prior to randomization and for the duration of the study.

          7. Stable dosages of metabolic treatments that could affect appetite (including
             metformin) for 4 weeks prior to randomization and for the duration of the study.

          8. Physical exam and laboratory results that are within the normal range for individuals
             with PWS.

          9. Presence of a parent/caregiver/guardian that is able to consent for their
             participation and complete assessments regarding the child's development and behavior
             improvement throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Exposure to any investigational agent in the 30 days prior to randomization.

          2. Child not receiving growth hormone treatment

          3. Children weighing less than 40 lbs

          4. Children with unstable Type 2 Diabetes confirmed by Hemoglobin A1C levels at screening

          5. Children with unstable medical co-morbidities at baseline.

          6. Children with active upper respiratory infections at screening.

          7. A primary psychiatric diagnosis other than ASD, including bipolar disorder, psychosis,
             schizophrenia, PTSD or MDD. These patients will be excluded due to potential
             confounding results.

          8. Pregnant or lactating patients or patients who will not agree to use a double barrier
             method of contraception. IN-OXT has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women.

          9. Females using an estrogen-based contraceptive. As an alternative to an estrogen based
             contraceptive, subjects will be counseled to use progesterone-based contraceptives;
             cervical cap; cervical sponges; or spermicidal foam in combination with a condom.
             Subjects will need to use a double barrier method to be in the study.

         10. A medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study, confound
             interpretation of study results or endanger the subject's well-being.

         11. A known diagnosis of Rett's Syndrome of Childhood Disintegrative Disorder or marked
             sensory impairment such as deafness or blindness.

         12. Subjects who have changes in allied health therapies, behavioral or educational
             interventions within four weeks prior to randomization other than those associated
             with school holidays.

         13. Subjects who have had changes in medications or medication doses of risperidone,
             apriprazole, other antipsychotic medications, clonidine, guanfacine, stimulants or
             anti-convulsants within four weeks of randomization.
