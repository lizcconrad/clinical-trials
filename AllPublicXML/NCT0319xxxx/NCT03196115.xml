      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of Hyaline
      fibromatosis syndrome from plasma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS) is rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by the
      deposition of amorphous hyaline material in skin and visceral organs. It represents a disease
      spectrum with infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) being the severe form and juvenile hyaline
      fibromatosis (JHF) being the mild form. Dermatologic manifestations include thickened skin,
      perianal nodules, and facial papules, gingival hyperplasia, large subcutaneous tumors on the
      scalp, hyperpigmented plaques over the metacarpophalangeal joints and malleoli, and joint
      contractures. ISH shows a severe visceral involvement, recurrent infections, and early death.
      The lesions appear as pearly papules or fleshy nodules. The severity is variable. Some
      individuals present in infancy and have additional visceral or systemic involvement, which
      can lead to early death. These patients may show intractable diarrhea and increased
      susceptibility to infection. Other patients have later onset of a milder disorder affecting
      only the face and digits. Additional features include gingival hypertrophy, progressive joint
      contractures resulting in severe limitation of mobility, osteopenia, and osteoporosis.
      Histologic analysis of skin lesions shows proliferation of spindle-shaped cells forming
      strands in a homogeneous and hyaline eosinophilic extracellular material in the dermis.

      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.

      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry 7,5 ml
      EDTA blood and/or a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis in
      those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done,
      sequencing of Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome will be done.
