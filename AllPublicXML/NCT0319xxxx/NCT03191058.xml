  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) as
      an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for depression. Even with multiple
      medication trials, 30 - 40% of patients will experience a pharmacologically resistant form of
      illness. The ineffectiveness of current treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD)
      coupled with the economic burden associated with the disorder engenders a need for novel
      therapeutic interventions that can provide greater response and remission rates.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve a randomized, double blind, non-inferiority clinical trial with two
      treatment arms conducted in two international academic medical centers (the Centre for
      Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada and UT Southwestern in Dallas, Texas). The
      investigators are pursuing a non-inferiority clinical trial in an effort to compare MST - a
      new treatment for TRD - to RUL-UB-ECT. Treatment will be administered two to three days per
      week. Depression symptoms will be assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HRSD-24) and suicidality will be assessed with the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI).
      Remission will be defined as HRSD-24 &lt; or = 10 and a &gt; 60% decrease in scores from baseline
      on two consecutive ratings. Once a participant reaches remission, a second rating to confirm
      remission will be conducted immediately before their next scheduled treatment. If remission
      is confirmed, they will then be considered a completer of the acute treatment course.
      Remission of suicidal ideation is defined as a score of 0 on the SSI. Therefore, there will
      be no specific minimum number of treatments that patients must receive to be classified as
      remitters. However, patients who do not meet remission criteria after 21 treatment sessions
      will be considered non-remitters and will cease treatment sessions. This maximum treatment
      number was chosen allowing for the possibility that MST may require more treatment sessions
      to achieve remission, similar to RUL-UB ECT. The blind will not be broken to participants
      until the completion of the entire study.

    <description>MST treatment will be administered using the MagPro MST with a Cool TwinCoil over the frontal cortex in the midline position using 100 Hz stimulation. The MST determination of seizure threshold will be done using 100% machine output applied at 100 Hz at progressively escalating train durations, commencing at 2 seconds and increasing by 2 seconds with each subsequent stimulation until an adequate seizure is produced. During subsequent sessions, one stimulation will be delivered using a train duration that is 4 seconds longer than the train duration at threshold (with a maximum train duration of 10 seconds).
This will be performed under the effect of anesthesia. The treatment procedure is approximately 10 minutes, followed by a recovery period of approximately 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>In the ECT arm treatment, the MECTA spectrum 5000Q machine will be used, which is an FDA approved device used for providing standard-of-care clinical ECT treatments. The ECT determination of seizure threshold and the adjustment of energy at subsequent sessions will be based on a standard published protocol. All participants will receive RUL-UB ECT at six times the seizure threshold under the effect of anesthesia. The treatment procedure is approximately 10 minutes, followed by a recovery period of approximately 30 minutes</description>
