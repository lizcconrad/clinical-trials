      Background

      Major spinal surgery tend to be lengthy with an increased risk of hypothermia. A quality
      improvement project of patients undergoing major spinal surgery showed that 67 % were
      hypothermic at the beginning of surgery. Several patients expressed a feeling of coldness at
      the arrival of the operating theatre.

      Aim

      To evaluate if Bairhuggers Full Access Underbody blanket can prevent hypothermia at
      initiation if used as prewarming and intraoperative warming compared to the results from the
      local quality improvement project. In addition we aim to explore patients´ experiences of
      comfort in relation to their temperature.

      Method

      Temperature of patients undergoing major spinal surgery (n=30) will be assessed at arrival to
      the theatre, after insertion of bladder catheter, at the start and end of surgery using a
      bladder temperature. The patients´ experiences of comfort will be evaluated with a 5 point
      Likert at the arrival to the operating theatre and after ten minutes of active prewarming
      with Bairhuggers Full Access Underbody blanket. Preoperatively ten randomly chosen patients
      will be observed and later interviewed in order to obtain further information regarding their
      experiences of comfort in relation to their temperature.

      Conclusion and perspectives

      By increasing the investigators knowledge on Bairhuggers Full Access Underbody blanket and
      its effects in preventing hypothermia as well as gaining insight to patients´ experiences of
      comfort in relation to temperature, the investigators anticipate to improve pre-anesthetic
      care and minimize risk factors associated with hypothermia for patients undergoing major
      spinal surgery.
