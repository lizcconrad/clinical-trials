  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic fracture urethral injuries (PFUI) occur in up to 10% of pelvic fractures. It remains
      controversial whether initial urethral realignment after PFUI decreases rates of urethral
      obstruction and the need for subsequent urethral procedures.

      The proposed prospective multi-institutional cohort study should determine the utility of
      acute urethral realignment after PFUI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort trial was designed to compare outcomes between urethral realignment
      (group 1) and suprapubic tube (SPT) placement (group 2). Centers are assigned to a group upon
      entry into the study. All patients will undergo retrograde attempted catheter placement; if
      this fails a cystoscopic exam is done to confirm a complete urethral disruption. If catheter
      placement fails, group 1 will undergo urethral realignment and group 2 will undergo SPT.

      Prior studies demonstrate urethral realignment is associated with a 15% to 50% reduction in
      urethral obstruction, however, it has also been associated with higher rates of incontinence
      and erectile dysfunction. Ninety-six men (48 per treatment group) are required to detect a
      15% treatment effect (80% power, 0.05 significance level, 20% loss to follow up / death
      rate). 100 patients will be enrolled with complete PFUI.
