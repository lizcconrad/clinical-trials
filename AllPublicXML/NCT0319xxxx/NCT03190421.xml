  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to see if expanded urine culture techniques used in the
      laboratory improve the clinical care of women over standard urine culture techniques.

      The investigators request permission to recruit 225 women who respond &quot;yes&quot; to the question
      &quot;do you feel you have a urinary tract infection&quot;. All participants will provide baseline
      urine specimens obtained by transurethral catheter (to avoid vulvo-vaginal contamination) and
      will complete a UTISA questionnaire to assess their current urinary tract symptoms.
      Participants will be randomized to the SUC treatment algorithm or the EQUC treatment
      algorithm. Treating physicians will receive either the SUC results or the EQUC results from
      the clinical laboratory and the results will be part of their clinical record. Treating
      physicians will follow the Loyola FPMRS treatment algorithm. Women in the study will also
      give consent for us to contact them using email, text messaging or phone call within 7-10
      days after &quot;treatment plan&quot; has been implemented. The treatment plan options will include no
      treatment if the culture results show no pathogenic bacteria. All participants will be
      queried 7-10 days after their treatment plan (by email or text) &quot;do you feel you continue to
      have a urinary tract infection&quot;. Women who respond &quot;yes' will be asked to return for a second
      urine specimen which is our standard protocol. The second urine specimen will be analyzed
      using EQUC culture techniques only. Again, a treatment plan will be developed by the
      attending physician and the patient participant will be queried 7-10 days after the plan is
      implemented.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare UTI symptom resolution rates in women with symptoms of UTI who are treated based on EQUC versus SUC results.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using the FPMRS treatment algorithms (see appendix I &amp; II Standard Urine Culture Treatment and Expanded Urine Culture Treatment Algorithms), attending physicians will treat participants based on their randomization to EQUC versus SUC. Following a 3-5 day standard course of treatment (which may include no antibiotics if the culture is negative), participants will be queried 7-10 days &quot;do you continue to have UTI symptoms&quot;. Women who report &quot;no&quot; will be categorized as successful treatment, women who respond &quot;yes&quot; will be categorized as treatment failures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revise the EQUC treatment algorithm.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQUC treatment algorithm was based on known uropathogens that we had previously identified as most likely to be symptomatic. During the course of this work we may identify other pathogens that are present and causing symptoms. These organisms will be identified and added to the treatment algorithm. This interim analysis is planned and was part of the statistical calculations to determine sample size.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify the symptom profile associated with specific organisms.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Using the UTISA questionnaire, we will perform a symptoms association study with specific bacteria.</description>

    <intervention_name>Expanded Urinary Culture</intervention_name>
    <description>involves the inoculation of 100X (0.1mL) more urine onto diverse types of media (BAP, chocolate agar, colistin and nalidixic acid (CNA) agar, CDC anaerobe 5% BAP) with incubation in more environments and temperatures (5% CO2 at 35°C for 48 h, aerobic conditions at 35°C and 30°C for 48 h, Campy gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2, 85% N) or anaerobic conditions at 35°C for 48 h). The level of detection for EQUC is 10 CFU/mL, represented by 1 colony of growth on any of the plates. EQUC is designed to isolate a broad array of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes and fastidious bacteria that grow slowly.</description>

    <intervention_name>Standard Urine Culture (SUC)</intervention_name>
    <description>involves inoculation of 0.001 mL of urine onto 5% sheep blood agar plate (BAP) and MacConkey agar plate with the plates being incubated aerobically at 35°C for 24 h. Thus, the level of detection for standard culture is 103 CFU/mL, represented by 1 colony of growth on either plate. Standard culture is designed specifically to grow Gram-negative rods, especially UPEC.</description>
