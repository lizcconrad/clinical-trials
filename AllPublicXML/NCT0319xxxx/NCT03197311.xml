  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical extraction of third molars is one of the most common outpatient procedures performed
      by oral surgeons. The prescription of postoperative narcotic and NSAID analgesics is the
      standard of care practice to relieve symptoms of pain, swelling, and trismus after these
      procedures. The majority of these patients do not return for follow up unless they experience
      a problem. There is limited data on whether the patients use the narcotics as directed and
      what is their practice of disposal of the remaining medications that were not consumed.

      In this research the effectiveness of postop analgesic consumption, analgesic disposal
      practice, pain control, and patient satisfaction will be compared between patients who are
      randomized to the intervention group who will use a developed mobile application and a
      control group who will not use the mobile app.

      A pilot randomized clinical trial will be conducted to determine if use of a mobile
      application improves adherence to narcotic analgesic use and their disposal and patient
      satisfaction post-surgical extraction of third molars in an outpatient setting. Eligible
      consented subjects will be randomized into either the mobile app group or the control group.
      Both groups will receive standard of care which includes prescription of postoperative
      narcotic and NSAID analgesics and usual postoperative instructions.For the mobile group, the
      Medable Axon Software developed by Stanford University will be used to customize a mobile
      application that will be used one week post surgery to monitor postoperative analgesic
      consumption and disposal practices, pain control, and patient satisfaction, In the control
      group, case report forms will be used to gather data from the electronic medical records and
      a telephone survey will be done one week post surgery to obtain data on patient satisfaction.
      A total of 20 consecutive eligible patients will be enrolled in this pilot trial..

    <description>The Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) will be used to assess post-op pain control. It consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate or 3 = severe. Three pain scores are derived from the sum of the intensity rank values of the words chosen for sensory, affective and total descriptors. Lower scores are associated with less pain..</description>

    <description>Assessment of patient satisfaction using a survey. For the subjects in the experimental group, they will be asked to complete a emoticon survey on the app which would correspond to the following descriptions: Excellent=4, good=3, average=2, poor=1.The subjects in the control group will be asked the same question as part of the post satisfaction survey without the emoticons as a sentence question. A lower score indicates low satisfaction.</description>

    <description>Educational links will be available to view as part of the app and usage will be monitored by website traffic. Higher numbers would indicate greater usage of educational links.</description>
