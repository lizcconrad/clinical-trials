    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pilot, single center, open-label study in patients with metastatic
      neuroendocrine tumor. Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment.
      Study participants will receive a one-time administration of 90Y-DOTA-TOC via the hepatic
      artery.

      Participants in the correlative sub-study will receive 68Ga-DOTA-TOC concurrent with the
      90Y-DOTA-TOC dose, and undergo additional imaging and assessment.

    <textblock>
      Prior to the procedure, the patient will be instructed to fast overnight. Upon arrival to the
      hospital intravenous (IV) access will be placed, and Additionally, a scopolamine patch may be
      placed the night prior to treatment. Additionally a Foley catheter will be placed.

      Starting 30 minutes prior to the administration of 90Y-DOTA-TOC, an amino acid solution will
      be administered via IV. An angiographic catheter will be directed under fluoroscopic guidance
      to the appropriate location in the hepatic artery.

      The 90Y-DOTA-TOC dose will be administered over thirty minutes via the hepatic arterial
      catheter in an outpatient setting.

      Ten patients also enrolled in the correlative sub-study will receive 68Ga-DOTA-TOC concurrent
      with the therapeutic dose and 90 minutes after treatment, these patients will be imaged 90
      minutes after treatment using a PET/CT and the following day using PET/MRI.

      All study participants will be followed up on protocol for six months for evaluation of
      toxicity and response to treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Biopsy proven neuroendocrine tumor, which is somatostatin receptor positive as
        demonstrated on somatostatin receptor PET.

          1. All sites or origin are eligible.

          2. Functional and nonfunctional tumors are allowed. 2. Hepatic metastases on imaging
             meeting the following criteria:

        a. Liver-only or liver-dominant metastases, defined as: i. At least 10% liver parenchyma

        1. For the imaging sub-study: at least one liver lesion must measure greater than 2 cm in
        size 2. For the imaging sub-study: treatment must only be performed using a single dose,
        and so arterial variant anatomy that would result in a split treatment will not be allowed
        ii. And, progression of the liver metastases demonstrated within the past twelve months
        defined as either:

          1. Appearance of any new liver lesion or

          2. 20% increase in size of at least one liver lesion. iii. Presence of low-volume
             extrahepatic lesions (including primary tumor) is allowed if they are stable and
             asymptomatic.

             b. SUVmax on 68Ga-DOTA-TOC PET of the liver metastases two times greater than the
             adjacent liver parenchyma.

          3. Not a candidate for surgical debulking.

          4. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2

          5. Age &gt; 18.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients not capable of getting PET study due to weight, claustrophobia, or inability
             to lie still for the duration of the exam.

             a. For patients in the imaging correlate sub-study: contraindication for undergoing
             MRI based on UCSF Radiology guidelines.

          2. Contraindication to hepatic arteriography (e.g. hepatic artery dissection and/or
             thrombosis, uncorrectable coagulopathy, severe allergy to iodinated contrast, severe
             vascular disease precluding safe hepatic artery catheterization).

          3. Any patient receiving treatment with short-acting octreotide, which cannot be
