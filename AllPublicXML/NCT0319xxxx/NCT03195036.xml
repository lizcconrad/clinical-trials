  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial evidence that early childhood development (ECD) programming can improve
      child health and development outcomes. An important component of ECD programming is
      supporting positive parenting and early stimulation practices. While many parents could
      benefit from such programming, mothers that are HIV-infected may particularly benefit given
      the higher risks of poorer child development among HIV-exposed children. Catholic Relief
      Services (CRS) in Cameroon is implementing the Key Interventions to Develop Systems and
      Services (KIDSS) ECD program for HIV-exposed children. The program will include home-,
      facility-, and community-based components. This impact evaluation will ascertain to what
      extent the KIDSS home-based component of the ECD model affects attainment of age-appropriate
      developmental milestones (measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire 3 (ASQ-3)) in
      HIV-exposed children in Cameroon. The study design is a cluster-randomized controlled trial
      with a cohort of 200 mother/child dyads across 10 study clinics. HIV+ mothers will be
      recruited during pregnancy and their children will be followed up until 18 months of age. The
      intervention group will receive regular home-based ECD services focused on positive parenting
      and early stimulation as well as exposure to facility- and community-based ECD programming.
      The control group will only have exposure to the facility- and community-based ECD
      programming. Randomization occurs at the clinic (cluster) level.

    <intervention_model_description>This study utilizes a cluster-randomized trial (CRT) design in order to evaluate the impact of the KIDSS ECD program delivered by Catholic Relief Services, specifically the home visiting component, on child development outcomes and utilization of HIV testing services. The main reason for including randomization is to reduce the risk of selection bias. The unit of inference for this CRT is at the individual level but the unit of randomization is the health facility (cluster) level due to issues of program feasibility.</intervention_model_description>
