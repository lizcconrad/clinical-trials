  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital mucous cysts (DMCs) are a benign rubbery cystic lesion which usually involve the
      dorsal or lateral side of DIP joint (digital interphalangeal joint) or proximal nail fold.
      The most successful treatment way is surgical management. However, which may cost time,
      require expertise, may cause infection, prolong wound healing and sometimes may lead to the
      joint movement limitation. The investigator bring this new technique: percutaneous
      capsulotomy for digital mucous cysts, which is easy and quick, last but not least, low
      recurrence rate.

      Participant

      Between 2016 and 2017, 50 participants with DMCs in Taipei veteran general hospital were
      included in this study. According to the clinical assessment at OPD(out participants
      department), DMC was diagnosed. Serial related serial clinical features of DMCs were
      investigated including participant's age, location, size of cysts, symptoms, duration, nail
      bed condition, underlying disease(ex. rheumatoid disease, Diabetes) and previous treatment.
      After explaining to participants about the treatment choice (surgical excision, aspiration of
      cystic contents, and our needle assisted percutaneous capsulotomy for mucous cyst) and
      participants agreed with accepting needle assisted percutaneous capsulotomy, they were
      selected for accepting our needle assisted percutaneous capsulotomy for mucous cyst.

      Surgical capsulotomy procedure.

      The surgical procedure for DMCs was using a 18G needle performing aspiration first and then
      cutting the stalk tract by the needle tip for capsulotomy. All procedure were done with local
      anesthesia. After operation, the investigator asking participants using dressing to pressure
      the wound about 10 minutes to stop bleeding. Later on, the wound was covering with
      antimicrobial ointment (neomycin) and simple dressing. Educating participants from water for
      24 hrs.

      Clinical assessments

      The investigator evaluating participant's prognosis by VAS, the improvement of fingernail
      deformity, the participants' subjective satisfaction and the recurrences was evaluating
      during follow-ups. This clinical study's approval was obtained from Association of IRB,
      Taipei veteran general hospital.
