  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin, anthracyclines, bleomycin and trastuzumab can cause severe cardiovascular or
      pulmonary toxicity. Why some patients are susceptible to extreme toxicity of cancer treatment
      is largely unknown. Unraveling extreme cardiovascular toxic responses in cancer patients may
      help understand the pathophysiology of cardiovascular toxicity of these agents and help in
      understanding the more subtle, long-term cardiovascular side effects that affect a larger
      part of cancer survivors. With induced pluripotent stem cells we will obtain patient-derived
      cells to recapitulate and mimic and study pathological (cardiovascular) responses and
      (cardiovascular) toxicity in vitro.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of these
        criteria:

          1. any proven cancer treated with curative intent;

          2. age ≥ 18 and ≤ 50 years;

          3. able to comply with the protocol;

          4. signed written informed consent.

        There are specific inclusion criteria for every subject group:

          -  severe toxicity during 1 to 3 cycles of anthracyclines;

          -  ≥ 3 months after end of cancer treatment which included the maximum tolerable dose of
             anthracyclines without (severe) toxicity;
