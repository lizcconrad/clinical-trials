  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that causes the highest morbidity and mortality, and the
      main pathological type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most of them present with
      advanced stage at diagnosis. This design is to study maintenance therapy with pemetrexed plus
      apatinib after first line induction therapy four cycles for advanced non-squamous
      non-small-cell lung cancer.
