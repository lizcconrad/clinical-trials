    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab works in combination
      with standard therapy in treating patients with glioblastoma. Drugs used in the chemotherapy,
      such as pembrolizumab and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving pembrolizumab and standard therapy comprising of temozolomide and radiation therapy
      may kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the 18 month overall survival rate of pembrolizumab in combination with standard
      therapy (surgery, external beam radiation therapy and temozolomide [TMZ] chemotherapy) in
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess adverse events (AE) and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in combination with
      standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

      II. To assess time to progression in patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with
      standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

      III. To assess progression-free survival in patients treated with pembrolizumab in
      combination with standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

      IV. To assess time to treatment failure in patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination
      with standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tumor PD-1/PD-L1 expression and inflammatory microenvironment profile by
      comparing PD-1/PD-L1 expression and T lymphocyte/monocytic infiltrates before and after
      administration of pembrolizumab treatment.

      II. To assess the peripheral immunophenotype profile and GBM-associated antigen-specific T
      cell responses before and after receiving pembrolizumab treatment in combination with
      standard therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT (COURSE 1): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      day 1.

      SURGERY (COURSE 2): Patients undergo standard of care surgery within days 4-7.

      CONCURRENT (COURSE 3): Starting 21-35 days after surgery, patients receive pembrolizumab IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 8-54.
      Patients also undergo external beam radiation therapy every 5 days per week on days 8-54.

      ADJUVANT (COURSE 4-8): Within 3-5 weeks after completing radiation therapy, patients receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5
      every 28 days. Treatment repeats every 63 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-4
      months thereafter.
