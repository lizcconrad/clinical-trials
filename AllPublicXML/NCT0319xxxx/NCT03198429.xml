      The current cluster randomized trial examines the efficacy of embedding two different
      parenting interventions within child protection services for young children (0 to 4) who have
      been exposed to domestic violence and who are at moderate to high risk for recurrent
      experiences of maltreatment. Interventions are &quot;embedded&quot; in recognition of the significant
      role played by child protection case workers in identifying families in need of intervention,
      referring/engaging families in intervention, and being able to use information resulting from
      intervention (e.g., reports from the intervention program, observations of parenting
      behaviour changes made as a result of intervention) to improve decision-making in their child
      protection practice. Thus in this trial, ongoing child protection case workers for families
      are randomly assigned to receive professional development training, supervision support, and
      priority client access to parenting interventions in the following four conditions: a)
      embedded mother-child dyadic intervention (Mothers in Mind); b) embedded fathering
      intervention (Caring Dads); c) both mother-child dyadic and fathering intervention; d)
      service as usual.

      Mothers in Mind (MIM) is a dyadic mother-child intervention aimed at preventing child
      impairment resulting from exposure to domestic violence. Intervention focuses on increasing
      mothers' awareness of the impact that exposure to family violence/trauma may have had on
      their infants and themselves as mothers, helping identify and promote positive parenting
      skills such as sensitivity and responsiveness to infant needs, promoting parental competence
      and emotional closeness and decreasing mothers' social isolation. Mothers in Mind uses an
      attachment and trauma-informed psycho-educational process approach in 12 weekly sessions (10
      group and 2 individual).

      Caring Dads (CD) aims to prevent recurrence of child exposure to domestic violence by
      intervening with fathers. Caring Dads includes 15 group sessions, an individual intake, and
      two individual sessions to set and monitor specific behaviour change goals. Major aspects of
      innovation in the Caring Dads program include the use of a motivational approach to engage
      and retain men in intervention, consistent emphasis on the need to end violence against
      children's mothers alongside of improving fathering; program content addressing
      accountability for past abuse; focus on promoting child-centered fathering over developing
      child management skills; and a model of collaborative practice with child protection.

      Hypotheses are posed for differential outcomes among child protection workers (level of
      randomization) and for children who are the subject of the child protection referral (nested
      within workers). At the level of the individual child (primary outcome) it is hypothesized
      that there will be lower rates of re-referral for children of families on the caseloads of
      child protection workers assigned to the embedded CD, MIM and combined intervention than for
      those on the caseloads of workers in the service as usual condition. At the worker level
      (secondary outcomes), outcomes are hypothesized in two areas: 1) worker skill in
      conceptualizing risk and need in cases of child exposure to domestic violence and 2)
      increased self-efficacy for referring to and collaborating with embedded interventions.
      Specifically, we hypothesized that following training and at 12-month follow-up, workers in
      the CD/MIM intervention and combined CD and MIM condition will have greater case
      conceptualization skills in responding to hypothetical cases as compared to workers in the
      treatment as usual condition. We further hypothesize that assignment to an intervention
      condition will lead workers to report greater self-efficacy for collaborating with embedded
      parenting interventions than workers in the treatment as usual condition post-training and at
      12-months follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study focus is the promotion of healthy outcomes in young children (0 to 4) whose exposure to
      domestic violence (DV) has been substantiated by child protective services. Young children
      are particularly vulnerable to damage resulting from exposure to DV. Research in
      developmental neuroscience has shown that infancy and toddlerhood is a time of greater
      plasticity of the brain and of sensitive periods for the development of a number of core
      cognitive, emotional, social, and self-regulatory capacities. The public institution with the
      greatest opportunity to promote better outcomes among very young children at high risk for
      compromised mental and physical health development as a result of exposure to domestic
      violence is child protective services. Exposure to domestic violence is one of the most
      frequently substantiated forms of child maltreatment experienced by Canadian children. As
      with other forms of maltreatment, very young children experience disproportionately high
      levels of victimization. Moreover, because infants and toddlers are more often in the
      presence of their mothers than older children, their exposure experiences are more likely to
      be direct (i.e., witnessing violence) as opposed to indirect (i.e., hearing or knowing about
      violence).

      Unfortunately, there is ongoing concern about child protection response to domestic violence
      and about the availability of interventions to address this issue. Interventions are needed
      in two areas. The first is interventions that will reduce impairment (i.e., cognitive,
      social, emotional development) of young child victims of exposure. This issue has been the
      focus of many academic and policy critiques and the source of considerable tension within and
      between the child protection and Violence Against Women (VAW) service communities. One
      tension is that mothers, on whom children rely for sensitive contingent responding to
      traumatic events and traumatic reminders, are also victims of DV. There is a robust
      relationship between DV victimization and symptoms of trauma and depression, and between
      maternal symptoms of depression and trauma and elevated levels of maternal intrusiveness,
      hostility, and non-responsiveness to young children. Domestic violence victimization is also
      a strong risk factor for mother-perpetrated maltreatment and many of the more complex child
      protection cases present with a combination of risk due to ongoing concerns about fathers'
      perpetration of domestic violence and about mothers' DV- or mental health-related neglect.
      There have been numerous calls for better training and greater collaboration between child
      protection and VAW services at this complex area of practice to avoid retraumatization of
      women and to promote better outcomes for children in the context of exposure to domestic
      violence.

      Second, a strong child protection response to DV needs interventions to prevent the
      recurrence of child exposure to violence. Historically, child protection practice in DV has
      focused almost exclusively on mothers' capacity to take actions to &quot;appropriately protect&quot;
      their children from violence exposure. There are many problems with this mother-focused
      strategy of child protection. The more appropriate alternative response is to offer effective
      services to parents (most often fathers) who have perpetrated DV in their families. Child
      protective services have been relatively slow to include fathers in their work, though this
      is changing. There have been numerous calls to continue to change practice in this area in
      order to make work with fathers a greater part of child protection responses to child
      exposure to domestic violence.

      The current study is designed to test the efficacy of providing families' child protection
      ongoing service workers with professional development training, supervision support, and
      priority client access to embedding two parenting interventions - one for mothers focused on
      preventing impairment and one for fathers focused on preventing recurrence - into child
      protection practice. These interventions are &quot;embedded&quot; in recognition of the unique context
      of child protection practice. Within child protection, families are assigned primary workers
      (in this case, ongoing service workers) whose job it is to work with a family to improve
      child safety to the point that the child is safe enough to close the file. Surprisingly,
      referral to parenting intervention is seldom part of child protection practice - most often,
      workers rely on their own work with families to prompt change. However, when parenting
      interventions are suggested, this referral is often linked to child protection plans; i.e.,
      families are not really choosing to access these interventions on their own accord. [There is
      nuance to this, as families are not legally mandated to attend. Yet given the power
      difference between the child protection worker and the family, a strong suggestion from a
      worker that a family access an intervention program carries substantial weight. Families
      retain the ultimate choice about whether or not to participate, but this choice cannot be
      understood as fully independent and voluntary]. Moreover, parents' success (or failure) in
      attending these programs and in making changes to their parenting can have implications for
      the length, intensity, and nature of ongoing involvement of the family with child protective
      services. In this context, it is not feasible to have workers &quot;suggest&quot; that a family access
      an experimental intervention program and then be randomly assigned to receive, or not
      receive, this program. Moreover, given this context, improving outcomes by providing
      parenting intervention requires that change occur first at the child protection worker level.
      Specifically, workers need to be able to identify families in need of intervention, be
      successful at referring/engaging families in intervention, and be able to use information
      resulting from intervention (e.g., reports from the intervention program, observations of
      parenting behaviour changes made as a result of intervention) to improve decision making in
      their child protection practice. Improved child outcomes also hinge on having interventions
      that are themselves efficacious. Because of the embedded, systems context of parenting
      intervention for child protection client, and because the first point of change is worker
      referral, the appropriate level of experimental manipulation is the child protection worker,
      not the individual families. Accordingly, this study makes use of a cluster-randomized
      design, where child protection workers are assigned to additional training, consultation, and
      support in making referrals to mothering, fathering, or both interventions as compared to
      practice as usual. Also relevant to considering design is the fact that child protection
      workers who will be the subjects of this CRT are nested in teams of 5 or 6 under a
      supervisor. Supervisors are responsible (generally speaking) for providing clinical
      supervision, administrative management, and leadership to their team of workers. As such,
      supervisors should be understood as potential &quot;gatekeepers&quot; (i.e., someone who may be called
      up to protect group-based interests that are affects by enrollment in a CRT). Given this
      organizational structure, the most practical and realistic design is to nest randomization by
      teams. Thus, workers in any one team will all be assigned to the same condition.

      Parenting Interventions, Child Protection and Clinical Equipoise In conducting a clinical
      trial, it is also necessary that genuine uncertainty exists in the relevant expert community
      about what therapy(ies) are most effective. Here, the relevant question is whether referral
      to a formal mothering/fathering intervention program is more efficacious than providing
      regular ongoing child protection service, which consists of in-home visits and individualized
      problem-solving with families. There is genuine uncertainty about this question in the area
      of both interventions for mothers and intervention for fathers.

      In terms of intervention for mothers, a major question is whether a &quot;therapeutic&quot; parenting
      program is efficacious when offered as part of child protection service where the typical
      provisions around client-therapist confidentiality are replaced by an agreement for
      collaborative information sharing between the intervention program and the child protection
      worker. This issue has been written about frequently and is one of the sources of tension
      between the CAS and VAW sectors. Also of concern is whether this difficult to engage group of
      mothers can be engaged in services when they are embedded in child protection practice.

      The specific program to be offered in this trial is Mothers in Mind. The Mothers in Mind
      program was developed in response to a recognized service gap for mothers who had experienced
      abuse/trauma, were showing abuse-related deficits in parenting, and had children under the
      age of four. This program is built on the foundation of research showing that dyadic
      parent-child responsivity based approaches are efficacious for improving outcomes for
      children in at-risk circumstances, including infants born prematurely, parented by depressed
      mothers, dyads who have been trauma exposed, and who are in anxiously attached. There is
      preliminary evidence in support of the value of MIM. A 2013 intervention study found that
      both facilitators and management identify that they are satisfied with the support provided
      by CDI in the areas of consultation and training. Pre- to post-program self-report evaluation
      data suggest that the MIM program is specifically helpful to mothers initially presenting
      with challenges in parenting. Specifically, in the subgroup of mothers presenting with high
      levels of challenge, completion of the MIM program was associated with significant positive
      changes in mothers' isolation, attachment, and sense of parenting competency (no other
      dimensions of outcome were assessed).

      In terms of fathering intervention, there is a great deal of concern in the literature about
      the efficacy of any group intervention aimed at reducing abuse recurrence, especially
      domestic violence. A recent meta-analysis concluded that the research evidence on programs
      aiming to change men's perpetration of domestic violence is insufficient to draw conclusions
      about effectiveness. Specifically, Smedslund et al. noted in 2011: &quot;This does not mean that
      there is evidence for no effect. We simply do not know whether the interventions help,
      whether they have no effect, or whether they are harmful&quot; (p. 8). Given the state of
      evidence, experts would certainly be divided on their opinion about whether a trial of this
      nature will show any advantage over service as usual.

      The specific program to be examined in this trial is Caring Dads. Caring Dads aim to reduce
      recurrence of domestic violence by working with fathers to increase their healthy,
      supportive, and non-abusive engagement with their partners and children.

      Caring Dads is currently considered a &quot;promising practice&quot; for addressing child maltreatment.
      Preliminary research on Caring Dads, using a comprehensive evaluation framework, established
      that Caring Dads addresses a need in communities, can be implemented in a way that is
      acceptable to clients and stakeholders, and matched, in its underlying theory, the
      characteristics and needs of most referred. Subsequent examination of Caring Dads using a
      pre- to post-research design showed that intervention is associated with changes in fathers'
      over-reactivity to children's misbehaviour and respect for their partner's commitment and
      judgment, with results being statistically significant, medium in size, moving mean scores
      into the normative range. Interim findings from independent research on Caring Dads being
      carried out in the UK are also promising. Based on data from 204 fathers, 72 partners, and 22
      children, McConnell reports that completion of Caring Dads is associated with pre- to
      post-group reductions in parenting stress and in level of hostility, indifference, and
      rejection as reported by fathers and reductions in domestic violence victimization (emotional
      abuse, isolation, violence, injury, use of children), depression, and anxiety as reported by
      mothers. Changes in identified domains persist over six-months and are well in excess of
      changes made by comparison group fathers over a similar time period. Finally, a small ongoing
      study by the Child Welfare Institute and K. Scott in Toronto finds that, consistent with
      Caring Dads' model of collaboration between group co-facilitators and child protection
      workers, enrolment in Caring Dads is associated with substantially higher levels of contact
      between men and their families' child protection workers and lower rates of re-referral for
      men enrolled in the program as compared to those referred but on a wait-list for service.

      Both the MIM and CD interventions will be embedded as a collaborative intervention across
      child protection and community service. Child protection workers will be directly trained by
      staff of the MIM and Caring Dads program on the nature of the programming provided. Cases
      potentially eligible for this program on the basis of referral and ongoing concerns will be
      flagged. Moreover, child protection staff will have ongoing consultation around the
      complexity of how to interpret and effectively respond to women's joint status as survivors
      of DV and mothers ensuring the safety and well-being of their children and on how to best
      intervene with fathers. Other aspects of embeddedness include ongoing communication through
      intervention and collaborative planning (child protection and community agency) and
      agency-CAST co-facilitation of intervention groups.

      Duty of Care Considerations. The child protection workers and supervisors being recruited
      into this study have a duty of care to the clients on their caseload. As part of their job,
      they need to make decision as to the best services and interventions to provide to their
      clients. Workers and supervisors will be fully aware that they are participating in a study
      where we are examining the effect of embedded parenting interventions. They will also be made
      aware that there is genuine uncertainty about the value of these interventions and will be
      cautioned about the possibility of therapeutic misconception. Depending on the trial arm,
      workers will be trained to better assess and recognize issues in the parenting of mothers and
      fathers of young children and they will be given information about intervention programs that
      have promising evidence of success. In addition, cases potentially eligible for referral to
      these programs will also be &quot;flagged&quot; for workers. However, it is important to note that
      there will be no (explicit or implicit) mandate that flagged clients will be referred to
      these intervention programs. Workers and supervisors will need to continue to use their
      judgment about the ultimate appropriateness of referral for individual clients. In addition,
      workers not assigned to a particular intervention arm (e.g., those assigned to service as
      usual) will not be prevented from making referrals to CD or MIM. Although workers will again
      be aware of the uncertainty of outcomes of these interventions (and the possibility of
      therapeutic misconception) and of their assignment in the trial, we will respond to their
      professional judgment about referral. If space is available for clients of these workers,
      they will be offered intervention regardless of the fact that this will weaken the
      intervention design. However, we anticipate that this will occur in a low number of cases
      because survey of practice reveals that few workers make referrals to parenting interventions
      and because within the context of this trial, we do not expect to have many &quot;empty&quot; spaces in
      intervention.

      Conditions and Hypotheses

      As explained earlier, because the focus of this study is on changing the ways in which child
      protection workers embed intervention into ongoing child protection family service, the
      appropriate level of experimental manipulation is the child protection worker, not the
      individual families. Outcomes will be examined at two levels - the level of the child
      protection worker and the level of the young child identified as being in need of the service
      of the Children's Aid Society (CAST). This trial will have four condition arms: a) embedded
      mother-child dyadic intervention (Mothers in Mind); b) embedded fathering intervention
      (Caring Dads); c) both mother-child dyadic and fathering intervention; d) service as usual.
      Hypotheses are outlined in detail as follows:

      Worker level Case Conceptualization H1: Professional training on embedded interventions
      (i.e., training, ongoing consultation and supported referral) will increase the workers'
      capacity to conceptualize risk and needs in hypothetical cases typical of those open to child
      protection services as a result of child exposure to domestic violence. Specifically, workers
      will demonstrate greater capacity to identify intervention needs relevant to
      fathers'/mothers' attitudes and behaviors; will be more likely to recommend interventions
      relevant to addressing fathers'/mothers' attitudes and behaviors; will be more likely to
      identify specific, concrete behavior changes in fathers/mothers as part of the rationale for
      case closure; and will increase the extent to which workers take intervention progress, or
      lack of progress, into account when making decisions about case closure in responding to
      hypothetical case descriptions. Effects will be evident following training and at a 12-month
      follow-up point in case conceptualization around mothers (for the MIM and combined
      intervention groups) and fathers (for the CD and combined intervention groups) as compared to
      workers in the treatment as usual condition.

      H2: Workers randomly assigned to an embedded intervention condition will have greater
      self-efficacy for referring to and collaborating with intervention programs. Effects will be
      evident following training and at a 12-month follow-up point. Specifically, workers in the CD
      and combined condition (i.e., conditions 3 and 4) will report greater self-efficacy for
      referring fathers and collaborating with fathering interventions than workers in the
      treatment as usual condition and workers in the MIM intervention and combined condition
      (i.e., conditions 2 and 4) will report greater self-efficacy for referring mothers and
      collaborating with mothering interventions than workers in the treatment as usual condition.

      Child Level Rates of re-referral for child protection concerns H3: There will be lower rates
      of re-referral for children of families on the caseloads of child protection workers assigned
      to the embedded CD, MIM and combined intervention than for those on the caseloads of workers
      in the service as usual condition.

      H4: Young children on the caseloads of child protection workers assigned to the embedded CD,
      MIM, and combined intervention will have fewer emotional and behavioural symptoms at one year
      follow-up than children of workers in the service as usual condition.

Example items include: &quot;I am confident that I know when I have the skills to help fathers myself and when a referral to a more specialized service is necessary&quot;; &quot;When I refer a father to intervention, I have specific idea(s) of the changes that I want to see her make&quot; and &quot;I feel like I have a range of ideas about what to do when fathers seem to be &quot;failing&quot; in intervention&quot;. Total score for self-efficacy in using embedded parenting intervention with fathers will be created by averaging across items.</description>

    <measure>Child social and emotional development (Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires-Social Emotional (ASQ-SE), 2nd Ed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Children's caregivers (mothers and/or fathers) will compete the ASQ-SE to assess young children's social and emotional development. Questionnaire items are age specific for children 6 months to 5.5 years of age with stages that focus on tasks related to attachment (0-12 months), autonomy and self-development (12-20 months), and establishing peer relationships (30 months-7 years). Specific behavioral domains addressed include: self-regulation, compliance, communication, adaptive behaviors, autonomy, affect, and interaction with people. Each item is rated on a three point scale &quot;most of the time&quot;, &quot;some of the time&quot;, or &quot;rarely&quot; and summed to create an overall social and emotional development score.</description>

    <description>This condition focuses on workers' practice with fathers who have been identified as perpetrators in cases of child exposure to domestic violence. Workers randomly assigned to this condition will receive:
a one-day training at the beginning of the study on the need to engage fathers as part of intervention in cases of child exposure to DV
access to a practice leader and consultant to respond to question and concerns about working with father perpetrators of DV
access to a 30-minute presentation, once a month, on issues of practice specific to working with this population In addition,
cases being assigned to ongoing service workers will be &quot;flagged&quot; by intake at the time they are opened to ongoing services as being a potentially appropriate referral to the Caring Dads program
clients who are then referred to CD as part of clinical service will be given access to this program at the earliest possible opportunity.</description>

    <description>Workers in the MIM condition will receive additional training and facilitated referral to MIM for eligible clients. Specifically, workers randomly assigned to this condition will receive:
a one-day training at the beginning of the study on the impact of DV on mothers, mothering, and child development
access to a practice leader and consultant to respond to question and concerns about working with women victims of DV on parenting issues
access to a 30-minute presentation, once a month, on issues of practice specific to working with this population In addition,
cases judged by intake workers as being appropriate referrals to the MIM program (see Methods) and being assigned to these workers for ongoing service will be &quot;flagged&quot; at the time of transfer as being potentially appropriate referrals to the Mothers in Mind program
clients who are then referred to MIM as part of clinical service will be given access to this program at the earliest possible opportunity.</description>

    <description>Workers in the service as usual condition will continue to provide in-home support to children and families in accordance with current practice. Workers will receive regular supervision from their supervisors. A review of practice reveals that, in general, workers make referrals to intervention programs in only a small minority of cases. Such referrals will continue under this study protocol - service will proceed as usual. This condition is not a placebo, families are continuing to receive the full child protection service that they would normally have received if this trail were not being run.</description>

    <intervention_name>Caring Dads</intervention_name>
    <description>Caring Dads is a 15-week group intervention program for fathers, with an intensive intake and two additional individual sessions to set and monitor specific, individualized change goals. Major aspects of innovation in the Caring Dads program include: the use of a motivational approach to engage and retain men in intervention; consistent emphasis on the need to end violence against children's mothers alongside of improving fathering; program content addressing accountability for past abuse and a model of collaborative practice with child protection. The Caring Dads program was developed with a specific commitment to remain focused on the safety and well-being needs of children as a primary goal of intervention and with the recognition that children's safety and well-being is integrally connected to that of their mothers.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mothers in Mind</intervention_name>
    <description>Mothers in Mind uses an attachment and trauma-informed psycho-educational process approach in 12 weekly sessions (10 of which are in group) with mothers. These sessions focus on raising awareness and validation about the experience of violence and the impact it has on mothering. Specifically, MIM increases mothers' awareness of the impact that exposure to family violence/trauma may have had on their infants and themselves as mothers, helps identify and promote positive parenting skills such as sensitivity and responsiveness to infant needs by increasing parental competence, helps promote emotional closeness and decreasing mothers' social isolation, increases mother and infant physical safety, and encourages positive attachment processes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Did the intake process substantiate child exposure to domestic violence as a primary
             or secondary code (Yes)

          -  Was the child's father (biological, step, or common-law) identified as a perpetrator
             of this abuse(need not be exclusive perpetrator)? (Yes)

          -  Is at least one of the investigated children four years old or younger (yes for MIM
             comparison)?

          -  Does the maltreated child reside with his or her mother or father or with his or her
             mother with ongoing regular contact with his/her father? (Yes)

          -  Are there continuing and insufficiently addressed concerns about the potential
             recurrence of domestic violence by father (Yes)

          -  Are there continuing and insufficiently addressed concerns about problems in the
             mother-child relationship? (Yes)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The child's mother and father are unable to communicate in English

          -  Given the opportunity, this father could not participate in a group-based intervention
             (reasons are documented. Examples would be severe mental health/substance use issues,
             severe problems with cognitive functioning, a work schedule that requires him to be
             regularly out of the region)

          -  Given the opportunity, this mother could not participate in a group-based
             intervention? (reasons are documented. Examples would be severe mental
