  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in Brazil, and its treatment, namely
      surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone therapy, has consequences and side effects
      that significantly affect the quality of life and associated physical and psychological
      factors. The practice of physical activity, in turn, may play a beneficial role in these
      factors, and help the recovery of the patient in relation to the consequences of the
      treatments. Two types of physical activity can be addressed in the context of breast cancer;
      Dance and the Pilates method. Thus, the objective of the present study will be to analyze the
      impact of Pilates practice and dance on quality of life and on psychological and physical
      factors in patients undergoing adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Patients older than 18
      years who are in adjuvant treatment, namely, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and / or hormone
      therapy at the Oncology Research Center - CEPON, will be invited to be part of the study.
      With a randomized clinical trial of three arms, the patients will be submitted to 16 weeks of
      intervention, and randomized in 3 groups: (A) belly dance protocol group; (B) Pilates method
      protocol group, and (C) control group who will continue with their routine activities. Sample
      randomization will be conducted in confidence by one of the researchers in a specific
      computer program. Information about personal and clinical characteristics, quality of life,
      psychological factors (depressive symptoms, body image, self-esteem, optimism, perceived
      stress, fatigue, pain, sexual function and sleep quality) and physical factors
      (cardiorespiratory fitness, balance , Posture, upper limb functionality and presence of
      lymphedema). All information will be collected before and after the intervention period.
      Statistical analysis will use the statistical package SPSS - IBM, version 20.0. Firstly,
      descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and percentage) will be used in order to
      know the data, and then the Anova two way test with repeated measurements and Sydak
      Comparison Test, in order to analyze the data. Groups of the Pilates method, of the dance and
      control group. Significance level of 5%.

      The MoveMama Project includes two protocols: (1) Dance and (2) Pilates. Each session for each
      modality will last 60 minutes, three times a week, for 16 weeks.

      In both groups, a chart of patient evolution will be developed during the protocol, which
      should be updated every week by the researchers responsible for the intervention. In order to
      control the intensity and safety of the practice of physical activity, since they are about
      patients who are in period of clinical adjuvant treatment. In this way, the blood pressure
      (BP), through a sphygmomanometer, and the investigation of the heart rate (HR) will be
      performed in every first class of the week at the beginning and end of the session.

      The Subjective Effort Perception Scale - Borg Scale 6-20 points (BORG, 2000) will also be
      used to evaluate the intensity and / or discomfort during physical activity practice in both
      protocols. This 6 to 20-point scale can be used efficiently because of its relationship to
      heart rate. It should be applied to describe resting sensations to situations of maximum
      physical effort, considering number six equivalent to 60 bpm (beats per minute), as well as
      number 20 to 200 bpm (Table 2) (FOSS et al., 2000).

      In both modalities of intervention, the evolution of the movements of upper limbs will always
      be respecting the limit of each patient.

      The dance protocol (1) will be performed through the belly dance method. This type of
      methodology was selected, because it is a practice that involves an intimate relationship
      between movement and emotion, awakens a spontaneous body language that privileges movements
      that respect the individuality of each practitioner, for the recovery of the feminine
      identity, and for be a practice that proposes intense movements of the upper limbs,
      benefiting patients directly.

      Classes will proceed in the following order: (a) Initial stretching: The sequence of
      movements lesson will span wide to specific joint movements, including flexion, extension,
      abduction, adduction and rotation, initiated by the upper body until reaching the lower
      limbs, with an expected duration of 10 minutes. (b) Main part: brief explanations about the
      purpose of the lesson, that is, the theory of dance or the specific step to be worked,
      followed by the practical part of teaching the technique. The purpose of this moment will be
      to develop in the students the movements of the belly dance technique, stimulating the motor
      coordination, the rhythm and the corporal consciousness, improving aspects of the flexibility
      and the range of movement of the upper limb. The practice of the movements will be explored
      in individual dynamics, in double or in group, involving the movement according to the rhythm
      of the music, or also, by rhythms stipulated by the students. This class session will last an
      average of 40 minutes. (c) Relaxation: Developed from slow-moving practices. With
      normalization of cardiac frequency, this part will last 10 minutes. Finally, at the end of
      each class, a brief discussion will be carried out on each student's perception of the
      contents given, and in relation to the objectives discussed at the beginning of the lesson,
      whether they were reached or not.

      The Pilates protocol (2) will proceed in the following order: (a) Initial stretching: The
      breathig, imprint &amp; release, hip release, spinal rotation, cat stretch, hip rolls, scapula
      isolation, arm circles, head nods and elevation &amp; depression of scapulae exercises will be
      performed during warm-up in all sessions, then in the 10th session Added theraband, tonning
      ball and ball, intensifying the exercises. Duration of 10 minutes. (b) Main part: brief
      explanations about the purpose of the lesson, the theory of Pilates, the basic principles of
      Joseph Pilates: breathing, centering, control, precision, fluency and concentration. Clarify
      the positions: positioning of the pelvis, positioning of the rib cage, stabilization and
      movement of the shoulder girdle and positioning of the head and cervical spine. This part
      will include the specific exercises in Pilates. The practice of the movements will be
      explored in individual dynamics. This class session will last an average of 40 minutes. (c)
      Relaxation: The relaxation will consist of the exercises: sitting on the ball, sitting on the
      spine stretch forward ball, sitting on the self-stretching ball of the cervical muscles
      (Upper Trapezius and Muscle Scalene muscles) and active mobilization of the cervical spine
      during the 48 sessions. Duration of 10 minutes.
