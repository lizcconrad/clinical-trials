    <textblock>
      Using double blind, randomized controlled design to study the short-term therapeutic effects
      of customized arch support insoles on children
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 45 children were enrolled. The children were randomized into two groups, including
      the study group (insoles group) and the control group (without insoles group).

      All participants in the insoles group were evaluated at baseline, that was before the
      customized arch-support insoles were prescribed. All the evaluations, including functional
      performance, physical function, and quality of life, were re-evaluated up to 12 weeks after
      the insoles wearing in the study group (insoles group).

      The control group were evaluated at baseline and up to 12 weeks.
