      Background:

      Follicular lymphoma is a type of cancer of the lymph nodes. Lab studies are important for
      cancer research. They help scientists better understand differences in the cancer biology of
      different patients. Researchers want to collect serial samples over time from people with
      follicular lymphoma to help them design future treatments.

      Objective:

      To collect a variety of samples from people with follicular lymphoma to study how these
      diseases progress and respond to treatment.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old who have been diagnosed with, but have not yet had any treatment
      for, follicular lymphoma.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will answer
      questions about daily functioning. They will have blood and urine tests. They may have scans
      and have tissue samples taken.

      Participants will be monitored about every 4 months for up to 2 years. They will repeat
      screening tests. They will have a cheek swab. A small brush will be rubbed against the inside
      of the cheek to wipe off some cells.

      Participants will have imaging scans about every 8 months for up to 2 years.

      Participants may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The hipbone will be numbed with a
      small needle.

      A needle will be put into the hipbone, and about 2 tablespoons of bone marrow will be taken
      out through the needle.

      Participants will continue being monitored every 6 months for up to 5 years, then 1 time a
      year.

      Background:

        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is
           incurable with standard first-line systemic therapy

        -  The clinical course of FL varies from slowly progressive over many years to a more rapid
           disease course that requires therapy shortly after diagnosis

        -  Early initiation of therapy does not improve survival, and asymptomatic patients are
           often managed with an initial period of watchful waiting

        -  Clinical prognostic indices predict survival, but cannot predict outcome for individual
           patients; biologic-based classifiers (gene-expression profiling and somatic mutational
           analyses) are more robust than clinical indices, but require prospective clinical
           validation from the time of diagnosis in the modern treatment era

        -  Paired samples linked to clinical information can lead to the discovery and/or
           validation of therapeutic targets for FL patients at the highest risk of early disease
           progression

      Objective:

      Characterize the molecular biology and clinical course of FL patients, and evaluate the time
      to treatment initiation for those patients who require first-line systemic therapy

      Eligibility:

        -  Follicular lymphoma (grade 1-2, 3a) with no evidence of histological transformation

        -  No previous cytotoxic, biologic or monoclonal antibody therapy for FL (previous
           radiation therapy permitted)

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

      Design:

        -  Patients with FL who meet all eligibility criteria will enroll on the study for expert
           monitoring of their disease, improved risk-stratification, and donation of tissue and
           cellular products for research. Patients will be monitored prospectively until they
           require second-line systemic treatment or the patient decides to withdraw from the
           study; untreated patients will be followed with clinic visits every 4 months for the
           first 2 years. After 2 years, protocol-specified visits will be increased to every 6
           months until 5 years. After 5 years, protocol-specified visits will be annually until
           disease progression requiring first-line therapy.

        -  Patients without an indication for first-line systemic therapy at 2 years from initial
           study enrollment will be offered an optional biopsy of their lymph node and bone marrow.

        -  During first-line systemic therapy, patients can continue being monitored on this study
           for post-therapy clonal evolution. Protocol-specified visits after therapy will be every
           6 months until 3 years. After 3 years, protocol-specified visits will be annually until
           disease progression requiring second-line therapy.

        -  Upon initiation of second-line therapy, if applicable, patients will move to survival
           follow-up only.

        Up to 88 patients with pathologically-confirmed follicular lymphoma (grades 1-2, 3a) will
        be enrolled and screened for eligibility, and up to 80 eligible patients will receive
        active surveillance on this study for the purpose of expert monitoring of their disease,
        improved risk-stratification, and donation of tissue and cellular products for research.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed follicular lymphoma (FL), grades 1-2, or 3a
             confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI; patients who meet criteria for
             immediate initiation of systemic therapy are eligible

          -  Adequate tissue available from original diagnostic biopsy.

        NOTE: If biopsy was &gt;12 months prior to enrollment OR adequate tissue is not available,
        tissue biopsy may be optionally repeated at study enrollment unless such a biopsy is
        considered unacceptable risk to the patient. Patients without adequate tissue are eligible
        at the discretion of the PI.

          -  Must have disease that is measurable or evaluable on either computed tomography (CT)
             scans or FDG-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        NOTE: Patients with the pediatric-type follicular lymphoma are usually &lt;18 years of age,
        and often have a very different clinical course than patients with the adult-type of FL.
        Due to this difference in biology, children are excluded from this study.

        - ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Previous history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or histologic transformation

          -  Any prior systemic treatment for lymphoma including cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic
             therapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy (radiotherapy permitted); patients who have
             received chemotherapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, or monoclonal antibody for
             other malignancies are potentially eligible provided that all of the following are
             true: a) that malignancy was not lymphoma, b) systemic therapy ended at least 3 years
             prior to the diagnosis of FL, and c) there is no evidence of active malignancy other
             than FL

        NOTE: Initiation of first-line systemic therapy is allowed while on this trial; concurrent
        participation in first-line treatment clinical trials will be permitted.

          -  Patients who are HIV-positive

          -  Any second malignancy that requires active systemic therapy

          -  Any other (non-lymphoma) life-threatening disease

          -  Patients unable to provide informed consent (surrogates will not be used)

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from enrollment onto this study because the invasive
             procedures and/or sedation needed to perform these may cause unnecessary harm to the
             unborn fetus. In the event a woman becomes pregnant while on study, she will not be
             removed from the study; however, no follow-up invasive clinical or research procedures
             will be done that include unacceptable to risk to the patient and/or to the unborn
             fetus.
