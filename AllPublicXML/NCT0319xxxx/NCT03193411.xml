  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this is an interventional prospective clinical study which was conducted to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, predictability, ocular aberrations, and flap thickness predictability of
      Visumax femtosecond laser (FSL) compared to Moria M2 microkeratome (MK) in mild to moderate
      myopia.

    <textblock>
      This study included 60 eyes who were divided into two groups. Thirty eyes in group (I) in
      which the flap was created with Visumax FSL, while in group II (30 eyes) the Moria M2 MK was
      used. Keratometric, refractive, and aberrometric measurements were compared preoperatively
      and 3 months postoperatively. The intraoperative subtraction pachymetry (the SP 100 Handy
      pachymeter (Tomey, Nagoya, Japan) was used for preoperative pachymetry and flap thickness
      measurement.
