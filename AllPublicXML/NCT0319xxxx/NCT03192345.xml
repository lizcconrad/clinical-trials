      Primary Objectives:

      Dose escalation (Part 1)

      Part 1A (SAR439459 monotherapy)

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum administered dose (MAD) of
           SAR439459 when administered intravenously as monotherapy in adult patients with advanced
           solid tumors.

      Part 1B (SAR439459 and REGN2810 combination therapy)

        -  To determine the MTD and/or MAD of SAR439459 administered intravenously in combination
           with REGN2810 administered intravenously in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Dose expansion (Part 2)

      Part 2A (SAR439459 monotherapy)

        -  To determine optimal dose of SAR439459 administered intravenously in adult patients with
           advanced melanoma who have failed a prior therapy based on anti-PD-1 (programmed cell
           death-1) or anti-PD-L1.

      Part 2B (SAR439459 and REGN2810 combination therapy)

        -  To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of SAR439459 administered intravenously
           in combination with REGN2810 in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR439459 administered as
           monotherapy (Part 1A/2A) and in combination with REGN2810 (Part 1B/2B) and PK profile of
           REGN2810 in combination with SAR439459 (Part 1B/2B).

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of SAR439459 monotherapy (Part 1A/2A) and SAR439459 and
           REGN2810 combination (Part 1B/2B).

      Dose escalation (Part 1)

        -  To characterize the overall safety and tolerability profile of SAR439459 administered as
           monotherapy and in combination with REGN2810.

        -  To identify the preliminary recommended phase 2 dose (pRP2D) of SAR439459 as monotherapy
           or in combination with REGN2810.

      Dose expansion (Part 2)

        -  To determine the progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), ORR, and
           safety of SAR439459 as monotherapy and PFS, TTP and safety in combination with REGN2810
           in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors.

        -  To confirm the optimal dose of SAR439459 administered in combination with REGN2810 (Part
           2).

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will start from the signature of the main
      informed consent and include a screening period of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment
      period of at least 2 cycles (14 days per cycle), an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days
      following the last administration of study drug (or until the patient receives another
      anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier), and a follow-up visit 3 months after treatment
      discontinuation and every 3 months following, until disease progression, or initiation of
      another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier. Patients who have no disease
      progression, and continue to benefit from the study drug(s), will be allowed to continue
      treatment beyond the common study end-date at their assigned dose unless the study is
      terminated by the Sponsor. The expected enrollment period is approximately 36 months.
