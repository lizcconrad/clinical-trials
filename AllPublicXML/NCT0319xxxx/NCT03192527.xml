  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      KN015,the active substance recombinant human Follicle Stimulating Hormone（FSH） Fc fusion
      protein, which belongs to the pharmaceutical class gonadotropins.KN015 is proposed for
      Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) programs only. Its indication is Controlled Ovarian
      Stimulation （COS）in combination with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist for
      the development of multiple follicles in women participating in an ART program. Due to its
      prolonged duration of FSH activity compared to conventional recombinant FSH (rFSH), a single
      subcutaneous injection of the recommended dose of KN015 may replace any daily rFSH
      preparation in a COS treatment cycle. This study is to evaluation of the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of KN015 in healthy Chinese female
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose, double blind
      parallel design, first-in-human study. The study design allows a gradual escalation of the
      dose-level with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the subjects. Dose
      escalation will continue until identification of MTD or up to a maximum dose of 100 μg.
      Tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity
      characteristics of KN015 will be assessed in healthy female subjects. Eligible subjects will
      undergo down-regulation of endogenous FSH with a GnRH antagonist Triptorelin prior to
      receiving KN015.
