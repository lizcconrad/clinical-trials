  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses whether the addition of chemodenervation to an established regimen of
      pelvic floor physical therapy for painful high tone pelvic floor dysfunction improves
      patients' objective and subjective outcomes. Study subjects will select one of three
      treatment approaches: injection of 50 units Botulinum toxin A with local sedation as an
      office procedure, injection of 100u BoNTA-cosmetic in either the office or while
      anesthetized, or injection of 150 units Botulinum toxin A while anesthetized.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-tone pelvic floor dysfunction is often a painful condition that can be associated with a
      number of female pelvic syndromes including childhood elimination disorders, idiopathic
      urinary retention, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, constipation, sport injuries,
      postoperative and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. Following appropriate patient
      education about pelvic floor function, mainstays of therapy for high-tone pelvic floor
      dysfunction pelvic pain include pharmacotherapeutic agents and pelvic floor physical therapy.
      The investigators hypothesize that chemodenervation with Botulinum toxin A will offer a safe,
      efficacious intervention for women with high tone pelvic floor dysfunction that cannot be
      adequately treated with pelvic floor physical therapy alone.
