  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a leading cause of medical consultations in France and in other
      industrialized countries. Although spinal surgery is a recognized treatment, to date, its
      impact has only been assessed using subjective or declarative criteria. Yet, in many
      orthopaedic diseases, it has been shown that the evaluation of functional capacities,
      including walking speed, is particularly useful to study the impact of these diseases and
      their treatment. To date, no study has attempted to assess the impact of spinal surgery by
      evaluating 1) the functional capacities of patients and 2) spatio-temporal parameters of
      locomotion and joint dynamics. The investigators hypothesize that spinal surgery in patients
      with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis should lead to an improvement in quantifiable
      locomotion parameters, and in particular walking speed. Walking speed is a quantitative
      measurement, which could reflect the degree of functional impairment of the patient before
      and after surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient:

          -  more than 18 years old

          -  who has provided verbal consent

          -  with acquired arthritic lumbar spinal stenosis

          -  eligible for surgery (pain &gt; 3 months, resistant to medical treatment)

          -  for whom the neurosurgeon has scheduled nerve decompression without osteosynthesis or
             instrumentation

          -  able to walk ≥ 10 metres without help

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient:

          -  Adult under guardianship

          -  Absence of health insurance cover

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  History of lumbar spinal surgery involving posterior or anterior arthrodesis

          -  History of lumbar spinal surgery involving arthroplasty

          -  History of lumbar spinal surgery within the previous 12 months

          -  Locomotor disorders due to causes other than spine disease (orthopaedic, neurological,
             vascular, cardiac…) that could significantly affect walking speed

          -  patients in whom the surgery could not be done or deferred (intolerance to the ventral
             decubitus position, infection…)

          -  patients who had revisit surgery before M6 (with the exception of early revisit
             surgery during the first month post-intervention)

          -  patients in whom osteosynthesis or the implantation of instruments was decided and
             done during the surgery
