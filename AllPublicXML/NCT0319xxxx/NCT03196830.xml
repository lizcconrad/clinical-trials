      This study is a single arm study to investigate the efficacy and safety of CAR-T targeted
      CD19/CD20/CD22/CD30 in relapse and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Ten patients
      will recruieted, admitted in hospital for 1 month for the CAR-T treatment and follow-up for
      at least 2 years.
