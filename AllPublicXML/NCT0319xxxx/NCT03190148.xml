    <textblock>
      In this study glucose metabolism of pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery, obese
      pregnant women and normal weight pregnant women was investigated. Three to six months after
      delivery the assessment of Glucose metabolism was repeated and the amount of ectopic lipids
      in the liver, heart and muscle was measured.

      In this study pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery, normal weight and obese
      pregnant women were invited to participate. Between the 24th and the 28th week of pregnancy
      an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as well as an intravenous glucose tolerance test
      (IVGTT) was conducted. Three to six months after delivery the examinations were repeated. In
      addition the ectopic lipid content in the liver, heart and the muscle was measured with
      1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging three to six months post partum. The aim of
      this study was to compare the glucose metabolism during pregnancy between the three groups as
      well as to investigate the changes three to six months after delivery.

    <measure>Assessment of glucose metabolism using an oral Glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an intravenous Glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery, as well as three to six months after delivery</measure>

    <description>In this study the Glucose metabolism (including beta cell function, Insulin resistance and Insulin secretion) of pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery was investigated with an OGTT and an IVGTT between the 24th and the 28th week of pregnancy. In Detail a measurement of the dynamic changes of Glucose, glucagon, C-peptide, Insulin and GLP-1 Levels during the OGTT and the IVGTT in pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery was done. Three to six months after delivery the OGTT and the IVGTT were repeated and a 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the measurement of the amount of ectopic lipids in the liver, heart and the muscle was done.</description>
