  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, multinational, open-label, ascending-dose, delayed-treatment concurrent
      control clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AT132 in subjects
      with X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy aged less than 5 years old. Subjects will receive a single
      dose of AT132 and will be followed for safety and efficacy for 5 years

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of gene transfer in X-Linked
      Myotubular Myopathy. Subjects will receive a single dose of AT132 delivered intravenously. A
      maximum of 3 dose levels of AT132 are planned for evaluation in this study. Four subjects
      will be enrolled at each dose level, including 1 subject at each dose level randomized to
      control with delayed administration of the investigational medicinal product. Dose escalation
      to the next dose level will be considered after evaluation of at least 4 weeks of data from
      all subjects dosed at the current dose level. One of the dose levels will be chosen for dose
      expansion, and the chosen dose will be administered to all delayed-treatment control
      subjects.

      The primary efficacy endpoint measures will be assessed at Week 48. Subjects will be followed
      for a total of 5 years after administration of AT132.

      This study will utilize an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that will monitor
      subject safety and provide recommendations to Audentes regarding dose escalation, dose
      expansion, and safety matters.

Once the optimal AT132 dose is selected, delayed-treatment control subjects will undergo pre-treatment baseline procedures to confirm that they remain eligible to receive treatment with AT132. Once eligible, delayed-treatment control subjects are dosed with AT132, they will initiate the same post-dose procedures as subjects who received AT132</description>
