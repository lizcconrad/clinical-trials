      The PRuDENTE study proposes to assess if metformin therapy a viable, efficient and
      cost-effective intervention to decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes (DMT2) in adult
      subjects with obesity and pre-diabetes in Mexico City. Half of the individuals recruited will
      receive as intervention, metformin and lifestyle modification therapy and the other half will
      receive only lifestyle modification therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes in Mexico is considered a national emergency given its high prevalence, incidence,
      mortality and costs. Mexico has one of the highest prevalence of diabetes; in only 6 years
      (2000 to 2006) this prevalence increased from 7.5% to 14.4%. In 2015, 151 deaths per 100,000
      inhabitants occurred in Mexico due to diabetes complications.

      Metformin is a hypoglycemia drug and itÂ´s the first line medication for the treatment of type
      2 diabetes.There is currently a significant amount of evidence that metformin administration
      reduces the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes and, despite its monotherapy being less
      effective than lifestyle changes, the good biosafety profile and low cost have made it the
      drug of choice in a joint treatment.

      The PRuDENTE study proposes to perform this intervention in a real environment in the clinics
      of the first level of care of the Ministry of Health of the Government of Mexico City, in
      order to provide evidence about the cost-effectiveness of metformin as a public health
      intervention for the prevention of diabetes.
