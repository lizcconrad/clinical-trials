  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast to conventional Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine is the most common
      used therapy of complementary and alternative medicine. Taiwan inherits traditional Chinese
      culture, and the people popularly accept traditional Chinese medicine for general diseases.
      However, most patients with acute or critical illness are used to admit to emergency
      department for medical services, and then transfer to the department of related specialist
      for further treatment. During the course of staying at emergent observation room, some
      diseases do not meet the criteria of admission and keep for evaluation. The longer of staying
      at emergent observation room the more waste medical resources.

      The Chinese medicine department of Changhua Christian hospital has treated patients, who
      consulted us at their own dispense, with subjective discomfort but remained at the emergent
      observation room. Detailed contents of this study include the Chinese and Western medicine,
      pharmaceutical, nursing cooperation mode, monitoring clinical effect of treating of the
      patients diagnosed with intestinal obstruction or ileus who complain about nausea, vomiting,
      abdominal pain, abdominal distension or constipation.And the patients were assigned to the
      control and treatment group. Then we give the treatment group with the electroacupuncture
      treatment,and the control groupe with the Chinese medicine seeds and the transcutaneous nerve
      stimulation (no power).The patients were diagnosed with objective analysis of tongue
      diagnosis, pulse diagnosis, heart rate variability, and questionnaire of pain. Hope that we
      can assess the efficacy of both two different treatment,and also assess the cost of medical
      care, and try to complete the syndromes statistical analysis of traditional Chinese medicine
      for abdominal pain, building the relevance of Chinese medicine physical assessment teaching
      and clinical efficacy.

      The most important of this clinical teaching is that, this is a good opportunity for Chinese
      medicine and Western medicine to cooperate with each other at the emergency department to
      confirm the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine, not only in the field of chronic or
      geriatric diseases, but also in the field of emergency with the evidence base. This factually
      achieves communication and integration of Chinese and Western medicine, and benefits the
      public.

    <description>The primary outcome evaluation was the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Visual analog scale is graded from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) and has proven its usefulness and clinical validity for the evaluation of pain. Patients were evaluated at two timepoints in this study: intervention (VAS-1), after intervention (VAS-2), 3 days after the intervention (VAS-3).</description>

    <description>The primary outcome evaluation was the the brief pain inventory (BPI) for pain. Brief pain inventory is used to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. Patients were evaluated at two timepoints in this study: intervention (BPI-1), after intervention (BPI-2), 3 days after the intervention (BPI-3).</description>

    <description>Participants were randomized divided into experimental and control groups .Acupuncture included Hegu (LI 4), Neiguan (PC6), Zusali (ST 36), Shanjuxu (ST37), Xiajuxu (ST39), Taichong (LR3) and Taibai(SP3) on both hands and legs. Acupuncture included Hegu (LI 4) and Neiguan (PC6), Zusali (ST 36) and Taichong (LR3) with electrical stimulation were conducted. The frequency of electrical stimulation was 2 Hz and the intensities of the stimulation was below 9.8 mA for 15 minutes.After 15 minutes treatment, acupuncture were removed and after 15 minutes the investigators stated to evaluate.</description>

    <description>Participants were randomized divided into experimental and control groups. The Vaccaria Seeds (scientific name:Vaccaria segetalis) will be applied in control group. Vaccaria Seed is a spherical, smooth and hard seed, which is commonly used on ear acupuncture point. In control group, Vaccaria Seeds will be secured on the acupuncture point the same as experimental group, and coverd by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which is actually not turned on. The intervention will last for 15 minutes.After 15 minutes treatment, acupuncture were removed and after 15 minutes the investigators stated to evaluate.</description>
