  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive impairment is one of the most common complications in elderly
      surgical patients. Laser laryngeal surgery is a short procedure, but characterized by high
      risk of disastrous airway fire. So the recommended oxygen concentration is less than 30%. For
      elderly patients, because of preoperatively declined cardiovascular and lung function and
      cognitive function, there is a potential that intraoperative low oxygen concentration may
      lead to drop of arterial oxygen tension, decrease of brain oxygenation, and exacerbate brain
      function impairment. Intravenous anesthesia and inhalation anesthesia is two commonly used
      technique for general anesthesia. Consequently, we carry out this study to identify whether
      different classes of anesthetics can affect postoperative cognitive function in old patient
      undergoing laser laryngeal surgery.

      The allocation sequence is generated by computer random number generation, and the allocation
      is placed in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes by a non-investigator. Enrolment
      and data collection are performed by trained research staff who are not involved in the care
      of the patients. The treating clinicians are not blinded to the assignment group, but all
      other staff involved in both the collection and collation of data, and administration of
      neurocognitive testing, are blinded to group allocation

      The primary measurement is the MMS scores. The secondary measurements are intraoperative
      desaturation score (multiplying Spo2 &lt; 90% by time (seconds)), extubation time, orientation
      time, and time to discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU).

      A sample size of 35 was determined by using a power analysis based on the assumptions that
      the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment in adult after otorhinolaryngological
      surgery would be as high as 50 %, b) a 70% reduction (from 50% to 15%) would be of clinical
      significance, and c) α= 0.05, β= 0.2.

      The continuous variables were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) whereas
      categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentage for data description.

      The outcome of interest is cognitive decline. A Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model
      with compound symmetry covariance structure was constructed to compare differences between
      two treatments with different time points as the repeated factors. As the effect of
      treatments may vary across different time points, an interaction between treatments and time
      was included in the model. Bonferroni-corrected post hoc test was conducted to adjust the
      observed significant level for multiple comparisons if the null hypothesis was rejected.
