  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the effectiveness of combined treatment with NB-UVB and tacrolimus
      versus NB-UVB alone . Patients will be treated for 6 months and followed up after 3 months
      .All types of vitiligo will be included except universal vitiligo.

      Study approval:

      The study will be submitted for approval by the Scientific and Ethical Committees at Faculty
      of Medicine, South Valley University, Qena. An informed written consent will be obtained from
      all participants.

      Study design:

      A randomized controlled trial.

      Study population:

      The study will include patients who attend the outpatient Clinic of Dermatology, Venereology
      and Andrology, Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University, with clinical diagnosis of
      vitiligo. Patients with universal vitiligo, women who are pregnant or lactating at the time
      of recruitment, children ≤ 2 years old, patients with acute or chronic disease that might
      affect skin barrier function or patients with history of photosensitivity will be excluded.

      Methods:

        -  Wash out period: ( 4 weeks) During this period, initial medical evaluation will be
           performed, social demographic data will be collected and patients will be enrolled after
           obtaining a written consent.

        -  Test period: (6 months) *Randomization: at the initial visit (visit 0), following the
           wash out period and before the start of treatment, patients will be randomly assigned to
           2 treatment groups; Group (A) : patients will receive NB-UVB sessions twice weekly for 6
           months. Initial dose will be 100 mJ/cm2, the dose will be increased by 10% per session.

      Group (B) : patients will receive NB-UVB sessions twice weekly for 6 months with the same
      dose plus topical application of tacrolimus 0.03% ointment twice dialy for the first month of
      treatment and once dialy for the rest 5 months of treatment.

      All Patients will be evaluated before the start of treatment (visit 0) and at monthly
      intervals for 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of vitiligo involvement is calculated in terms of hand units. One hand unit is approximately equivalent to 1% of the total body surface area. The degree of pigmentation is estimated to the nearest of one of the following percentages: 100% - complete depigmentation, no pigment is present; 90% - specks of pigment present; 75% - depigmented area exceeds the pigmented area; 50% - pigmented and depigmented areas are equal; 25% - pigmented area exceeds depigmented area; and 10% - only specks of depigmentation present. The VASI for each body region is determined by the product of the area of vitiligo in hand units and the extent of depigmentation within each hand unit measured patch.
Total body VASI = S All body sites [Hand Units] ´ [Residual depigmentation].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vitiligo Disease Activity (VIDA) score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VIDA is a six-point scale for assessing vitiligo activity. Scoring is based on the individual's own opinion of the present disease activity over time. Active vitiligo involves either expansion of existing lesions or appearance of new lesions. Grading is as follows: VIDA Score +4 - Activity of 6 weeks or less duration; +3 - Activity of 6 weeks to 3 months; +2 - Activity of 3 - 6 months;+1 - Activity of 6 - 12 months; 0 - Stable for 1 year or more; and -1 - Stable with spontaneous repigmentation since 1 year or more. A low VIDA score indicates less activity.</description>
