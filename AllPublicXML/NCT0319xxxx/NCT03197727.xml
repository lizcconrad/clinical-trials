      This study compares the associated risk factors between adults with tooth wear and age- and
      sex-matched controls without tooth wear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some people are at greater risk due to their eating and brushing habits. Poor oral health
      behaviors and malnutrition are the leading causes of tooth surface loss in adults. Fluid
      consumption trends have changed, and the increased consumption of carbonated drinks coincides
      with a decline in the consumption of dairy products and increases in the use of packaged
      products. Frequent and faulty brushing with abrasive oral hygiene products can also increase
      TW. Individuals unhappy with the color of their teeth may also frequently use whitening
      toothpaste.

      Saliva is considered the biological factor with the greatest potential to modify the
      progression of TW. There are several potential mechanisms by which saliva may protect enamel
      from dietary acid erosion. Saliva protection mechanisms include the dilution of erosive
      agents in the mouth, neutralization, effects of calcium and phosphate ions, and slowing of
      the rate of enamel dissolution.

      The loss of dental tissue can lead to the character's loss of precision and form, and in
      advanced stages the dentin surface can be exposed. TW is initially painless and
      unrecognizable. In the next stage, complaints often include tenderness and non-aesthetic
      factors. It is difficult to recognize the signs of TW and very important to avoid premature
      diagnosis, as TW can often be diagnosed by a dentist. Correct diagnosis is an important part
      of the treatment and will help the dentist determine recommendations for the patient.
