  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is one of main adverse events in ventilated patients who receive long-term usage of
      mono-sedative. Sequential sedation may reduce these adverse effects. This study aimed to
      evaluate incidence and risk factors for delirium in sequential sedation patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have showed that patients under mechanical ventilation have a higher risk
      for experiencing delirium than nonmechanically ventilated patients (20%-50%). Its occurrence
      is also more frequent in elder patients. More than that, it is often hard to identify
      delirium by physicians, leading to unreasonable management of ICU patients.

      And delirium is one of main adverse events in ventilated patients who receive long-term usage
      of mono-sedative. Sequential sedation may reduce these adverse effects.

      However, few present studies focus on delirium in sequential sedation patients. Thus, in this
      study, we aimed to determine the factors of delirium in patients who received sequential
      sedation in ICU.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study was delirium. Patient evaluations were implemented using Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale every four hours a day for a maximum of twenty-eight days or until ICU discharge, whichever occurred first. The risk factors were analyzed using risk regression (logistic-regression). Any variables which had P&lt;0.2 after univariable logistic-regression or potential variables associated with delirium were included for multivariable logistic-regression. P&lt;0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance.</description>
