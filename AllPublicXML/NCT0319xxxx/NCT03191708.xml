  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR) is a novel method for evaluating the functional significance of
      coronary stenosis. The purpose of the FAVOR II China study is to evaluate the diagnostic
      accuracy of on-line QFR with FFR as the reference standard. The secondary purpose is to
      compare the diagnostic accuracies between online QFR and online QCA, with FFR as the
      reference standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients at high risk of having one or more coronary stenosis are evaluated routinely by
      invasive coronary angiography. Lesions are often quantified by QCA, but fractional flow
      reserve is increasingly used to assess functional significance of identified stenosis. FFR is
      assessed during CAG by advancing a wire with a pressure transducer towards the stenosis and
      measure the ratio in pressure between the two sides of the stenosis during medical induced
      maximum blood flow (hyperemia).

      The solid evidence for FFR evaluation of coronary stenosis and the relative simplicity in
      performing the measurements have supported adoption of an FFR based strategy in many centers
      but the need for interrogating the stenosis by a pressure wire, the cost of the wire, and the
      drug inducing hyperemia limits more widespread adoption.

      QFR is a novel method for evaluating the functional significance of coronary stenosis by
      calculation of the pressure drop in the vessel based on two angiographic projections. The
      FAVOR Pilot study (Tu et al.) showed promising results for core laboratory QFR analysis in
      selected patients. However, the accuracy of QFR when assessed online in the catheterization
      laboratory is unknown. The purpose of the FAVOR II China study is to evaluate the diagnostic
      accuracy of on-line QFR with FFR as the reference standard. The secondary purpose is to
      compare the diagnostic accuracies between online QFR and online QCA, with FFR as the
      reference standard. It is a prospective and multi-center trial with a total of 308 patients
      conducted at 5 Chinese centers.
