    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the safety and clinical activity of nivolumab and
      ipilimumab in combination with either sequential administration of CY/GVAX pancreas vaccine
      followed by CRS-207 (Arm A) or with administration of CRS-207 alone (Arm B) in patients with
      pancreatic cancer.
