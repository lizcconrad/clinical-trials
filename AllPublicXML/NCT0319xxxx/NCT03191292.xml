  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a bacterial epidemiology in patients who present a
      prosthetic joint infection and for which a surgery is necessary. At the time of the first
      surgery, as the bacteria responsible for the infection are not known, a probabilistic
      antibiotherapy is initiated at once after the surgical treatment. The antibiotherapy is then
      adapted to the bacteria from samples collected during the surgery when they are identified
      (the delay is 14-21 days).

      The study will focus on bacteria identified on samples collected during the surgery; the
      delay between the implantation of the prosthesis and the presentation of symptoms will be
      considered : more than one year vs. less than one year.

      Investigators assume that there is not the same type of bacteria involved in those two cases
      of delays and that the probabilistic antibiotherapy may be not optimal when the symptoms are
      presented more than one year after implantation of the prosthesis. A probabilistic
      antibiotherapy not adapted lead to develop resistance for the bacteria and decrease the
      chance to cure the patient (increasing of relapse).

      The result of this study will allow medical doctors to have an optimal probabilistic
      antibiotherapy, depending on the delay between implantation of the prosthesis and the
      presentation of the symptoms.

    <description>The samples collected during the surgery are put in bacteriological culture media. Bacteriological culture of samples collected during surgery for all patients included is made allowing to identify which type of bacteria is involved in the infection, depending on the chronology of the infection (delay between implantation and the presentation of the symptoms [&lt; 1 year vs. &gt; 1 year])</description>

    <measure>collection of probabilistic antibiotic treatment in patients with prosthetic joint infection</measure>
    <time_frame>the day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The type of molecule used and dosage will be described. Probabilistic antibiotic treatment is initiated immediately after the surgery, before the bacteria is identified. The samples are put in bacteriological culture media. The time to obtain results is usually 3 weeks maximum after the surgery because this is the delay for slow-growing bacteria to grow. Then, the empirical treatment can be amended in order to have an antibiotic treatment adapted to the bacteria found.</description>
