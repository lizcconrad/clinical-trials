    <textblock>
      There is a relationship between depression and periodontal disease. This relationship may be
      double-sided. A psychological state such as anxiety, depression, body image, and self-esteem
      may be affected from the symptoms of periodontal disease.

      Background: Depression is a multi-factorial disease characterized by a variety of symptoms.
      Psychiatric disorders seem to be more prone to periodontitis compared to patients without
      psychiatric disorders. However periodontal disease and depression can be considered
      bidirectional risk factors. Periodontal disease can also be an effect on depression. The aim
      of this randomized controlled clinical study is to determine the effect of non-surgical
      mechanical periodontal treatment on psychological state.

      Material and methods: The study population consisted of 184 depressed patients with
      non-treated periodontal diseases. Two randomized group is formed from these patients.
      Immediately periodontal treatment (test group, n = 92) and delayed periodontal treatment
      (control group, n = 92). Clinical periodontal and psychological measures were performed at
      baseline and 6th weeks on control and test group.
