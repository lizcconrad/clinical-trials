  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn about factors that may affect healthy eating and
      physical activity for Latino families in Houston. Researchers will use this information to
      design a program to encourage healthy behaviors.

      To take part in this study, participant will have a study partner. Participant's study
      partner is another adult living in participant's household. If participant and participant's
      study partner agrees to take part in this study, participant will participate in the
      following activities:

        -  Participant will fill out questionnaires about participant, participant's family, and
           participant's neighborhood, and about participant's exercise behaviors and the types and
           amount of food participant usually eats. These questionnaires should take about 1 hour
           to 1.5 hours to complete.

        -  Participant will complete a checklist and record the types of foods and beverages
           present in participant's home. This will include all of the food in participant's
           refrigerator, freezer, cabinets, countertops, and any other areas where food might be
           kept. Kitchen appliances and food preparation tools will also be recorded. Study staff
           will be available to assist participant. This will take about 45 minutes to complete.

        -  Participant's height, weight, and waist and hip circumference will be measured. To
           measure participant's waist and hip circumference, participant may be asked to lift
           participant's shirt to expose participant's stomach area and lower participant's pants
           to expose participant's mid-hip area. The height, weight, and waist and hip
           circumference measurements should take about 10 minutes.

        -  Participant will be given an accelerometer. An accelerometer is a small device that is
           worn on participant's hip that measures the amount of physical activity participant
           does. Participant will wear the accelerometer for 7 days and then return it in a
           pre-addressed envelope provided to participant.

        -  Within 3 weeks after the study visit, participant will complete a questionnaire over the
           phone or online, depending on participant's preference, that will ask about the types
           and amounts of food participant usually eats.

        -  During the home visit, participant and participant's study partner will be randomly
           assigned (as in a flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participant will have an equal
           chance of being in any group. These groups differ in the order that questionnaires about
           the types and amounts of food participant eats are completed. If participant is assigned
           to group 1, participant will complete a questionnaire called a food frequency
           questionnaire at the home visit and a questionnaire called a 24-hour recall within 3
           weeks after the home visit. If participant is assigned to group 2, participant will
           complete the 24-hour recall at the home visit and the food frequency questionnaire
           within 3 weeks after the home visit.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Participation in this study will be over after participant completes the questionnaire within
      3 weeks after the home visit and return the accelerometer.

      Additional Information:

      Participant may be contacted by phone, unencrypted text, unencrypted email, or mail while
      participant is taking part in this study to remind participant about study procedures (for
      example, returning the accelerometer). Study staff will only contact participant using the
      types of communication that participant specifies.

      Participant will be asked to give the names and contact information of family members and/or
      friends for the study staff to contact in the event they cannot reach participant first.

      If the accelerometer is lost or stolen, participant will not be responsible for the
      replacement cost, but participant should tell the study staff right away.

      Participant's home address may be used to access public information about the area where
      participant lives. This is to help researchers learn about how participant's neighborhood
      encourages physical activity, healthy eating, or other important health behaviors. The
      results from this study will only be reported as a group and participant will not be
      identifiable from any products resulting from this study (such as research papers).
      Participant's home address will never be released or published in any form. Participant's
      address will be stored separately from other study data, and only the study chair will be
      able to see the data after the neighborhood information has been collected.

      Participant may be contacted in the future to see if participant would agree to take part in
      other research studies.

      Women who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant during the study period will no
      longer be able to participate. If participant becomes pregnant during this study, please tell
      the study staff right away.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 120 participants total will take part in this study,
      and up to 48 will take part in this part (the home visit portion) of the study. All will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.
