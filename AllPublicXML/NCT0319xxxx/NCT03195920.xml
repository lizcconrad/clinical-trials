      This is a single arm, single center study to assess the safety and efficacy of a form of
      extracorporeal lithotripsy, called the Enhanced Lithotripsy System, to treat urinary stones.
      Subjects will be treated up to 2 times with the Enhanced Lithotripsy System and followed for
      30 days after the last treatment session.
