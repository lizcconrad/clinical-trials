  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a mobile phone app designed to help Veterans with
      PTSD. Participants in this study will be randomized to receive one of 2 possible mobile phone
      apps. The term &quot;randomized&quot; means that which app a participant receives will not be based on
      any characteristic or behavior of the participant, but will be determined solely by chance
      like a flip of a coin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive access to the mobile app &quot;PTSD Coach&quot;. Participants will be
      randomized (by computerized coin flip) to one of two versions of the mobile app. All versions
      of the app will provide comprehensive information and tools for managing trauma symptoms, but
      one version of the app will provide personalized, confidential coaching messages delivered by
      either a Veteran peer or clinical psychologist. Participants will be asked to complete an
      online survey before using the mobile phone application and again 8 weeks later. Participants
      will be provided with the option to complete a telephone interview after 8 weeks of using the
      mobile phone application. To be eligible, participants must be a U.S. military Veteran, age
      18 or older, have received a previous diagnosis of PTSD, and own an iPhone or iPad device.
