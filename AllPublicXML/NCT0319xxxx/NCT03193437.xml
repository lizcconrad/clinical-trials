  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of
      selinexor in patients with advanced thymic epithelial tumor progressing after primary
      chemotherapy. This is a multicenter, open label phase II trial that uses a Simons two stage
      design. The study population is adults with histologically confirmed, advanced, inoperable
      TETs who are progressing after treatment with at least one platinum containing chemotherapy
      regimen.

      This study is comprised of 2 similar phase II trials, one running in US (25 patients) and one
      running in EU (25 patients):

      There are two study arms:

      Arm A: Thymoma

        -  Stage 1: 15 patients

        -  Stage 2: 10 patients

      Arm B: Thymic carcinoma

        -  Stage 1: 15 patients

        -  Stage 2: 10 patients
