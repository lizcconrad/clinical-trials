  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was suggested that the patient compliance plans an important role in the Hp eradication.
      However, data on whether re-education could improve the eradication rate are lacking. We
      consider that re-education on patients by telephone during the process of drug administration
      could increase the eradication rate in Hp infected patients.

      We hypothesized that telephone re-education during the whole process of drug administration
      would improve the compliance of patients and ultimately increase the Hp eradication rate.
