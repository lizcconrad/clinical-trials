      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS

        -  In subjects with T2DM and HF, effect of canagliflozin will be superior to placebo for
           the change from baseline in PCWP after a single dose (6 hours post-dose) and after 4
           weeks.

        -  Treatment with canagliflozin will be well tolerated over 4 weeks.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center study
      (Figure 1). Thirty subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 randomization ratio to canagliflozin
      300 mg once daily (QD) or placebo. The study will include a 3-week pretreatment screening
      phase and a 4-week double-blind treatment phase.

    <description>Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. It works by decreasing the amount of sugar the body absorbs, and increasing the amount of sugar that leaves the body in the urine.
