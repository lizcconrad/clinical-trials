    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of Rhythmic Reading Training
      (RRT), a computer-assisted intervention method that combines sublexical reading exercises
      with rhythm processing, and that of a multimodal intervention comprising different
      methodology, called 'Abilmente'. All interventions were delivered for a period ranging 1-2,5
      months, in 60 minutes biweekly sessions.

    <intervention_name>RRT+sat</intervention_name>
    <description>RRT is a child-friendly computerized reading training program designed for Italian students with DD aged 8-14 yrs. The main feature of this intervention is the integration of a traditional remediation approach (sublexical treatment) with rhythm processing. Therefore, all reading exercises are characterized by a rhythmic accompaniment with gradually increasing speed. For this study, RRT was delivered in combination with a specific auditory training involving several music games specifically designed for improving auditory processing abilities typically compromised in children with DD.</description>
