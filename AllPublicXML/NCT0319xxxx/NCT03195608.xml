  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) impacts an individual's fitness to drive in a number of ways that
      increase the crash risk in this population. Current vehicle automation technologies are
      available, that although designed for the general public, may help drivers with PD stay on
      the roads longer and safer than currently possible. Using a driving simulator (a safe and
      cost-effective alternative with no impact on licensing for participants), this study will
      investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of utilizing in-vehicle technology
      (i.e., a simulated lane change assistance system) to address critical driving errors in
      individuals with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease.

    <description>Participants will complete a standardized battery of paper and pencil and computer tests. Following these tests, participants will complete a baseline simulator driving assessment without any form of assistive technology. We will employ a CDS-200 driving simulator (DriveSafety Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). A trained blinded evaluator will observe the recorded drive and score the drive. After the baseline assessment, participants will engage in 3 intervention sessions (lasting 30 minutes each). During these sessions, the lane change assistance system will be introduced and participants will be taught how to use it. After the 3 sessions, participants will participate in a post-test, similar to the baseline assessment but with a different route within the simulated world. They will drive this new route with the assistive technology. One to two weeks after the post-test, participants will be invited to participate in a follow-up assessment (battery of tests and simulator assessment).</description>

    <description>This study will investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 6-session lane change ADAS-intervention on the simulated driving performance of individuals with mild to moderate PD. We anticipate that the use of lane change assist technology will decrease the number of driving errors in individuals with PD. As this is a feasibility study, we will evaluate: -recruitment capability and sample characteristics - data collection methods, procedures, and outcome measures - acceptability and suitability of the lane change assist technology intervention - preliminary efficacy The outcomes of this study will inform the design of a larger study, should such large-scale study be warranted.</description>
