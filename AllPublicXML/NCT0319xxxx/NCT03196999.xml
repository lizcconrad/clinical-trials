    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a mobile app called Resolving Psychological Stress (REPS) to
      help alleviate symptoms of PTSD. The app will administer threat-related attention bias
      modification to individuals who score high on a PTSD checklist. This study will be
      administered remotely to individuals in the United States. The aims of the study are to
      explore both the feasibility and acceptability of the app with it's users, as well as,
      explore the efficacy of the app at alleviating PTSD severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly disabling disorder that affects
      approximately 30 million people in the United States. New low-cost and accessible treatments
      for PTSD are desperately needed. Threat-related attention biases represent an important
      potential treatment target for PTSD. Such attention biases predict risk for PTSD following
      trauma exposure, and are thought to maintain symptoms of PTSD and other anxiety disorders.
      Research indicates that specific forms of computerized attention bias modification (ABM) are
      effective in reducing attention bias for threat as well as anxiety in patients with diverse
      anxiety disorders. The investigators have developed a mobile &quot;app&quot; called RePS (Resolving
      Psychological Stress) to administer threat-related ABM to patients with PTSD and have tested
      it in a laboratory-based pilot study of 19 people with PTSD. Preliminary data indicate that
      the app is highly acceptable to patients and that use of the app reduces attention bias for
      threat and PTSD symptom severity. The study aims are to examine the feasibility,
      acceptability and usability of remotely administered app-based ABM; and determine the
      efficacy of remote app-based ABM in reducing attention bias and PTSD severity.
