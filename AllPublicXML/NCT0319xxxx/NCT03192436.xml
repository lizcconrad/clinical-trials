  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromodulation is a fast growing field that offers a wide range of applications for both
      understanding and treating the brain. Future research for non-invasive neuromodulation will
      need to elucidate the optimal frequency, duration, and intensity of stimulation for a variety
      of technologies and diseases. Closed loop stimulation is thus a promising research area that
      allows for responsive stimulation and real time symptom management. Our project is proposed
      to develop and test a novel noninvasive neuromodulation integrating transcranial focused
      ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) with electrophysiological source imaging (ESI-tFUS) to allow
      evidence-based neuromodulation for brain research and the management of brain conditions.
      Despite the recent developments and attention surrounding tFUS, relatively little is known
      about the mechanisms and optimal parameters of this stimulation technology. The addition of
      ESI neuroimaging, aimed at providing biomarkers to assess the effects of tFUS
      neuromodulation, could provide crucial necessary information regarding the neural response to
      the applied stimulation in real-time. In order for tFUS to be further developed and
      transformed into a robust neuromodulation technology, an integrated electrophysiological
      source-imaging-guided tFUS system to allow for individualized and responsive stimulation is
      needed.

      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the proposed ESI-tFUS in human subjects
      using motor and somatosensory paradigms.

    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study outcome is a closed-loop control algorithm to control the parameters in administrating the tFUS. The outcome data of the study will include the MRI data, EEG data, tFUS location and timing data, perceptual (subject reported) effects of tFUS and/or pins, and any reported adverse events. Analysis of the EEG data will be conducted using EEG analysis software, and the customized software to be developed at the PI's lab. The EEG data will also be correlated with tFUS application. The output of our data analysis process will be in the form of quantitative spatial estimation of tFUS activation in the brain using EEG source reconstruction.</description>
