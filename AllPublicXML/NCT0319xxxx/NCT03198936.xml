      Brain Pill™ is a mental health enhancing and successfully marketed dietary supplement with a
      balanced composition of scientifically proven nutrients for accelerating and restoring brain
      function and thereby enhancing the cognitive performance and creating positive impact on
      behavioral outcomes.Hence the aim of the study is assessment of the effects of Brain Pill
      supplementation on memory performance in healthy adults with subjective memory complaints.

      It is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled , single centered study to access the
      efficacy of Brain Pill on working memory capacity and mild mood disturbances.

      Effect of Brain Pill on working memory capacity will be accessed by improvement in mean
      response time and accuracy measured by working memory battery from baseline to end of the
      study. Effect of Brain Pill is also accessed on Neurophysiological improvement in working
      memory as measured by electroencephelogram (EEG) from baseline to end of the study. Also
      improvement in attention and concentration will be accessed from baseline to end of the study
      by Picture recognition test.

      Effect of Brain Pill on mood disturbances will be accessed by Brunel Universal Mood State.
