  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in obese youth is often preceded by a prediabetic state called:
      Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT), which is associated with a pre-existing defect in insulin
      secretion. This study intends to determine if genetic factors are associated with defects in
      insulin secretion, the incretin system and hepatic insulin resistance in obese adolescents.
      The long-term goal of this study is to generate information on both the genetics as well as
      the pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes in Youth, which ultimately might guide the
      investigators towards better preventive and treatment avenues.

      The Specific Aims of this study are:

      Aim 1a. To delineate the effects of TCF7L2 rs7903146 on functional Beta-Cell Capacity in
      obese adolescents with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and pre-IGT.

      Aim 1b. To determine if the risk genotype in TCF7L2 is associated with worsening in beta cell
      function longitudinally, thereby affecting changes in glucose tolerance.

      Aim 2. To examine the functional effect of the rs7903146 variant in the TCF7L2 gene on a)
      incretin effect in obese adolescents with IGT and pre-IGT.

      Aim 3. To determine the functional effects of TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP on hepatic glucose fluxes
      in obese adolescents with IGT and pre-IGT.
