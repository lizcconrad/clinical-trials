    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether rituximab (RTX) offers
      effectiveness and safety advantages over other commonly used approved Disease-Modifying Drugs
      (DMT) in the largest real-world population-based structured prospective follow-up cohort of
      Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients. The study will include both treatment
      naïve patients starting their first DMT and patients switching from a previous first line DMT
      (escalation/second-line).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-intervention observational prospective cohort study assessing the
      long-term safety and efficacy of RTX treatment in MS compared with other common MS DMTs
      regarding both clinical and radiological parameters in a real-life population of patients
      with MS.

      A number of parameters will be assessed annually. These include baseline demographics,
      previous drug history and reasons for discontinuation, disability status (expanded disability
      status scale), relapses, safety and adverse events (AE), contrast enhancing T1 and newly
      appearing T2 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as a panel of patient reported
      outcome measures: Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT); MS impact scale-29 (MSIS-29) Fatigue
      Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), the MS check
      scale and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire 9 (TSQM-9).

      Retrospective data entered in medical charts and the Swedish MS registry will be included
      together with prospective annual structured follow up from inclusion into the study for a
      minimum of three years (three to nine years).

        All patients initiated at their first or second disease-modifying drug between January 1
        2011 and June 30 2018 will be included in the trial. Up to present date, study-related data
        will be retrospectively controlled via individual study of patient records. Patients will
        be identified through the Swedish MS registry. Inclusion into the COMBAT-MS core study will
        be subject to written informed consent. Given the non-intervention design of the study and
        very limited study-specific procedures outside of clinical practise, we expect
        participation rates to be very high. Based on preliminary calculations from the MS registry
        the projected number of participants will be 3700 patients, out of which at least 1000 are
        treated with rituximab first or second-line.
