    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of venetoclax and to find the highest dose of
      venetoclax that can be given safely when it is combined with one or two chemotherapy drugs
      (cytarabine or cytarabine and idarubicin). This study tests different doses of venetoclax to
      see which dose is safer in children with leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Determine a tolerable combination of venetoclax plus chemotherapy in
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute leukemia
      of ambiguous lineage. The primary endpoint is the maximum tolerated combination (MTC) of
      venetoclax plus chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: Estimate the overall response rate to the combination of venetoclax and
      chemotherapy in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractor AML or acute leukemia of
      ambiguous lineage. The secondary endpoints are the rates of complete remission (CR) and
      complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) for patients treated at the MTC.

      This study will be done in two parts:

        -  Part 1 - Dose Escalation: The goal of Part 1 of the study is to find the highest
           tolerable combination of venetoclax and chemotherapy that can be given to patients with
           leukemia.

        -  Part 2 - Dose Expansion: After determination of doses in Part 1, patients will be
           enrolled on Part 2: to look at the effects of the venetoclax in combination with
           chemotherapy.

      Depending on when participants enroll on the study, PART1 participants will receive one of
      the following courses of therapy:

        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-17; OR

        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-11; OR

        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-11; idarubicin once
           on day 1; OR

        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine every 12 hours on days 8-17; idarubicin once
           on day 1.

      PART 2 participants will receive one of the following courses of therapy:

        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine - to be determined from Part 1 of the study;
           OR

        -  Venetoclax daily on days 1-28; cytarabine - to be determined from Part 1 of the study;
           idarubicin once on day 8.

      The cytarabine dosage will be that found in Part 1 to be the highest safest dose.

      Those participants receiving idarubicin will also receive dexrazoxane.

      All participants on both Part 1 and Part 2 receive one intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy before
      starting the first cycle. Patients with CNS disease will receive weekly IT therapy until the
      cerebrospinal fluid becomes free of leukemia (minimum of 4 doses). Bone marrow aspiration and
      biopsy to assess response will be performed between days 28 and 42 of cycle 1. Patients who
      achieve complete remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery/partial
      remission (CR/CRi/PR) and who do not experience unacceptable toxicity during cycle 1 may
      receive up to four cycles of chemotherapy.

    <description>In Part 1, venetoclax with cytarabine will initially be given at dose level 1 and escalated based on tolerability. Idarubicin will be given only at dose level 4.
Two expansion cohorts will be enrolled:
Cohort A will be a group of 12 participants receiving the maximum tolerated combination (MTC) that does not include idarubicin.
Cohort B will be a group of 12 participants receiving the MTC with idarubicin.
Intrathecal Triple Therapy (ITMHA) will be given prior to cycle 1. Patients without evidence of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia will receive no further IT therapy during cycle 1. Patients with CNS disease will receive weekly ITMHA beginning on day 8 until the cerebrospinal fluid becomes free of leukemia.</description>

                  patients in all categories must not be eligible to undergo curative therapy, such
                  as immediate SCT, because of disease burden, time needed to identify a stem cell
                  donor, or other reasons.

          -  St. Jude patients must be between 2 years and ≤ 21 years of age, on therapy (active
             patient), or within 3 years of completion of therapy. Patients treated at
             collaborating sites must be ≤ 24 years old.

          -  Performance status: Lansky ≥ 50 for patients who are ≤ 16 years old and Karnofsky ≥
             50% for patients who are &gt; 16 years old.

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute effects of all prior therapy and
