  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive stimulation of the central nervous system, including transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has been increasingly
      used in the investigation of cortical plasticity. The purpose of our study is to understand
      mechanistically—at the neurophysiological and systems levels—how the brain learns new motor
      skills. We propose to study the acquisition, consolidation, and retention of motor skill
      learning in healthy subjects. At the behavioral level, we will use movement kinematics to
      quantify and characterize movement, which allow us to infer functional strategies used by the
      brain to reduce movement errors. At a neurophysiological level, we will use TMS to document
      changes in cortical circuitry, which will allow us to infer neuroplastic changes possibly
      subserving these strategies. At a systems level, we will enhance motor system excitability
      using tDCS, which will enable us to infer the contribution of the stimulated area to the
      motor system's ability to learn new skills.
