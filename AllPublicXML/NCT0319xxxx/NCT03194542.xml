    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      luspatercept in subjects with MPN-associated myelofibrosis and anemia with and without
      RBC-transfusion dependence. The study is divided into a Screening Period, a Treatment Period
      (consisting of a Primary Phase, a Day 169 Disease Response Assessment, and an Extension
      Phase), followed by a Posttreatment Follow-up Period.

    <description>Luspatercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of the human active in receptor type IIB linked to the IgG1 Fc domain. Luspatercept, through a mechanism of action different from erythropoietin, works to correct ineffective erythropoiesis by promoting late-stage maturation of erythroblasts.</description>
