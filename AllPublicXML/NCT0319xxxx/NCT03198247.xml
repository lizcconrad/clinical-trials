  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether adding a treatment using pain neuroscience
      education (PNE) and coping skills training (CST) to usual care, in subjects with knee
      osteoarthritis and pain catastrophizing, who are scheduled for a total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA), is more effective than only usual care. There is a high evidence level of different
      systematic reviews, which support the efficacy of physiotherapy treatments combined with
      behavioural techniques aimed to reduce pain catastrophism, pain and disability in other
      pathologies. The primary aim of that kind of interventions is to help the subjects to
      reconceptualise its own pain understanding and its role on the recovery process, as well as
      promoting an increase of activity and encourage the subject to resume its usual activity
      instead of continuing to avoid it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of TKA has increased dramatically during the last two decades, its popularity
      can be attributed to its evident success regarding pain improvement, deformity correction and
      disability reduction in knee osteoarthritis subjects. However, only a third of the patients
      report no functional problems after surgery, the 20% of then are unsatisfied with its
      functional skills and around a 20% are experiencing pain, high disability degrees and a
      significant quality of life reduction. This results cannot be fully explained by mechanical
      processes, surgical procedures or surgery variations, but it seems to be related to other
      psychological aspects. Chronic pain subjects often develop maladaptative thoughts and
      behaviours (i.e. pain catastrophism, Kinesiophobia, activity avoidance) which contribute to
      make the subject suffer physically as well as emotionally, and affect on the intensity and
      persistency of pain.

      Although many psychosocial factors have been studied, pain catastrophism has emerged as one
      of the most important predictors for persistent pain after a total knee arthroplasty, as well
      as its severity and duration, that's why it is getting more importance when it comes to study
      chronic pain in this subjects. Reducing pain catastrophism has become a key factor to
      determine the success in the rehabilitation of some maladies accompanied by pain, considering
      that its reduction has been associated with the clinical improvement of pain itself. It has
      been observed that treatments using psychological and psychosocial interventions, therapeutic
      education and coping skills training, or physical therapy and therapeutic exercise, are
      effective techniques to reduce pain catastrophism. Nevertheless, it's still necessary to
      determine whether the maladaptative pain related thoughts approach, using physical therapy
      and behavioural techniques, are able to reduce the risk of suffering postoperative chronic
      pain.

The horizontal line anchors will be &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;.

This program is mainly based in &quot;Explain Pain&quot; concept, used in multiple rehabilitation programs. Its aim is to change the subject's pain understanding, teaching them the biological processes underneath the pain construct, as a mechanism to reduce itself and its related maladaptative thoughts and behaviours</description>
