  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre, prospective observational study. The study plans to enrol 500
      patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer who are eligible and intended to
      be prescribed Zoladex® (goserelin acetate implant) 10.8 mg or Zoladex® (goserelin acetate
      implant) 3.6 mg as monotherapy or in combination with androgen blockade (CAB) at 50 clinical
      sites in China. The effectiveness and safety data will be collected at baseline and each
      visit within 26 weeks after treatment of Zoladex®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is a standard treatment for locally advanced or metastatic
      prostate cancer. It is also increasingly used in patients with high-risk localized prostate
      cancer or in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse after local therapy.

      The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, such as goserelin
      acetate(Zoladex®), have provided an effective and reversible means of suppressing androgen
      level. Zoladex® was originally formulated as a 3.6mg depot injection. Goserelin acetate
      10.8-mg depot, given once every 3 months, is pharmacodynamically equivalent to 3 consecutive
      monthly injections of the goserelin acetate 3.6-mg depot, offers a more convenient and
      cost-effective dosing regimen for patients.

      Goserelin acetate 10.8-mg depot has been available in China since 2012. However, data on the
      effectiveness and safety of the long-acting depot of Zoladex® (goserelin acetate depot)
      10.8mg specifically in a Chinese population is limited. A &quot;real-world&quot; observational study is
      proposed to establish the effectiveness and safety profile of Zoladex ® 10.8mg in Chinese
      patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.
