  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one in three older adults fall annually and it is the primary cause of
      traumatic injury in older adults. While exercise and balance programs have been shown to be
      effective in reducing fall risk, maintaining behavior change is known to be difficult. Thus
      additional interventions need to be validated to add to our current armamentarium to reduce
      falls in older adults. Cognitive training (CT) involves exercises that target specific
      cognitive tasks, such as memory or processing speed. It has been speculated that routinely
      performing such tasks may increase functional ability. Recent work has pointed to an
      increased risk of falls in community-dwelling older adults who have alterations in specific
      cognitive tasks. Thus the purpose of the proposed study is to demonstrate the feasibility and
      to explore the effectiveness of a 16 week CT intervention to reduce risk and incidence of
      fall and improve outcomes up to 1 month post-intervention in a group of community dwelling
      older adults at risk for fall.
