  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 3.5 - 5 million Americans are living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United
      States. HCV significantly impacts rural Pennsylvania. It is estimated that 160,000 adults in
      Pennsylvania are living with hepatitis C. In 2010, Center for Rural Pennsylvania estimated
      that 27% of population of PA live in one of Pennsylvania's 48 rural counties. Under this
      estimate, there are over 43,000 individuals affected with chronic HCV living in rural
      Pennsylvania. Rural county residents often experience barriers to health care by having fewer
      primary care providers and limited specialty care physicians available to them to address
      their healthcare needs.

      RQ1: Will the community based delivery system for Hepatitis C screenings see an increase in
      positivity rates?

      HO1: There is no relationship between the community based delivery system with an increase in
      the Hepatitis C screening positivity rates.

      HA1: There is a relationship between the community based delivery system with an increase in
      the Hepatitis C screening positivity rates.

      In rural Pennsylvania, transportation is considered a socioeconomic barrier and social
      detriment to personal health. Using an evidence-based model of population health by bringing
      the care into the high-risk population's community setting reduces the transportation and
      socioeconomic barriers of the most vulnerable at risk populations.

      It is estimated that 35% to 65% of Opioid Substitution Treatment Patients (OST), are infected
      with HCV. Therefore, OPT programs that are already operating will be engaged and will be a
      primary focus for patient screening and recruitment for these services. In addition, high
      volume venues attracting high-risk populations will also be targeted to encourage HCV
      screening, education, and treatment.

      Primary Objectives:

      To screen Opioid Substitution Treatment Patients (OST), high-risk individual at Opioid
      Treatment Programs (OTP), and/or all high-risk populations in outlying sites (Anti-HCV
      prevalence)

      To initiate HCV treatment of OST patients and other high-risk individuals at OTP facilities
      and/or high risk populations in outlying sites (linkage of care)

      To maintain the successful HCV therapy and cure [Sustained Viral Response (SVR)] in OST
      patients and other high-risk individuals at OPT facility and/or high risk populations in
      outlying sites (retention)

      To facilitate the use of a patient navigator and nursing case management staff to reduce
      barriers to initial screening and patient education
