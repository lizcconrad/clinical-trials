    <textblock>
      This study prospectively evaluates whether the use of iCAGES (integrated CAncer GEnome Score)
      tool in guiding the treatment of advanced cancers is superior to current standard care in
      progress free survival (PFS),overall survival (OS),and improvement of life quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a fatal disease caused by the accumulation of various oncogene and tumor suppressor
      gene mutations. Studies of high-throughput sequencing for patients who suffered from cancer
      has found that different mutations play a different role in the occurrence and development of
      different cancers. Several gene panels already exist to help identify mutations in a few
      genes that may have corresponding FDA-approved drugs or drugs under clinical trials. However,
      given whole-genome/exome sequencing data, the suitable clinical analysis tool to analyze
      individualized cancer-related gene mutations, and recommend the most appropriate targeted
      treatment options among hundreds of possible drugs therapy is absent currently.

      The recently proposed iCAGES is a precise biomedical informatics analysis tool, which could
      help increase the accuracy of cancer driver gene detection and prioritization, bridge the gap
      between personal cancer genomic data and prior cancer research knowledge,and facilitate
      cancer molecular diagnosis as well as personalized precision therapy.

    <description>In this group, we perform whole exome or genome sequencing of tumor sample in compared to blood sample, screen tumor-related special mutations by using biomedical informatics analysis procedure and utilized the iCAGES system to rank the most appropriate drugs available and then manually examine this list to select the best therapeutic strategy for the patient based on availability of drug and expert knowledge. The PFS, OS, and quality of life (QOL) will be recorded and compared with that from standard care.</description>

        In this study, all the patients will be recruited from the Second Affiliated Hospital of
        Guangzhou Medical University and the collaborated Hospitals during 01/07/2017 to
        01/07/2019, 250 advanced patients (180 cases for A group and 70 cases for B group) are
        anticipated to be collected. All the patients are more than 18 years old and less than 70
        years old. The follow-up will be performed every 2 month until 2 years after the first
        treatment post-recruitment or quit.
