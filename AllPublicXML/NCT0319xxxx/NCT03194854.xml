    <textblock>
      Subjective well-being is a positive state affairs in six domains of life: interpersonal,
      community, occupational, physical, psychological, and economic (I COPPE). The purpose of the
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of an online
      intervention named Fun For Wellness (FFW), designed to promote skills and self-efficacy in
      the multidimensional I COPPE domains of life.

      Subjective well-being is a positive state affairs in six domains of life: interpersonal,
      community, occupational, physical, psychological, and economic (I COPPE). The purpose of the
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of an online
      intervention named Fun For Wellness (FFW), designed to promote skills and self-efficacy in
      the multidimensional I COPPE domains of life.

      In designing the program we considered the pressing societal need to promote universal health
      and well-being and prevent stress, illness and disease. Preventable conditions related to
      lifestyle such as obesity and stress afflict millions of people. Therefore, we saw a need to
      develop a universal tool for the adult population who would be comfortable with the online
      platform of FFW. Universal programs have been shown to be effective, for example, in reducing
      mental health problems in college students.

      While face-to-face interventions are effective in preventing serious conditions, they are
      very labor intensive and limited in reach. The ability to prevent adverse conditions and to
      enhance healthy behaviors through online interventions creates several opportunities:
      accessibility, scalability, interactivity, affordability, and fidelity of implementation. A
      randomized controlled trial of the FFW intervention in an employee sample, found initial
      evidence for the effectiveness of the FFW intervention. Participants who complied with the
      FFW intervention had significantly higher subjective well-being, as compared to compliers in
      the Usual Care group, in multiple I COPPE domains.

      For the current study, well-being and self-efficacy measures will be administered at baseline
      (T1), 30 days-post baseline (T2) and 60 days -post baseline (T3). A maximum of 500 patients.
      Approximately 53,000 university health system patients who have provided consent to be
      contacted for research may be invited via email to participate in the online study. All other
      study activities will take place entirely online at a secure website.

      Hypothesis 1: Outcome effects: The online well-being program will be more effective than the
      usual care condition in improving: 1) overall well-being 2) domain well-being, and 3) health
      related quality of life (HRQOL) over time.

      Hypothesis 2: Self-efficacy effect: The online well-being program will be more effective than
      the usual care condition in improving I COPPE well-being self-efficacy.

      Hypothesis 3: Mediating effect: The effect of the online well-being program on- 1) overall
      well-being, 2) domain well-being and, 3) health related quality of life will be partially
      mediated by improvements in I COPPE well-being self-efficacy over time.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention group will be compared to a usual care (UC) control group on outcomes of overall subjective well-being, domain-specific well-being, health-related quality of life, and well-being self-efficacy. The intervention group will participate in online activities for 30 days while UC control group participants will be asked to conduct their lives as usual for the same 30 day period. Both groups will complete assessments during this time period. The UC group will be given access to the intervention for 30 days after all study participants have completed the three survey battery administrations.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants who have completed the full online T1 battery will be randomly assigned in real-time by the computer to either the intervention condition or the UC control condition. Randomization, group assignment, and assessments will be conducted solely by the computer program, so researchers will be blind to participant randomization, group assignment, and participant group identity during assessment times. With regard to group size and power, experience from our prior efficacy study of FFW indicates that for the current study, the computer program will use a 2:1 randomization algorithm so that there are twice as many FFW intervention participants as UC control participants.</masking_description>

    <description>FFW consists of videos, games, and content teaching 14 skills to support seven drivers of change that promote well-being in I COPPE domains. The drivers form the acronym BET I CAN, which stands for: Behaviors, Emotions, Thoughts, Interactions, Context, Awareness, and Next Steps. B teaches basics of habit formation, including antecedents, behaviors, and consequences and techniques like goal setting, behavior tracking and rewards. E teaches how to build positive emotions and cope with negative ones. T teaches lessons from cognitive behavioral therapy. I builds communication skills such as empathy, listening and assertiveness. C teaches how to create healthier environmental contexts. A aims to increase insight. N emphasizes the need to make plans and anticipate barriers.</description>
