  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effectiveness of fasting or fasting-mimicking diet has been proved an effective approach to
      treat metabolic and autoimmune diseases in mice. However, clinical trials performing
      prolonged fasting with more than 7 days have not been reported. Investigators conduct an open
      label, phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 21-day
      fasting-like diet in the treatment of metabolic and autoimmune diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although fasting has been proved an effective approach to treat metabolic and autoimmune
      diseases in mice, prolonged fasting is difficult to implement in human-beings for the safety
      and feasibility reasons.

      In this clinical trial, we will recruit metabolic and autoimmune diseases and then follow a
      traditional Chinese 21-day fasting-like diet process with extremely low calorie intake (about
      5% of normal diet) and prolonged fasting-like period. Blood, urine, stool samples will be
      collected on day 0 (baseline), day 4, day 7, day 14, day 21 and day 51 after it started up.
      Therefore we can examine the changes of disease-associated physical indexes and metabolic
      biomarkers pre and post the 21-day fasting-like diet.

      The purpose of the study is to ascertain the impact of the fasting-like diet during the 21
      days. The investigators hypothesize that the 21-day fasting-like diet can reduce the
      biomarkers associated with aging and age-related diseases and benefit for the treatment of
      metabolic and autoimmune diseases.
