      Primary Objective:

      -To evaluate the efficacy of a single 6-mL intra-articular (IA) injection of Hylan G-F 20
      measured by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Numerical
      Rating Scale (NRS) 3.1 A1 score over a total period of 26 weeks in Chinese patients with
      symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the response rate of a single 6-mL IA injection of Hylan G-F 20 in
           comparison to an IA placebo injection over 26 weeks. Response is defined as WOMAC A1 ≥2
           point improvement from baseline on NRS in daily pain score averaged over a 7-day period.

        -  To evaluate the safety of a single 6-mL IA injection of Hylan G-F 20, in comparison to
           an IA placebo injection over 26 weeks.

      The duration of the study will be 29 weeks at maximum. The screening and wash-out period may
      last for up to 14 days, depending on the half-life of the medications followed by an 8-day
      baseline period including the Treatment Day. Overall, there will be up to 21 days between
      signing informed consent (at screening visit) and the randomization (Day 1). Treatment will
      be administered on Day 1, and follow-up period will be 26 weeks.
