  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called enzalutamide in combination with external
      beam radiation therapy as a possible treatment for prostate cancer. Presently, when
      participants receive hormonal therapy with radiation therapy for prostate cancer, medications
      are given to reduce testosterone levels in the blood stream. This leads to side effects such
      as loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction (ED) and decrease in muscle strength. The purpose
      of this study is test another form of hormonal therapy with radiationtherapy. The medication
      called enzalutamide will be used with radiation therapy. Instead of lowering testosterone,
      enzalutamide blocks testosterone in cells. This study will test if enzalutamide when used
      with radiation will lower the PSA without causing the side effects associated with
      medications that lower testosterone in the blood stream

      The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each of 6 treatment cycles. Each
      treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time the participant will be taking the
      study drug enzalutamide by mouth (4 pills daily). The diary will also include special
      instructions for taking the enzalutamide.

      The participant will also be undergoing external beam radiation therapy during the study, for
      a duration of 5,5 weeks. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. This part of
      the study is considered standard of care.

      The participant will be required to have IGRT either by ConeBeam CT study and/or fiducial
      markers placed within the prostate as part of this study. These are very small gold markers
      that are placed in the prostate. This procedure is similar to the biopsy that the participant
      had to diagnose their cancer. These both procedures are routinely performed to permit imaging
      and position corrections to improve the precision of the external beam (radiation) delivery
      (Image Guided Radiation Therapy). This is also considered standard of care and is not
      experimental.

      Planned Follow-up: Participants will be followed on study at a 3 month follow-up after
      treatment (cessation of enzalutamide). Additional follow-up to assess the status of the
      participant's cancer will be conducted at the discretion of the treating physicians as part
      of the participant's routine medical care.

    <description>On this study patients will be treated with 6 months of Xtandi (enzalutamide). Approximately one-third of the way through this treatment they will receive EBRT. Starting on Day 1, all patients will ingestenzalutamide 160 mg/day at the same time each day without breaks (except as outlined for toxicity), with or without food, for 6 (28 day +/-3 days) cycles. Dose reduction of enzalutamide to 120 mg/day is allowed with the approval of the Medical Monitor. Patients will be instructed to return all unused capsules at each study visit to assess compliance and will receive study drug every 28 days (+/-3 days) for 6 cycles (25 weeks).</description>

    <description>Radiation: External Beam Radiation Dose will be normalized such that exactly 98% of the PTV (planned target volume) receives the prescription dose and will be scored as per protocol. The maximum allowable dose within the PTV is 107% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03 cc. The minimum allowable dose within the PTV is &gt;95% of the prescribed dose to a volume that is at least 0.03 cc.
EBRT shall receive prescription doses to the PTV 70 Gy delivered in 2.5 Gy</description>
