      Background and Aims: Arrival of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents against hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) with high-sustained virological response (SVR) rates and very few side effects
      has drastically changed the management of HCV infection. The impact of DAA exposure on
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after a first remission in patients with advanced
      fibrosis remains to be clarified.

      Methods: 68 consecutive HCV patients with a first HCC diagnosis and under remission,
      subsequently treated or not with a DAA combination, were included. Clinical, biological, and
      virological data were collected at first HCC diagnosis, at remission and during the
      surveillance period.

    <description>The cohort includes cirrhotic patients infected with HCV and successfully treated for their first history of hepatocellular carcinoma. Some of these patients were treated with direct-acting antivirals for their HCV infection while the others did not receive any direct-acting antivirals treatment during the follow-up period.</description>

        France developing a first HCC and receiving or not a direct-acting antiviral combination
        therapy after HCC remission between January 2009 and March 2016 were considered.
