  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular invasion (MVI) has been well demonstrated as an unfavorable prognostic factor
      for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and patients with MVI have a high risk of tumor
      recurrence after curative hepatectomy. Currently, the diagnosis of MVI is determined on the
      postoperative histologic examination, which greatly limits its influence on preoperative
      decision making. Therefore, we constructed this prospective study to develop a machine
      learning-based model for preoperative prediction of MVI by extracting high-dimensional
      magnetic resonance (MR) image features.

      Histologically-diagnosed primary HCC after curative hepatectomy. The magnetic resonance image
      will be imported into the imaging management software (GE healthcare Analysis-Kit
      software),and the tumor lesions will manually delineated by two independent radiologists and
      then reconstruct into three-dimensional images for feature extraction. The radiomic textural
      features including grayscale histogram, transform matrix, wavelet transform and filter
      transformation are automatically extracted by the Analysis-Kit software.The high-throughput
      extracted features will be then selected by the univariate analysis, and a prediction model
      will be developed based on machine learning algorithm in a training set in which patients
      were collected from a retrospective study. And in the present study, an independent
      validation set will be collected and used to validate the prediction accuracy of the model.

        Between June 2017 and July 2017，all patients who will undergo curative resection (R0
        resection) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun YatSen University in Guangzhou, China,
        for HCC based on the modified WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system, are
        considered for inclusion. By the eligibility criteria stated below, MVI presentative rate
        is 30-42% in chinese HCC population as reported, we retrospectively collected about 80
        patients for training and an estimated 40 patients will be needed for validation set of
        this study.
