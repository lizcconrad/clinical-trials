    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab and ibrutinib work as front line therapy in
      treating patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      obinutuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving obinutuzumab and ibrutinib may work better in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab in chemotherapy
      naive patients with indolent lymphomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression free survival rates and overall survival rates in indolent
      lymphomas.

      II. To assess safety and tolerability of the combination. III. To evaluate response using
      positron emission tomography (PET) and correlate PET negativity with durability of response.

    <description>Patients receive ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive obinutuzumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 and day 1 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 months after course 5, patients with stable disease will continue to receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for a total of 12 doses.</description>
