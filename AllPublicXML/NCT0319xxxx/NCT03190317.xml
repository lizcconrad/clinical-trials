      This is a study of study of My HealtheVet (MHV) use by Veterans diagnosed with Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and VA providers/staff who care for them. We hope to learn and
      understand how MHV can improve the self-management of chronic conditions like HIV. First, we
      will review Veteran medical records to look at the relationship between use of MHV and
      whether it has a positive or negative impact on the Veteran's management of HIV. Next, we
      will interview Veterans to find out how they use MHV for self-management and both Veterans
      and providers to find out why they choose to use (or not to use) specific MHV tools. Lastly,
      we will use the information we found from the first two steps and create an intervention that
      will encourage non-MHV users to use the MHV tools that can help them achieve their
      health-related goals. Once the intervention has been developed, Veterans and providers will
      participate in a &quot;cognitive walkthrough&quot; where they will help the researchers test the
      intervention to see if it is usable, possible, and acceptable.

    <textblock>
      Over the last twenty years, HIV has transformed from a terminal disease to a condition with
      near normal life expectancy for patients who follow ideal treatment regimens. HIV-infected
      individuals still face many challenges and need to be active in self-management of their HIV
      and other conditions in order to live a healthy life. In order to ensure that this population
      of HIV-infected individuals actively self-manages their condition, personal health records
      (PHRs) should be used more often. PHRs may simplify disease self-management, improve health
      outcomes, and reduce unnecessary health care use.

      The VA has one of the nation's largest PHR systems - My HealtheVet (MHV). MHV includes
      features that can help patient's self-manage their disease (e.g., prescription refill,
      viewing lab results view, secure messaging). While there has been recognition that MHV holds
      promise as a self-management tool, there has not yet been an examination of use of MHV
      features and their relationship to health outcomes in any chronic disease group, let alone in
      HIV-infected Veterans.

      The objective of this project is to evaluate MHV use by HIV-infected Veterans and their
      providers, by completing three aims/steps.

      Aim/Step 1: Describe the relationship between use of MHV tools for self-management across
      HIV-infected Veterans and determine their relationship to health outcomes and care processes
      in these Veterans through review of medical records.

      We will use the VA medical record data, which allows us to study the diverse VA patient
      population with patients from a range of personal backgrounds, geographic locations, and VA
      health care networks. HIV infection will be determined by the presence of two outpatient HIV
      diagnoses or one inpatient HIV diagnosis. This study will use a retrospective group of
      HIV-infected Veterans who used MHV between October 2007- April 2017 to evaluate the
      relationship between patient HIV care outcomes and MHV tool use. We will look at data to
      carefully consider HIV-infected patient health status, health care received, and activity. We
      will also look at Quality of Care (QC) outcomes which include medication adherence, CD4
      count, viral load testing and detectable viral load, appointments, patient cancellations,
      patient no-shows, emergency department visits, flu vaccination, and syphilis and lipid
      testing. This aim/step will allow us to examine differences in VA patients who have opted to
      use MHV versus those who have not opted to use MHV.

      Aim/Step 2: Describe how Veterans with HIV use MHV for self-management, and why they choose
      to use (or not to use) specific MHV tools; and similarly how and why providers use (or do not
      use) MHV.

      We will interview Veterans and providers to learn what motivates certain patients and
      providers/staff to use MHV the way they do, or to understand MHV system issues, as well as
      attitudes and perceptions that prevent others from using MHV. We will select patients and
      providers from six VA medical centers and interview those with high-, low, or no- MHV use. We
      will discuss how they use MHV to manage their HIV and other conditions. We will discuss with
      them how their providers use MHV as a tool for communication and coordination. With Veterans
      not using MHV (or minimal use) we will ask about their reasons. The interviews will be
      audio-recorded.

      Aim/Step 3: Incorporate findings from Aims/Steps 1 and 2 to design an intervention that will
      be tested by Veterans and providers.

      We will compare the data from aims/steps 1 and 2 to develop an intervention that may improve
      self-management in Veterans with HIV. We will identify Veterans and providers from two VA
      medical centers that will help us test the intervention through &quot;cognitive walkthroughs.&quot;
      Cognitive walkthroughs are used to test an intervention that is in the early stages of
      development. Veterans and providers will be the first to test if the intervention is
      acceptable and feasible. They will also offer feedback to the researchers as it relates to
      problems with using the intervention. The cognitive walkthroughs will be audio- and
      video-recorded.
