  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) are accepted as the gold standard in covering
      denuded root surfaces. Combining enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) with periodontoplasic
      surgical operations is another method in covering denuded root surface. The aim of this study
      is to compare a SCTG operation group and EMD applied group in addition to SCTG using complete
      root coverage rate and a newer method root coverage esthetic scoring system (RES).

      Background: Subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTG) are accepted as the gold standard
      in covering denuded root surfaces. Combining enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) with
      periodontoplasic surgical operations is another method in covering denuded root surface. The
      aim of this study is to compare a SCTG operation group and EMD applied group in addition to
      SCTG using complete root coverage rate and a newer method root coverage esthetic scoring
      system (RES).

      Methods: This is a split-mouth and controlled study. Thirthy-eight Class I or II gingival
      recession defects at canine teeth were treated in the control (SCTG) (n=19) and test groups
      (n=19) (SCTG+EMD). The root coverage esthetic score were evaluated by 2 blind periodontists 1
      year after the treatment using RES. The agreement between the two periodontists was assessed
      by kappa analysis. Complete root coverage rate was evaluated for both groups. Two groups were
      compared with statistically methods in terms of RES parameters and gingival recession height
      /width.

    <description>TEST GROUP: Langer and Langer technique was used to prepare the recipient side. The vestibule surfaces of adjacent interdental papillae were de-epithelialized. The dimensions of the recipient area were measured by periodontal probes and four bleeding centers were created in the palatinal region. The graft was placed on the recipient site and fixed with 4.0 silk sutures. Pressure was applied to the operation area for 5 minutes with saline impregnated sponges. EMD (Emdogain®, Straumann, Basel, Switzerland) was used in the test group in addition to SCTG. Prior to EMD application, the root surface was applied with 24% EDTA (PrefGel, Straumann, Basel, Switzerland) for 2 minutes. The area was washed with saline and then EMD was applied.</description>

    <description>CONTROL GROUP: Langer and Langer technique was used to prepare the recipient side. The anesthetic solution was applied to the donor site in the palatinal region on the same side as the operation site. The dimensions of the recipient area were measured by periodontal probes and four bleeding centers were created in the palatinal region. The graft was placed on the recipient site and fixed with 4.0 silk sutures. Pressure was applied to the operation area for 5 minutes with saline impregnated sponges.</description>
