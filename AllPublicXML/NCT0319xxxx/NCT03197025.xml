  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) is caused by infection of the vulva
      with human papillomavirus (HPV). In a small percentage of cases, vulvar HSIL can turn into
      cancer. The risk of cancer can be reduced by treating HSIL. A personalized immune treatment
      might rid the body of HPV infection and thereby cure vulvar HSIL. The immune treatment in
      this study is called T cell therapy. The cells are E6 TCR T cells. Participants will also get
      aldesleukin (IL-2) to help the cells last longer.

      Objective:

      To find a safe dose of E6 TCR T cells combined with aldesleukin to use in people with vulvar
      HSIL.

      Eligibility:

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Blood, lab, and pregnancy tests

      Heart tests

      Chest x-ray

      Sample of tissue taken from the vulva (biopsy).

      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed by a needle in one arm. A machine
      removes white blood cells from the blood. The rest of the blood is returned by needle in the
      other arm. The white blood cells will be changed into E6 TCR T cells and grown in a lab.
      About 3 weeks later, participants will be admitted to the hospital for about 5 days. They
      will get the cells through a tube placed in a vein. They will get IL-2 the same way.
      Participants will recover 1-3 days in the hospital. They will be monitored closely. They will
      have blood and lab tests. Participants will have follow-up visits with lab tests and a
      physical exam every few months for 5 years. At some visits they will also have leukapheresis,
      blood tests, or vulvar biopsy.

      Background:

        -  Vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) is a premalignant epithelial
           lesion that is frequently multifocal and/or recurrent.

        -  The primary treatment is surgery, which may result in disfigurement and compromise of
           the urethra, anus, or clitoris. Recurrence after surgery is common and primarily treated
           with additional surgery.

        -  Vulvar HSIL is caused by chronic infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16
           infection. In this clinical trial the HPV-16 infection is targeted with a single
           infusion of autologous T cells that have been genetically engineered to express an
           HPV-16 E6-specific

      T cell receptor (E6 TCR T cells).

      Objective:

      -Determine the safety of E6 TCR T cells for the treatment of vulvar HSIL.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of HPV-16+ vulvar HSIL.

        -  Expression of the HLA-A2*02:01 allele.

        -  Measurable lesion(s) that are recurrent or cannot be resected with acceptable cosmetic
           or functional results.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old and less than or equal to 60 years old.

        -  Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase I clinical trial with a 3+3 dose escalation design.

        -  Subjects will receive E6 TCR T cells followed by up to two doses of aldesleukin 720,000
           IU/kg IV.

        -  No conditioning regimen will be given, aldesleukin will be capped at a maximum of two
           doses, and E6 TCR T cell dosing will begin at dose level -1 from the previously
           determined safe dose.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITIERA:

               1. Patients must have vulvar HSIL as confirmed by pathology report from a
                  CLIA-certified laboratory.

               2. Vulvar HSIL must be HPV-16+ by a PCR, RNA, or in situ hybridization test from a
                  CLIA certified laboratory.

               3. Patients must have measurable lesion(s) as defined in section 6.3.2 and one or
                  more of the following criteria:

                    1. Failure of surgery to control disease (i.e. positive margins or recurrence
                       of HSIL after surgery).

                    2. Multifocal or extensive disease for which surgery would result in major
                       deformity that is not be acceptable to the patient.

                    3. Disease for which surgery would have a risk of functional impairment that is
                       not be acceptable to the patient (i.e. involve partial or complete excision
                       of the clitoris, anus, vagina, or urethra).

               4. Patients may have received any previous therapy, including surgical excision, but
                  must have histologically documented recurrence on new biopsy and a measurable
                  lesion that meets the above criteria.

               5. The presence of disease that can be biopsied for research purposes is not an
                  inclusion criterion.

               6. Patients must have the HLA-A*02:01 allele

               7. Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 60 years. As age
                  increases, the ability to tolerate the toxicities of aldesleukin decreases, so
                  the patient population for this study will include up to and including 60 years
                  of age to increase safety.

               8. ECOG performance status of 0-1. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent
                  Document.

               9. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. Women of
                  child-bearing potential are defined as all women who are not post-menopausal or
                  who have not had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as women over the
                  age of 55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.

              10. The effects of E6TCR T Cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
                  suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should
                  inform her treating physician immediately.

              11. Seronegative for HIV antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
                  protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive
                  can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the
                  experimental

                  treatment.

              12. Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C
                  antibody test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the presence of
                  antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

              13. Must be willing to participate in Gene Therapy Long Term Followup Protocol
                  (15-C-0141), which will follow patients for up to 15 years per Food and Drug
                  Administration (FDA) requirements.

              14. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL

          -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,000/mcL

          -  platelets greater than or equal to 150,000/mcL

          -  hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10.0 g/dL

          -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits except in patients with Gilbert s
             Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) Serum ALT/AST &lt; 3 times ULN

          -  creatinine less than 1.5 times baseline, &lt; 1.5 times ULN

        OR

        -creatinine clearance less than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine
        levels above institutional normal (by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
        (CKD-EPI) equation)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          2. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with E6 TCR, breastfeeding should be discontinued
             if the mother is treated with E6 TCR. These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study.

          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, any ongoing or active
             infection (e.g. requiring anti-infective therapy), coagulation disorders,
             cardiovascular disorders, respiratory disorders, cancer, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations (within the last six months) that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          4. Any form of systemic immunodeficiency, including acquired deficiency such as HIV or
             primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease. The
             experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune
             system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the
             treatment.

          5. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy if greater than the equivalent of 5 mg prednisone
             PO daily. Patients previously on steroids must be off steroids for four weeks prior to
             treatment.

          6. Any history of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, coronary revascularization,
             ischemic symptoms, or previously documented LVEF of less than or equal to 45%. A
             cardiac stress test is required for all patients greater than 50 years old. A cardiac
             stress test may also be performed for any clinical concern. Patients with cardiac
             ischemia are not eligible.

          7. Patients with any active invasive cancer are not eligible.

          8. Patients vulvar HSIL that is not HPV-16+ or is associated with multiple types of
             high-risk HPV are not eligible.
