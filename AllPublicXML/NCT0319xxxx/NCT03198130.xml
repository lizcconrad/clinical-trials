        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN (squamous cell
             carcinoma of the head and neck) with no curative options with at least 1 lesion that
             is measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria
             and accessible for biopsies. Primary tumor sites of oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx,
             or hypopharynx are included.

          2. Have failed/are refractory to at least first line chemotherapy OR deemed unsuitable
             candidate for first line chemotherapy due to medical co-morbidities or patient
             preference

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1

          4. Adequate hepatic function

          5. Adequate renal function

          6. Adequate bone marrow function

          7. Provide signed informed consent

          8. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for immune-related adverse event (irAEs)

          2. Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the programmed death-1/programmed
             death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway

          3. Prior treatment with other immune modulating anti-cancer agents

          4. Untreated brain metastases that may be considered active

          5. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
             REGN2810

          6. Prior treatment with idelalisib

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria will apply
