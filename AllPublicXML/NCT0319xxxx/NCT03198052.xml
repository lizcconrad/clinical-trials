  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The third generation of CAR-T cells that target PSCA, MUC1, PD-L1, or CD80/86 have been
      constructed respectively and their anti-cancer function has been verified by multiple in
      vitro and in vivo studies.Clinical studies will be performed to test the anti-cancer function
      of the these individual or combination of the CAR-T cells for immunotherapy of human cancer
      patients with PSCA, MUC1, PD-L1, or/and CD80/86 expressions.In this phase I study, the
      safety,tolerance, and preliminary efficacy of the PSCA/MUC1/PD-L1/CD80/86-CAR-T cell
      immunotherapy on human cancers will firstly be tested.

      1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced lung or other cancers,with written consent for
           this study;

        2. Perform biopsy to determine the expression of PSCA, MUC1, PD-L1, or CD80/86 of the tumor
           by western blotting or IHC;

        3. Collect blood from the patients and isolate mononuclear cells,activate the T cells and
           transfect the T cells with PSCA, MUC1, PD-L1, or CD80/86 targeting CAR, amplify the
           transfected T cells as needed,test the quality and killing activity of the CAR-T cells
           and then transfer them back the patients via systemic or local injections, and follow up
           closely to collect related results as needed;

        4. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.

    <description>Response rates will be estimated as the percent of patients whose best response is either complete remission or partial remission by combining the data from the patients. To compare with historical data, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the response rate.</description>
