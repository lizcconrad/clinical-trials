  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depending on their gestational age, preterm infants need several weeks with different types
      of breathing-support due to immature development of the lungs, respiratory muscles,
      chest-wall and respiratory center in the brain. WHO`s recommendation on interventions to
      improve preterm birth outcomes underline the need for more research on respiratory support in
      infants born preterm. This study will test inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the
      Silverman-Andersen Retraction Score, which is a systematic clinical scoring tool for the
      respiratory work and the severity of respiratory distress in preterm infants. It will examine
      if there is consistency in the assessments done by doctors and nurses, and also if the
      observations correlate with technological monitoring. This easy to use scoring tool will help
      to determine the grade of respiratory distress, to assess respiratory exacerbation, to decide
      when to start weaning from respiratory support, and to give the best respiratory treatment to
      the child. This study will contribute to optimize care for preterm infants with respiratory
      distress.
