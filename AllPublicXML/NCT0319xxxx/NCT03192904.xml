    <textblock>
      According to published studies, there are two main approaches in the dissection of
      intersegmental plane: stapling devices and energy instrument separation. However, only a few
      retrospective studies focused on the perioperative outcomes of these two approaches, and
      there has been no definitive conclusion about which method is better. So the investigators
      want to conduct a prospective study, trying to figure out this problem.

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has been one of the most serious life-threatening diseases of human society. It
      has the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide among all the malignant tumors. Due to the
      popularization of low-dose CT and other means of examination, more and more patients with
      lung cancer are detected in the early phase of disease. Anatomical segementectomy is one of
      the standard surgical procedures for these small pulmonary nodules or ground glass opacity
      (GGO), which are clinically highly suspected or puncture confirmed early lung cancer lesions.
      Dissection of the intersegmental plane in segementectomy is a difficulty that have puzzled
      thoracic surgeons for decades because of the complicated anatomic relationship and
      variations, along with lack of boundary between pulmonary segments. There are two main
      approaches in the dissection of intersegmental plane: stapling devices and energy instrument
      separation. However, only a few retrospective studies focused on the perioperative outcomes
      of these two approaches in segmentectomy, not to mention in robot assisted segmentectomy, and
      there has been no definitive conclusion about which method is better. So the investigators
      want to conduct a prospective study, trying to figure out this problem.

      The investigators set incidence rate of postoperative complications as their primary
      endpoint. According to their calculation, a total of 136 patients will be enrolled (each
      group has 68 patients).

    <description>All enrolled patients will accept robot-assisted or uniportal segmentectomy. After cutting off the relevant segmental arteries and veins, we clamp the segmental bronchus, and then the diseased lung will be ventilated to identify the border of segment according to the collapse region. We use energy instruments dissect intersegmental plane along the determined border. If fast-frozen pathology confirms lung cancer, we will do lymphadenectomy. At last, a drainage tube will be placed.</description>
