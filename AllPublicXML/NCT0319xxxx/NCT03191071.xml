  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is randomized clustered pragmatic trial whose objective is to decrease unnecessary
      antibiotic prescription in adult patients with lower respiratory tract infection managed at
      primary care level in Switzerland, using a simple algorithm based on 2 point of care test
      results
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have two distinct phases:

      The first phase will test the feasibility of the intervention (UltraPro) along a pilot study.
      Following the setup of a lung ultrasound training curriculum for general practitioners, the
      practicality of the whole UltraPro algorithm will be evaluated at primary care level.

      The second phase will be a pragmatic randomized three-arm intervention study using an
      algorithm based on the results of procalcitonin and lung ultrasound to manage patients with
      lower respiratory tract infections at primary care level. The procalcitonin-ultrasound
      algorithm will be compared to procalcitonin-guided management alone and usual care.

    <description>General practitioners randomly assigned to the UltraPro arm will be responsible to recruit patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria and manage them using the UltraPro algorithm.
The UltraPro algorithm combines the result of a procalcitonin point-of-care test with lung ultrasound result to decide on antibiotic prescription. Blood sampling will be performed to identify potential novel biomarkers. Naso-pharyngeal swabs as well as sputum culture will allow for microbiologic identification of aetiological agents.</description>

    <description>General practitioners randomly assigned to the procalcitonin arm will be responsible to recruit patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria and manage them using the procalcitonin algorithm.
The procalcitonin point-of-care test will be performed, as described above, to decide on antibiotic prescription. Blood sampling will be performed to identify potential novel biomarkers. Naso-pharyngeal swabs as well as sputum culture will allow for microbiologic identification of aetiological agents.</description>

    <description>General practitioners randomly assigned to the usual care arm will be responsible to recruit patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria and will manage and treat these patients as they usually do. Only general practitioners who do not use procalcitonin and lung ultrasonography routinely will be included in the usual care arm.
Naso-pharyngeal swabs as well as sputum culture will be performed to allow for microbiologic identification of aetiological agents.</description>

    <intervention_name>UltraPro</intervention_name>
    <description>First, procalcitonin will be measured using a rapid point-of-care test. In case of elevated procalcitonin result (≥0.25 µg/L), a lung ultrasound will be performed to look for the presence of a lung infiltrate or consolidation suggesting the presence of community acquired pneumonia. A portable ultrasound machine with a convex probe, that will be provided to the general practitioner by the study, will be used.
The lung ultrasound will be done following international evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound using the basic eight-region sonographic technique and the criteria for positive scan and positive examination for the diagnosis of pneumonia .</description>
