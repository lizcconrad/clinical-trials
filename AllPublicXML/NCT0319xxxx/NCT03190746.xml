      It is hypothesized that one or several of these 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      (rs2246704, rs2853884, rs3747158, rs4820059, rs7291050, and rs933226) in the YWHAH gene could
      be related to RA disease severity.

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis of substantial morbidity. Serum
      biomarkers such as Rheumatoid Factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide assist with
      disease diagnosis and prognostic assessment of future disease activity. 14-3-3 eta is a
      relatively new RA serum biomarker. The 14-3-3 family of proteins were named based on
      chromatographic elution properites and are ubiquitously expressed intracellular chaperon
      proteins. The isoform relevant in RA is 14-3-3 eta. 14-3-3 eta provides additional
      information about RA to the clinicianâ€”it assists in making diagnosis, provides prognostic
      assessment of disease severity, and provides insight regarding response to therapy. Thus,
      14-3-3 eta serves as an important mechanistic biomarker informing the clinician about
      patient's RA.

      14-3-3 eta is the product of the YWHAH gene, located on chromosome 22q12.3. It is about 13
      kilobase long, consisting of two exons separated by a single intron. This gene has been
      implicated in linkage studies to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Six YWHAH single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in a prior study: rs2246704, rs2853884,
      rs3747158, rs4820059, rs7291050, and rs933226. rs2246704 was associated with bipolar disorder
      (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.31, p=0.03) and psychotic BP (OR 1.66, p=0.002). All six SNPs are
      intronic. It was hypothesized that one or several of these 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) could be related to RA disease severity.

    <description>The primary endpoint was the relationship of the six YWHAH SNPs to RA disease severity as based on the presence (1 point) or absence (0 points) across several domains: (A) serologic status (positive anti-CCP = 1 point, for example), (b) erosive changes (presence of erosions = 1 point), and (c) extra-articular manifestations (presence = 1 point).</description>
