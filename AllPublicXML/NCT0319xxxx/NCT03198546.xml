  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The third generation of CAR-T cells that target GPC3 (GPC3-T2-CAR-T cell)have been
      constructed and their anti-HCC function has been verified by multiple in vitro and in vivo
      studies.Clinical studies will be performed to test the anti-cancer function by the
      GPC3-T2-CAR-T cells in human HCC patients with GPC3 expression.In this phase I study, the
      safety,tolerance, and preliminary efficacy of the GPC3-T2-CAR-T cell immunotherapy on human
      will firstly be tested.

      1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,with written consent
           for this study;

        2. Perform biopsy to determine the expression of GPC3 of the tumor by western blotting or
           IHC;

        3. Collect blood from the patients and isolate mononuclear cells,activate the T cells and
           transfect the T cells with GPC3 targeting CAR, amplify the number of transfected T cells
           as needed,test the quality and killing activity of the GPC3-T2-CAR-T cells and then
           transplant back the patients via systemic or local injections, and follow up closely to
           collect related results as needed;

        4. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.

        5. Will also perform the similar clinical trial on lung squamous carcinoma with GPC3
           expression.
