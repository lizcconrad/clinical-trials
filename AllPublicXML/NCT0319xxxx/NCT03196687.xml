  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 DM may develop a cardiomyopathy often called diabetic cardiomyopathy
      which is characterized by left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in early stages

      Type 2 DM is associated with various types of subclinical target organ damage resulting in
      elevated risk of CVD events, moreover there is growing evidence that a prediabetic status,
      such as impaired fasting glucose is also related to subclinical target organ damage when
      compared to a group with normal glucose metabolism Diabetes mellitus is a well-studied major
      risk factor for coronary heart diseases, which is one of the leading causes of death
      worldwide. Another distinct entity of diabetes-related cardiac affection is the diabetic
      cardiomyopathy. This entity of cardic affection by diabetes still needs more and more
      attention, not only because it is common in diabetic patients, but also because of its easy
      detection by the simple, inexpensive and widely available diagnostic echocardiography.

      The proposed mechanisms that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy
      include autonomic dysfunction, microvascular disease, interstitial fibrosis and metabolic
      disorders. However, the actual causes and mechanisms remain unclear.
