  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, limited English proficient (LEP) parents of children at Seattle
      Children's Hospital for day surgery will be randomized to usual discharge care or usual
      discharge plus language-concordant, audio-recorded instructions via recordable card. these
      cards are similar to recordable greeting cards, and can record up to 180 seconds of
      information. They can be played back over 100 times. We will follow-up with families 2-7 days
      later to assess satisfaction and comprehension of discharge instructions.
