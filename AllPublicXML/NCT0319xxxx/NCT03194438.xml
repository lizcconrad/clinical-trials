  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-week
      multicomponent integrative therapy program, Urban Zen Integrative Therapy (UZIT), for adults
      with chronic, life-limiting cardiopulmonary disease. The secondary goal is to determine
      preliminary efficacy of UZIT in symptom management. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents an
      excellent model of a severe, life-limiting cardiopulmonary condition with high symptom burden
      and poor outcomes suitable for this scientific inquiry. Despite medical and pharmacological
      advances in the treatment, 50-55% of persons with PH will die within three years after
      diagnosis. Medical management often involves life-long complex pharmacological treatment
      requiring high levels of skill, knowledge, and social support. Clusters of bothersome
      symptoms such as chest pain, anxiety, insomnia, dyspnea, and fatigue can overwhelm patients'
      ability to manage daily activities and medication treatment regimens. Side effects of
      treatment induce additional noxious symptoms. The high prevalence of physical symptoms,
      depression, and anxiety among adults with PH confirmed in our prior work, can also lead to
      reduced (HRQoL). A literature search found no published report of complementary, integrative
      therapy interventions to alleviate symptoms in adults with PH. This study will use a single
      group repeated-measures design to address the feasibility and acceptability of the
      intervention and to explore preliminary efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility and acceptability study will use a pre/post intervention (6-weeks UZIT
      program) mixed-method design with repeated (weekly) measures of a single cohort of 20
      patients with PH. This study will also explore preliminary efficacy testing to construct
      sample size estimates for future randomized control trials. Patients will serve as their
      controls.

      This study will enroll 20 patients from two PH clinics within the Ohio State University
      Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). Patients with PH condition related to the cardiac cause are
      managed at the OSU Cardiology clinic located at the Ross Heart Hospital. Patients with PH
      condition related to other causes are managed at the OSU Pulmonary clinic at Martha
      Morehouse. These inter-professional clinics provide access to a patient population with
      diverse race/ ethnicity, sex, and age. All eligible patients managed at both PH clinics at
      OSUWMC will be invited to participate. Patients in both clinics receive standard medical
      treatments according to institutional and national clinical practice guidelines.
