  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study in patients with advanced and/refractory cervical cancer,
      endometrial carcinoma or uterine sarcoma.

      Patients will be treated with an immunomodulatory cocktail (Vitamin D, aspirin,
      Cyclophosphamide and Lansoprazole), followed by pembrolizumab, combined with radiation. In
      addition, patients will take Curcumin, a food supplement.

      This is a Phase II multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, 3-cohort study in patients with
      advanced and/or refractory cervical cancer, endometrial carcinoma or uterine sarcoma.
      Patients will be treated by an immunomodulatory cocktail (consisting of a daily intake of
      2000 IU Vitamin D, 325 mg aspirin, 50 mg Cyclophosphamide and 180 or 30 mg Lansoprazole
      alternating weekly), followed by pembrolizumab administered intravenously at 200 mg in 21-day
      treatment cycles, combined with radiation (3x 8Gy in 48h-intervals). In addition, patients
      will take Curcumin, a food supplement on a daily basis.
