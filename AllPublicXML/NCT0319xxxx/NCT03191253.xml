  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UCSF and Project Open Hand (POH), a community based organization in San Francisco which
      provides meals and groceries to chronically ill clients in the Bay Area, have partnered to
      conduct an initial randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Changing Health through Food
      Support (CHEFS) pilot intervention implemented by POH. The intervention consists of providing
      comprehensive, medically-appropriate food support, individual nutritional counseling, and
      group-based nutritional education over 6 months to low-income clients who have been diagnosed
      with HIV in order to improve their viral load and health-related quality of life (primary
      outcomes) as well as depression, ART adherence, food security and diet quality (secondary
      outcomes). We will randomize 200 participants to the intervention (n=100) or control (n=100).
      Participants will be followed for 6 months. The investigators will assess outcomes at
      baseline and 6-month follow-up using a quantitative survey and blood draws. In addition, the
      investigators will conduct a qualitative study at follow-up in a subset of participants to
      understand perceived impacts, barriers and facilitators.
