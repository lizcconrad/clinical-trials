  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective observational study.

      A substantial number of patients do not respond favourably to sacral neurostimulation (SNS)
      although clinically, they appear to have the same lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction
      characteristics as the good responders. This may be due to methodological issues (lead
      position) or patient selection. The purpose of this study is to improve and standardize lead
      position, in order to increase the patient response to test stimulation and to SNS treatment,
      and to decrease adverse events.

          1. Male or female aged ≥18 years and competent to provide consent

          2. Minimum 3 months of self-reported OAB symptoms or self-reported obstructive lower
             urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in addition to confirmed non-obstructive urinary
             retention on urodynamics.

          3. Failed, or are not a candidate for more conservative treatment (i.e., pelvic floor
             training, biofeedback, behavioral modification, oral pharmacotherapy)

          4. Willing to discontinue OAB medications for 2 weeks prior to the implant and for the
             entire study period

          5. Able to thoroughly fill in all questionnaires, voiding diaries and office visits for
             device programming and clinical evaluations before the TLP, 3 weeks after TLP and 6
             weeks, 6 months and 1 year after implantation of definitive IPG.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current of prior evidence of primary stress incontinence or mixed incontinence where
             the stress component overrides the urgency component

             the Neurostimulator implant site

         16. Knowledge of planned magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diathermy, or high output
             ultrasonic exposure
