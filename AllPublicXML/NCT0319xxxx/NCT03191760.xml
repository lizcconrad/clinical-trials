  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if &quot;Behavioral Activation and Social Engagement for PTSD&quot;
      (BASE for PTSD), an individual therapy for PTSD, will help Veterans with PTSD 1) through
      improved understanding of how PTSD affects them, 2) by reducing ways in which they avoid
      meaningful activity due to PTSD, 3) by enabling them to do more of the things they really
      care about, and 4) by improving, strengthening, and building up their social supports.

      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that some people develop
      following exposure to a traumatic event. PTSD often results in a reduction in feelings of
      connection to other people and changes in views about others, as well as reduced
      participation in valued activities. Many veterans with PTSD do not seek treatment offered in
      specialty mental health settings and may forgo treatment of any kind.

      This study is an open-trial format (no comparison condition) of U.S. military veterans who
      will participate in a brief psychotherapy treatment for PTSD offered in a Primary Care
      setting. This is a pilot trial to see if the treatment is effective at reducing symptoms of
      PTSD and increasing feelings of social support, and an exploratory aim is to see if veterans
      engage in additional treatment after completing this treatment.

    <description>Participants will attend 6 in-person therapy sessions lasting approximately 45 minutes per session, held in Primary Care settings. Content of therapy sessions includes education about PTSD symptoms, discussion of the role of avoidance in maintaining PTSD symptoms, self-monitoring homework to identify links between activity level and emotions, and homework designed to increase engagement in valued activities, with a focus on increasing social contact and support. If relevant, participants will be instructed in basic communication skills, social skills, and relaxation skills. We have modified the standard Behavioral Activation intervention by reducing the number and length of sessions to accommodate the Primary Care setting. In addition, there will be a stronger emphasis on social engagement in BASE then in standard BA and social contact and support will be addressed during each treatment session.</description>
