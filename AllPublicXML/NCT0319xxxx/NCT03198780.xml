      To establish the feasibility of a tool that monitors and motivates people with COPD to
      complete training in mindful pursed-lip breathing to enhance pulmonary rehabilitation at
      home.

      For this pilot study patients who meet the conventional criteria for pulmonary rehabilitation
      at their clinical appointments will be recruited and scheduled to return for the study. After
      completing the informed consent, patients will be taught how to don and doff the pulse
      oximeter, the source of the heart rate and oxygen signals. Patients will participate in a
      demonstration on how to perform the intervention. Recruitment will continue until five
      patients have completed the pilot in a clinic setting. If necessary, the prototype will be
      modified and testing resumed. Once the prototype system has met the criteria for success in
      the clinic, five of patients will be asked to use the prototype at the clinic and to take it
      home for a week and perform the intervention at least five times.

    <description>In the clinic, once patients are proficient with the proposed tool, they will (1) independently don the pulse oximeter, (2) use the prototype to perform the mindful breathing intervention. The whole session will last no longer than 60 minutes with 30 minutes for the consent and demonstrations, two minutes to don the study devices, 15 minutes to practice mindful breathing, and two minutes to doff the study devices. The mindful breathing portion will be divided into three sessions. Each session will last three minutes and display a different presentation of Heart Rate Coherence biofeedback.
At home, after completing the in-clinic study, five patients will take the mindful breathing tool home for a week to practice pursed-lip breathing at least five times. They will don the study devices, perform the intervention, and doff study devices.</description>
