  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team has made the hypothesis that the intensity of the phonatory disorders
      (rhinolalia), and of the maxillo-mandibular growth anomalies (facial morphology), may have
      negative effects on the quality of life of adolescents with Pierre Robin sequence.

      The investigators also want to assess the impact of 2 different surgical protocols of closure
      of the cleft palate (1 or 2 step(s)), on the current phonatory and morphology aspects. These
      2 protocols were performed, by 2 parisian clinical teams, that have now been merged at Necker
      hospital.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, the investigator will include patients who were treated, via maxillo-facial
      surgery, in their early childhood for a Pierre Robin sequence.

      In the frame of a follow-up visit, if they accept to participate in the study, they will
      fulfill with 2 psychologists, 3 quality of life questionnaires, and 1 depression assessment
      questionnaire.

      This will aim at evaluate their quality of life and their social integration, at the time of
      adolescence.

    <description>The data obtained via the 4 quality of life questionnaires will be assessed on regards of the severity of the facial dysmorphy and phonatory disorders.
The investigators will aggregate these results, and will be able to check if there is a clear correlation between them. They will be able to say if it can be concluded that the physical troubles due to the Pierre Robin sequence affect the quality of life of the patients.</description>
