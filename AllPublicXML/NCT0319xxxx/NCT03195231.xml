  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the most important nonmotor features of idiopathic PD（Parkinson's
      disease ）which may not just interfere with the motor symptoms of PD but can also cause
      immense personal suffering as well as decreased quality of life with increased disability and
      caregiver burden. However,there is little hard evidence to guide clinical treatment. Although
      some newer dopamine agonists also have antidepressive effect, the use of tricyclic or
      nontricyclic antidepressants is frequently required.However, the side-effects of these agents
      may also worsen some preexisting nonmotor problems in PD. Wuling powder is a Chinese medicine
      which is made by cultivating Xylariasp mycelium using submerged fermentation technology.
      Xylariasp is the fungus sclerotia which grow in termite nests. Wuling powder is mainly used
      to soothe nerves and anti-insomnia in clinical. The antidepressant effect of Wuling powder
      has been confirmed in clinical, but not in the patients of Parkinson`s disease. Therefore,
      the investigators design a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      antidepressant effect of Wuling powder in PD patients and its underlying mechanism.
