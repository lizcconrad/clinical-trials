    <textblock>
      As many as 20% of patients are unhappy with the results of total knee replacement (TKR).
      Various changes to surgical technique have tried to address this but have not led to a
      significant improvement in the numbers of patients satisfied with their operation.

      Recently, attention has focussed on alignment of the leg. When viewed from the front, a
      number of people do not start with a straight, mechanically aligned leg. Traditionally, when
      implanting a knee replacement, the surgeon tries to put the shin bone half of the knee
      replacement perpendicular to the floor to equalise stresses on the in and outside of the
      joint. However, this may result in the alignment of the leg changing considerably, straining
      the soft tissues around the knee and contributing to dissatisfaction with TKR.

      There has been a move by some surgeons to change practice, and to implant the TKR in a way
      that replicates the alignment of the patient's own original knee- alternative alignment.
      Studies looking at alternative alignment have not shown any loss of satisfaction with results
      of TKR and indeed are showing some signs that in the short term, function of the knee may be
      better with the new technique.

      The research team are planning to run a study comparing the knee replacement used in Exeter-
      the Triathlon- when put in place using traditional alignment versus using the alternative
      alignment methods. The outcomes will be assessed in various ways including patient
      satisfaction questionnaires, measuring muscle strength, flexibility around the knee, and by
      assessments of alignment of the new knee on X-rays and Computerised Tomography scans. The
      research team will look at short term results for satisfaction and function of the knee, and
      in the long term look at wear and survivorship to see if patient satisfaction with TKR can be
      improved.

      Research Question:

      When performing total knee replacement (TKR), does the use of the alternative alignment
      method result in improved function by comparison to a group undergoing the same procedure but
      using traditional technique? Primary Aim: To identify if the group undergoing TKR using
      alternative alignment method have a significantly improved functional outcome at 1 year when
      assessed by the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of at least 5 points in the
      Oxford Knee Score (OKS) by comparison to the group using traditional alignment technique.

      Secondary Aims: To identify if the use of alternative alignment method when performing TKR
      results in:

        -  Shortened length of stay (LOS) in hospital

        -  Improved short term function when assessed by peak quadriceps or hamstrings muscle
           torque measured by myometer

        -  Lower hospital costs as a result of reduced LOS or operating time

        -  Enhanced improvement in patient outcome scores Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score
           (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Euroquol (EQ5D) at short, mid and long term timeframes

        -  Enhanced positioning of the implants as assessed by a Computerised Tomography (CT) scan
           rotational profile assessment

        -  Enhanced range of knee flexion

        -  Any significant differences in component positioning, limb alignment or component wear

        -  Any significant changes in functional ability as measured by the Exeter Functional Lab
           protocol or Nurture activity assessment tool or the Instride Accelerometer by comparison
           to the TKR performed with traditional instruments.

      The research team will achieve these aims:

        -  By enrolling 126 patients into this study over a period of 2 years

        -  By carrying out a prospective randomised study looking at the subject matter over a
           period of 8 years

        -  By analysing patients functional status pre and post-surgery using patient generated
           questionnaires and data from the Exeter functional lab

        -  By analysing patients the 1 year radiological results from the plain x-rays to look at
           limb alignment, component position and wear

        -  By analysing the TKR component position on the pre and post-operative Computerised
           Tomography (CT) scans

        -  By collecting length of stay data taken from the patient administration system

        -  By collating all of the data from the study into a spread sheet for analysis by a
           professional statistician

      Scientific Background:

      Despite being one of the most successful of orthopaedic operations, a number of patients
      remain dissatisfied after TKR surgery. In a study of 253 patients, 1 year after TKR, Noble et
      al reported 11% of patients were neutral in their satisfaction after their surgery and 14%
      reported that they were either dissatisfied (3%) or very dissatisfied (11%). Reasons for this
      are not always clear.

      Various changes to surgical technique have tried to address this over the years. These
      include computer assisted navigation and patient specific knee replacement parts. However, to
      Brin et al, the clinical significance of this remains to be proven.

      More recently, attention has focussed on the alignment of the leg. Classic mechanical
      alignment (MA) in TKR is meant to co-align the prosthetic components to the mechanical axes
      of the femur and tibia and restore neutral overall limb alignment. Traditionally, surgeons
      have believed that implant durability is maximized when postoperative limb alignment is
      corrected to 0 ± 3 degrees relative to the mechanical axis. When implanting the tibial
      component of a TKR, the surgeon will try and put the device perpendicular to the tibial
      mechanical axis. This is done make sure the stresses on the new knee are equally placed on
      either side of the joint to try and prevent asymmetrical or accelerated wear on one side of
      the prosthesis. However, Bellemans et al examined 250 asymptomatic volunteers and identified
      that 32% of men and 17% of women have a varus deformity of the knee. Therefore, for many
      people, placement of the tibial component perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis may
      result in the alignment of the leg changing considerably, putting new strains on the soft
      tissues around the knee itself as well as altering the biomechanics of the adjacent ankle and
      hip joints with the potential to generate soft tissue strain in these areas also. It is
      possible that this alignment change is a major contributing factor to the dissatisfaction of
      some patients with TKR.

      Concerns that a failure to achieve &quot;correct&quot; positioning of the TKR components may adversely
      affect the survivorship of the artificial joint may not be well founded. Bonner et al
      reported upon the survivorship 501 TKRs after 15 years of follow up. 396 implants were within
      3° of the mechanical axis and 105 were not. Whilst this latter group may have been expected
      to have performed inferiorly, the results showed no statistically significant difference in
      the survivorship of the 2 groups when revision for aseptic loosening was used as the end
      point for the analysis. Similarly, Parratte et al reviewed 398 TKR cases in whom 292 had
      post-operative limb alignment within 0-3° of the mechanical axis and 106 were outside of
      this. The authors concluded that a postoperative mechanical axis of 0° ± 3° did not improve
      the fifteen-year implant survival rate.

      Surgeons such as Waterson et al are therefore now questioning the old philosophy of
      alignment. There has been a move to change surgical practice and put the knee replacement
      parts in place in a way that replicates the alignment of the patient's own original
      knee-natural, alternative or kinematic alignment (KA). Importantly, several studies looking
      at this KA have not shown any loss of satisfaction with results of knee replacement, and show
      some signs that in the short term, function of the knee may be better with the new technique.

      Waterson et al reported 1 year follow up data in 71 patients undergoing TKR randomised to
      either KA (n = 36) or MA (n = 35). No significant differences were found between them in
      function one year post-operatively. The authors recommended further research is required to
      see if any theoretical long-term functional benefits of KA are realised or if there are any
      potential effects on implant survival. Interestingly, in this work, there was a greater
      improvement in the mean American Knee Society Score (AKSS) in the KA group at six weeks when
      compared with the MA group (p = 0.05). The measurements of peak torque in the quadriceps were
      also significantly better in the KA group at six weeks and three months (p = 0.003 and p =
      0.02 respectively) by comparison to the MA group. Whilst this randomised control trial failed
      to demonstrate any discernible difference between TKRs implanted in KA or MA at 1 year, the
      authors recommended mid- to longer-term follow-up to confirm the equivocal functional outcome
      and that survival of the TKR is not compromised by KA relative to MA. This new study takes
      this concept further using manual instruments to try and achieve KA.

      Mizner et al reported deficits in quadriceps force of 30-40% in patients for up to a year
      after TKR by comparison to age matched subjects. They describe reduction of quadriceps muscle
      performance has been correlated with fall risk, walking speed, speed and quality of
      sit-to-stand transfers, and performance during stair climbing in individuals older than 60
      years of age. Such functional deficits can impact significantly on quality of life and this
      functional reduction could be a contributory factor to the dissatisfaction with TKR reported
      by some patients. Bade et al identified similar reductions in quadriceps strength after TKR
      at 1 and 3 months post-op that took 6 months to recover to pre-operative levels. Again, this
      can have implications for functional recovery and satisfaction. If Waterson's work on KA
      versus MA shows improvements in early quadriceps function, then it is important to see if
      this can be progressed further and translated into improved function and satisfaction after
      TKR.

      Dossett et al reported the results of their work and evaluated an alternative alignment
      method (KA with patient-specific cutting guides) compared to the alignment results with MA
      with conventional instruments. This was a randomized controlled trial of 41 KA and 41 MA
      patients. In this work, the authors point out that because a mechanically aligned TKR strives
      to correct limb alignment to a straight line, the kinematics of the knee can be altered. They
      outline the principle behind KA i.e. placement of the components so that the orthogonal 3-D
      orientation of the 3 axes that describe normal knee kinematics is restored to that of the
      pre-arthritic knee. Two of their secondary outcome measures showed results in favour of the
      KA knee: The Oxford Score (OKS-0 is best and 48 worst) was 8 in the KA group and 15 in the MA
      group, a difference of 7 points, which was significant (P.001). The range of knee flexion was
      120° in the kinematically aligned group and 115° in the MA group, a difference of 5°, which
      was significant (P .043).

      It was also of interest that in the Dossett paper the operative time in the kinematically
      aligned group was 21 minutes less than the mechanically aligned group (P&lt;000).

      In the short term at least, it would appear that KA of TKR components has the potential to
      deliver improvements in patient generated outcomes, quadriceps torque and flexibility of the
      knee which in theory could increase the number of patients satisfied with TKR. Concern about
      longer term failure of TKR if MA is not rigorously pursued appears to have been allayed.

      A study examining short, medium and longer term outcomes of KA, with a contemporary TKR
      design is needed to see if outcomes for patients scan be improved. This study has the
      potential to be of great importance in contributing to this question. Limb alignment has
      focussed on the need to achieve the zero degree goal of hip, knee and ankle alignment. To
      achieve real 3 dimensional (3D) more natural alignment, surgeons have to accept this goal may
      not be correct. There is a need to achieve pre-arthritic/pre-morbid alignment and to evaluate
      if this can unlock the potential for improved patient outcomes. A prospective, randomised
      study with multiple outcome measures can deliver a major contribution to the knowledge base
      of this subject and influence surgical practice with the aim of improving patient outcomes
      and satisfaction.

      Methodology:

      This study will be carried out at a single centre: The Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU)
      at the Royal Devon and Exeter (RD+E) Hospital. Different parts of the study will be carried
      out in the operating theatres, orthopaedic out-patients department and the physiotherapy
      department.

      Participant Selection:

      Study participants will be undergoing TKR under the care of the EKRU at the RD+E Hospital.

      Patients will be identified as potential participants in 1 of 2 ways. Firstly, by their
      surgeon when they are listed for TKR surgery. The surgeon will outline the study, provide the
      patient with the study patient information leaflet and a copy of the study consent form and
      ask permission from the patient to allow one of the research team to contact them.
      Alternatively, they will be identified from the current surgical waiting list as suitable for
      inclusion. In this latter case, their surgeon will write to the patient requesting permission
      for one of the research team to contact them by telephone to discuss the study and to enquire
      if the patient would enrol. A patient information leaflet about the study will accompany this
      letter.

      The patient will have an opportunity to provisionally agree or decline enrolment during this
      telephone call.

      Written consent for participation will be obtained on a study specific Ethics Committee
      approved consent form on attendance at the hospital for the pre-operative CT scan. The
      pre-operative data will be collected including: demographics and medical history, Knee
      Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), the Euroquol 5 Dimension
      Questionnaire (EQ5D) score, the Forgotten Knee Score (FKS) and the Knee Society Score (KSS),
      the SF36, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score, pain
      measurements by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during rest and activity and detail of the use of
      pain medication. The research team member will assess participants overall joint flexibility
      using the Beighton scale. An assessment of pre-operative anxiety and depression will be made
      via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 3 copies of written consent will be
      obtained- one original and 2 photocopies. The original will be kept by the research team in
      the study masterfile, one will be returned to the patient and one will be placed in the
      medical notes.

      Routine care for these patients from their clinic appointment includes X-ray of the affected
      knee, full leg alignment X-ray, and an assessment of their active and passive range of motion
      of the knee.

      All information collected pre-operatively will be used to quantify the sample population and
      compare post-operative progression.

      Pre-operative Radiological Assessment:

      In addition to routine care, all study participants will undergo 1) a pre-operative CT scan
      of the affected leg (spiral CT through the hip, knee and ankle) and 2) a whole leg
      antero-posterior (AP) radiograph standing on one leg (the leg about to have a TKR and
      involved in the study) and 3) a lateral &quot;heel-hang&quot; X-ray of the knee for surgery.

      Pre-operative Functional Assessment:

      Study participants will attend the Functional Lab in the physiotherapy department at the RD+E
      Hospital for an assessment of their functional ability using the Exeter Functional lab
      protocol and the Nurture and Instride devices.

      Randomisation:

      This will be a randomised, prospective, blinded study with 2 arms of 63 patients each. Arm 1
      will receive a Triathlon TKR implanted using the traditional/MA method and arm 2 will receive
      a Triathlon TKR using the KA/alternative alignment method. The randomization schedule will be
      determined using an on-line random assignment sequence generator
      (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm), kept and controlled by the study co-ordinator.
      Randomisation assignment will be transcribed onto paper, and placed inside a sealed opaque
      envelope.

      Any deviation from the assigned treatment group by a surgeon will be reported as a deviation
      from protocol and the case will be terminated from the study.

      Sample Size:

      126 patients (63 per arm). The sample size was determined using the primary outcome measure,
      OKS measured at 12-month follow-up, which has a Minimal Clinically Important Difference
      (MCID) of 5 units (Clement et al). To detect a between group mean difference of 5 units, with
      90% power and significance threshold of 0.05, using a standard deviation in both groups of
      7.6 (Clement et al), requires 50 participants per group. Assuming 20% attrition, 63
      participants per group are required.

      Admission to Hospital for Surgery and Hospital Stay: will occur in the routine way as for all
      patients undergoing TKR in this hospital.

      Intra-operative assessment:

      Before any ligament releases or bony cuts are made, a dynamic soft tissue envelope assessment
      is to be performed using the Stryker navigation system. All study patients will have their
      operation performed using Navigation.

      Navigation will verify the cuts being made and assess the soft tissue balance both before and
      after trials and implantation of the TKR.

      These results will be recorded in the navigation database and in the patient's study file.

      The use of navigation will add approximately 15 minutes to the length of the operation and
      will ensure that the intended surgical alignment goal has been achieved.

      Post-operative Follow Up:

        -  Participants will be reviewed at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years
           post-operatively. (3 and 6 month appointments in addition to routine care).

        -  The 6 post-operative visits for functional testing are in addition to routine care.

        -  The study will terminate at 5 years after which patients will return to the usual
           post-operative management schedule of a further review 10 years post-operatively.

      Post-operative Radiological Assessment:

        -  Participants will undergo X-ray examination of the knee post-operatively whilst in
           hospital and then at 1, 2 and 5 years- as per routine care

        -  Participants will undergo one post-op spiral CT scan examination of the affected leg at
           approximately 6 weeks after surgery (spiral CT through hip, knee and ankle) and a repeat
           of the whole leg AP radiograph standing on one leg (the leg that has just had a TKR and
           is involved in the study) at 1 year post-operatively. This is in addition to routine
           care.

      Surgery:

      Operating techniques will be standard techniques as used by the 4 experienced TKR surgeons
      involved in the study with the exception of the alignment of the components which will be
      decided upon in the randomisation schedule for use of the traditional MA or the KA method.

      The use of navigation to assist ligament balancing and placement of the TKR will be in all
      cases.

      All components will be cemented in situ using the Triathlon Cruciate Retaining (CR) Implant
      with an X3 polyethylene insert.

      All patellae will be resurfaced. After surgery, patients will be discharged home allowed to
      fully weight-bear as comfort allows and with walking aids for use for a 6 week period if
      required. All patients will be instructed in an exercise regime whilst in hospital which they
      will continue after discharge and post-operative out-patient physiotherapy will be provided
      on an as needed basis- treatment type and frequency will be decided upon by the individual
      physiotherapist seeing each patient reflectinfg the care given to TKR patients in the region.

      Study Blinding:

      The following people will be blinded as to which arm of the study the patient is allocated
      to:

        -  The patient

        -  The functional assessor in the physiotherapy department

        -  The physiotherapist providing post-operative physiotherapy

        -  The radiologist reporting the CT scans

        -  The 2 surgeons reporting the X-ray findings-no surgeon will report on his or her own
           patients

      Data Collation:

      To be undertaken by the clinician undertaking the specific procedure concerned. The research
      coordinator or the research nurses attached to the RD+E Hospital R+D department will collect
      the pre-op consent, the pre and post-op Patient recorded Outcome Measures (PROMs). Data will
      be entered on to the study database by them the accuracy of entry double checked by them i.e.
      one person enters the data and a second checks its accuracy.

      RD+E Hospital physiotherapists will be responsible for collection of the Functional
      Assessment data.

      The 4 surgeons will be responsible for clinic data and communications, operation note
      details, reporting on X-ray findings- all of these to be on the hospital Clinical
      Documentation Management (CDM) system.

      Dr Anaspure will report the CT scan findings. All data will be stored on RD+E NHSFT secure
      computers. Data will be entered into an Excel spreadsheet for later transfer into a
      statistical package such as Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24,
      for analysis. All patient identifiers will be removed. At the end of the study, when all
      analysis of the data has been completed, the study data will be archived as per the sponsor's
      archiving Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

      Statistical analysis. The research team will arrange for independent statistical analysis of
      the results by Dr. Fiona Warren from the University of Exeter Clinical Trials Unit (CTU).

      All outcomes will be reported descriptively by group, with continuous outcomes reported as
      mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range).

      All continuous outcome measures, including the primary outcome (OKS) will be analysed using
      linear regression modelling with adjustment for randomisation variables (surgeon, severity
      based on baseline OKS, and age (below 70, 70 and above), and baseline measurement. EQ5D will
      be analysed using the equivalent analyses with Tobit regression. Between group comparisons
      will be reported using confidence intervals and p-values.

      For continuous measures recorded at multiple time points, hierarchical regression models will
      be used to assess the interaction between intervention and timepoint, with the interaction
      effect reported as a global p-value.

      All analyses will be reported using the intention to treat principle. The primary analyses
      will include complete case data only. The amount of missing data will be reported for all
      outcome variables. In the event of substantive missing data (more than 5%), a secondary
      analysis will be performed including observed data and missing data imputed using multiple
      chained equations.

      Timescale:

      EKRU carry out 25 TKR procedures per month. The research team understand that studies have,
      on average, 54% of potential participants who choose not to be part of the research and
      believe it is reasonable to recruit 11 cases per month. However, will be allowed to achieve
      the sample size of 126 in case recruitment is slower than anticipated.

      Each patient will remain part of the study for approximately 5 years. Total duration of the
      study will be 8 years. (2 years to recruit participants, 5 years of follow up and data
      collection and one further year for data collation, cleansing and evaluation, statistical
      analysis and writing up of the study findings).

      Dissemination of Results:

      Participants will be informed in writing of the results if they so desire. The (R+D) Office
      at the RD+E Hospital will be informed of the results.

      The results of this research will be presented both nationally and internationally at knee
      surgery conferences, and published in a peer reviewed journal.

      Impact of Research:

      Unknown. If the research identifies a clear advantage of one study arm over the others, then
      it is likely that this technique will become standard TKR procedure in the EKRU- with the aim
      of providing patients with the best clinical and functional results after TKR surgery.
      Similarly, if a clear difference is found in one study arm, one would hope that presentation
      of the results to colleagues at other institutions will result in better long term results
      for their patients.

      In the event that no technique proves superior to the others, then this will provide surgeons
      with the reassurance that no matter what their preferred technique, their patient is not
      being disadvantaged.

      If one arm of the study out performs the other in clinical and functional results, there may
      also be cost differences between the arms of the study which could result in cost savings for
      the NHS.

      Costs:

      The EKRU has signed a Masters Service Agreement with Stryker UK to support its research
      projects. The study will remain an investigator initiated one, independent of influence of
      Stryker. As such all anticipated costs of the study will be covered.

      Measures to avoid bias:

        -  The patients will be blinded as to which arm of the study they are allocated to.

        -  The operating surgeon cannot be blinded to randomisation as he will be performing the
           surgery.

        -  The member of staff interpreting the results of the CT scan (Dr Anaspure) will be
           blinded as to which group the patients are allocated to

        -  The physiotherapist carrying out the functional assessments will be blinded to study arm
           allocation as will the physiotherapists carrying out post-operative out-patient
           rehabilitation

        -  No surgeon will report upon the x-rays of a patient upon whom he/she operated

        -  The statistician analysing the results will be blinded to study arm allocation

      Patient involvement:

      The study research team have consulted with patients on the feasibility of participating in
      the study at all and in particular about the demands of attending the appointments for
      functional assessment and CT scans. The study was discussed at the EKRU patient research
      panel. (This panel is a group of patients who have undergone knee replacement surgery in this
      Unit and who are therefore, well placed to comment on the practicalities of study
      involvement, as well as on the appropriateness and clarity of the patient information
      leaflet.) Attendance at all time frames is critical for completion of the secondary measure
      functional outcome and it was stressed by the patient representatives that the patients need
      to be fully informed of the commitment required should they agree to take part. Similarly, it
      was recommended that the extra commitment for CT scan appointments be highlighted.

      Bi-annual meetings of the patient research panel are held and if issues arise when running
      the study that require further patient involvement, they will be taken them to the panel for
      consultation. If a meeting is not due for some time, a panel member will be contacted
      personally for their advice. When the research team consulted on the design and wording of
      the patient information leaflet and the consent form, various changes were recommended and
      implemented.

      Risks/Monitoring Adverse Events/Stopping the Study:

      A log of adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse device effects and serious adverse
      device effects will be kept by the study coordinator. Any such event events occurring in the
      immediate peri and post-operative events should be reported to the coordinator by the
      consultant surgeon in charge of the case who will contact the study sponsor within the time
      frames as specified by them. Similarly any such adverse events may be identified in clinic
      and again, the surgeon concerned should report these back to the coordinator to be logged and
      the sponsor will be informed.

      It is possible that adverse events will occur that are dealt with either by the Accident and
      Emergency (A+E) department, the patient's General Practitioner (GP) or other hospitals. These
      may not be readily apparent to the research team. The operating surgeon will specifically ask
      participants to inform the research team if any complications or adverse events occur at each
      clinic attendance.

      A meeting of the research team will be held on a 3 monthly basis to discuss progress of the
      study, any specific problems and to consider whether there are any justifications for
      stopping the study. As both techniques being studied of performing TKR are already in use, it
      is not anticipated that there will be an unexpected complication that would necessitate an
      early termination of the study.

      Ethical considerations Ethical approval for this study will be sought from the National
      Research Ethics Service and the Health Research Authority.

      The study coordinator has discussed the study with the radiological protection officer at the
      RD+E Hospital who has provided radiation dose calculations as follows:

      All patients undergoing these total knee replacement operations in our hospital receive AP
      and Lateral radiographs of the knee on 5 occasions (pre &amp; post op, at 1, 2 years and 5
      years), 2 AP radiographs of both legs at pre-op &amp; 1 year. This is routine care. The total
      dose arising from these examinations is 81 millisiverts (µSv) as described by the Health
      Protection Agency Centre for Radiation, Chemicals and Environmental Hazards (HPA-CRCE) Report
      012, 2010.

      In addition, patients enrolled in this trial will require 2 additional whole leg AP x-rays, 1
      lateral x-ray of the knee and 2 CT scans covering the hip, knee and ankle. The total dose
      that a patient participating in this trial will receive is 1.7mSv, of which 1.6mSv is in
      addition to standard care.

      Participants are &gt;/= 60 years of age and pregnant women are excluded from the trial.

      The lifetime risk of developing a cancer resulting from the total radiation dose is 1 in
      21,900 for a 60 year old patient; this would fall to 1 in 84,900 for an 80 year old patient.
      For the ages of the expected cohort, this is considered to be a very low risk (HPA-CRCE-028,
      2011 and NRPB, 2001) and is equivalent to around 8.5 months of natural background radiation
      in the UK.

      The lifetime risk of developing a cancer resulting from the excess dose in this trial is 1 in
      23,000 for a 60 year old patient; this would fall to 1 in 93,800for an 80 year old patient.
      For the ages of the expected cohort, this is considered to be a low risk (HPA-CRCE-028, 2011
      and NRPB, 2001) and is equivalent to around 8 months of natural background radiation in the
      UK.

      With participants consent, the research team will send anonymised data regarding the
      navigation findings during the operation, as well as CT and X-ray findings from pre-and
      post-surgery to Stryker UK. This will be with the purpose of providing information to allow
      the company to improve surgical technique, as well as implant and instrumentation design. No
      personal identifiers will be used when this information is sent to Stryker UK

      Conflicts of Interest:

      Stryker UK have supported this study financially. However, it remains completely independent
      from them in study design, results and dissemination of findings. The 4 operating surgeons
      all undertake consultancy work for Stryker UK and will complete the necessary applications
      regarding this on the ethics application for this study.

      Confidentiality All of the research staff are trained in the guidelines for Good Clinical
      Practice (GCP) in research. All National Health Service (NHS) staff involved are bound by
      patient confidentiality requirements of the NHS.

      The study participants GP will be informed that their patient is involved in the research-
      particularly as the patient may wish to discuss their involvement in the research with their
      GP.

      All of the data associated with the study will be kept electronically on the hard drives of
      computers within the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU). It will be stored on encrypted
      and password protected hospital computers. The data will only be accessible by members of the
      research team and by the Research and Development (R+D) department at the RD+E Hospital who
      will require access to the data to ensure compliance with the protocol and that all study
      regulatory requirements are being met.

      When the data is sent for statistical analysis, all personal identifiers will be removed and
      a study number only used for identification.

      No personal identifiers will be used when information about the navigation findings, and CT
      scans and X-rays findings is sent to Stryker UK At the end of the study (see timescales
      above), all research data will be archived as per our sponsors archiving SOP. Radiographs and
      scans will remain on the secure hospital systems as per routine care.

             joint at time of study device implantation.

          -  Patient has received any orthopaedic surgical intervention to the lower extremities
             within the past year or is expected to require any orthopaedic surgical intervention
             to the lower extremities, other than the TKR to be enrolled in this study, within the
             next year.

          -  Patient requires bilateral total knee replacements, or has a history of unsuccessful
             contralateral partial or total knee replacement.

          -  Patient has chronic heart failure (NYHA Stage ≥ 2)
