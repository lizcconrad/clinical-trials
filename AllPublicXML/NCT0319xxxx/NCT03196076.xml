      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound for kidney
      malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, prospective study designed to evaluate the accuracy of
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with microbubble contrast agent (perflutren lipid;
      Definity®) to identify malignancy in patients with kidney disease, a known risk factor for
      kidney malignancy, in whom a conventional ultrasound (US) or other prior imaging shows an
      indeterminate or suspicious kidney lesion.

      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the sensitivity of CEUS in diagnosing
      kidney malignancy in patients with a risk factor for kidney malignancy and compare it to the
      current gold standard test in this patient population. Secondary analysis will include more
      optimal contrast-enhanced imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) in a subset of patients who can receive these studies. The study outcome will lead to
      immediate clinical application in patients with chronic kidney disease. Given the
      cost-effectiveness and adverse event profile, it has excellent potential to become
      established as first line diagnostics in the general patient population as well.

    <description>Perflutren will be administered in a bolus or continuous infusion using the dosing range and administration type within the perflutren prescribing information.Once perflutren lipid has been administered, the transducer is maintained in a constant position over the area of interest to show the target lesion in order to assess the enhancement pattern during the early, mid and late vascular phases. Images will also be taken of kidney parenchyma in a suitable longitudinal plane.If there are multiple lesions in one subject requiring a second dose, the subject will have the option to undergo a 2nd contrast-enhanced study 30-minutes after the initial contrast dose, per dosing instructions in the package insert.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for the present study, patients must meet the following criteria:

          1. Able to provide written informed consent

          2. Willing to comply with protocol requirements

          3. At least 18 years of age

          4. Have kidney disease, defined as either CKD II-V, determined by estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;90 and derived from serum creatinine measurements, or
             albuminuria/proteinuria, determined by albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to
             creatinine ratio of &gt;30mg/gm within 3 months of recruitment, or on dialysis or having
             received a kidney transplant or have biopsy proven kidney disease. In these latter
             cases, blood and urine tests are not necessary.

          5. Have at least one kidney lesion identified but incompletely characterized on a
             non-contrasted US, CT, or MR exam for which the patient's provider recommends
             follow-up studies or further evaluation with additional imaging test(s).
