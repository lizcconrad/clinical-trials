  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase 3 study is aimed to compare the efficacy
      and safety of MIL60 with bevacizumab as first-line treatment when combined with standard
      chemotherapy (paclitaxel/carboplatin) in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic or
      recurrent non-squamous NSCLC.
