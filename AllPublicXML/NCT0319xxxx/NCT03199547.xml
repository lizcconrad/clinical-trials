  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though maternal and neonatal health are high priority areas for international development,
      maternal and neonatal mortality remain unacceptably high. Worldwide there are 1 million
      maternal and 4 million neonatal deaths every year and half of them occur in sub-Saharan
      Africa.

      Post-partum and neonatal severe bacterial infections, namely sepsis, are leading causes of
      maternal and neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Newborns can be infected during labour -
      when passing through the birth canal - and also during the first days/weeks of life, as a
      consequence of the close physical contact with the mother, when the latter carriers bacteria.
      As the mother is an important source of bacterial transmission to the newborn, treating
      mothers with antibiotics during labour should decrease their bacterial carriage and therefore
      lower transmission to the newborn. As carriage is a necessary step towards severe disease,
      this intervention should in turn result in the lower occurrence of severe bacterial disease
      and mortality during the neonatal period.

      In many high-income countries, pregnant women are screened during pregnancy for vaginal
      carriage of Group B Streptococcus, the bacteria responsible for the vast majority of neonatal
      sepsis in the developed world. If women are carriers, they are treated with intravenous
      antibiotics during labour to decrease the risk of severe disease to their off-spring.
      Although this intervention has been successful in developed countries, infrastructure and
      resource limitations in regions like sub-Saharan Africa prevent both screening and use of
      intravenous antibiotics. Also, in Africa several bacterial pathogens are responsible for
      neonatal sepsis and the antibiotics needed in the continent should cover a wider number of
      bacteria; and ideally cover also bacteria responsible for severe post-partum disease in the
      mother.

      We will conduct a large trial in West Africa, The Gambia and Burkina Faso, with the main
      objective of determining if a single dose of an oral antibiotic given to women during labour
      decreases newborn mortality. The trial will also assess the effect of the antibiotic on
      lowering newborns and maternal hospitalization during the first week's post-partum. We have
      selected an antibiotic (azithromycin) that in sub-Saharan Africa has already been used for
      elimination of other prevalent diseases such as trachoma. This antibiotic is safe, requires a
      single oral administration, has no special storage requirements and has the potential to
      eliminate most of the bacteria commonly causing severe disease in newborns and post-partum
      women in the continent. Very important this antibiotic is not widely used in clinical care in
      the continent, and therefore, any temporal increase of resistance induced by the intervention
      should not have implications on current treatment guidelines.

      Before going to the large trial proposed here (12,500 women to be recruited), we have
      generated robust preliminary data on the effect of the intervention in a proof-of-concept
      trial conducted in The Gambia (829 women and their offspring recruited). We found that in
      fact, babies born from mothers who had taken this antibiotic during labour were less likely
      to carry bacteria that can potentially cause severe disease. These babies were also three
      times less likely to have bacterial skin infections or umbilical infections, both highly
      common among African newborns. Besides, fever or mastitis (again both very common in the
      region) during the post-partum period were four times lower among mothers who had taken the
      antibiotic during labour. Such trial confirmed our hypothesis of impact on bacterial
      transmission but it was too small to assess the effect of the antibiotic on mortality and
      hospitalizations. The preliminary trial also showed that women from the azithromycin group
      were less likely to need antibiotics for treatment infections during the puerperal period,
      decreasing then the pressure on the scarcity of antibiotics available in the continent.

      The advantages of our approach are its simplicity, low cost and the possibility of protecting
      both mothers and babies with the same intervention.

      Dr Marc Tahita Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro Burkina Faso BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
      Neonatal and maternal sepsis are major contributors to the high burden of mortality in
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Bacterial infections are leading causes of neonatal deaths,
      representing 1 out of 3 deaths in this age group (1).

      Neonatal sepsis is the consequence of bacterial infection during early life. Newborns may be
      infected during labour (through the birth canal) or during the first days/weeks of life, when
      they may become infected because of the close physical contact with the mother, if the latter
      carries bacteria (i.e. in the nasopharyngeal tract), a common occurrence in resource-limited
      settings, particularly in SSA. Streptococcus pneumoniae and group A Streptococcus are
      important in the late neonatal period (from the second week of life), while group B
      Streptococcus (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli occur often in both the early
      and late neonatal periods (2).

      AZI is a semi-synthetic azalide macrolide that is structurally related to erythromycin but
      has a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity, improved tissue penetration and a more
      favourable pharmacokinetic profile (3). Azithromycin is a cheap, wide spectrum, oral
      antibiotic that is safe to use in mothers and newborns, does not require special storage
      conditions, and can be delivered at the most peripheral level of care.

      Between 2013 and 2015, we conducted as first proof-of-concept, a double-blind randomized
      trial on the effect of 2g of AZI administered to Gambian women in labour on maternal and
      neonatal bacterial carriage (4). The primary endpoint was bacterial carriage at day 6 in the
      newborn (i.e. S.aureus, GBS or S.pneumoniae). The rationale for the study was that this
      intervention would decrease bacterial carriage of the study bacteria both, in the mother and
      the newborn and consequently the risk of invasive bacterial disease or sepsis. We found that
      the intervention substantially reduced the prevalence of carriage of each of these three
      bacteria, both in the newborn and the mother, during the entire neonatal/puerperal period
      (4).

        1. Newborn (b) Mother1

             1. Maternal nasopharyngeal swab at day 0: collected before the intervention was given.

      Our study also showed that women in the AZI group had a lower prevalence of the study
      bacteria in the breast milk during the entire neonatal period (day 6: 9.6% vs 21.9%, RR=0.44,
      p&lt;0.001) and in the vaginal tract (8-10 days: 13.2% vs 24.2% RR=0.55 - p&lt;0.001).

      Although the study was not designed to evaluate clinical endpoints, prevalence of these
      endpoints decreased significantly in the AZI group (5). The use of antibiotics, and the
      occurrence of fever, mastitis and puerperal infections were significantly lower in the AZI
      group (Table 1). Newborns in the intervention group had fewer infections (skin infections,
      umbilical infections, ear infections, conjunctivitis or mild sepsis) during the neonatal
      period (Table 2). There were also fewer neonatal deaths due to severe infections in the AZI
      group (0.4% versus 1.4% excluding neonates with severe congenital malformations).

      p-values from the log-rank test (mothers p=0.001, newborns p=0.04) AZI was safe for both the
      mothers and the newborns. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) was not observed in any of the
      study children during the 2-month follow up period (4).

      Azithromycin is a cheap, wide spectrum, oral antibiotic that is safe to use in mothers and
      newborns, does not require special storage conditions, and can be delivered at the most
      peripheral level of care.

      In the trial presented here, we want to assess the impact of using AZI during labour on
      neonatal mortality as well as maternal and neonatal sepsis and infant growth. If successful,
      this simple intervention could be easily implemented through the health system at the most
      peripheral level of care. It has the potential to achieve wide coverage in SSA where low-cost
      interventions aiming at reducing neonatal mortality are urgently needed. In addition, the
      intervention should concomitantly protect women and newborns. Azithromycin resistance will
      also be monitored as the former trial showed high rates of AZI resistance for S. aureus.
      However, AZI is not widely used in SSA for clinical treatment and therefore any short-term
      resistance arising from the intervention would have little impact on clinical care.

           TRIAL DESIGN

           This is a multi-country phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial in
           which 12,500 women in labour will be randomised to receive either a single dose of 2g of
           oral azithromycin or placebo (ratio 1:1). Pregnant women (age ≥16 years) will be
           identified during antenatal clinic visits in several health facilities in The Gambia and
           Burkina Faso; and will be asked to provide written informed consent. Recruitment will
           take place when these women attend the study health facilities in labour.

           INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Pregnant women (age ≥16 years) will be identified
           during antenatal clinic visits and asked to provide written informed consent. During
           labour they will be screened and recruited unless they have any of the following
           exclusion criteria: planned caesarean section, ante-partum haemorrhage, known allergy to
           macrolides, confirmed intrauterine death or a known severe congenital malformation. The
           randomisation number will only be assigned after the screening.

           TRIAL OBJECTIVES

           The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of one oral dose of AZI (2g)
           given to women in labour on neonatal mortality (from birth to 28 days). Exclusion
           criteria include: severe birth asphyxia (Apgar score &lt;3 at 1 min); severe congenital
           malformations and very low birth weight (VLBW) (&lt;1.5Kg). Note: Those deaths excluded
           from the primary objective are considered in some of the secondary objectives below.

           Secondary objectives of the trial include the effect of the intervention on other
           clinical endpoints (for both neonates and mothers) and on microbiological endpoints
           (prevalence of carriage and resistance of different bacterial pathogens):

                PARTICIPANTS AND SAMPLES We will recruit 12,500 women and their newborns.
                Approximately half of this number of women will be recruited in The Gambia and half
                in Burkina Faso. However, the recruitment will be competitive and if one country
                does not reach the numbers within the time period expected, the other will increase
                the recruitments.

           *Visit at Day 0/1 (recruitment at the health facility and discharge from the health
           facility) and visit at Day 28 is the same for all the study participants. The additional
           active visits are only for participants included in one of the sub-studies.

           All study participants will be followed for 28 days. During this follow-up period,
           samples will be collected if they are hospitalized with suspicion of sepsis (mothers and
           newborns). Clinical samples to conduct sepsis work up will be collected. For newborns
           hospitalized with clinical suspicion of sepsis, we will also collect nasopharyngeal
           swabs (NPS), oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and rectal swabs (RS).

           CENTRES INVOLVED IN THE TRIAL

           In The Gambia, we will conduct the trial at Bundung Maternal and Child Health Hospital
           and Serrekunda Health Facility. Bundung Maternal and Child Health Hospital is where the
           proof-of-concept trial was conducted. The hospital delivers approximately 5,000 babies
           each year and is located on the Gambian coast, 15 km from the MRC The Gambia
           headquarters. Pregnant women usually have 2-3 antenatal visits during the second and
           third trimester and they are kept in the health centre for approximately 6 hours after
           delivery. Serrekunda Health Facility is located approximately 15Km from both the Bundung
           Maternal and Child Health Hospital and the MRC The Gambia headquarters. Approximately,
           2,000 deliveries take place per year. In The Gambia, maternal mortality ratio is 461
           deaths/100,000 live births (4) and infant mortality rate is above 50 deaths/1,000 live
           births (5).

           In Burkina Faso, the study will be carried out at the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro
           (CRUN) located in the rural central west region of the country. In 2013, the total
           population of the Nanoro Health district was estimated at 158,127 people. There are 14
           peripheral health facilities (covering 70 villages) around the referral hospital, all
           with maternity and extended program of immunizations (EPI) services. Seven to 10 of
           these health facilities will be part of the trial. The epidemiological profile of
           diseases remains dominated by communicable infectious diseases. Maternal mortality rate
           is 300 deaths/100,000 live births and infant mortality rate is 78.3 deaths/1,000 live
           births. A Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), which covers a total
           population of about 60,000 people in 24 villages (7 health facilities) was set up in
           2009 by the CRUN within the Health district catchment area.

           ALLOCATION OF PARTICIPANTS Randomisation lists based on permuted blocks will be created
           independently for each country, and blister packs will be numbered according to the
           list. The trial will comply with Good Clinical Practices (GCP).

           RISK TO THE SAFETY OF THE TRIAL

             1. Hyperpyloric stenosis (HPS). Azithromycin is associated with HPS in infants (6)
                although it is uncertain in the context of azithromycin treated breast feeding
                women (7). Typically, infants with HPS do not show any symptoms at birth but they
                develop projectile vomiting and other metabolic abnormalities during the first few
                weeks of life. Data generated in our pilot study showed that azithromycin reaches
                the breast milk and traces are still detectable in samples collected at day 28 (8).
                There is some evidence that HPS is less frequent in SSA (9). In our pilot study
                none of the 419 children whose mother received azithromycin developed HPS (8).
                Nevertheless, newborns will be carefully followed up for signs of HPS.

             2. Azithromycin resistance. Azithromycin is not routinely used for clinical care in
                SSA and has a wide antimicrobial spectrum (10). For these reasons it has been used
                in several successful mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns, including trachoma
                and yaws control and elimination (11;12), and in clinical trials for the prevention
                of malaria in pregnancy and preterm births (13). Most studies have shown to varying
                degrees that resistant bacteria can be selected after a single dose. Nevertheless,
                in the absence of antibiotic pressure, resistance disappears due to the lower
                fitness of resistant bacteria (14). Studies that have used azithromycin for MDA, in
                which thousands of people were treated at the same time, have shown that
                S.pneumoniae resistance is only maintained for more than a few months in
                communities where the baseline prevalence of resistance is high (15). In The Gambia
                azithromycin resistance after MDA for trachoma elimination reverted to baseline
                levels 6 months after the intervention (16). In our pilot study, resistance of
                S.aureus was high 28 days after treatment but decreased to baseline levels 12
                months after treatment (Bojang et al in prep). As azithromycin is not used in
                standard clinical care, there would be little selective pressure on resistant
                bacteria. In addition, it is interesting to note that in our pilot trial women in
                the azithromycin group used other antibiotics less often than women in the placebo
                arm (2). This suggests that the intervention might decrease selective pressure on
                the few antibiotics available for standard clinical care in the region. Resistance
                to azithromycin and other antibiotics among the trial participants will be assessed
                in the proposed study.

           SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION In our proof-of-concept trial, the prevalence of bacterial
           carriage in the azithromycin group decreased by more than 50%, and there were 6 neonatal
           deaths (1.4%) (primary endpoint as defined above) in the placebo arm compared to 2
           (0.4%) in the azithromycin arm (70% reduction).

           We assume that mortality in the placebo arm will be at least 1.4% - this is a
           conservative estimate as in the proof-of-concept trial neonates were closely followed up
           during the first week of life and this probably decreased the risk of death. Assuming
           the intervention reduces neonatal mortality by 40%, we would need 5,800 women per arm to
           show a significant difference at 80% power and 5% significance level. And allowing for
           8% loss to follow-up, we would need to recruit a total of 12,500 women (Table 6).

           Table 6. Power with a sample size of 12,500 women by mortality in the placebo arm and
           effect of the intervention.

           Mortality in the placebo arm Effect of the intervention Power 1.4% 50% 40% 35% 96% 80%
           72% 1.7% 50% 40% 35% 30% 99% 90% 80% 65% 2.1% 50% 40% 35% 30% 99% 95% 88% 75%

           Approximately half of the women will be recruited in The Gambia and the other half in
           Burkina Faso. Maternal and infant mortality rates in these two countries are similar.

           This sample size will provide reasonable power for the secondary endpoints of maternal
           and neonatal infection, hospitalization and antibiotic use, since their occurrence is
           higher than neonatal death.
