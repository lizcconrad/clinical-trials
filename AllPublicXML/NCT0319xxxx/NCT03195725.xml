  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate how discussions surrounding Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
      (DNACPR) decisions have changed following the Tracey judgement and how &quot;harm&quot; is being
      defined by clinicians working within specialist palliative care in a hospice setting.

      This is a retrospective case note review. Five hospices within the West Midlands will be
      invited to participate and up to 300 sets of deceased patients' notes containing a DNACPR
      form will be reviewed; 150 from 2013 (prior to the Tracey judgement) and 150 from 2015
      (following the Tracey judgement).

      Initially these forms will be reviewed to document the percentage of patients with whom a
      DNACPR decision was discussed in 2013 and the percentage with whom it was discussed in 2015
      to allow comparison from before the Tracey judgement and after the Tracey judgement.

      If patients did NOT have DNACPR decisions discussed with them, their DNACPR forms and
      clinical notes will then be reviewed and the reasons documented for not involving patients in
      2013 and in 2015 compared. It is anticipated that many, if not most, DNACPR decisions which
      were not discussed with patients in 2013 will cite &quot;distress&quot; as the reason but following the
      Tracey judgement this would not be acceptable in 2015.

      Further analysis of DNACPR forms and clinical notes will then take place for those patients
      identified as not being involved in DNACPR discussions in 2015 (post-Tracey) to identify
      whether, and how, &quot;harm&quot; was defined by the clinician. This should be recorded on the DNACPR
      form or in the clinical notes.

      Following data collection, quantitative analysis will be undertaken to allow comparison of
      percentages of DNACPR decisions discussed with patients in 2013 and 2015 followed by
      descriptive analysis of variation in reasons for not discussing DNACPR decisions in 2013 and
      2015. This study is explorative in nature and further qualitative analysis will not be part
      of this research project.
