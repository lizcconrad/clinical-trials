    <textblock>
      Identifying the critical lesion of coronary artery disease and determining the interventional
      plan are significant for reducing adverse cardiovascular adverse events. The assessment of
      critical lesion requires the consideration of plaque morphology, tissue composition, and
      endometrial stress which leading to rupture. In summary, accurate assessment of critical
      lesions has high application value. In this study, patients with critical coronary artery
      disease were divided into two groups: an accurate assessment group and a simple assessment
      group, with the aim to compare the diagnosis and treatment efficiency as well as prognosis,
      potential cardiovascular risk, possible &quot;excessive&quot; intervention.
