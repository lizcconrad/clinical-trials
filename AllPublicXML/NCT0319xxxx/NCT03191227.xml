      The aim of the Cork and Kerry Study Phase II (Mitchelstown cohort recruited 2010-11) is to
      provide an updated profile of glucose tolerance status, cardiovascular health and their
      related factors in an Irish adult general population sample and to compare the findings with
      those obtained during baseline assessment of Phase I of the Cork and Kerry study (1998) and
      the rescreen (2008).

      Additional objectives include determining the prevalence of proximal risk factors, such as
      hypertension, dyslipidaemia, body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance as well as of more
      distal risk factors of diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity, and the
      association between cardiovascular health and its risk factors with general measures of
      well-being and mental health. The new cohort includes collection of qualitative and
      quantitative data in an effort not only to describe the current health status of the cohort
      and assess individual level determinants but also to provide the appropriate context to
      interpret the role of behavioural factors and social circumstances on health.

      Recruitment was completed on a new cohort of 2047 men and women aged 50-69 years from
      patients attending a single large primary care centre, the Living Health Clinic in
      Mitchelstown, a town with a population of 43000 in county Cork. The Living Health clinic
      includes eight GPs, and the practice serves a catchment area of 20 000, with a mix of urban
      and rural residents. Participants were randomly selected from all registered attending
      patients in the 50-69-year age group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiovascular disease</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was obtained from the GHQ by asking study participants if they had been diagnosed with any one of the following seven conditions: Heart Attack (including coronary thrombosis or myocardial infarction), Heart Failure, Angina, Aortic Aneurysm, Hardening of the Arteries, Stroke, or any other Heart Trouble. Subjects who indicated a diagnosis of any one of these conditions were classified as having CVD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Type 2 Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Type 2 diabetes was defined according to the American Heart Association guidelines of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 7 mmol/L or doctor diagnosed diabetes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Obesity</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Anthropometric measurements were recorded with calibrated instruments according to a standardised protocol. Body weight was measured in kilograms without shoes; to the nearest 100g using a Tanita WB100MA® weighing scales (Tanita Corporation, IL, USA). Height was measured in centimetres to one decimal place using a Seca Leicester® height gauge (Seca, Birmingham, UK). BMI was calculated as weight (kg) /height (m)2. Individuals with a BMI ≥ 30kg/m2 were defined as obese.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypertension</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure was measured according to the European Society of Hypertension Guidelines using an Omron M7 Digital BP monitor on the right arm, after a 5-minute rest in the seated position. The average of the second and third measurements was used for analyses. Hypertension was defined as average systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg or being on hypertensive medication.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolic syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a composite measure classified using a range of MetS definitions (National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) 2001, 2004, American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation) based on the following features: Waist circumference (WC), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Triglycerides (TG) and Blood pressure (BP).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaire which was designed to evaluate the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms. History of depression was assessed using the following questions: &quot;Have you ever had depression?&quot; Subjects were then asked &quot;If yes, when did it start? In the last year/ 1-5 years ago/ &gt;5 years ago.&quot; Data regarding antidepressant medication use were collected. In addition to use of the aforementioned screening tool, subjects who indicated a diagnosis of depression or current anti-depressant medication use were classified as having a mental health disorder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), using only the anxiety subscale. History of anxiety was assessed using the following questions: &quot;Have you ever had anxiety?&quot; Subjects were then asked &quot;If yes, when did it start? In the last year/ 1-5 years ago/ &gt;5 years ago.&quot; Data regarding antidepressant medication use were collected. In addition to use of the aforementioned screening tool, subjects who indicated a diagnosis of depression or anxiety or current anti-depressant medication use were classified as having a mental health disorder.</description>
