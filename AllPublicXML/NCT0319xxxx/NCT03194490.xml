    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of adding stretching exercises to cervical
      mobilization and cervical range of motion exercises on cervical range of motion, pain, pain
      threshold, level of disability and patient satisfaction for patient with non-specific
      mechanical neck pain

      All recruited participants will sign a statement of informed consent. Subjects will be
      randomly divided into two groups (stretching group and standard intervention group). The
      following questionnaires will be completed in the following order: Neck Disability Index
      (NDI), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and Global Rating of Change Scale (GROC). Next,
      Cervical Range of Motion (ROM) and Pain threshold will measured for both groups. The
      stretching group will receive the cervical passive mobilization, stretching, and home program
      (Stretching and ROM exercise). The standard intervention group will receive cervical
      mobilization and home program (ROM exercises).

    <description>Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) is a liner outcome measurement used to determine the level of the participant's pain when comparing baseline, weekthree, five and ten. It consists of a straight 100mm line that is scored from 0 to 10 with 10 mm intervals. The zero represents no pain while a 10 represents very severe pain that participant cannot stand.</description>

    <description>The Global rating of change (GROC) is used to measure the amount of improvement that the patient achieves from the intervention or rehabilitation program when comparing baseline, week three, five and ten. The score ranges from -7 to 0 to 7 in which -/+3 to -/+ 1 represents a small change, -/+ 4 to -/+5 represents moderate change and -/+6 to -/+7 means a large change. The negative and positive means the patient condition worsens or improves respectively.</description>

    <description>The manual therapy will be conducted by a physical therapist who has experience in manual therapy and is licensed from the California Board of Physical Therapy. The manual therapy intervention will consist of Passive Accessory Intervertebral Movements (PAIVMs) that are selected to increase the intervertebral foramen space. The nature of PAIVMs technique will be selected by the physical therapist based on the participant's condition.
Stretching exercise will be given to the participants by the main investigator. The anterior and middle scalene muscles stretch will be occurred by applying a gentle pressure for 30 seconds for 3 times. Upper trapeze muscle stretch will be occurred by applying a gentle pressure for 30 seconds for 3 times. Moreover,stretch sternocleidomastoid muscle will be occurred by applying a gentle pressure for 30 seconds for 3 times.. In addition, a home exercise will be given to the participant.</description>
