  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare 3 methods of assessing endothelial function in
      healthy female volunteers and pregnant women with and without pregnancy induced hypertension.
      The methods under comparison are simultaneous tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), EndoPAT and
      Sphygmocor (pregnant women only). 35 participants (15 healthy, 10 pregnant normal blood
      pressure, 10 pregnant with hypertension) will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In both normotensive women and others with pregnancy induced hypertension, in previous
      research simultaneous tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) were measured in both forearms, with a
      blood pressure cuff above the tissue oximetry probe on one side.

      StO2 values were continuously monitored on each side during unilateral blood pressure (BP)
      cuff inflation (to suprasystolic pressure for 3 min), and then during deflation. Despite
      similarity in the forearm StO2 decline observed with cuff inflation in all women, the rise
      following cuff deflation - indicative of reactive hyperemia - appeared reduced in
      hypertensive patients, suggesting a relationship with impaired endothelial reserve.

    <description>Part#1: 15 healthy volunteers; 2 assessment sessions. Session 1: StO2 vs. EndoPAT Method comparison analysis; both StO2 and EndoPAT will be applied simultaneously &amp; pulse oximeter probes placed bilaterally on fingers. Baseline readings will be taken for 5 minutes. The blood pressure cuff will be inflated to suprasystolic pressure and StO2 and pulsatile volume changes will be measured by peripheral arterial tonometry, continuous measurement for 3 min and repeated every 10 minutes for 3 sessions.
Session 2: This session will occur within 1 week of session 1. This session is to determine the consistency of the response.
All probes will be applied as in session 1 and cycles of 10 minutes for 3 sessions will be done. All the measurements in session 1 will be captured in session 2.
This will determine inter-day variability. (total time is 53 min).</description>

    <description>Part #2: 20 participants, 10 normotensive and 10 pre-eclamptic pregnant women during their visit to labor floor.
Session 1: Both StO2 and EndoPAT will be applied simultaneously to the same arm below a BP cuff. Baseline readings will be taken for 5 minutes, the blood pressure cuff will be inflated to suprasystolic pressure StO2 and pulsatile volume changes will be measured by peripheral arterial tonometry, continuous measurement for 3 min and repeated every 10 minutes for 3 sessions.
Additionally, vascular stiffness with be measured by SphygmoCor to measure pulse wave velocity (PWV).
