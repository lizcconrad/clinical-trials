  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The First 1000 Days (conception to age 2) is a crucial period for the development and
      prevention of obesity and its adverse consequences in mother-child pairs and their families.
      The overall aim of the First 1000 Days program is to work across early-life systems to
      prevent obesity, promote healthy routines and behaviors, address social determinants of
      health, and reduce health disparities among vulnerable children and families at the MGH
      Chelsea and Revere HealthCare Centers, and DotHouse Health.

      The study aims to simultaneously implement and evaluate an obesity prevention program across
      early life systems to reduce the prevalence of obesity risk factors within racial/ethnic
      minority families, close the gap in maternal-child health disparities, and assess and address
      social determinants of health.
