  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is an extension of protocol 0002, Proof of Concept and Dose Ranging Study of
      carbidopa-levodopa in Neovascular AMD. that is a 3 month study of escalating doses of
      carbidopa-levodopa in neovascular AMD. This trial is a 9 month extension for patients who
      successfully complete protocol 0002 and wish to continue carbidopa-levodopa therapy. It will
      use the two higher dose regimens of protocol 0002. these will be assigned according to how
      well the higher dose was tolerated in protocol 0002.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This extension will employ the same medications, measurements, guidelines for anti-VEGF
      injections and safeguards as in protocol 0002. In combination with protocol 0002, it will
      provide a total of 12 months of therapy with carbidopa-levodopa.

If that dose was not well tolerated in study 0002, the patient will receive the intermediate dose, carbidopa-levodopa 25-100 mg, 1 tablet TID.</intervention_model_description>
