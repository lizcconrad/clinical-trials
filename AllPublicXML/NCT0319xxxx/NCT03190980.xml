      Background: It was long believed that newborns could not experience pain. As it is now
      documented that newborns have all the necessary systems to perceive pain, pain management can
      no longer be ignored.

      Pharmacologic agents are not recommended in neonates for pain relief in minor procedures and
      still there is debate regarding the efficacy of oral glucose, in different strengths, on
      alleviation of pain among neonates.

      Aim: The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety oral administration of
      glucose, in different concentrations, on pain relief in full term neonates undergoing heel
      prick test.

      Methods: The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized, double blind placebo
      controlled trial to investigate the effect of glucose solution on alleviating the pain of
      heel prick test in around 360 healthy full term newborns who will be randomly allocated to
      one of three groups (around 120 neonates in each group): First group will receive 5% glucose,
      second group will receive 30% glucose and third group will receive sterile water as a
      placebo, 2 minutes prior to the procedure.

      Specially trained nurses will take turns to carry out blood sampling. Neonatal pain will be
      assessed by the Neonatal Infant Pain (NIPS) as well as by duration of crying, changes in
      heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled
      study of healthy full term newborns delivered by normal vaginal delivery, undergoing heel
      prick test. They will be randomized to receive either 5% glucose, 30% glucose or sterile
      water as a placebo, 2 minutes prior to the procedure. The investigators will study the
      efficacy and safety of oral glucose, in different strengths, compared to placebo (sterile
      water) in pain alleviation.

      All parents will receive an explanation of the study before participation, and informed
      written consent will be signed by the parents for voluntary participation
