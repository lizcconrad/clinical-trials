  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this retrospective, single-arm, non-randomized, multi-center study is to
      collect real-world data on the effectiveness of using the TRAP technique in acute ischemic
      stroke patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy.

      The TRAP Registry is designed to collect real-world data on the use of the TRAP technique for
      mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients. Recanalization success (as assessed using a TICI
      Score), along with the time to recanalization and number of passes needed for success will be
      assessed at the conclusion of the procedure. In addition, neurologic recovery (as evaluated
      using the Modified Rankin Scale and National Institutes of Health Score) will be assessed at
      24 hours, discharge, and 90 days after the thrombectomy procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject experiencing an acute ischemic stroke in which imaging demonstrates a vascular
             occlusion located in the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) through the distal
             middle cerebral artery (MCA)

          -  Subjects in which the TRAP technique is used for at least the first two thrombectomy
             passes per occluded vessel

          -  Subjects that range in age from 18-85

          -  Subjects with a prestroke modified Rankin scale of 0-1 and presenting with an NIHSS of
             8-30

          -  Subjects that the operator feels may be treated with endovascular therapy

          -  Subjects in which computed tomography (CT)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
             demonstrates an infarct size of less than 70cc on MRI or Alberta Stroke Program Early
             CT (ASPECTS) score overall of 6 or better

          -  Subjects in which groin puncture can be obtained within 6 hours of symptom onset (with
             or without Total Plasminogen Activator administration)

          -  Subjects who have consented in accordance with local Institutional Review Board
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absence of large vessel occlusion on neuroimaging

          -  Evidence of tandem occlusion on neuroimaging

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 x 10³ cells/mm³ or known platelet dysfunction

          -  Contraindication to CT and/or MRI (i.e., due to contrast allergy or prior implant that
             precludes MRI imaging)

          -  Previously documented contrast allergy that is not amenable to medical treatment

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding at time of intervention

          -  Evidence of brain hemorrhage on CT and/or MRI at presenting hospital
