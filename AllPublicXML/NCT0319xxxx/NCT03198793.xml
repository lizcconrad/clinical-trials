  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential hypertension (HTN) is a disease that affects approximately 1 billion individuals
      worldwide. Despite the availability of effective and safe anti-hypertensive drugs, 65% of
      subjects diagnosed with HTN do not have their blood pressure (BP) controlled (&lt;140/90 mmHg).
      The overall incidence of resistant HTN, (defined as requiring 3 or more anti-hypertensive
      drugs, including a diuretic, to control BP) is estimated to be 15% of the hypertensive
      population. Consequently, there is a pressing unmet medical need to develop new classes of
      anti-hypertensive drugs that act on alternative pathways and further control BP and the
      associated cardiovascular risks in subjects.

      The prevalence of HTN in African Americans in the United States is among the highest in the
      world, and HTN is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. One of the risk
      factors for HTN is sodium sensitivity. There is a higher association of HTN with sodium
      sensitivity in African American subjects and other racial/ethnic groups who are
      overweight/obese.

      Effective agents to treat HTN in this high-risk population are clearly needed.

      This study will be conducted in a hypertensive, overweight subject population of multiple
      ethnic origins in which QGC001 is likely, based on its mode of action, to demonstrate a
      significant anti-hypertensive effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      QGC001 is a prodrug of the specific and selective APA inhibitor, EC33, and is the prototype
      of a new class of centrally-acting anti-hypertensive agents called brain APA inhibitors.
      Inhibition of brain APA, which converts Ang II into Ang III, has emerged as a novel anti
      hypertensive treatment, as demonstrated in several experimental animal models. QGC001's
      anti-hypertensive effect is in part due to: 1) a decrease in arginine vasopressin release in
      the blood circulation, increasing diuresis, which reduces the size of body fluid compartment;
      and 2) a reduction in the sympathetic tone, leading to subsequent decreases in vascular
      resistances.

      This study is an open-label, dose-titrating safety and efficacy study of QGC001 administered
      PO, BID, over 8 weeks in hypertensive overweight subjects of multiple ethnic and racial
      groups in the United States.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of twice daily (BID)
      administration of oral (PO) QGC001 (250 mg BID, 500 mg BID, and 500 mg BID +
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg once daily [QD]) on blood pressure (BP) over 8 weeks in
      hypertensive overweight/obese subjects of multiple races/ethnicities.
