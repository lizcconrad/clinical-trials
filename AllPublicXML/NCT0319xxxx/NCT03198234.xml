  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients with hematologic malignancies need a hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) to be cured. Only about 50% of these patients have a fully matched donor,
      the remaining patients will require an HSCT from a mismatched related or unrelated donor.
      Almost 60% of these mismatched donor HSCTs will result in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD),
      which can cause significant morbidity and increased non-relapse mortality. GvHD is caused by
      the donor effector T cells present in the HSC graft that recognize and react against the
      mismatched patient's tissues.

      Researchers and physicians at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford are working to
      prevent GvHD after HSCT with a new clinical trial. The objective of this clinical program is
      to develop a cell therapy to prevent GvHD and induce graft tolerance in patients receiving
      mismatched unmanipulated donor HSCT. The cell therapy consists of a cell preparation from the
      same donor of the HSCT (T-allo10) containing T regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells able to suppress
      allogenic (host-specific) responses, thus decreasing the incidence of GvHD.

      This is the first trial of its kind in pediatric patients and is only available at Lucile
      Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford.

      The purpose of this phase 1 study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a cell
      therapy, T-allo10, to prevent GvHD in patients receiving mismatched related or mismatched
      unrelated unmanipulated donor HSCT for hematologic malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients ages 3-30 years, with hematologic malignancies undergoing mismatched related or
      unrelated donor transplant will receive conditioning chemotherapy with Total body radiation
      and cyclophosphamide, according to the standard procedure.

      The investigators plan to infuse the donor T-allo10 product one day before HSCT so that the
      Tr1 cells contained within the T-allo10 product will be able to prevent anti-host
      alloreactivity of the T cells present within the unmanipulated HSC graft. Indeed, Tr1 cells
      best exert their suppressive activity at the time of effector T cell activation, occurring
      when the T cells present in the HSC graft will be transferred to the patient ; therefore, the
      investigators expect that the early infusion of T-allo10 cells will optimally modulate
      anti-host alloreactivity of the donor T cells and prevent GvHD.

      Immunosuppression will also be administered at the time of HSCT.

      Up to 27 eligible patients will be given the T-allo10 product sequentially in 3 escalating
      dose cohorts to determine the maximum tolerated dose (or the highest dose tested if no
      maximum tolerated dose is reached). Each cohort will begin by evaluating 3 patients. The
      patients in each cohort will be staggered by 28 days and each succeeding patient will be
      enrolled no sooner than the 29 day after the preceding patient's infusion of T-allo10.

        -  If no patient in a cohort develops a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) following infusion of
           the investigational cellular product, the investigators will start enrolling patients at
           the next higher cell dose after completing the 28-day safety evaluation of the 3rd
           patient in the dose cohort.

        -  If one out of 3 patients in a cohort has a DLT, 3 additional patients will be evaluated
           at the same dose level.

        -  If one out of 6 patients experiences a DLT, dose escalation will occur.

        -  If 2 out of ≤ 6 patients experience a DLT, dose escalation will cease and that dose will
           be designated the maximally administered dose.

        -  Up to three (3) additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level if
           only 3 patients were treated previously at that dose
