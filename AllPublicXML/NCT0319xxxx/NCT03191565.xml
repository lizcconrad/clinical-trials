      BACKGROUND: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a serious and debilitating mental
      disease characterized by difficulties with emotion regulation that leads to unstable and
      self- destructive behavior and relationships. The prevalence of BPD is between 1% and 5% in
      the Scandinavian population with similar prevalence rates found in US epidemiologic surveys.
      BPD increases the risk for suicide by 4-fold, while patients with comorbid BDP and tendency
      to self-harm have a further 2-fold attenuated risk. BDP is difficult to treat, and even more
      difficult when co-occurring with other disorders. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is the
      best validated treatment for BPD, showing medium to large effect sizes as compared to
      treatment as usual for anger, parasuicidality (suicide attempts without an intention to die)
      and poor mental health. DBT uses self-monitoring as the mainstay of treatment, which helps
      patients regulate their emotions by means of emotional regulating skills, and reduce problem
      behavior. Self-monitoring has traditionally been done by means of daily paper diaries. The
      latest developments in smartphone applications have generated alternatives for ecological
      momentary assessments of problematic behavior that even prompt patients to practice skills
      targeting emotion regulation. An example of this is Monsenso's DBT self-monitoring mHealth
      application (mHealth means mobile health, public health supported by mobile phones). Such
      applications may enhance treatment success in BPD patients, as they are available to patients
      at all times.

      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the Monsenso's mHealth app with respect to clinical efficacy as an
      adjunct to DBT-psychotherapy treatment and utility as a way to measure outcomes in BPD
      patients.

      METHODS: The study will be a 2-year multi center, randomized controlled trial. In both
      conditions patients will be followed for one year. Self report data of DBT-skills-use,
      positive and negative affect, Standardised self report questionnaires on Emotion regulation
      ability; functioning; borderline symptoms. will be given pre, post and every month. The
      treatment arm (n=50) will receive the mHealth app that includes coaching suggestions and
      instructed how to use it. The control arm (n=50) will only use a pen and paper based
      self-monitoring, as traditionally used in DBT-treatment.

      STUDY ENDPOINTS: Primary: mean number of days passed per new DBT-Skill learned. Secondary:
      Borderline personality disorder(BPD)-symptoms, Emotion regulation ability, ratio
      positive/negative affect.

      BACKGROUND

      Borderline personality disorder

      It is estimated that 1-5% of the Scandinavian population meets the criteria for borderline
      personality disorder (BPD). General consensus regarding estimates for the western world
      population, is that around 1,5% of the population meets criteria for BPD. Lifetime prevalence
      will be estimated as 3 times as high (about 5%). The percentage for clinical populations is
      considerably higher and is estimated to be around 28% (range 9.3 to 46.3 % of patients in
      different current studies) of all psychiatric patients meeting this diagnosis. BDP is
      characterized by an instability across a number of domains: Mood, interpersonal
      relationships, self-image, impulse- and behavioral control. Generally, these BDP
      manifestations are attributed to a lack of ability to emotionally regulate. Patients with BDP
      have a four times increased risk of premature death compared to the general population,
      emphasizing the need for appropriate treatment.

      Treatment of borderline personality disorder

      Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has shown good clinical efficacy and is regarded as one of
      the most well researched evidence-based treatments for BPD. The DBT treatment centers around
      the learning of a predefined set of behavioral skills, targeting lack of emotional, mental
      and behavioral self-control. These skills are trained in group and individual therapy.

      In standard clinical practice, evaluation of a patient's progress in learning skills is left
      to the clinician's subjective memory and evaluation of weekly data.

      Self-monitoring of skill use and accompanying changes in suicidality, self-harm, and
      emotional reactivity have traditionally been done by means of paper diaries. Technological
      advances in self-monitoring might reduce the burden on the patient, increase data quality and
      generate new opportunities for registration (8). Recent studies on pain management have
      suggested that mhealth solutions significantly increase compliance. Studies using electronic
      diaries in the treatment of bipolar disorders, in pain- and weight management, and in
      patients treated with chemo-therapy have also shown promising results. DBT skills have been
      shown to mediate improvements in BPD defining behaviors.

      However, no randomized studies to date have examined if a mobile phone-/mhealth solution
      could speed up the time it takes for patients to assimilate the DBT-skills, while at the same
      time serving the function of filling out diary cards for the treatment of BDP.

      Regarding the time series part of the study, a single pilot study of ecological momentary
      assessment (EMA) has demonstrated significant differences in fluctuations of positive and
      negative affect on a daily basis when comparing major depressive disorder to BPD. Hence, this
      lends promise that a purpose-designed mobile phone application aimed at collecting DBT-diary
      data will produce time-efficient and valid data of higher quality than traditional
      paper-registrations. This will also at the same time generate objective outcome data, thus
      collecting multimodal data. Both self report and passive sensor data. The exact same sensor
      data have been shown to have value in predicting manic episodes in bipolar patients.

      When starting an mhealth-supported session, it is possible to view the EMA data (for content,
      see Table 1), self-rated daily assessments, monthly questionnaires together with the
      therapist. The mDiary system will automatically generate chosen relevant questionnaires at a
      selected ratio, making the research data-collection much easier. The patient and the
      therapist can also get access to phone sensor data, such as activity level, phone use,
      internet use and minutes of communication on phone as well.

      The increased overview provided by diarycard-, sensor- and questionnaire data can also be
      useful when evaluating and discussing patient cases at staff meetings or during therapist
      supervision.

    <description>In this condition the intervention is that participants enter their skills-use and mood on a smartphone. They can follow their progress on graphs on the smartphone, get reminders to train skills, get psychoeducation about what the different emotion regulation coping skills can do, and how to do the skills. therapists can watch patient progress online, and review skill use together with the patients while in psychotherapy. The intervention is using a smartphone as an adjunct to the treatment.</description>
