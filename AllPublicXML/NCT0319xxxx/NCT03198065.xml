  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since Semm et.al. reported the first case of laparoscopic appendectomy in 1983, minimally
      invasive surgery has become the main stay for treating of many surgical diseases. After the
      booming in the advancement of surgical instrument and breakthrough in surgical skills, the
      minimally invasive surgery has been widely applied to neurosurgery, spinal surgery, breast,
      thyroid, hernia surgery, etc. It has been proved that minimally invasive surgery is safe and
      effective, and further it achieves compatible results and outcomes in oncology and functional
      diseases. Minimally invasive surgery in alimentary tract, known as laparoscopic surgery, has
      been performed in gastric surgery (e.g. gastric cancer, tumor, functional disorders and
      bariatric surgery), hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery (e.g. hepatectomy, cholecystectomy,
      and pancreatectomy), and colorectal surgery (e.g. colorectal cancer and functional bowel
      disease). Under a superior heritage of surgical skills from Taiwan university hospital, we
      introduced laparoscopic surgery in 1996 and currently, laparoscopic surgery becomes the
      mainstay of surgery in Yunlin branch. In 2015, there were 600 laparoscopic surgery in our
      hospital, while 150 colorectal laparoscopic surgery in the same year. In recent years,
      single-incisional laparoscopic surgery has emerged to become one of the focused topic in the
      world and seemly in our department. Through single-incision surgery, we attempted to minimize
      the incision wound to achieve better cosmesis and faster recovery. By the valuable clinical
      experiences gathering in our hospital (Yunlin branch) in recent 10 years, we contemplate
      two-step plans: first, by retrospective data collection, we can explain the clinical problems
      based on current statistical results. Second, based on prior (step 1) retrospective findings,
      a prospective study could be conducted for more evident results.

      The aim of this study is to compare two kinds of single-incision laparoscopic surgery setting
      including hand-made glove setting and commercialized single-incision multiport setting. The
      preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data will be collected for analysis.
