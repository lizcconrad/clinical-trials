    <textblock>
      To compare the postoperative analgesic effect and the intensity of motor block in different
      concentration ropivacaine plus fentanyl when used epidurally with a patient-controlled
      analgesia device after Cesarean delivery.

      1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedures are
           undertaken.

        2. All patients were received epidural anesthesia with 2% Lidocaine and patient-controlled
           epidural analgesia (PCEA) for post- operative pain control. PCEA randomly allocated into
           three groups. Group A patients received 0.08% ropivacaine plus 4 mcg /mL fentanyl, Group
           B patients received 0.08% ropivacaine plus 2mcg /mL fentanyl, and Group C patients
           received 0.16 % ropivacaine plus 2 mcg /mL fentanyl. Dermographic data, dosage of PCEA
           during first 48 hours post-operation，NRS scores, patient satisfaction and the intensity
           of motor block will be recorded and analyzed.
