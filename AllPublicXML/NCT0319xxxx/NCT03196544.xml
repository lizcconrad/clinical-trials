  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel transdiagnostic behavioral treatment
      -- social approach training -- intended to enhance positive social connections in individuals
      with elevated anxiety and/or depression. Social relationship impairments are pervasive and
      debilitating consequences of anxiety and depression. Existing treatments have some beneficial
      impact on social functioning; however, many people continue to have few and/or poor quality
      relationships following treatment, even after experiencing symptom relief. This study will
      evaluate the effects of social approach training on the brain systems that have been shown to
      be important for establishing positive connections with others. Approximately 60 individuals
      (ages 18-55) seeking treatment for anxiety or depression will participate in this study.
      Participants will be randomly assigned with equal probability to one of two versions of
      social approach training (5 or 10 sessions) or a waitlist (assessment only) control group.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and post-treatment and compared on measures
      assessing brain responses to social reward (primary outcome), as well as physiological,
      behavioral, and emotional responses to social reward (secondary outcomes). It is hypothesized
      that participants assigned to social approach training will display greater increases from
      pre- to post-treatment in activity in brain systems that regulate the processing of social
      reward (e.g., striatum) relative to participants in the control group. This study will also
      determine whether the 5- vs. 10-session versions of the treatment program result in
      meaningful differences, compared to each other, in how the brain responds to social reward.

             questionnaires, and all other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No telephone or easy access to telephone.

          2. Any substance use disorder in the past year except subjects with mild alcohol,

             12-week stability criteria so that symptom changes as a result of other psychosocial
             treatments are not confounded with changes due to the research.

          9. Inability to complete the initial assessment battery or treatment sessions.

         10. Clinical conditions assessed by the interviewer that necessitate more imminent
             clinical care (e.g., active suicidal ideation): These criteria are in place so
             participants with these other, more several symptoms can be referred for appropriate
             mental health services.
