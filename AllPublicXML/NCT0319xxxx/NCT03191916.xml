      The investigators hypothesize that multi-session anodal tDCS (atDCS) of the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) will induce long-lasting effects in improving cognitive function
      and reducing cognitive fatigue and fatigability in PD patients with MCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after
      Alzheimer's disease) and affects approximately one million people in the United States. Mild
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is very common even in early stages of PD. In addition to
      cognitive impairment, patients with PD also suffer cognitive fatigue (defined as the general
      sensation of difficulty in initiating cognitive activity) and cognitive fatigability (defined
      as &quot;deterioration in the performance of attention tasks over an extended period of time&quot;).
      Cognitive impairment, cognitive fatigue, and cognitive fatigability affect quality of life in
      patient with Parkinson's disease.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive and safe brain stimulation
      technique that has been shown to be effective in improving cognitive function in subjects
      with Parkinson's disease. During tDCS, low-voltage, low amplitude current is passed through a
      pair of surface electrodes placed over the areas of brain of interest.

      The specific aim of this study is to examine if atDCS to LDLPFC at 2 milliamps (mA) for 20
      minutes daily for 5 days will improve cognitive function and reduce cognitive fatigue and
      fatigability in PD patients with MCI. The study will examine if the effects may last for two
      weeks.

    <measure>Change in Reaction Time (RT) on contextual cueing computer task</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes; pre-test during the second research visit, post-test on 6th research visit after 5 consecutive days of tDCS, a follow up test on the 7th research visit, 7 days after last tDCS session and 8th visit 14 days after last tDCS session</time_frame>
    <description>A visual search task will be given in which the participant looks for a T among L's. The contextual cuing task will consist of a practice block and forty test blocks. Eight of the trials in a block will consist of search configurations that repeat from block to block (repeat configurations); the other eight trials in a block will be randomly-generated configurations (new configurations). After the final trial, a recognition task will be presented to determine whether participants realized that repeat configurations were presented (not expected; cueing effects appear to result from implicit learning). Reaction time for each block will be recorded, with cognitive fatigue measured as deterioration of RT over the 40 blocks. This measure of change in RT will be compared across the 4 visits (pre-test, 6th visit, 7th visit, and 8th visit). Improved cognition fatigue based on tDCS treatment would predict reduced change in RT in the later visits compared to the pre-test.</description>

Error rate for each block will be recorded, with cognitive fatigue measured as increased errors over the 40 blocks.

    <description>The Stroop Test is a measure of processing speed, attention, and inhibition. In Stroop A, the participant is required to read color words (e.g., Red, Green, etc.) out loud quickly for 45 seconds. In Stroop B, the participant is required to name ink colors out loud as quickly as possible for 45 seconds. In Stroop C, the participants are required to name the color ink of opposing color words (e.g., the word &quot;blue&quot; written in red ink with the correct response being &quot;red&quot;). Digit Span forward is a measure of simple attention. Participants repeat progressively longer series of numbers until the participant can no longer complete the task. Digit Span Backward is a measure of working memory. The participant repeats back a series of numbers in reverse order. The series length increase until the participant can no longer complete the task.</description>
