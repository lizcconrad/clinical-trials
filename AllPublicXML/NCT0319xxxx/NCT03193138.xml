      Anti-androgenic therapies relying on peripheral and/or central blockade for the treatment of
      prostate cancer seems to have an impact on the cardio-vascular system. This study
      investigates reports of cardiovascular toxicities for treatment including Anatomical
      Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification: sex hormones (G03), hypothalamic hormones (H01C)
      and sex hormones used in treatment of neoplastic diseases (L02) in the French
      pharmacovigilance database and European Clinical Trials (EudraCT) database.

      Hormone replacement therapies and contraceptive pills are responsible of a wide range of
      cardio-vascular side effects, particularly thrombo-embolic disorders and ischemic heart
      disease. The difference of incidence and type of cardio-vascular events between men and women
      are strongly related to sex hormones. Androgenic agonists and antagonists are used in various
      indication including prostate cancer or hormone replacement therapies. This study
      investigates the main characteristics of patients affected by cardiovascular side effects (of
      which ventricular arrhythmia's, QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointe) imputed to drugs
      classified as G03, H01C and L02 according to ATC. A causality assessment according to both
      Begaud's method and the World Health Organization-The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) is
      systematically applied.
