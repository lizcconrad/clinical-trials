  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this research is to develop an efficacious training paradigm to
      enhance older adults' defense mechanisms against falls and possibility reduce healthcare
      cost. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the direct medical cost for
      fall related injuries to be $30 billion annually. Slips and trips combined account for more
      than 50% of the outdoor falls in community-dwelling older adults. These environmental
      perturbations are opposing in nature, with slips mainly resulting in backward falls and trips
      in forward falls. This project explores perturbation training through both slip and trip
      exposure based on the principles of motor learning. The project design consists of a
      randomized controlled trial to examine the ability of the central nervous system to mitigate
      the interference in stability control (if any) that is induced by opposing types of
      perturbations. It also introduces a novel combined slip and trip perturbation training
      paradigm to enhance one's ability to retain and generalize the acquired fall-prevention
      skills to both types of falls. Slips and trips induced on an over ground walkway will be used
      to prepare the motor system to improve stability control and vertical limb support to resist
      falls. The longer-term benefits of such combined perturbation training over exclusive
      slip-only or trip-only perturbation training in reducing both laboratory-induced and real
      life falls will also be assessed. The hypothesis of this study if supported by the results
      will provide an evidence-supported training protocol to reduce the fall-risk among
      community-dwelling older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired or delayed reactive postural responses pose a potential threat to falls while
      walking resulting in slips or trips in older and neurologically impaired individuals.
      Therefore, increase in understanding of postural responses to unexpected external
      perturbation in older adults and people with neurological diseases will lead to development
      of new therapeutic approaches for fall prevention in this population. The overall objective
      of this is to investigate the dynamic stability during slip and trip-like experiences by
      evaluating the efficiency of recovery responses, retention and fall-risk reduction to slips
      or trips induced during normal walking in healthy older adults. Participants will be
      community dwelling ambulatory older adults between the age range of 60 to 90 years. Subjects
      will be screened for the inclusion criteria. Subjects who qualify will go through clinical
      balance assessment and dynamic stability training. The older adults will be divided into any
      of the four groups -1) overground slip only training, 2) overground trip only training, 3)
      overground combined slip + trip training, or 4) control (single slip + single trip). For both
      overground slip/trip, all subjects' normal walking pattern and their recovery responses to
      slip/trip will be recorded with a motion tracking system (including videotaping) while they
      walk across an instrumented area along a straight path in the lab. A slip will be induced
      after a subject steps on a low-friction platform. A trip will be induced by introducing an
      obstacle device while the subject is walking, which consists of a hinged aluminum plate. At
      12 months post-training session, the follow-up stability test will consist only of one slip
      and trip induced on the training side and contralateral side. Incidence of falls and physical
      activity will be monitored between training and re-test sessions through falls and activity
      monitoring-questionnaire to describe details of the falls.

    <description>Perturbation is induced successfully and safely to reproduce inadvertent falls in a protective laboratory environment. Falls will be measured by the amount of body weight supported by the full-body harness system and measured by a load cell attached to this system. Instability of the body's COM and poor limb support prior to touchdown of the recovery step account for 90~100% of subsequent falls (occurring ~500ms later) in both sit-to-stand-slip and in gait-slip, in the laboratory settings. Intervention consists of repeated perturbation training to induce a change in the laboratory induced falls immediately post-training and examine it's retention 12 months after the initial training session.</description>
