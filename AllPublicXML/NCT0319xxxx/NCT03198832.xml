  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease (PD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) have the same inflammatory
      etiopathogenesis and demonstrate a bidirectional relationship, for DM2 affects the severity
      of PD, and this may contribute to the overall inflammatory burden of the individual,
      influencing the natural course DM2. The aim of this study is to establish whether individuals
      with DM with or without chronic periodontitis have an increase in oxLDL and what is the
      influence of periodontal treatment in the reduction of oxLDL with consequent improvement in
      Diabetes Mellitus parameters.

      Periodontal disease (PD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) have the same inflammatory
      etiopathogenesis and demonstrate a bidirectional relationship, for DM2 affects the severity
      of PD, and this may contribute to the overall inflammatory burden of the individual,
      influencing the natural course DM2. The aim of this study is to establish whether individuals
      with DM with or without chronic periodontitis have an increase in oxLDL and what is the
      influence of periodontal treatment in the reduction of oxLDL with consequent improvement in
      Diabetes Mellitus parameters. 44 patients will be divided into 2 groups: Diabetic Patients
      with Chronic Periodontitis (DM2DP) and Diabetic Patients without Chronic Periodontitis (DM2).
      The DM2DP group will receive periodontal debridement and DM2 group will be treated with
      supragingival scaling. Both groups receive board control every 3 months. At baseline, 3 and 6
      months after treatment, will be held making the clinical periodontal parameters (plaque
      index, gingival index, probing depth, gingival recession relative clinical attachment level
      and Periodontal Inflamed Surface Area (PISA) index) and blood collection for assessment serum
      inflammatory markers (oxLDL, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglyceride, Interleukin (IL)
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α) and CRP). Biochemical analyzes will be
      carried out by Z-scan technique. The data obtained before and after periodontal therapy will
      be analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
