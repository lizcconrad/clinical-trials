  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the last stage (stage 5) of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
      Abnormalities of cognitive function and high levels of depression or anxiety incidence are
      characteristic of hemodialysis patients. In this research project, the investigators subject
      in ESRD patients starting hemodialysis as the carrier. Based on the longitudinal research
      design, using multimodal neuroimaging data，combining with the interact relationship between
      changes of brain morphology, the dysfunction of resting-state and-task state with cognitive
      impairment and abnormal emotions.Establish brain structure-function change model associated
      with dialysis progression, Explore imaging markers of central and disease development
      characteristics in ESRD patients. the investigators attempt to clarify the core mechanism of
      kidney-brain axis damage, thus provide evidence for early cognitive-behavioral therapy to CKD
      patient.
