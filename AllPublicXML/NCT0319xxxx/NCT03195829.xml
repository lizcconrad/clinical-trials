    <textblock>
      Involvement in social and leisure activities has been associated with a decreased risk of
      dementia in the elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is a crucial phase to
      prevent the worsening of cognitive decline in elderly at risk to develop dementia. These last
      years, the use of computerized training programs to enhance cognitive functioning showed
      positive and promising results. However, the effects on psychosocial factors still poorly
      documented in cognitive interventions in MCI. It seems essential to promote these factors
      involving social ties, group dynamic, the motivation, as factors that can contribute to
      enhance social life and cognitive functioning.

      This feasibility study evaluated a computer-based cognitive stimulation in elderly with MCI
      and explore the effects on cognitive and psychosocial components.
