  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a newly formulated
      foaming gel product on gingivitis and/or moderate periodontitis when used with or without the
      GLO Science accelerating device (GLO Device), compared to standard tooth brushing with
      antioxidant whitening toothpaste with or without flossing (split mouth design for control
      group).

      This is a 60-day randomized single blinded parallel group study. After 42 days, all use of
      interventional products were discontinued, and the participants returned to the clinical
      center at day 60 for final measurements. The primary outcomes assessed in this study were the
      differences in gingival index (GI) and bleeding on probing (BOP) from baseline to 42 &amp; 60
      days. The secondary outcomes are tooth whitening, oral malodor, pocket depth and plaque
      amount.

      It is hypothesized that participants using the gingival health product with the GLO Device
      will experience greater reductions in GI &amp; BOP measurements than the control group, as well
      as participants using the gingival health product on a toothbrush alone.
