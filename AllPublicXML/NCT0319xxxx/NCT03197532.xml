    <textblock>
      Women of late to mid reproductive age may participate in a study using novel methodology to
      identify subtle changes in the reproductive endocrine axis via daily urine hormone analysis,
      which may have important implications for reproduction and may signal reproductive
      senescence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with a reduced follicular pool either from natural aging or previous chemotherapy, may
      not have any clinical signs or symptoms and traditional measures of ovarian reserve, such as
      basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone may be within the normal range. However, there may be
      alterations in the luteal or follicular phases(shortened follicular phase and luteal
      insufficiency) due to compromised follicle competency and alterations in the H-P-O axis.
      Therefore this aim uses novel methodology to identify subtle changes in the reproductive
      endocrine axis which may have important implications for reproduction and may signal
      reproductive senescence. Compared to yearly follicular measures of reproductive hormones,
      daily urine hormone analysis provides a more integrative assessment.

      Three groups of subjects will be recruited:

      Group 1: Otherwise healthy, mid-reproductive aged women between the ages of 20 and 35 years
      previously exposed to high dose alkylating agent therapy (or have an alkylator score of 1 or
      more), and at least 1 year from cancer treatment.

      Group 2: healthy, mid-reproductive aged women between the ages of 20 to 35 who have not been
      exposed to cancer therapy.

      Group 3: healthy, late reproductive aged women between the ages of 43-50 who have not been
      exposed to cancer therapy, nor have a history of infertility.

      Subjects in all groups must have regular menstrual cycles every 21-35 days, and have a uterus
      and both ovaries. Each participant will complete daily urinary collections for 2 menstrual
      cycles to assess reproductive hormones. The ultimate goal of this work is to better estimate
      the reproductive window, or time to menopause.

    <description>Participants will be provided with calendars on which to record detailed menstrual cycle information during the study. The total menstrual cycle length will be defined as the number of days from day 1 of menses to the day before the next menses. The Kassam method will be used to determine evidence of luteal activity, presumably ovulation. Follicular phase will be defined as the number of days from day 1 of menses up to the day of luteal transition and the luteal phase length will be defined as the number of days beginning from the day after the day of luteal transition to the day before the next menses.</description>
