  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to conduct a dietary intervention for overweight (body maas
      index BMI≥25) and obese (BMI≥30) pregnant women in two maternity care clinics and explore the
      effect of the intervention on gestational weight gain and the prevalence of gestational
      diabetes between the intervention and control groups.

    <textblock>
      Half of the women are allocated to the intervention group and another half for the control
      group. The intervention group will get written material of healthy diet during pregnancy as
      well as emphasized nutritional guidance given by public health nurses at each visit in the
      maternity care clinic. There will also be two group meetings with a dietitian. The control
      group will get the same written material, but otherwise basic care and guidance at each visit
      in the maternity care clinics. The collected data of both groups include the information on
      weight gain, the result of an oral glucose tolerance test and 4 day food records, Three
      factor eating questionnaire (TFEQ R-18) and Binge Eating Scale (BES).
