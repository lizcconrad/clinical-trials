  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to analyze the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on knee osteoarthritis.
      Eligible patients will undertake arthroscopic knee surgery plus intraoperative PRP and also
      receive second look surgery and intraoperative biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease defined by progressive degradation of the joint as well
      as loss of cartilage on joint surfaces. The degeneration that occurs in the joint leads to
      changes in the catabolic and anabolic activity of chondrocytes. Osteoarthritis may induce
      pain, stiffness and limitation in range of motion of the joint and also may impact the
      quality of life. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a fraction of plasma that contains platelets
      and multiple growth factors concentrated at high level. Because activated platelets have the
      potential to release growth factors, PRP has been clinically used to accelerate wound healing
      and tissue regeneration in orthopedic and oral surgery. Although several studies have
      assessed the effects of PRP on knee osteoarthritis, a higher level of evidence has not been
      provided. This study aimed to analyze the effect of PRP on knee osteoarthritis. After
      performing arthroscopic knee surgery plus intraoperative PRP in eligible patients, a second
      look arthroscopic surgery with intraoperative biopsy will be arranged 6 months later. Pre-
      and post-operative imaging and clinical outcomes will also be compared.
