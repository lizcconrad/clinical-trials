  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well epacadostat and pembrolizumab work in treating patients
      with gastroesophageal junction or gastric cancer that has spread to other parts of the body
      and cannot be removed by surgery. Epacadostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving epacadostat and
      pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with gastroesophageal junction or gastric
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess 6-month progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate objective response rate (RR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS). III. To assess the safety and tolerability of
      epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the responder rate defined as the proportion of subjects with an increased
      ratio of CD8+ to Treg cells in on-treatment compared with pre-treatment biopsies.

      II. To identify putative immunologic biomarkers of tumor response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive epacadostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 9 weeks for
      18 months, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

    <description>The clinical laboratory data will be analyzed using summary statistics (e.g., means and frequencies), and no formal statistical comparisons among the treatments are planned. In addition, distributions of key laboratory parameters (including hemoglobin, neutrophils, and platelets) will be plotted over time; these values will also be classified into Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity grades and tabulated.

    <description>Adverse events will be coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities tabulated by preferred term and system organ class for all events, related events, and events &gt;= grade 3. Severity of adverse events will be based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.03 scale as indicated.

    <description>Time-to-event data will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, treating subjects with no observed death or progression as censored at their last date known to be alive. For the overall survival analysis, the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the survival time distribution and the median survival.</description>

    <description>The 95% exact confidence interval for the response rate will be estimated using the Clopper-Pearson method. For objective responders, the duration of response is the time from the first objective response contributing to an objective response, to the first objective response of progressive disease (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) occurring after the first objective response contributing to the objective response.</description>
