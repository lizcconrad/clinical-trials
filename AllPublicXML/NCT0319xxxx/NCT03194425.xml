    <textblock>
      Retrospective case-control study.

      A substantial number of patients do not respond favourably to sacral neurostimulation (SNS)
      although clinically, they appear to have the same lower urinary tract dysfunction
      characteristics as the ones with good responses. This may be due to methodological issues
      (lead position) or patient selection. The purpose of this study is to improve and standardize
      lead position, in order to increase the patient response to test stimulation and to SNS
      treatment, and to decrease adverse events.

          1. Male or female aged ≥18 years and competent to provide consent

          2. Minimum 3 months of self-reported OAB symptoms or self-reported obstructive LUTS in
             addition to confirmed non-obstructive urinary retention on UDO

          3. Failed, or are not a candidate for more conservative treatment (i.e., pelvic floor
             training, biofeedback, behavioral modification, oral pharmacotherapy)

          4. Willing to discontinue OAB medications for 2 weeks prior to the implant and for the
             entire study period

          5. Able to thoroughly fill in all questionnaires, voiding diaries and office visits for
             device programming and clinical evaluations before the TLP, 3 weeks after TLP and 6
             weeks, 6 months and 1 year after implantation of definitive IPG.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current of prior evidence of primary stress incontinence or mixed incontinence where
             the stress component overrides the urgency component

          2. Any neurological condition that may interfere with normal bladder function, including
             stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, clinically significant peripheral
             neuropathy, or spinal cord injury (e.g., paraplegia)

          3. Urinary tract mechanical obstruction including but not limited to Benign Prostatic
             Hyperplasia (BPH)

          4. Treatment of bladder or pelvic floor dysfunction with botulinum toxin (Botox ®) or
             surgery in past 12 months

          5. Unable to toilet self and have and maintain good personal hygiene

          6. Unable to provide clear, thoughtful responses to questions and questionnaires

          7. Urinary tract, bladder or vaginal infection or inflammation

          8. Hematuria, and absence of an elaborate diagnostic work-up

          9. Severe or uncontrolled diabetes (A1C &gt; 8, documented in the last 3 months) or diabetes
             with peripheral nerve involvement

         10. Allergy to local anesthetic or adhesives

         11. Bleeding disorder or on an anticoagulant that cannot be stopped for 3 days before the
             implant

         12. Pregnant, lactating, planning to become pregnant, given birth in the past 12 months,
             or female of child-bearing potential and not practicing a medically-approved method of
             birth control

         13. Skin lesions or compromised skin at the implant or stimulation site

         14. Use of investigational drug or device therapy or participation in any study involving
             or impacting gynecologic, urinary or renal function within past 4 weeks

         15. Passive implants (e.g., prostheses) are allowed, but no implanted metal should be at
             the Neurostimulator implant site

         16. Knowledge of planned MRIs, diathermy, or high output ultrasonic exposure

         17. Presence of a documented condition or abnormality that could compromise the safety of
             the patient

         18. Any psychiatric or personality disorder at the discretion of the study physician

         19. Interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome as defined by the EAU guidelines
