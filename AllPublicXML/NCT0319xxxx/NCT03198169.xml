  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part pilot study to determine the clinical effectiveness of two new antimicrobial
      products on the complete healing of chronic wounds.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of this study will involve 5 patients with qualified chronic wounds which will receive
      active treatment with both the Atteris Antimicrobial Skin and Wound Cleanser (AWC) and the
      Atteris Antimicrobial Barrier Film Dressing (ABFD) for a 6-week period with a 12 week
      follow-up in order to optimize the final study application protocols. Part 2 of this study is
      a randomized, double blind, 2 by 2 factorial, controlled study comparing the AWC and/or the
      ABFD with 100 research subjects and n=25 subjects per cell. Patients will be randomized to
      receive either active AWC and active ABFD, or active AWD and placebo ABFD, or placebo AWC and
      active ABFC, or AWC placebo and ABFD placebo in addition to standard of care (SOC). The
      active AWC active ABFD versus AWC placebo ABFD placebo statistical contrast will be of most
      importance and the clinical expectation is wounds treated with the active forms of these
      products will heal faster than wounds treated with double placebo and this will additionally
      provide data to power a future definitive study to compare the healing potential of the two
      therapeutic modalities (AWC, ABFD).
