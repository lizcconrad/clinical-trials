  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was the development, and testing of a HF application that was used
      to provide self-care support to HF patients through a smartphone device. The study appraised
      current available literature on HF to determine best practices for promoting self-care of HF
      through direct communication with individuals with HF living at home. For the purpose of this
      study, smart phone communication was utilized. Smart phone applications allow patients to
      transmit physiological data, such as weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptom data to
      healthcare providers. Using a secure website, a healthcare worker can access the information
      and contact the patient via the mobile phone when their data is out of normal range. This
      study was novel in its approach from what is traditionally offered in that it supported
      patient self-care decisions by promoting symptom monitoring and offered both tactical and
      situational skills strategies through at the point education.
