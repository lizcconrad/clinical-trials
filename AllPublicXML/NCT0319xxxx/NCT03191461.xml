  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional pilot study. The investigators seek to obtain early information
      pertaining to the relationship between measurements of myocardial perfusion reserve and
      myocardial fibrosis after receipt of Anthracycline-based chemotherapy (â‰¥2 years prior).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this cross-sectional pilot study is to determine the myocardial
      perfusion reserve index (MPRI) in cancer survivors treated with anthracycline chemotherapy
      relative to similarly aged healthy comparators without a history of cancer treatment.
      Hypothesis: Cancer survivors treated with anthracycline chemotherapy will have a lower MPRI
      than similarly aged healthy comparators without a history of cancer treatment.The secondary
      objective of this cross-sectional pilot study is to determine if MPRI is associated with
      myocardial fibrosis measured non-invasively with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.
      Hypothesis: MPRI will be inversely associated with fibrosis burden

      Study participants will be consented with pre-study data collection recorded. No
      randomization will occur as this is a cross-sectional study. Participants in both the cancer
      survivor and control groups will complete one study visit. No follow-up will be completed.

    <measure>Myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>During Adenosine Stress Test</time_frame>
    <description>The myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI) will be measured noninvasively with adenosine stress CMR imaging after dual-bolus first-pass perfusion with gadolinium contrast. The slope of the myocardial signal intensity curve is computed and normalized by the slope of the blood pool signal intensity curve for both rest and stress. MPRI is calculated as the ratio of the stress slope divided by the rest slope.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Myocardial fibrosis quantification using Myocardial T1</measure>
    <time_frame>During Adenosine Stress Test</time_frame>
    <description>Measured noninvasively with CMR imaging. For myocardial fibrosis quantification with T1 endocardial and epicardial contours are drawn to delineate the myocardium; mean T1 (pre- and post-contrast) is calculated from the pixels within the myocardium. Expected range of T1 is 900-1250ms with higher T1 values considered a worsened outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Myocardial fibrosis quantification using extracellular volume (ECV)</measure>
    <time_frame>During Adenosine Stress Test</time_frame>
    <description>Measured noninvasively with CMR imaging. The ECV is calculated from the mean myocardial T1 and LV blood T1 pre- and post-contrast. Expected range of ECV is 20-40% with higher ECV values representing a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a contrasted adenosine stress CMR examination on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA) dedicated to cardiovascular imaging. Adenosine stress was selected due to attenuated endothelium dependent and -independent vasodilation after doxorubicin receipt in humans to allow the investigators to understand the potential effect of perivascular fibrosis on perfusion reserve. Standardized CMR protocols will be performed to measure LV volumes (to assess wall motion abnormalities and identify any potential myocardial dysfunction), Native T1, ECV, and myocardial perfusion reserve in the short-axis plane</description>

        The investigators will enroll 10 eligible and consenting men and women aged 21-85 years who
        either currently have or have had cancer who began their cancer treatment at least 2 years
        prior to this study and have received anthracycline based chemotherapy. The investigators
        will enroll an additional group of 6 men and women without cancer or a prior history of a
        cardiovascular event, matched to 5-year age range with our post-cancer treatment
        participants

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria :

          1. Cancer patients must have Stage I-III breast cancer or lymphoma and have received an
             anthracycline agent during treatment at least 2 years prior to enrollment in this
             study.

          2. Age-matched to cancer survivor with no history of cancer or anthracycline treatment.

          3. Age 21-85 years of age at the time of enrollment.

          4. ECOG or Karnofsky performance status of 0-1.

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          6. Enrolled control participants must have normal creatinine clearance of &gt;60 mL/min/1.73
             m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an IRB-approved informed consent
             document (either directly or via a legally authorized representative).

        Exclusion Criteria :

          1. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to gadolinium contrast agents or adenosine or history of kidney disease.

          2. Those with contraindications for MRI such as ferromagnetic cerebral aneurysm clips or
             other intracranial metal, pacemakers, defibrillators, functioning neurostimulator
             devices or other implanted electronic devices.

          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          4. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the use of gadolinium in cardiac
             MRI imaging may not be safe in pregnant women. Because some methods of birth control
             are not 100% reliable, a pregnancy test is required if the participant is a) a
             sexually active woman of childbearing potential or b) a sexually active peri or
             post-menopausal women whose last normal menstrual period was less than 12 months ago.

          5. Coronary revascularization in the past 6 months or known severe multi-vessel CAD
             previously determined to be not amendable to mechanical intervention.

          6. Ongoing, unrelieved symptoms thought to represent cardiac ischemia and requiring
             immediate cardiac catheterization

          7. History of COPD or asthma
