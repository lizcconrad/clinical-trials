  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of tinted filters and illumination on the visual performance of patients with low
      vision (i.e., individuals with reduced vision that is uncorrectable with glasses, surgery or
      treatments) has been a topic of research and discussion for many years, yet there is no
      current consensus or practice standard for the evaluation and recommendation of colored
      filters and/or illumination intensity. Anecdotally, there have been many subjective reports
      of improvement in visual function and comfort with the use of tinted lenses. Previous studies
      have attempted to elucidate the subjective improvements observed using vision tests, such as
      visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, and the findings have been inconsistent.
      Traditionally, filters and optimal illumination are prescribed clinically through a trial and
      error method, which involves trying various filters and lamps haphazardly to determine which
      if any are preferred by the patient. The investigators are proposing to evaluate whether the
      illumination and filters chosen in office by participants using a new assessment tool the
      LuxIQ/2 translate to overall patient comfort and improved speed, accuracy and print size
      while reading, and to evaluate whether participants have the same illumination and colored
      filter preference determined by the LuxIQ/2 in a clinical office setting and in their home
      environment.
