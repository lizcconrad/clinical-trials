  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a survey to examine relationships between culture, race, and ethnicity
      with treatment preferences and perceptions for acne vulgaris.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how explanatory models, perceptions, and treatment
      preferences of acne vulgaris vary across different cultures and racial and ethnic
      backgrounds. This study will also use Willingness to Pay to investigate differences in
      treatment valuation. Clarifying these differences will better inform patient counseling and
      treatment adherence by improving the quality of shared decision making.
