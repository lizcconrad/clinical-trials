  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Zip-009 clinical investigation will enroll 26 paediatric subjects requiring laceration
      repair and fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the clinical investigation. The
      investigation is designed to evaluate the time and cost savings and the satisfaction and
      outcomes of the Zip 4 device compared to conventional sutures. The subjects will be randomly
      assigned at a 1:1 ratio to either the Zip 4 Surgical Skin Closure Device group or the
      Standard of Care sutures group. The investigation consists of one screening/baseline visits
      at day 0 where the subject will be treated with either the Zip device or sutures, and
      thereafter two follow up telephone calls at day 10 and day 30. The Zip device/sutures will be
      removed prior the first follow up call day 10. The duration of the investigation is estimated
      to 5 months, including a 4-month recruitment period and 1-month follow up period.

    <description>The primary endpoint in this clinical investigation is the mean difference in time to wound closure, for the two treatment methods used. These include total treatment time and duration of period starting from the preparation of procedure until protective wound dressing is applied, and including whether or not anesthesia and/or sedation was used when comparing the Zip 4 Surgical Skin Closure Device and the standard of care closure suturing.</description>
