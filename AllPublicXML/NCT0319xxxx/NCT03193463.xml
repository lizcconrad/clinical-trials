  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with topotecan by an alternative
      method, direct delivery into brain tumors, is safe and well tolerated. The Cleveland
      Multiport Catheter is a new, investigational device that will be used to deliver topotecan
      into your brain tumor. A second purpose of this study is to determine whether the Cleveland
      Multiport Catheter can be used effectively and safely to deliver topotecan into your brain
      tumor.

      This study will also determine the best dose of topotecan to deliver to your tumor with use
      of the Cleveland Multiport Catheter and will also examine how your tumor responds to
      treatment with topotecan.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To investigate by MR imaging the spatial and temporal distribution of topotecan in
           enhancing or nonenhancing bulk tumor administered by convection-enhanced delivery (CED)
           in patients with recurrent/progressive WHO grade III or IV (high grade) glioma (HGG) who
           have failed standard therapy comprising surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant
           chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

        -  To investigate by MR imaging the influence of the rate and topotecan concentration, on
           the spatial and temporal distribution of topotecan administered by CED in patients with
           with recurrent/progressive HGG

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To investigate the extent to which backflow may be observed on MRI during CEDmediated
           delivery of topotecan

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity profile of topotecan administered by CED
           using different doses and infusion rates.

        -  To observe evidence of activity of single-agent topotecan administered by CED to
           patients with recurrent/progressive HGG who have failed standard therapy comprising
           surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

    <description>Only 1 Cleveland Multiport Catheter (CMC) will be placed and CED will be performed intra-operatively only in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipped Operating Room. Topotecan infusion will be performed over a 4-hour period, with the goal of complete tumor coverage. The initial rate will be 1.20 ml/hour and infusion will be monitored by intermittent MRI imaging. The rate may be adjusted upwards during the infusion, in the event of incomplete tumor coverage, or downwards, if new mass effect is apparent. Following completion of the 4-hour infusion, the CMC will be removed. The initial rate for each subsequent patient may be adjusted upwards in increments of up to 1.20 ml/hour based upon the tumor coverage and safety characteristics of the previously treated patients.</description>

    <description>2 Cleveland Multiport Catheter (CMCs) will be placed and the total infusion rate of Topotecan per CMC to be used for the first 24 hours for the first patient will be 0.834 ml/hour (3.48 microliters/minute/microcatheter). The rate used for the second 24 hours of the infusion will be 1.668 ml/hour. If the first patient does not experience rate-limiting toxicity, then the patient #2's initial infusion rate will start at the highest tolerated rate for patient #1, and the second 24-hour rate for that patient will be increased by 0.834 ml/hour. Each subsequent patient will undergo rate escalation in a similar manner until we observe either: 1) complete coverage of the enhancing tumor by the infused Gadopentetic acid (Gd-DTPA), or 2) rate-limiting toxicity.</description>

If the first patient does not experience rate-limiting toxicity, then the patient #2's initial infusion rate will start at the highest tolerated rate for patient #1, and the second 24-hour rate for that patient will be increased by 0.29 ml/hour. Each subsequent patient will undergo rate escalation in a similar manner until we observe either: 1) complete coverage of the non-enhancing tumor by the infused Gd-DTPA, or 2) rate-limiting toxicity.</description>
