  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellar tendinopathy is characterized by anterior pain in the knee, due to the great demand
      imposed on the extensor mechanism of the knee. Evidence shows that the most appropriate
      treatment for this condition is the conservative treatment, through strengthening with
      eccentric exercises. However, a recent editorial proposes a new treatment protocol based on
      concentric and eccentric exercises, with the initial prescription of isometric exercises. The
      hypothesis of this study is that the protocol is as good as the eccentric exercises,
      generating less pain.

    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot; The participant will classify his average pain in the last 7 days.</description>

    <measure>Functional capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>VISA-P questionnaire assesses the symptoms and disability of patients with patellar tendinopathy. It is a questionnaire with eight questions, six of them on a Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 10 points, where 0 represents the maximum severity of the disease and 10 represents no pain or limitation. Question 7 has four possible answers (0, 4, 7 and 10 points). Question 8 has a subdivision (8A, 8B and 8C), in which only one can be answered, depending on the perception of pain during sport activities, varying up to 30 points. The total score of the questionnaire varies between 0 and 100 points, with 100 points corresponding to the absence of pain or disability.</description>

    <measure>Pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will perform 10 repetitions of the complete unipodal squat on an inclined plane and sequentially will be placed on a stretcher lying comfortably with the knee flexed at 20 degrees. The patient should indicate the point of greatest pain in the tendon, which will be marked to be the location of the tip of the algometer, and the distance to the apex of the patella will be measured to use the same point in the assessment after treatment. If the patient does not present pain in the assessment after treatment, the point standardized in the initial evaluation will be used. If the patient still presents pain, the point of greatest pain will be evaluated. For measurement, pressure will be applied until the patient experiences a mild pain sensation (pain level 1), when he will be instructed to press the algometer button to stop the test.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Eccentric</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients allocated in this group will perform three sets of 15 unipodal squats with the affected limb on an inclined plane. The patient will be instructed to perform only the eccentric phase of the exercise, keeping the torso erect and flexing the knee up to 90 degrees. The return to the initial position will be performed with the unaffected leg. To increase exercise load, the patient will carry a bag with washers. This protocol will last eight weeks, with 24 face-to-face sessions.
Both groups will also receive a protocol with complementary isotonic exercises, focusing on the strengthening of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, hamstrings and calves.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Modified protocol</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients allocated in this group will receive treatment based on a protocol published in a clinical practice guide, with modifications to make the protocol more pragmatic. Thus, the use of mechanotherapy devices will be replaced by free weight exercises, so that the protocol can be performed in environments that do not offer this type of machinery. This protocol is composed of four exercise stages, being the first three stages performed in the presence of the physiotherapist, and will last eight weeks with approximately 24 face-to-face sessions.
Both groups will receive a protocol with complementary isotonic exercises, focusing on the strengthening of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, hamstrings and calves.</description>
