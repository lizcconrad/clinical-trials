  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety/toxicity and potential anti-tumor activity of sequential
      administration of nivolumab and escalating doses of the mTOR inhibitor ABI-009 in advanced
      UPS, LPS, CS, OS and Ewing sarcoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of ABI-009,
      an mTOR inhibitor, when given sequentially with nivolumab in advanced UPS, LPS, CS, OS and
      Ewing sarcoma.

      The secondary objectives are to investigate the disease control rate (DCR) and progression
      free survival (PFS) using nivolumab/ABI-009 combination therapy in advanced UPS, LPS, CS, OS
      and Ewing sarcoma.

      The exploratory objectives are (1) To correlate progression free survival (PFS) based on
      Immune-related Response Criteria (irRECIST) with that based on RECIST v1.1, and (2) To
      correlate PFS with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in patients' tumors.

    <description>This is an open label, dose-seeking phase 1b study using a defined dose of nivolumab and escalating doses of Nab-Rapamycin (ABI-009) given intravenously.
I. Dose Escalation Phase 1 Part of Study: The study will employ the standard &quot;cohort of three&quot; design. No intra-patient dose escalation will take place.
II. Expansion Phase 1b Part of Study: Following dose escalation, an additional 22-28 patients will receive ABI-009 at the MTD and defined doses of nivolumab to assess overall safety and potential efficacy in a greater number of patients. Patients in the expansion phase of the study may continue treatment up to 18 three-week cycles or until significant disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</description>
