  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-concept study evaluates ALLOD-2 for the prevention of episodic migraine.

      The investigational product (ALLOD-2), is a combination of two marketed drugs. Both drugs are
      used at much lower doses than the doses used for the approved indications.

      The combination is a First-in-Class drug due to its new and unique mechanism of action.

      The study consists of three study periods: a 4-week baseline period, a 12-week double blind
      treatment period, and 4-week post-treatment follow-up period.
