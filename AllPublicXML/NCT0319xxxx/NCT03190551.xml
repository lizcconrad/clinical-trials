      The primary aim of this study is to compare needle shaft visibility between the
      retroclavicular approach and costoclavicular approach for infraclavicular brachial plexus
      block in patients undergoing elective upper limb surgery. Secondary aim is to investigate the
      differences between the two groups in sensorial block success rate, block performance time,
      block performance related pain, motor block success rate, surgical success rate,
      complications, patient satisfaction, use of supplemental local anesthetic, use of analgesic.

      Infraclavicular blocks are performed with different approaches. This study evaluated the
      effectiveness, safety and feasibility of a retroclavicular brachial plexus block as compared
      with costoclavicular approach for infraclavicular brachial plexus block. 60 patients
      scheduled for elective upper limb surgery were recruited and randomized into two groups:
      Retroclavicular approach for infraclavicular block (Group I), costoclavicular approach for
      infraclavicular block (Group R). Sensory block, adverse effects and complications were
      evaluated and recorded every 5 minutes until 30 min after local anesthetic injection. Success
      rate of each nerve sensory block, complications, rate of satisfaction, rate of failure and
      incidence rate of adverse effects, the needle shaft visibility, procedure time,duration of
      the block's effect, use of supplemental local anesthetic, use of analgesic are compared with
      both groups.
