  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A correlation between the bispectral index values and electroencephalographic patterns at the
      loss of consciousness (LOC) when using propofol in elderly patients, has not been determined.

      Our aim is to describe the BIS values and the power of the alpha band in the
      electroencephalography in elderly patients, at the LOC moment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propofol is an anesthetic drug regularly used in elderly patients requiring anesthesia. The
      electroencephalographic pattern recognized when propofol is administered, is different to the
      pattern obtained in younger patients. Both groups presents an alpha and slow bands, but they
      differ in the intensity of the signal. Younger patients presents more intense
      electroencephalographic bands than older patients.

      Bispectral index (BIS) is a clinical indicator used to evaluate the depth of anesthesia. A
      correlation between this indicator and the power of electroencephalographic bands has not
      been determined.

      We will describe the LOC moment of elderly patients receiving propofol as anesthetic for
      general surgery, with the EEG characteristic bands and the BIS value obtained at that moment.
      The BIS values related to the EEG characteristic bands can be described, to correlate the
      actual indicators of depth of anesthesia with new parameters.

        Elderly patients scheduled for surgery are an understudied population. Incidence of
        postoperative delirium and other complications can be related to changes in cerebral
        dynamics under anesthesia, with effects observed even after the use of anesthetics agents.

        To characterize changes in EEG patterns under the induction of anesthesia, can give new
        information to understand the physiology of the elderly brain under anesthesia.
