  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this research will be to define some of the mechanisms underlying the
      progression and complications of heart failure (HF) with preserved left ventricular ejection
      fraction (HFPEF) Aim 1: to evaluate the differences in cardiac structure, function and
      fibrosis markers through the spectrum of HF stages in order to deepen the understanding of
      the pathophysiology driving HF progression.

      Aim 2: to define the mechanisms by which HF risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes,
      obesity, and renal insufficiency, interact with age to increase HF risk, and to evaluate the
      role of precipitating factors such as myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation in HFPEF.

      Aim 3: to determine prognostic factors in HFPEF patients, by following these patients over
      time. Accordingly the investigators will correlate baseline data (echocardiographic, MRI or
      biomarkers) with incident cardiovascular events and determine whether these measures provide
      incremental prognostic information beyond clinical characteristics.

    <description>We intend to recruit consecutive patients admitted for HFPEF in our institution during the next 4 years. Eligible patients include those with age ≥50 years, LVEF ≥45%, symptomatic HF, and either a hospitalization for HF within the prior year or an elevated natriuretic peptide level (BNP ≥100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥360 pg/mL) within the 60 days before inclusion.

    <description>We plan to recruit 10 per decade of age. These subjects will allow us to evaluate the effects of age on the parameters of our study. They will have no risk factors, a normal ECG at rest and normal heart ultrasound and no abnormalities on a stress test.
