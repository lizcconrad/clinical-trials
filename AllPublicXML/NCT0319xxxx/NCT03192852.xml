  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to evaluate colorimetric changes after supervised whitening treatment, using Violet
      LED light associated or not with carbamide peroxide 35% gel. 80 will be divided into: Group 1
      - Violet LED light, Group 2 Violet LED light + carbamide peroxide 35% gel, Group 3 -hydrogen
      peroxide 35% and Group 4 will be submitted to the gingivoplasty surgery procedure, for
      aesthetic desire, after whitening treatment with Violet LED light without gel. The
      colorimetric changes will be measured before, right after each whitening session in the end
      of the period of 3 months, through the Vitapan Classical (Vita) color scale, and by digital
      spectrophotometer. The sensibility degree will be measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
      . The gum tissues Group 4, will be analyzed by histomorphometrically. Quality of life will be
      evaluated.

      This randomized, blind controlled trial has the objective of evaluate colorimetric changes
      after supervised whitening treatment, in-office, using Violet LED light of 405 nm associated
      or not to the use of carbamide peroxide 35% gel. Eighty patients, of which 20 with aesthetics
      desires to be submitted to gingivoplasty surgery, will be divided into four groups. Group 1
      will receive whitening only with Violet LED light (405 nm). Group 2 will receive a whitening
      treatment combination of Violet LED light with carbamide peroxide 35% gel. Patients of Group
      3 will receive a whitening treatment with hydrogen peroxide 35% and Group 4 will be submitted
      to the gingivoplasty surgery procedure, for aesthetic desire, after whitening treatment with
      Violet LED light (405 nm) without gel. The colorimetric changes will be measured before,
      right after each whitening session in the end of the period of 3 months, through the Vitapan
      Classical (Vita) color scale, and by digital spectrophotometer (SpectroShade™ Micro MHT Optic
      Research). The sensibility degree will be measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in each
      session and in all groups. The gum tissues removed during the gingivoplasty in Group 4, will
      be histomorphometric analyzed to measure possible inflammatory gum changes by the Violet LED
      light (405 nm) irradiation. The degree of satisfaction of the patient and the life quality
      after aesthetic result achieved will be evaluated. The results will be presented by means and
      standard deviation. After checking the normality of the data, a one-way ANOVA will be
      performed. In case the data do not follow a normal distribution, it will be utilized the
      Kruskal-Wallis test and a value of p &lt;0.05.
