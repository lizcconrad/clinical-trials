    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well electronic patient reported outcomes work in
      measuring health-related quality of life in patients with stage I-IV prostate cancer
      undergoing treatment. Using a smartphone application to measure and monitor symptoms before,
      during, and after treatment may help patients better detect, understand, and manage their
      health.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the feasibility of collecting electronic patient-reported outcome data using
      validated health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment tools at baseline, during, and
      after treatment through a smartphone application in adult men throughout their course of
      treatment for prostate cancer.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility defined as satisfactory completion (60%) of weekly questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of satisfactory completion will be estimated along with a one-sided exact 95% confidence interval. The method will be considered feasible if the lower bound of the confidence interval is above 0.7 or, equivalently, if at least 49/60 (82%) of participants have satisfactory completion. Rates of completion may be estimated by levels of baseline demographic or clinical characteristics.</description>

    <description>Patients complete questionnaires over 15 minutes once a week over 3 months via a smartphone application. Patients rate urinary function, bowel habits, sexual function, hormonal function, and overall satisfaction. Patients with advanced disease also answer questions related to pain, fatigue/lack of energy, weight loss, and worry domains.</description>
