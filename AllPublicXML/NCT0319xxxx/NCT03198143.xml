  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of the &quot;hunger hormone&quot; ghrelin on human decision-making.
      Participants will be given an injection of ghrelin or saline on different study days and will
      then be asked to make a series of computer-based decisions. The investigators hypothesize
      that ghrelin will increase participant's preference for energy-dense foods and will also
      increase impulsiveness in decision making.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ghrelin is a hormone made by the stomach that stimulates hunger and feeding behavior. How
      ghrelin affects human decision-making is poorly understood. This study will investigate the
      effect of ghrelin on nutrition-related and time-based decisions in humans. Participants eye
      movements will be tracked by a computer during the decision-making process.
