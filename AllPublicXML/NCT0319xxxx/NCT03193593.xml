          7. Women of childbearing potential agreeing to use either:

               1. a highly effective method of contraception with failures rates less than 1% per
                  year such as implant, intrauterine device (IUD), or confirmed sterilization and
                  sterilization procedure at least 3 months prior to the day of dosing

               2. dual methods of contraception with overall failures rate less than 1% per year
                  such as injectable, pill, patch, ring, and diaphragm from the day of dosing for 3
                  months (subjects using oral contraception must have initiated treatment at least
                  2 months prior to the day of dosing)

          8. Willing and able to complete protocol requirements and instructions, which includes

          7. Documented diagnosis of chronic pain condition, or other painful pre-operative
             condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may require analgesic treatment in

             prior to surgery

         12. Aminoglycoside intake within 48 hours prior to or during surgery

         13. Pre-existing disorders of the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia gravis, Eaton-
             Lambert syndrome, or amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis)

         14. Any past or current medical condition that in opinion of investigator, puts subject at
             undue safety risk for surgical complications or for use of the investigational
             product.
