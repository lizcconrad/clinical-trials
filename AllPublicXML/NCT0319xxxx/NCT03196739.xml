  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because virtual reality can provide more enriched environment, repetitive goal-oriented
      tasks, and increased patients' interest and motivation, it is expected to stimulate
      neuroplasticity of injured brain and promote recovery in patients with brain disorders. On
      the other hand, immersive virtual reality using a head-mounted display has not yet been
      attempted in the rehabilitation of patients with brain disorders. In addition to the benefits
      of existing virtual reality or game rehabilitation, immersive virtual reality can further
      enhance brain plasticity, such as the effect of mirror therapy or action observation, through
      self-awareness of the body in the virtual space. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      the feasibility of applying the immersive virtual reality using a head-mounted display in
      patients with upper extremity dysfunction due to brain disorders.
