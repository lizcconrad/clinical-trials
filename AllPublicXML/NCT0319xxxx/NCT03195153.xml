  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Substantial
      clinical and experimental evidence suggest that both diabetes and insulin resistance cause a
      combination of endothelial dysfunctions, which may diminish the anti-atherogenic role of the
      vascular endothelium. Therefore, in patients with diabetes or insulin resistance, endothelial
      dysfunction may be a critical early target for preventing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
      disease. It has been implicated as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and
      premature cardiovascular mortality for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as
      well as for patients with essential hypertension. A complete biochemical understanding of the
      mechanisms by which hyperglycemia causes vascular functional and structural changes
      associated with the diabetic milieu still eludes us. In recent years, the numerous
      biochemical and metabolic pathways postulated to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of
      diabetic vascular disease have been distilled into several unifying hypotheses. The role of
      chronic hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic microvascular complications and in
      neuropathy has been clearly established. However, the biochemical or cellular links between
      elevated blood glucose levels, and the vascular lesions remain incompletely understood. A
      number of trials have demonstrated that statins therapy as well as angiotensin converting
      enzyme inhibitors is associated with improvements in endothelial function in diabetes.
      Although antioxidants provide short-term improvement of endothelial function in humans, all
      studies of the effectiveness of preventive antioxidant therapy have been disappointing.
      Actually, control of hyperglycemia thus remains the best way to improve endothelial function
      and to prevent atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular complications of diabetes.
