      This intervention study is a part of the FOCUS (Frailty Management Optimization Through EIP
      AHA Commitments and Utilization of Stakeholders Input) project which purpose is to critically
      reduce the burden of frailty in Europe by assisting those partners within the European
      Innovation Partnership for Active Healthy Ageing (EIPAHA) with commitments focusing on early
      diagnosis/ screening and/or management of frailty to achieve scalability.

      FOCUS aims to critically reduce the burden of frailty in Europe by developing methodologies
      and tools to assist entities focusing on early diagnosis, screening and management of frailty
      to achieve scalability. Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults that brings an
      increased risk for poor health outcomes including falls, incident disability, hospitalization
      and mortality.

      The FOCUS Consortium brings together a multidisciplinary team of specialists from 10
      organizations in 6 countries - Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, United Kingdom -
      that will work on developing, piloting and disseminating methodologies and tools to assist
      entities focusing on early diagnosis, screening and management of frailty to achieve
      scalability.

      Wroclaw Medical University actively participates in all projects for the advances in science,
      entrepreneurship, technological innovation, both with public authorities, local governments,
      and enterprises. In FOCUS project, WMU is responsible for Evaluation of the project and
      collaborates with the others partners in Coordination of the project, Dissemination of the
      project, Synthesis of learning and realities of practice, Analysis and guidelines
      development, Creation of Network and Platform for knowledge exchange, Test of guidelines in a
      set of commitments (Work Package 7 - WP7).

      The outcomes of this proposal will offer significant potential improvements for innovative,
      coordinated and comprehensive community based prevention with regard to the optimisation of
      functional capacity tools to address pre-frailty, and for improving the management of
      frailty.

      The registered study has its own protocol developed by Wroclaw Medical University research
      team and will be implemented within WP7 of the FOCUS project.

      This is a prospective intervention study. The study is expected screening about 320
      participants - persons aged more than 60 years old recruited from Universities of the Third
      Age, day care centers, primary care centers, geriatrics out-patient clinics and from nursing
      homes. We are expected to enroll 270 potential participants (at least 135 participants) to 5
      groups: 4 intervention groups and 1 control group without any intervention.

      Patient qualification is based on criteria developed by Fried et al 2001.

      Dimensions:

      Weight loss Exhaustion Physical Activity Walk Time Grip Strength

      INTERPRETATION:

      Robust: 0 points Pre-frail: 1-2 points Frail: 3 or more points

      Method: diagnostic survey Technique: the 'surveys combined with direct measurements of
      patients investigated within 0, after 3 and 6 months

      Tools:

      Study questionnaires:

      • Standardized questionnaires: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Minnesota
      Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire Vulnerable Elders — 13 Survey Mini Nutritional
      Assessment Health Behaviour Inventory Montreal Cognitive Assessment Geriatric Depression
      Scale World Health Organization Quality of Life (short version) questionnaire Camberwell
      Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule Barthel Scale Activities of Daily Living
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal
      Schedule Timed up and go test Beck Depression Inventory

        -  The questionnaire on: socio-demographic data - age, gender, marital status, living in
           relationship/ without relationship, level of education, place of residence, economic
           status; the number of hospitalizations in the last 3 years (including kind of ward); the
           number and kind of chronic diseases (ICD-10); the number of permanent medications;
           employment situation; number of traveling in the last year; having pets; number of
           languages the participants can speak; number of falls

        -  Rating of patients' difficulties in the implementation of the intervention (Did the
           patients perform the interventions? How often? Was it difficult to the patients?)

        -  Observations sheet: height, weight, BMI, hand grip strength, circumference of arm
           muscle, circumference of calf

        -  The results of laboratory tests: sodium , albumins, lymphocytes, LDL cholesterol, C
           reactive proteins, glomerular filtration rate, fasting glucose, thyroid hormones
