    <textblock>
      This project is a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial evaluating the
      feasibility, tolerability, acceptability and adherence for lorcaserin among actively using,
      men who have sex with men (MSM) with cocaine use disorders.The study will enroll 45
      individuals who will randomly be assigned to either the treatment (lorcaserin) arm or the
      placebo arm, to be taken twice a day for 12 weeks.

             maintenance treatment or received therapy with any opiate-substitute within 30 days
             preceding screening

          -  Currently in court-mandated cocaine use treatment;

          -  Had previous history of suicidal behavior in the last 12 months (&quot;yes&quot; answer to the

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt; 450 or a QRS interval &gt; 120 msec at screening. If QTcF
             exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times
             and the average of the three QTc values should be used to determine the subject's
             eligibility.

        (Note: Participants newly diagnosed with HIV at screening who consent to be contacted for
        re-screening will be called in the subsequent month, or later, depending on participant
