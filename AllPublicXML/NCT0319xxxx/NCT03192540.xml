  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the effects of an eight-week center-based exercise intervention for
      adolescents with Down syndrome on home exercise compliance. As well, to observe changes in
      fitness including muscular strength, endurance and aerobic capacity. Finally to observe any
      changes in mood, behavior and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Adolescents with Down syndrome will attend an eight-week, center-based exercise intervention.
      Participants will undergo an hour of exercise intervention each week. During this time,
      participants will be working with a certified athletic trainer, exercise physiologist and
      physician. Exercises will focus on strength and endurance of all major muscle groups, while
      ensuring proper technique and form is used. They will also receive instruction on how to
      continue the exercise program at home. Prior to starting, and at the end of eight visits, all
      exercise participants will undergo testing procedures for anthropometric, strength and
      flexibility measurements. This data will be collected as part of clinically evaluating the
      impact of the program on each participant. In addition, to the exercise program (and clinical
      assessments of fitness), DSFit participants will complete study measures of behavioral
      functioning as well as scales of depression and anxiety. In addition, participants in the
      DSFit study will complete a weekly exercise log during and for three months after the
      intervention.
