  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The collected data from the Zurich Registry for pulmonary Hypertension (PH) are evaluated in
      a retrospective analysis. This study examines the number of patients and their exact
      diagnoses who are treated at the University Hospital of Zurich and potentially other
      participating in the Zurich Registry. Other demographic parameters such as age, gender and
      body-mass-index are also part of the evaluation. Furthermore, the analysis will focus on the
      newest guidelines on PH. Therefore, it will be checked how many patients would fulfill the
      therapeutic goals in terms of New York Heart Classification (NYHA), 6-minute walk distance,
      sign of right heart failure and N-terminal pro-brain-natriuretic peptide(NTproBNP).
      Additionally, the study examines on how the patients are treated. Despite the different kind
      of Drugs, the focus lies on the combination therapy (single, double, triple) and the impact
      the therapy had on the patients.
