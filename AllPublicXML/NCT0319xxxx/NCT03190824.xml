      Open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase IIa study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      immunological response of OBP 301 in patients with unresectable/unresected metastatic
      melanoma. This proof of concept study will be undertaken in male and female patients with
      unresectable Stage III and IV melanoma. Patients with unresectable/unresected mucosal
      melanoma may be enrolled after consultation with the Medical Monitor.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall tumor sites response
      (objective response rate [ORR]) to OBP-301 in both injected and noninjected lesions up to and
      including Week 24 in patients with unresectable/unresected Stage III and IV melanoma. The ORR
      is defined as the rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on the
      modified immune-related response criteria (irRC) 1.0. The modification is to allow the
      identification of up to 10 cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or lymph node tumor lesions and
      identify the lesions as target and nontarget lesions.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the ORR up to and including Week 24 in injected target lesions based on the
           modified irRC 1.0 and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1

        -  To evaluate the ORR up to and including Week 24 in noninjected target lesions based on
           modified irRC 1.0 and RECIST 1.1

        -  To evaluate the ORR in both injected and noninjected target lesions at Week 12 based on
           the modified irRC 1.0 and RECIST 1.1

        -  To evaluate duration of response and time to response

        -  To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) at Week 24 and Week 48

        -  To evaluate overall survival (OS) at Week 24 and Week 48

        -  To evaluate the safety of OBP 301

      Exploratory Objective (optional):

      The optional exploratory objective of this study is to investigate the tumor immunological
      response in blood and tumor tissue following treatment with OBP-301.

Duration of response (injected and noninjected lesions): applies only to patients whose best overall response is CR or PR. The start date is the date of first documented response (CR or PR) and the end date is the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to underlying cancer
