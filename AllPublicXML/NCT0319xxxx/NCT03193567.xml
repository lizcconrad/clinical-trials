      The purpose of this study to preliminarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of High Efficient
      Killing Cell Therapy for refractory and advanced non-small cell lung cancer
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pathological confirmed non-small cell lung cancer with no standard treatment
      are enrolled. The patients fails in previous at least 2 lines of chemotherapy and 1 line of
      targeted therapy where applicable. This is a prospective exploratory trial.
