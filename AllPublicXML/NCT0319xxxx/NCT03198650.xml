    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study of acalabrutinib, a selective and
      irreversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in Japanese adult patients with advanced
      B-cell malignancies. This study is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (dose-confirmation phase) and
      Part 2 (dose-expansion phase).
