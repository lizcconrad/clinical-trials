  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor balance capacity is one of clinical symptoms of stroke patient. The reason of loss
      balance capacity is motor impairment, as well as a diminished capacity to voluntarily shift
      body weight or to with stand external pertubations. An important determinant of activities of
      daily living performance is standing balance. Therefore, poor balance, or postural stability,
      is significant predictors the risk of fall. After a fall, the patient can experience
      psychological, physical, social, economic, and sometimes fatal effects. The injuries can
      reduce the patient's mobility as well as independence and influence quality of life. Postural
      movement patterns include three discrete control strategies: hip, knee, and ankle strategy.
      The ankle rocker is an important factor to maintain balance during standing and the ankle
      strategy restores the center of mass (CoM) to a position of stability through body movement.
      As a result, effective control of foot motion and ankle stability may decrease postural sway
      and the risk of fall in chronic stroke.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the insole on balance capacity in
      chronic stroke.
