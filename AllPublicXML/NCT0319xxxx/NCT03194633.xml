  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension are two closely related common chronic diseases
      that have serious implications to human health. Hypertension is a major cause for progression
      of renal disease and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Control of Blood
      Pressure (BP) to target is now considered to be the main goal in the treatment of patients
      with CKD.

      In clinical practice, it is difficult for CKD patients with hypertension to achieve systolic
      BP (SBP) or diastolic BP (DBP) goal; oftentimes, calcium channel blocker (CCB) class of
      drugs, for example, nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), is used in such
      patients. Previous data have demonstrated nifedipine to be having a significant dose-response
      relationship; that is, nifedipine 60 mg provided better BP reduction than 30 mg. However,
      there are limited studies that have evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of nifedipine
      GITS 60 mg in Chinese CKD patients with hypertension. Hereby, the objective of this study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of nifedipine GITS 60 mg treatment in a large
      cohort of CKD patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
