    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the effect of multiple doses of
      ethinylestradiol / levonorgestrel (Microgynon®) on single dose pharmacokinetics of BI 409306
      and the effect of single dose of BI 409306 on multiple dose pharmacokinetics of
      ethinylestradiol / levonorgestrel (Microgynon®)
