    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect postmarket data in subjects who receive surgical
      treatment of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear (of at least 1.5 cm) with the BioWick™
      SureLock™ implant. Both performance and safety data will be collected.

      Study Title Efficacy of the BioWick™ SureLock™ Implant for the Reattachment of Soft Tissue to
      Bone in Subjects Undergoing Rotator Cuff Repairs

      Sponsor Cayenne Medical, Inc., a Zimmer Biomet company

      Study Design The study is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm study that
      includes both preoperative assessments and follow-up assessments at 3 months, 6 months, 12
      months, and 24 months.

      Clinical Phase Postmarket

      Number of Sites Up to ten sites in the U.S.

      Study Duration per Subject Subjects will be enrolled in the study for up to 24 months.

      Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to assess the structural failure
      rate with the use of the BioWick™ SureLock™ implant.

      Secondary Objective

      The secondary objectives of this study are :

        -  To document the postmarket effectiveness of the BioWick™ SureLock™ implant using range
           of motion measurements, ASES scores, VR-12 scores, and VAS scores, with the
           corresponding assessments made at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.

        -  To document device safety via device-related adverse events reported over the course of
           the study.

    <description>The BioWick™ SureLock™ implant is a device for shoulder and extremity surgery, constructed of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene Suture. BioWick™ SureLock™ is uniquely designed to minimize these risks by avoiding manual tensioning with an inserter mechanism that ensures that the implant is consistently deployed below the cortex.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of rotator cuff tear which is greater than or equal to 1.5 cm and
             less than or equal to 4.0 cm full thickness of either the supraspinatus or
             infraspinatus with an intact subscapularis, confirmed by MRI, which has not been
             previously repaired;

          -  Goutallier Stage 2 or less;

          -  Patte Stage II (mid humeral head retraction);

          -  Tear(s) confirmed intra-operatively by calibrated probe, tears measured in both
             anterior-posterior and medial-lateral planes;

          -  Subject is skeletally mature at the surgical site;

          -  Subject is able to read and understand the ICF and has voluntarily provided written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Conditions which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, may limit the
             subject's ability or willingness to follow post-operative care or study instructions;

          -  If female, subject is pregnant;

          -  of local or systemic infection;

          -  Suprascapular nerve compression requiring release or documented by EMG-NCV;

          -  Substance abuse, including tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs which, in the
             investigator's judgment, could impair healing or influence study compliance;

          -  Foreign body sensitivity. If material sensitivity is suspected, testing should be
             completed prior to device implantation;

          -  Insufficient blood supply or previous infection which may hinder the healing process;

          -  Subject conditions including: insufficient quantity or quality of bone or soft tissue,
             or immature bone where the device may impact or disrupt the growth plate;

          -  Subject is a prisoner or member of another vulnerable population;

          -  Cortisone injection within 6 weeks prior to surgical treatment;

          -  Use of immune suppressants or chemotherapeutic medications;
