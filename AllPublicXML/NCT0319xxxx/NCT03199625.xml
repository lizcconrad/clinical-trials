  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which includes cognitive therapy (CT) and behavioral
      therapy (BT), is the first-line treatment for patients with panic disorder (PD). However, the
      neural mechanism of CBT is unknown. The exploration of mechanism is of great significance for
      clinical strategy formulation. This study is proposed on the basis of our early PD and CBT
      neuroimaging studies, adopt the design of prospective randomized controlled intervention
      study, set up three time points: before the treatment（week 0）, the initial treatment (week
      4th), the plateau treatment (week 28th). With normal subjects as black control and
      antidepressant therapy as intervention comparison, this study set up CT and BT two
      intervention groups, respectively collect all the participants'symptomatological,
      psychological, cognitive function and brain imaging data (3D,DTI, fMRI in resting and tasks
      states) at week 0, week 4th and week 28th. This study is based on the advanced analysis
      methods we applied in the early study,including BOLD-fMRI, DTI, topological characteristics
      analysis of the whole brain network and Granger causality test etc. It is from the point of
      multiple levels(brain regions, circuits, whole brain), multimodal (structure, function) to
      comprehensively analysis the role of CT and BT for the function and structure of brain
      regions, circuits (mood regulating circuit and cognitive control network for emotion
      processing) and whole brain in patients with PD. Totally, we explore the target area, path
      and mechanism of CBT for emotion processing neural circuits in patients with PD, and combined
      with the clinical data we preliminarily explore the imaging biomarkers of different
      intervention methods which may predict therapeutic effect.
