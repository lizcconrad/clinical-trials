  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to generate a comprehensive survey of the use on the market of the
      Anecova device within its intended indications according to the Instructions For Use. The
      Anecova Registry is part of the Anecova quality system, to enable the Post Marketing
      Surveillance and the Post Market Clinical Follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As soon as the very first minute of the fertilization process, very important biological
      events, critical for the future developmental competency of the embryo are taking place.

      These biological events, after the sperm cell entry in the oocyte cytoplasm and prior to the
      first cleavage, include: the completion of the meiosis, the exclusion of the second polar
      body, the pronuclei formation, the replication of the male and female DNA and the chromosome
      segregation on the newly formed mitotic spindle.

      If any of these events is aberrant, one or both of the two daughter cells and their
      descendants may carry chromosomal anomalies. In other words an uneven first cleavage in size
      or in content is associated with chromosomal abnormality and aneuploidy.

      In vivo all these events occur in a natural environment where the presence of specific
      molecules and of a dynamic and physiological environment might be an advantage over in vitro
      culture conditions to ensure optimal cellular functions.

      The Registry will capture information from the Anecova procedure, from the outcomes, from the
      procedure performance, from the safety and from the utilization of the Anecova Medical Device
      in clinical routine.
