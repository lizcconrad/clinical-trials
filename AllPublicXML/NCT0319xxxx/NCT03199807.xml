  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of
      cancer-related death worldwide. The resection rate for HCC is approximately 10%-30% and the
      overall prognosis is very poor with a 5-year survival rate of 5%-6%. The recurrence rate is
      high after radical resection. In addition to surgery, radiofrequency ablation, transcatheter
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE), microwave ablation, cryoablation, radioactive seeds
      implantation, high-intensity-focused ultrasound, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted
      drugs are available for patients with unresectable tumors; however, the efficacy of these
      treatments are limited and long-term prognosis in the patients is still poor. Moreover, due
      to serious side effects induced by treatments such as TACE, chemotherapy and targeted drugs,
      it may not be possible for patients to continue receiving these therapies. The study herein
      successfully developed a new immunotherapeutic approach combined with radiotherapy, and tried
      to proved it to be more effective and safe.
