    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a single dose of entinostat on
      subjects with varying levels of renal impairment.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      entinostat in adult subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment compared to
      healthy mean-matched subjects.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      entinostat in adult subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in healthy
      mean-matched adult subjects.

             performed 4 months or more prior to dosing of study drug. A male who has been
             vasectomized less than 4 months prior to dosing must follow the same restrictions as a
             non vasectomized male).

          6. If male, must agree not to donate sperm from dosing until 90 days after dosing of

             able to comply with the protocol.

             Mild, Moderate, and Severe Renal Impaired Subjects:

          8. Baseline health is judged to be stable based on medical history, laboratory profiles,
             vital signs, or ECGs at screening, as deemed by the PI. Subjects with any clinical

             opinion of the PI.

          9. For subjects with mild RI only: Baseline eGFR 60 89 mL/min/1.73m2, inclusive, based on

        may be enrolled if deemed appropriate in the opinion of the PI.

        9. Has eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2, based on the MDRD equation at screening defined as follows:
        eGFR = 175 x (Scr,std)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 Scr, std: serum creatinine (mg/dL) measured with
        a standardized assay. For females, multiply result by 0.742; if African American, multiply
        result by 1.212.

        Actual creatinine clearance, as determined by a 24-hour urine collection, may be used in
        place of or in conjunction with the MDRD equation, at the PI's discretion. Subjects who
