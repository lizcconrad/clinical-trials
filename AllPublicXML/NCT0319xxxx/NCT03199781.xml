      PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of motorized mechanical massage associated with cosmetics
      in improving body contour and appearance of gynoid lipodystrophy.

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective and comparative longitudinal clinical study will be
      performed in 30 women with localized fat and gynoid lipodystrophy. Patients will be submitted
      data collection and assessments and before and after treatment.

      HYPOTHESES: It is expected that the patients will present improvement in the body contour and
      in the picture of the gynoid lipodystrophy after the association of the therapies.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A descriptive analysis will be done before and after
      vibration-oscillatory therapy, with frequency tables for categorical and descriptive
      variables (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values) for continuous or
      numerical variables. In order to compare the main variables between the groups and the
      collection times, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements will be used.
      Tukey's test will be used to compare groups. The level of significance adopted for the
      statistical tests will be 5% or p &lt;0.05.

      After signing the informed consent, the participants will be evaluated by two
      physiotherapists where the data collected will be from personal data, anthropometric and
      complementary diagnostic tests such as: ultrasound diagnosis in order to evaluate the
      thickness of the adipose tissue and Cutomiter analysis of the Viscoelasticity of the skin.
      Afterwards they will be divided and started the treatment with another physiotherapist who
      will perform the following protocol of the study: exfoliation of the skin, application of the
      motorized mechanical massage with the device Dermotonus Slim with 550mg of vacuum, continuous
      mode, for 20 minutes subdivided into region Abdominal and posterior thigh, after the end will
      be applied the creams for lipolytic purposes. The protocol will be performed twice a week for
      1 hour each, totaling 10 sessions.
