  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm study involving the use of a high resolution manometry (HRM) diagnostic
      device that is not utilized in any clinical decision-making processes. All patients scheduled
      for DISE as part of their regular clinical care will be screened for enrollment via described
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRM) is a diagnostic technique that has the potential
      to objectively measure pharyngeal collapse patterns in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during
      sedation as well as natural sleep. The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of HRM
      in objectively mapping patterns of pharyngeal collapse observed during drug-induced sleep
      endoscopy (DISE). Quantifying pharyngeal collapse patterns that occur during sedation and in
      natural sleep may significantly impact the selection and success of surgical treatments, as
      well as surgical outcome assessment.

    <description>A high-resolution pharyngeal manometry catheter will be used to capture air pressure data in millimeters of mercury at 0.8mm intervals throughout the pharynx and proximal esophagus during the drug-induced sleep endoscopy procedure. This data will be used to generate maps of pressure data over time.</description>

    <time_frame>Collected during operative procedure, the video endoscopy will take about 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Video from the flexible nasopharyngoscopy exam conducted during the drug-induced sleep endoscopy will be recorded and time-synched to the high-resolution pharyngeal manometry catheter output. The video results will be graded by a trained reviewer using a validated scoring system called the VOTE classification. The VOTE system is a subjective scoring system based on video endoscopy that scores the degree and configuration of airway obstruction related to the velum (soft palate), oropharyngeal lateral walls, tongue base, and epiglottis. The VOTE classification results will be compared to the pressure catheter results to examine for correlations.</description>
