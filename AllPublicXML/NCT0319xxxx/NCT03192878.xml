  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting large and medium caliber
      arteries, particularly the aortic arch and its main branches. Clinical manifestations are
      caused by the marked thickening of the wall of the involved vessels, resulting in lumen
      narrowing and ischemia of the tributary districts. Therapy is based on the use of
      corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic drugs including infliximab, a monoclonal
      antibody blocking tissue necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Biosimilar infliximab is commercially
      available and used in the treatment of various immune-mediated conditions. There are
      currently no data on the efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab in the treatment of TA.

      The investigators propose this monocentric, observational, prospective, open label study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of biosimilar infliximab in the treatment of 30 patients
      with TA. Specifically, the study will include: I) TA patients refractory to treatment with
      corticosteroid and/or immmunosuppressive therapy, not previously treated with infliximab; II)
      TA patients already receiving treatment with originator infliximab.

      Biosimilar infliximab will be administered at dosages usually employed in the treatment of
      TA. Specifically, patients not previously treated with the originator drug will receive
      biosimilar infliximab intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/Kg at time 0, at week 2, at week 4;
      thereafter, treatment will be administered every 4-6 weeks at a dose of 5-10 mg/kg based on
      clinical judgement. In patients previously treated with the originator drug, biosimilar
      infliximab will be administered at the same dosages.

      To evaluate the efficacy of therapy, changes in clinical manifestations, laboratory
      examinations, and imaging findings including angio-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
      thoracic and abdominal vessels and total body PET/CT scan will be evaluate at time 0 as well
      as 6 and 12 months following treatment initiation. In order to evaluate the safety of the
      study treatment, the investigators will stringently evaluate possible side effects of
      treatment, including infusion reactions, changes in laboratory tests, infection, cancer,
      autoimmune manifestations, neurological and cardiovascular symptoms.

      The total duration of follow up for each patient will be 52 weeks from enrolment.
