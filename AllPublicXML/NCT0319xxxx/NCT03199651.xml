      This randomized clinical trial studies the Beating Lung Cancer in Ohio protocol in improving
      survival in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. The Beating Lung Cancer in
      Ohio protocol may help in evaluating immunotherapies and targeted therapies that prolong
      survival, have more favorable toxicity profiles than conventional chemotherapy and impact
      quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish a 6 month observation period for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients
      (NSCLC) (n=400), using the statewide research network, documenting usual care (UC) practices,
      survival and quality of life.

      II. Following the 6 month observation period, conduct a 3 year clinical trial in stage IV
      NSCLC patients (n=2500) randomized to either UC or free advanced genomic and immunotherapy
      testing (AGIT) (next generation sequencing tumor or blood circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) and PD-L1 testing immunohistochemistry staining) with decision support (DS)
      through a genomics board, followed by medical record review and recontacting of patients.

      III. Following the aim 1 six month observation period, for subjects in aim 2 (n=375) who
      smoke or have recently quit smoking, and their household members who smoke (n=94), to conduct
      a 1 year smoking cessation intervention trial where subjects are randomized to UC or National
      Cancer Center Network (NCCN)-driven centralized telephone counseling and decision support
      (CTC/DS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (UC): Patients receive usual care and undergo collection of tumor tissue and blood
      sample for the repository. Patients who smoke or have recently quit smoking and their
      household members who smoke may also undergo smoking cessation via usual care or NCCN
      driven-CTC/DS.

      ARM II (AGIT/DS): Patients undergo collection of tumor tissue for analysis using
      FoundationOne assay and blood sample for analysis using FoundationACT blood circulating tumor
      DNA assay. Patients who smoke or have recently quit smoking and their household members who
      smoke may also undergo smoking cessation via usual care or NCCN driven-CTC/DS.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every month for 9 months and every 2
      months for up to 3 years.

    <description>For aim II, a linear mixed model will be used to model change in quality of life as subjects are transitioned from one therapy to the next, with a main effect for treatment group and random effect for hospital and patient nested within hospital. To allow for possible changes in trajectories over time (e.g., a change-point analysis) the 'segmented' package in R will be used. Trajectories for each treatment will be modeled using a segmented mixed model with random change points as implemented in R.

The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval between smoking cessation and intervention arm will be reported based on the generalized linear mixed models model. As an alternative, we will also fit competing risks regression models (e.g., using the R package 'cmprsk') with death and smoking cessation as competing events.

Cox proportional hazards model will be fit with a random effect for hospital and time to obtain the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for the treatment effect (advanced genomic and immunotherapy testing versus usual care). Interaction between treatment and time (e.g., via a time-dependent treatment effect) will be evaluated to assess possible evolution in usual care over time.
