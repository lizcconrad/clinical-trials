  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn injury is the result of an energy transfer that destroys the skin and adjacent tissues.
      Partial thickness burn wounds are painful and difficult to manage. The aim of burn treatment
      in partial thickness burns is to promote rapid wound healing, decrease pain, protect wound
      from infections, minimize scar formation and functional impairment In recent years, there are
      progressive development of new dressing material with a variety of option for depth adapted
      wound management. Many wound dressings are available for superficial and partial thickness
      burns. Hydrogel based wound dressing provides good biocompatibility with the skin and mucosa
      and promotes hydration of the wound bed.

      Aluminaid wound dressings is a hydrogel based wound dressing that is integrated with
      aluminium that was designed to reduce acute pain in the treatment of superficial and partical
      thickness burn injuries.

      Up to date, no evidence regarding integrated with aluminium sheet in hydrogel based wound
      dressings for the use in partial thickness burns. Therefore this trials is aimed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of Aluminaid versus Hydrogel for the treatment of partial thickness
      burns.

      This is a prospective, randomized, open label, active controlled trial that aim to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of Aluminaid versus Hydrogel wound dressings in the treatment of
      partial thickness burns.

      The study is a multi center trial in children and adults of 12 - 65 years old with partial
      thickness burns.
