  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a severe disease with a bad prognosis. However, thanks to
      extensive research in this field, there are more and better treatment options that allow
      patients to participate in recreational activities at moderate altitude or bring up the
      question of air-travel.

      Still very few is known about the effects hypoxic conditions have on PH patients. The aim of
      this study is to investigate the effects of hypoxia in comparison to normoxia and hyperoxia
      on pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension during routine right heart
      catheterisation. We aim to get insight into the pathophysiology of pulmonary hemodynamics
      under hypoxic conditions in comparison to normoxia and hyperoxia in patients with pulmonary
      arterial and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension compared with control patients,
      that are scheduled for right heart catheterisation due to dyspnea but have no PH.
