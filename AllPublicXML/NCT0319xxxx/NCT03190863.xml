  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor imagery has shown promising results to optimize tenodesis grasp in individuals with
      C6-C7 tetraplegia. However, efficacy of using motor imagery to improve grasping after
      tetraplegia requires further study with higher level of evidence. In addition, controlling
      covert practice remains difficult due to the absence of overt movements. However, similar
      brain activity measured during both over and cover movements makes possible to provide visual
      information about the covert practice performance using neurofeedback.

      The Investigators thus designed this multicentric randomized controlled trial to investigate
      the effect of motor imagery with or with no visual neurofeedback on grasping capabilities
      after C6-C7 tetraplegia. They hypothesized that providing neurofeedback based on brain
      activity measured by electroencephalography namely knowing the covert practice performance
      would results in greater grasping improvement in response to practice as compared to motor
      imagery practice alone.

    <measure>Wrist extension angle in degree during grasping with 3D motion analysis system</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 19 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals with C6-C7 tetraplegia extend their wrist to grasp using tenodesis. Specifically, the wrist extension shortens the tendons of fingers and thumbs flexors that elicit either a palmar or a lateral grip. A complete reach-to-grasp movement will be recorded using a 3D motion analysis system (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd. UK). Wrist extension angle in degree will be measure during grasping when the object is grasped.</description>
