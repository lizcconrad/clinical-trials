  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implementation of early sensory re-education (SR) techniques, aimed to preserve the
      cortical hand area, such as the use of audio-tactile interaction, becomes an important
      strategy to obtain also a better sensory function. The aim of this study was to investigate
      sensory function outcomes (threshold monofilaments, two-point discrimination test, STI and
      DASH) and cortical responses (fMRI) in patients submitted to an early protocol of SR of the
      hand with a sensor glove model. After surgical repair of median and/or ulnar nerves, 17
      participants were divided into two groups: the training group, trained on the protocol with
      the sensor glove model, and the control group, untrained. After six-month follow-up, no
      difference was observed between groups, related to sensory function, especially tactile
      gnosis. Despite this, the early training with this sensor glove model seems to provide some
      type of cortical audio-tactile interaction, contributing to previous studies that focus in
      early SR of the hand using the integration of different sensory modalities.

    <description>Training Group patients were submitted to application of a three-month protocol for early sensory re-education of the hand using the sensor glove model developed by Mendes et al. (2011). Patients also received conventional physical therapy for this type of injury in a specialized hand therapy center in a university hospital. Control Group patients received only conventional physical therapy treatment. No home sensory re-education program was established for any group and the CG patients were not submitted to any protocol for early sensory re-education of the hand.</description>
