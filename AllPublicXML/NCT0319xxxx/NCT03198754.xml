  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 60 patients scheduled for HSCT in the treatment of MM will be recruited in the
      weeks to months prior to their hospitalization. Light therapy incorporating ambient
      systematic programmed light illumination (sPI) will be used in patient hospital rooms (during
      scheduled transplant) to control cancer-related fatigue (CRF). The FDA has certified that
      light therapy, like that used in this study, is a low-risk intervention. When admitted to the
      hospital for a stem cell transplant, there will be a light fixture in the hospital room which
      we will be testing to see how it may affect cancer related fatigue, sleep quality, and other
      negative side effects often seen with the transplant and subsequent treatment. The light
      fixture will turn on and off by itself in the morning. There are two treatment arms used in
      the study, each of the arms uses different light intensities. The study treatment received,
      i.e. which of the two lights, will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. There is an
      equal chance of being given each study treatment. Participants will not be told which study
      treatment they are getting until after the study is completed. Each light will be turned on
      from 7 AM to 10AM every day during transplantation. While in the hospital assessment of
      fatigue, sleep activity, depression, circadian rhythms, and quality of life will continue
      through the course of hospitalization (14-21 days of treatment, to determine immediate impact
      of sPI), then repeat at one month and three months post-discharge follow-ups (to determine
      lasting effects). Outcomes will be assessed through standardized scales (e.g., FACIT-Fatigue
      Scale) and objective measures (e.g., actigraphy, daysimeter for light monitoring, melatonin
      from urine collection, blood inflammatory markers, all explained below). This trial will: 1)
      be the first randomized clinical trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of sPI to prevent CRF
      and other biopsychosocial side effects of transplant; 2) focus on a distinct, relatively
      homogenous patient population (MM-HSCT patients) with high prevalence of CRF; and 3) explore
      possible circadian rhythm mediation via melatonin analysis and blood analysis. This
      investigation will have major public health relevance as it will determine if an inexpensive
      and low patient burden intervention (sPI) is able to control fatigue associated with medical
      illnesses and related problems.

    <measure>FACIT-Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue scale will be used both for selection of patients into the study and as an outcome measure of fatigue. Smith et al. (1999) report that this 13 item scale has excellent test-retest reliability (r = 0.90) and internal consistency reliability (alpha = 0.93-0.95). In addition, criterion related validity studies using objective measures of physical function as the outcome show that patient reported fatigue based on the FACIT-Fatigue can predict these objective measures. This measure is the main tool for measuring fatigue in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative. Cella (personal communication) has indicated that a FACIT-Fatigue score equal to or less than 33 constitutes clinically significant fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. Tested for its psychometric properties in cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome, psychology students, medical students, army recruits and junior physicians, it was found to have good Test-retest Reliability (r=0.80) and great Internal Consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index consists of 19 self-rated items. Scale reliability is excellent using both an internal consistency criterion (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.85). The validity of the instrument is based on its ability to discriminate patients (those having either sleep problems and/or depressive symptoms) from controls (healthy participants without sleep complaints).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36 scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,1 month post hospital discharge, 3 months post hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the SF-36 scale. The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short form health survey consisting of 36 questions. Both test-retest and internal consistency reliability exceeded 0.70 in studies of this scale's psychometric properties. The scale also has demonstrated content, criterion, and predictive validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>20 item questionnaire that comprise six scales reflecting major dimensions of depression: depressed mood; feelings of guilt and worthlessness; feelings of helplessness and hopelessness; psychomotor retardation; loss of appetite; and sleep disturbance. The CES-D has been shown to be a reliable measure for assessing the number, types, and duration of depressive symptoms across racial, gender, and age categories (Cronbach's alpha â‰¥0.80). Concurrent validity by clinical and self-report criteria, as well as substantial evidence of construct validity has been demonstrated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PANAS</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a 20-item self-report measure of positive and negative affect developed by Watson, Clark, and Tellegen (1988). NA and PA reflect &quot;dispositional imensions, with high-NA epitomized by subjective distress and unpleasurable engagement, and low NA by the absence of these feelings.&quot; Conversely, PA represents the extent to which an individual experiences pleasurable engagement with the environment. Consequently, emotions such as enthusiasm and alertness are indicative of high PA, whilst lethargy and sadness characterize low PA. Both the PA and NA have decent Test-retest reliability (r=0.68 and r=0.71 respectively) and decent Internal Consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Symptoms Inventory-18 (BSI-18)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>BSI-18 is one an integrated series of instruments designed to measure psychological distress. A more concise version of the 53 item BSI, the BSI-18 boasts 18 items and, according to its authors, this inventory presents satisfactory reliability indexes, both for the dimensions (ranging from .74 to .84) and the general distress index (.89). It has decent Test-retest Reliability (r=0.76) and good Internal Consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89).</description>
