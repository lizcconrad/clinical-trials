  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal intubation (TI) is the most common life-saving intervention for resuscitation and
      stabilization of critically ill neonates in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs).Recently,
      video laryngoscopy (VL) has become available in neonatal clinical practice to allows trainees
      and frontline providers to perform standard direct airway visualization (i.e., traditional
      laryngoscopy) while the supervisor can simultaneously view a real-time video displaying what
      the laryngoscopist is seeing. However, VL associated coaching during TI has not been
      rigorously evaluated.The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of video coaching
      training for neonatology attending providers on tracheal intubation procedural outcomes in
      neonatal ICUs. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the video coaching
      skill training for neonatology attendings reduces the occurrence of adverse tracheal
      intubation associated events among all tracheal intubations in neonatal ICUs over 2 years
      before and after intervention. The secondary objectives are to 1) determine if video coaching
      training is feasible to all neonatology attending physicians using train the trainer approach
      with a remote simulation and 2) determine if the video coaching skill competency among
      neonatology attending physicians who completed the training using a remote simulation

    <description>Study intervention is a VL coaching training for site neonatology attendings. Each site leader/key educator will be trained remotely by expert co-investigators. Site leaders and key educators will train their attendings. The quality of VL coaching skills will be verified by randomly auditing 20% of attending providers at each site for their skill assessment by remote simulation during the transition/post-intervention phase.</description>

    <description>Each neonatology attending providers will receive a video laryngoscopy coaching training using a C-MAC video laryngoscope and an intubation training manikin available at each site by a site leader. During the training, site leader will act as a trainee confederate, and each neonatology attending provider will be trained to coach a trainee utilizing video images from C-MAC video laryngoscope and a cognitive aid with standardized language in a laminated card. This training part typically takes approximately 15-30 minutes including consenting process.
Each site leader will be trained by PI or PI's designee using remote simulation. In this remote simulation, each site leader will coach an actor at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) using a profile video image and C-MAC video laryngoscopy image through CHOP approved video conferencing software. A standardized language will be taught to each site leader with a cognitive aid (laminated card).</description>
