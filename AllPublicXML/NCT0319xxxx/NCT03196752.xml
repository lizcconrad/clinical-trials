  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cricothyroid membrane is the most common position that the invasive airway secure is
      performed, but it is not easy to identify the cricothyroid membrane by tactile perception.
      Although it is recommended to use the laryngeal handshake method for identifying the
      cricothyroid membrane in difficult airway society 2015 guidelines for management of
      unanticipated difficult intubation in adults, there is only suggestion without clinical data
      about how much the laryngeal handshake method improves the accuracy of identification of the
      cricothyroid membrane So we made the hypothesis that the cricothyroid membrane is identified
      more correctly when the laryngeal handshake method is used than when that method is not used.
      And we try to find out whether there is actual difference about identification of the
      cricothyroid membrane between using the laryngeal handshake method and not using that method.
      By identifying the difference between them, we are going to support the recommendation of
      guidelines and make the evidence for educating the doctors who have any possibility to
      perform the criocthyroidotomy to use the laryngeal handshake method skillfully in the 'cannot
      intubate, cannot oxygenate' situation.
