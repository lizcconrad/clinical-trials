  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of our work is to provide an inexpensive and scalable m-health tool
      to increase both volume and intensity of physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior in
      patients at risk for type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study is to pilot test MapTrek, a
      text-messaging based intervention.

      This study will randomize participants to 2 groups, an intervention group that will receive a
      Fitbit and MapTrek, and a control group that will receive a Fitbit only. This study has 3
      specific aims.

      Aim 1- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek walk more than the control patients.

      Aim 2- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek generally walk at a faster pace during
      the day than control patients.

      Aim 3- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek have less sedentary time during the day
      than the control patients.

      We expect to collect sufficient data to demonstrate the effectiveness of MapTrek, our
      prototype m-health tool, as an intervention to increase physical activity, heighten intensity
      of activity, and reduce sedentary behavior among a cohort of patients at risk for type 2
      diabetes.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group receive a Fitbit and MapTrek, an interactive text-messaging platform. The only equipment needed is a Fitbit (we provide) and a smartphone (required prior to enrollment). Each week, patients are assigned to a virtual walking route. Each day, they receive a text message with a link to the current route. The link will take them to a map where they can see their progress and the progress of others. A leaderboard provides information on how many steps each participant has taken. MapTrek also supports Street View on Google Maps, so patients can explore what they would see if they were in that location. Throughout each race, patients will randomly receive challenge text messages. Completing a challenge awards bonus steps to propel their character along the map.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control group will receive a Fitbit only. This will allow us to determine if changes in physical activity are due to MapTrek or simply by giving the patients a Fitbit.</description>
