  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD), affects over 45% of all individuals over 70 years of age.
      Patients with moderate CKD have more than a two-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment
      than those without CKD; furthermore, as many as 20-70% of patients with CKD have established
      cognitive impairment and overt dementia. The burden of cognitive impairment and dementia
      leads to functional decline and accelerated loss of independence, contributing to the
      tremendous individual, societal, and economic burden of CKD (i.e., 20% of Medicare
      expenditures in adults &gt;65 years of age). There is no recommended treatment to prevent
      cognitive decline in CKD patients, and the few medications available for cognitive impairment
      have only short term modest effects. There is a critical need to evaluate therapies to
      forestall cognitive impairment, and maintain or improve cognitive functioning in older
      patients with CKD. To address this need, this study will test the hypothesis that older
      patients with moderate/severe CKD and pre-clinical cognitive impairment randomized to a
      6-month home-based exercise program will improve cognitive function and MRI measured brain
      structure, compared to a usual care control group. This study will combine an assessment of
      cognition with MR imaging techniques to fully evaluate brain structure, blood flow, and
      behavior relationships at a level previously not conducted in this population

    <description>Home-based exercise program: The exercise training group will participate in an educational session on exercise for CKD. Participants will receive a packet of information with an exercise prescription and a heart rate monitor that monitors the exercise. Participants will be asked to exercise (a brisk walk) at home, 3 times per week, for 30-60 minutes for 24 weeks. Participants will be contacted via phone biweekly or more frequently if they are behind the exercise routine, and the investigators will meet with them monthly to provide encouragement and progression of exercise, and to download the heart rate monitor.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive standard instructions on exercise for patients with kidney disease similar to what is commonly done in clinical practice. The control group will not receive an exercise prescription or heart rate monitor. Participants will be contacted via phone biweekly to answer any questions and ensure continued study participation. The control group will not meet with the investigators monthly.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to exercise at home by walking at a moderate intensity. Each participant will receive an exercise prescription. Participants will receive a heart rate monitor. The heart rate monitors will be used to achieve a desired exercise intensity and to monitor adherence levels. The participants will receive biweekly to weekly phone calls, and monthly in person meetings will be used to address any barriers, provide encouragement, and progress the exercise.</description>
