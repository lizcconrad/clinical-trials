  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trametinib works in treating patients with juvenile
      myelomonocytic leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Trametinib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate to trametinib in children with recurrent or
      refractory juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further define and describe the toxicities of single agent trametinib in children with
      recurrent or refractory JMML.

      II. To further characterize the pharmacokinetics of trametinib in children with recurrent or
      refractory JMML.

      III. To prospectively evaluate mutant allele burden as a marker of disease activity in JMML.

      IV. To measure the objective response rate to 12 cycles of trametinib in children with
      recurrent or refractory JMML.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the distribution of JMML diagnostic criteria in children with recurrent or
      refractory JMML.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for up to 5 years.
