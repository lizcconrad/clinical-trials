  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CCTG 602 is a multisite demonstration project to evaluate the effectiveness of facilitated
      linkage to PrEP using a community-based transgender PrEP outreach worker (T-POWr) versus
      standard of care (SOC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 500 self-identified transgender / gender non-conforming persons seeking daily
      Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV will be enrolled into this study.
      Each participant will be followed up to 28 weeks after enrollment. The primary endpoint,
      successful linkage to a PrEP evaluation visit, will be measured after 30 days of enrollment.

      Participants expressing interest in PrEP will be referred to the regional transgender PrEP
      outreach work (T-POWr) via phone call. Enrolled participants will be randomized (1:1) to
      either SOC PrEP linkage vs T-POWr facilitated PrEP linkage. Participants randomized into the
      SOC Arm will receive an HIV risk assessment, PrEP education, and an appointment for a linkage
      visit. Participants randomized into the T-POWr arm will receive SOC and a thorough
      client-centered case management evaluation that will assess needs including access to health
      insurance, general health care, assessment of current hormone administration, housing, mental
      health care, domestic violence care, substance use treatment, and other services.

      Participants will be contacted at Week 4 to verify linkage, and at Weeks 16 and 28 to assess
      PrEP and HIV status, and access to referred services.

    <description>All participants will be asked to complete a secure confidential online survey focusing on needs assessment.
Participants in the T-POWr Intervention Arm will receive a client-centered case management consultation based on how the participant responds to the online survey. The T-POWr will refer participants to assistance services based on the needs assessment, including accessing general health care, health insurance, hormone replacement therapy, housing, mental health care, domestic violence care, substance use treatment, etc. Each resource is extensively vetted to assure a trans-friendly experience and will be tailored to each geographic area across the project enrollment sites. The study facilitates referrals for services but will not provide extensive and ongoing case management.</description>
