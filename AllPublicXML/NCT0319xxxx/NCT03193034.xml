  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the change from pre-operative baseline to two year
      postoperative functional performance improvement for the ATTUNE® primary, cementless TKA RP
      system as measured with the KOOS questionnaire (KOOS-ADL sub-score) in the Japanese patient
      population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Evaluate change from preoperative baseline in post-operative outcomes using additional
           patient reported measures at 2 years: PKIP (overall and sub-scores), KOOS (overall and
           sub-scores), AKS and EQ-5D-3L.

        -  Evaluate change from preoperative baseline in pain and satisfaction over time as
           measured using a modified VAS Pain Score (discrete numbers rather than a continual
           scale) at 2yr.

        -  Evaluate type and frequency of Adverse Events

        -  Evaluate survivorship of the ATTUNE® Primary Cementless TKA system for the CR RP
           configurations using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 1 and 2yrs.

        -  Evaluate primary, cementless ATTUNE® TKA fixation through zonal radiographic analysis of
           the bone-implant interface at 6wk, 1yr, and 2yrs after surgery.

        -  Evaluate any changes in anatomic tibiofemoral, femoral component and tibial component
           alignment at 2 years compared to the first postoperative radiographs.

        -  Radiographically characterize the postoperative ATTUNE patellar component alignment and
           positioning in Japanese population.

    <measure>Patient-reported Outcome:Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living (KOOS ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Minimum 2 years (670-912 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 42 questions and include the WOMAC Osteoarthritis index. The KOOS consists of 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreational function and knee related quality of life. Each question has 5 Likert-like response options. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

    <description>The Pre Surgical and/or Post-surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) questionnaire is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 25 questions relating to the patient's awareness of their knee. Questions include the patient's self-confidence about the current status of their knee performance, stability, and overall satisfaction. Each question has a 5, 6 or 10 Likert- like response option.</description>
