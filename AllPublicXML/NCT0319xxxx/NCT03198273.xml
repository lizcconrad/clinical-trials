    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a pain intensity measurement scale with validity and reliability. The patient will be told that they can evaluate their pain from 0 to 10 on a 10 cm horizontal line. It will be explained that if there is no pain, 0 (the leftmost point), the most severe pain will be 10 (the rightmost point). According to these explanations, patients will be asked to mark their pain intensity on a 10 cm chart. On the 10 cm chart, the distance between the point marked by the patient and the leftmost 0 will be measured by the ruler and the value will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Functional Level Status</measure>
    <time_frame>nine weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Lumbar Scale (ODI) was developed by Fairbank to assess functional impairment. There are 10 questions evaluating various daily activities of this scale and 6 options for each question between 0-5. In this scale, the degree of clinical pain severity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, social life, travel and change degree of the pain are questioned. The minimum score taken from the scale is 0, the maximum score is 50. 0-4 points mean there is no disability, 5-14 points are mild, 15-24 points are moderate, 25-30 points are severe and 35-50 points are considered to be complete functional disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Level</measure>
    <time_frame>nine weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form-36 (SF-36) will assess the health-related quality of life of individuals. The form consists of a total of 36 articles which can be filed by the patient. The scale consists of 8 subscales related to health. Physical function (10 articles), social function (2 articles), role limitations due to physical problems (3 articles), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 articles), mental health (5 articles), fitness (4 articles), pain (2 articles), general health [general overview point (5 articles) and health change (1 article)]. The scores from each subscale range from 0-100. 0 indicates the worst condition and 100 the best health condition. The SF-36 is suitable for personal evaluation, and can be applied to people over 14 years of age or face to face computerized or trained personnel.</description>

    <description>Participants will exercise 3 times a week for 6 weeks (18 sessions in total, 45-60 minutes each session) in accompany with a physiotherapist. Since the chosen model for exercise training is clinical pilates exercises, separate patient training will be needed.
