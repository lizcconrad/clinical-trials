  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are associated with high risk for suicide, yet there are
      few brief interventions that directly target suicide prevention in this large population. The
      goal of this intervention development study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary effectiveness of a brief intervention called SafeTy and Recovery Therapy
      (START) that is augmented with content delivered on mobile devices outside of the clinic
      setting. The intervention will evaluated in a community urgent care center context as people
      initiate outpatient care, and, if effective, could be deployed in a wide network of such
      centers.

      This intervention development research project evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary impact of a brief cognitive behavioral intervention, tailored to SMI, that is
      delivered during the gap period between urgent care evaluation and follow-up outpatient care.
      SafeTy and Recovery Therapy (START) is a 4-session cognitive behavioral intervention
      augmented by mobile technology, which delivers automated and personalized reinforcement of
      adaptive coping behavior outside of the clinic setting. START builds from collaborative
      development alongside a community psychiatric service organization, and our preliminary data
      in the SMI population that supports the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of brief,
      mobile augmented cognitive behavioral intervention.

      In a 3-year developmental study, our deployment focused approach will first refine
      intervention procedures, safety and care continuity protocols, and fit with the deployment
      setting with a series of collaborative contacts with community providers, project staff,
      advisors, and patient advocates. We will next conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial
      with 70 patients diagnosed with either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia rapidly referred by
      community triage providers to receive START in the walk-in clinic setting. Patients are
      enrolled who have SMI diagnoses and current active suicidal ideation and/or a suicide attempt
      in the prior 3 months. Participants are randomized to one of two active conditions: START +
      Mobile augmentation or START alone. We will evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and
      enhancement of rates of outpatient treatment engagement and crisis service use in comparison
      to the sample population. We will also examine pragmatic mechanisms, which include outpatient
      treatment engagement and coping self-efficacy, on change in suicidal ideation severity and
      crisis service use along with the preliminary impact of mobile augmentation.
