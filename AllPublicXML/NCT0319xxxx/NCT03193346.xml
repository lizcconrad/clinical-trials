    <description>Mean change from Baseline (28-days prior to first treatment) in frequency (number) of headache days during the 28 day period ending with Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. A moderate/severe headache day is defined as a day (00:00 to 23:59) when a participant reported 4 or more continuous hours of headache and reported a maximum severity of moderate or severe per patient diary among all headache episodes that occurred on that day.</description>
