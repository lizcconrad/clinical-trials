  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate whether the combination of immune therapy and radiation
      therapy to plasmacytoma that can stimulate the immune system to attack and eliminate the
      abnormal cells in the bone marrow and perhaps delay or prevent the cancer from worsening.
      This study will evaluate whether the immune system responds to the combination of radiation
      with immunotherapy. It is possible that that the combination of immune therapy and radiation
      may not make any difference in whether or not the patient will develop multiple myeloma in
      the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Histologically confirmed plasmacytoma amenable for biopsy

          -  Detectable clonal bone marrow plasma cells by multicolor flow cytometry and less than
             10% clonal plasma cells in a bone marrow biopsy by immunohistochemistry, morphology,
             or flow cytometry.

          -  Clinically safe to delay radiation for at least 2 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  Anticipated lifespan greater than 3 month.

          -  Adequate organ function, as defined below:

               -  Total bilirubin within normal ranges unless associated with hepatobiliary
                  metastases or Gilbert syndrome, then total bilirubin ≤ 2 x ULN

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Able and willing to give valid written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including
             inflammatory bowel disease [eg, colitis, Crohn's disease], diverticulitis with the
             exception of a prior episode that has resolved or diverticulosis, celiac disease,
             irritable bowel disease, or other serious gastrointestinal chronic conditions
             associated with diarrhea; systemic lupus erythematosus; Wegener's syndrome

             inhaled, topical or local steroid injections (eg. intra-articular injection); steroids
             as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions; systemic corticosteroid at
             physiologic doses not to exceed 10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.

             Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior the first dose of
             durvalumab.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or female patients of reproductive
             potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control from starting
             dose of durvalumab (Cycle 1 Day 1), including dosing interruptions through 90 days
             after receipt of the last dose of durvalumab. Refrain from egg cell donation while
             taking durvalumab and for at least 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab.

          -  Male subjects who are not employing an effective method of birth control from starting
             dose of durvalumab (Cycle 1 Day 1), including dosing interruptions through 90 days
             after receipt of the last dose of durvalumab. Refrain from sperm donation while taking
             durvalumab and for at least 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab.
