  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if by using MRI changes can be identified changes
      early on in the knees of young children that may be at risk for developing osteochondritis
      dissecans. If MRI can identify changes then better council can be offered about the risks of
      future activity and treatment options.

      Each subject will be asked to undergo an MRI at enrollment, six,12, and 18 months. Subjects
      will be monitored for evidence of osteochondritis dissecans in order to determine if we can
      identify it and then create a treatment program to allow these children to avoid developing
      definitive disease
