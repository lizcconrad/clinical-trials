  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is a leading global cause of neonatal mortality despite of numerous advances
      and intensive research in perinatal medicine. Almost one million children die each year due
      to complications of preterm birth and in almost all countries with reliable data, preterm
      birth rates are increasing. Of the 14 million survivors per year, many face a lifetime of
      disability, including learning disabilities, visual and hearing impairments. Spontaneous
      preterm delivery (SPTD) is often multi factorial event, precocious cervical softening,
      shortening and dilatation are a common denominator. The majority of preterm births happen
      spontaneously, though some are due to early induction of labor or cesarean birth, typically
      due to medical maternal of neonatal conditions.

    <textblock>
      The uterine cervix has to provide structural integrity and mechanical resistance to ensure
      normal development of the fetus as the uterus expands to accommodate the fetus growth.
      Preterm delivery is closely related to a premature cervical ripening. The scientific bases
      for the proposed project is the elasticity modulus of a cervix is a more sensitive parameter
      characterizing the stage of cervical ripening. The main component of the cervix tissue is a
      collagen. Cervical ripening is the result of realignment of collagen, degradation of collagen
      cross-linking due to proteolytic enzymes. These processes affect the elasticity modulus of
      the cervical tissue. Therefore, assessment of cervix by a device measuring cervical
      elasticity and cervical length appears to be and adequate approach for identifying pregnant
      women at high risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. The primary cervical elasticity
      assessment currently used in clinical practice is relying on the evaluation of the cervix as
      &quot;hard, medium or soft&quot;. In the scope of this project the investigators propose to develop and
      clinically validate a new and cost-effective device, Cervix Monitor for detecting cervix
      conditions leading to SPTD and its risk assessment. The CM will be based on measuring of the
      applied pressure to the cervix by a tactile sensor array and ultrasound measurement of cervix
      length .
