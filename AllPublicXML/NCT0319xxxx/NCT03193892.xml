      Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a disease characterized by diffuse cystic changes
      in the lung, is a rare disorder that affects almost exclusively women. The main objectives of
      this study are to accurately evaluate the prevalence of LAM, the status of disease, the
      diagnosis and treatment, the quality of care, and the health related outcomes in China.

      Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a disease characterized by diffuse cystic changes
      in the lung, is a rare disorder that affects almost exclusively women. The main objectives of
      this study are to accurately evaluate the prevalence of LAM, the status of disease, the
      diagnosis and treatment, the quality of care, and the health related outcomes in China. This
      is a register study lasting 4 years, aims to raise 800 subjects. Primary endpoint is the
      annual change of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital
      capacity (FVC) in pulmonary function tests.
