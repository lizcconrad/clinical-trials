  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective randomized control trial testing the hypothesis that
      routine topical antibiotic prophylaxis does not significantly reduce the rate of infection
      after eyelid surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of prophylactic topical antibiotic therapy after eyelid surgery is widespread. Due to
      increasing antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-related complications, and healthcare costs, the
      investigators wish to determine whether prophylactic post-operative antibiotic ointment is
      truly necessary. After all, existing dermatology literature currently recommends against the
      routine use of antibiotic ointment after various surgical procedures (e.g. Mohs surgery). The
      investigators aim to perform a prospective randomized control trial at the University of
      California, San Francisco. The investigators aim to recruit a total of 400 oculoplastics
      patients undergoing eyelid surgery or surgery involving peri-orbital incisions from 2017
      through 2019.

    <description>Intervention: 200 patients in the antibiotic arm will receive either erythromycin unless there is a specific contraindication (e.g. known allergy or lack of pharmacy availability). Those who are erythromycin allergic will receive bacitracin. If neither antibiotic is obtainable by the patient, polybacitracin will be prescribed instead. Antibiotic ointment is to be applied to the surgical incision(s) 4 times daily for 1 week.</description>

If the patient cannot obtain either (i.e. lack of availability at the pharmacy), polysporin-bacitracin will be prescribed. Allergy to all 3 study drugs means that a patient will be excluded from the study.</description>
