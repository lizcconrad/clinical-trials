      This study include a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      post-market clinical trial and a registration study.

      The randomized clinical trial included subjects (n =798) will be randomly divided into
      experimental (n = 532) and control groups (n =266) according to a random number table.
      Patients in the experimental group will receive Huaier Granule (20g/time, 3 times/d).
      Patients in the control group will receive placebo (20g/time, 3 times/d). The registration
      study plan to recruitment at least 300 patients.

      The primary outcome measures is disease-free survival，secondary outcome measures is 2-year
      overall survivals, ECOG-performance status, Karnofsky performance score and tumor markers
      (CEA、CYFRA21-1、SCC).
