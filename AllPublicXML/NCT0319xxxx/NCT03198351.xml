      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate any potential increase in the risk of major birth defects, in the first year of
      life, in teriflunomide-exposed pregnancies.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the potential effect of teriflunomide-exposure on other adverse pregnancy
      outcomes including any potential pattern of minor birth defects, spontaneous abortion,
      stillbirth, preterm delivery, small for gestational age at birth and at 1 year follow-up.

      The total study duration per participant is approximately up to 2 years.

        -  This is a prospective, observational study (no intervention), ie, patient registry.

        -  The statistical analysis for the cohort study describe baseline characteristics in all
           three cohorts, and then will compare pregnancy outcomes in cohort 1 to cohort 2 and
           secondarily to cohort 3.

        -  For the &quot;registry&quot; group, without comparisons, only descriptive statistics of pregnancy
           outcomes will be summarized.

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Pregnant women who have provided an oral and/or written consent to enroll no later
             than 20 completed weeks from last menstrual period (LMP).

          -  Pregnant women who agree to the conditions and requirements of the study including the
             interview schedule, release of medical records, and the physical examination of live
             born infants (up to 1 year post birth).

          -  Pregnant women with a diagnosis of MS and teriflunomide exposure during pregnancy
             (Cohort 1).

          -  Pregnant women with MS but not exposed teriflunomide during pregnancy (Cohort 2).

          -  Healthy pregnant women who do not have a known diagnosis of MS and have no known
             exposure to a known human teratogen during pregnancy (Cohort 3).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Pregnant women who come in first contact with the project after prenatal diagnosis of
             a major structural defect (Cohort 1, 2, 3). This does not apply to the &quot;registry&quot;
             group.

          -  Pregnant women who first come in contact with the project after 20 completed weeks'
             gestation (Cohort 1, 2, 3). This does not apply to the &quot;registry&quot; group.

          -  Pregnant women who had previously enrolled in the study for a previous pregnancy (only
             1 pregnancy, per woman, maybe registered) (Cohort 1, 2, 3). This does not apply to the
             &quot;registry&quot; group.

          -  Retrospectively reported cases (Cohort 1, 2, 3). This does not apply to the &quot;registry&quot;
             group.

          -  Pregnant women with exposures to teriflunomide commencing after the 12th week post-LMP
             (Cohort 1). This does not apply to the &quot;registry&quot; group.

          -  Pregnant women who had previously been treated with teriflunomide if they had received
             any dose of the drug within 2 years prior to the index pregnancy and do not have
             documented blood levels below 0.02 mcg/mL prior to pregnancy (Cohort 2).
