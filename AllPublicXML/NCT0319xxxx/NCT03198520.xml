        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  with the absence of 3 or less teeth per saddle, excluding third molars

          -  partial denture in one arch only

          -  with previous denture wearing experience, and Cobalt Chrome (CoCr) Removable Partial
             Denture (RPD) fitted in the previous 24 months and the patient is currently and
             routinely wearing the denture

          -  With a stable oral health in terms of absence of disease activity affecting the
             periodontium, dental hard tissues (caries), pulp and the structural/aesthetic
             integrity of restored teeth

          -  With at least 1 posterior natural tooth occlusal stop (molar or premolar)

          -  Class I, Class II and Class III (Kennedy's Classification)

          -  Occlusal spacing (static and dynamic) around clasp assembly including the occlusal
             rest

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients requiring extensive treatment prior to the provision of a removable partial
             denture (RPD)

          -  Patients with active primary disease; caries, periodontal disease or symptoms of
             pulpal or apical pathology to the remaining teeth

          -  Patients with irreversibly compromised structural/aesthetic integrity of restored
             teeth that cannot be restored as part of the provision of treatment.

          -  Patients with an opposing Removable Partial Denture (RPD). Removable Partial Denture
             (RPD) to only be in one arch and must oppose a full denture or a dentate arch which
             provides a stable occlusal relationship

          -  Canines are NOT to be replaced with the Removable Partial Denture's (RPDs). Patients
             must have their natural canines present
