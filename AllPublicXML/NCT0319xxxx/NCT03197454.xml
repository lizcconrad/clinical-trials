  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the experimental treatment
      (cognitive training) further outlined in this protocol on the cognitive abilities (e.g.,
      processing speed, attention, working memory, and executive function), brain functionality,
      functional status and quality of life of individuals with age-related cognitive decline as
      compared to a computer-based active control.

    <description>Change in resting state functional connectivity will be measured by resting State T2*weighted EPI-BOLD, a 10-minute task-free BOLD contrast sequence consisting of 300 volumes (TR=2000 ms/TE=30ms) at 3.4mm3 in-plane resolution and 3mm slice thickness. Participants will be instructed to keep their eyes open and maintain attention on a central gray fixation cross on a black screen.</description>

    <measure>Changes in brain structure</measure>
    <time_frame>At 3 months and at 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>3D T1-Weighted multi-echo MPRAGE. Morphometric analyses will be based on this MRI sequence (not accelerated because the reliability of acceleration for multi-site studies has not yet been established). We will achieve spatial resolution of 1 x 1 x 1 mm voxels.</description>
