  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older studies in animals and humans have shown cancer responses to very low doses of
      whole-body or hemi-body radiation. To study the effects of low doses of radiation in patients
      with recurrent prostate cancer, investigators will enroll up to 21 patients for 10 fractions
      of low dose radiation, delivered over 5 weeks. Participants will be followed on study for 12
      months, capturing PSA, CBC, QoL and blood samples for immunological analysis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer.

          -  Having undergone prior prostate surgery or radiotherapy or both.

          -  Evidence of recurrence of the disease as demonstrated by rising PSA levels. Patients
             are eligible if on androgen blockade or hormone naïve.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and/or
             radium-223.

          -  Receiving treatment with immunosuppressive medications.

          -  Platelet count below 50,000/µl (50 x 109/l) or leukocyte count below 3,000/µl (3 x
             109/l) or granulocyte count below 2,000/µl (2 x 109/l).

          -  Other medical conditions or co-morbidities which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may interfere with the participant's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Language difficulties which may hinder the patient's ability to complete the trial.

          -  Inability of the potential participant to provide consent.

          -  Lack of independence in daily living activities and any other conditions which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, will hinder the participant's ability to participate and
             complete the study obligations.
