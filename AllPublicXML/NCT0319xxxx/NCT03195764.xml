  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T-1101 (Tosylate) is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential
      anti-cancer therapeutic by Taivex Therapeutics Corp. T-1101 (Tosylate) is a potent
      anti-cancer agent in numerous human cancer cell lines. In addition, oral administration of
      T-1101 (Tosylate) showed tumor growth inhibition in different mouse xenograft models of human
      cancers. In this study, safety, tolerability and PK of T-1101 (Tosylate) will be evaluated
      and also the recommended dose and regimen(s) to initiate Phase 2 will be determined.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of T-1101 (Tosylate) in Participants with Advanced Cancers Refractory to Standard Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>The first 21-day cycle</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is highest dose level in which 6 patients have been treated with at most 1 experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
When following toxicity events occur within the first 21-day cycle, these toxicity will be defined as DLT.
Hematological toxicities : prolonged grade 4 neutropenia for &gt;7 days, grade 3 febrile neutropenia (an ANC &lt; 1000/mm3 with a single temperature of &gt; 38.3°C or a sustained temperature of &gt; 38°C for more than 1 hour), grade 4 febrile neutropenia (febrile neutropenia with life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated), grade 3 neutropenia with grade 3 infection and grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or grade 4 lasting 7 days.
Non-hematological toxicities: grade 3 or 4 toxicities, Nausea and vomiting or diarrhea must persist at grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical therapy.
The above toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Tumor eligibility:

               -  Histologically confirmed advanced malignancies refractory to standard active
                  treatment.

               -  Solid tumors that have measurable or evaluable disease as per Response Evaluation
                  Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v. 1.1). Target lesions that have been
                  previously irradiated will not be considered measurable (lesion) unless increase
                  in size is observed following completion of radiation therapy.

          2. Able, in the investigator's opinion, to have a life expectancy of more than 3 months.

          3. Female or male, 20 years of age or older.

          4. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          5. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior therapy or surgical procedures to no
             more than grade 1 (except alopecia).

          6. Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:

               -  Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT ≤ 5
                  x ULN if liver tumor is present.

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN

          7. Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient has been
             informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial prior to enrollment.

          8. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Extensive radiation therapy or systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks before
             starting study treatment or target therapy within 2 weeks of starting study treatment.

             for another investigation drug.

          4. Documented or suspicious brain metastases, spinal cord compression, carcinomatous
             meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease.

          5. Any of the following occurs within 6 months prior to starting study treatment:
             myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass
             graft, congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident including transient
             ischemic attack.

          6. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE grade 2, or atrial fibrillation of any
             grade.

          7. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt;150/100 mmHg despite optimal
             medical therapy).

          8. Current treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low dose warfarin up to 2 mg PO
             daily for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed).

          9. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.

         10. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be
             postmenopausal, or must agree to the use of highly effective contraception during the
             period of therapy. Highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that
             results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1 percent per year) when used
             consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized
             partner. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal
             investigator or a designated associate.

         11. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor,
             excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, which
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

         12. Patients with active infection should be excluded.

         13. Positive test for hepatitis B (HBsAg) or hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody).
