  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial comparing the
      effectiveness and safety of transseptal puncture using the Baylis transseptal system to
      transseptal left atrial access with standard transseptal equipment (usual care) in patients
      undergoing catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation with the cryoballoon system.

      The targeted population will consist of patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation undergoing pulmonary vein isolation with the cryoballoon system.

      Study Objective - The objective of the prospective, randomized study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of the Baylis transseptal system (RF needle, TorFlex sheath, and
      specialised ProTrack guidewire) compared with a conventional transseptal (conventional
      sheath, Brockenbrough needle, and standard guidewire) for transseptal LA access during
      cryoballoon ablation procedures.

      Trial design - This will be a prospective single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial
      comparing the effectiveness and safety of transseptal puncture using the Baylis transseptal
      system to transseptal left atrial access with standard transseptal equipment (usual care) in
      patients undergoing catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation with the cryoballoon
      system.

      Study Population - The targeted population will consist of patients with symptomatic
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing pulmonary vein isolation with the cryoballoon
      system.
