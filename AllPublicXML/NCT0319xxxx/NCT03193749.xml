      Purpose:

      The ATTACH trial, as currently designed, will primarily test whether a treatment with
      Amiodarone for at least 6 months has a trypanocidal effect among individuals with
      mild-to-moderate Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy. A secondary goal will be to confirm, in this
      population, a clinical benefit from this treatment (in terms of reducing mortality or cardiac
      arrhythmic events), and to explore whether a potential trypanocidal effect is associated with
      a clinical benefit.

      Investigators currently plan to enroll over 200 participants in Bogotá and Bucaramanga,
      Colombia. Such sample size will provide 82% of statistical power to detect at least a 30%
      relative reduction in the primary outcome. This is assuming that at least 75% of untreated
      participants will test positive at least once after three qualitative PCR assays for
      Trypanosoma cruzi during the 6th month after randomization (allowing for up to 10% losses to
      follow up and treatment adherence over 90%).

      ATTACH is currently seeking collaborating centers internationally. The current funding
      structure will allow to test study hypothesis on trypanocidal effect, whereas data on
      clinical effects will be exploratory. Investigators expect to increase the sample size to at
      least 600 participants in order to a) enhance geographical variability/generalizability for
      the primary results and b) to achieve enough statistical power to test the hypothesis on
      clinical impact.

      New centers are welcome to join this protocol, either as a placebo-controlled or as a
      pragmatic, open label trial. These centers will be working with the central coordination with
      their own funding/logistic capabilities. In the open label protocol, eligible, consenting
      participants will be randomly prescribed or not to Amiodarone. As assessing clinical impact
      will be the priority, new centers are not required to have on-site PCR capabilities. These
      centers are encouraged to store blood samples for PCR testing elsewhere later, if possible.

        ATTACH will enroll individuals with positive serology for Trypanozoma cruzi and evidence of
        both structrural and rythm/conduction cardiac abnormalities, as defined by any of the
        following inclusion criteria

          1. Structural cardiac abnormality (at least one):

               -  NTpro-BNP values &gt;125 ng/ml, or BNP values &gt; 50 ng/ml

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% or left diastolic diameter &gt; 5.5
                  cm

               -  Symptoms of heart failure, or one episode of acute heart failure over the last 12
                  months

          2. Rrythm/conduction cardiac abnormality (at least one)

               -  EKG monitoring showing 10 or more VPBs/hour or ventricular Tachycardia

               -  EKG showing left anterior hemiblockade or right bundle branch blocakde

               -  Use of a cardiac stimulation device as treatment for A-V block or Sinus node
                  dysfunction

        The protocol allows concurrent treatments for the condition (e.g. beta-blockers, ACE
        inhibitors, etc.) other than Amiodarone. Individuals meeting the above eligibility criteria
        who have previously received trypanocidal therapy (e.g. Benznidazole or Nifurtimox) can
        still be included, as long as they prove to be PCR positive for T. cruzi at enrollment.
        Co-intervention with these agents during the study will also be allowed, as per physician's
        judgment, either as open label treatment, or as part of another study not involving
        Amiodarone.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  LVEF &lt; 30% or NYHA Class III-IV

          -  Medical prescription with chronic use of Amiodarone

          -  Pregancy (currently, or planned in the following 2 years), or childbearing age without
             reliable birth control

          -  Heart rate &lt; 50 or AV blockade without treatment with cardiac stimulation device

          -  Contraindication for Amiodarone as per treating physician (e.g. because of long QT
             syndrome, thyroid disease, interstitial lung disease)

          -  Atrial fibrillation
