      Two new rapid HIV tests by Alere™ have the potential to substantially decrease the window
      period for rapid tests. First, the Alere™ HIV Combo is a rapid fourth generation test. The
      performance in a laboratory based setting was recently assessed at the Thai Red Cross
      Anonymous Clinic Laboratory in Bangkok, Thailand (personal communication). Of 50 confirmed
      acute HIV samples, Alere™ HIV Combo could detect 37 (74%), while none of these 50 cases could
      be identified by the currently used third generation tests. These data have not yet been
      published, but the preliminary results indicate a very favorable performance of the Alere™
      HIV Combo in a facility-based laboratory setting.

      Second, the Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect is a qualitative, cartridge based, nucleic acid
      amplification test designed for Point of Care use. Data from several early infant diagnosis
      studies in Sub-Saharan African countries have assessed the performance of the Alere™ q
      HIV-1/2 Detect. The test was performed in the field, by a range of health professionals, from
      nurses and laboratory technicians to medical doctors. The pooled analysis showed a
      sensitivity of 99.07% (95%CI 95.48 - 99.95%) and a specificity of 99.94% (99.72-100%).

      This will be a prospective study, collecting blood samples from individuals receiving PrEP at
      one of two drop-in centers in Bangkok, Thailand:

      Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand (RSAT) and Service Worker IN Group (SWING). RSAT is a
      community-based organization for people with sexual diversity (MSM, gay, transgender,
      lesbians, and bisexual), and has specific programs for MSM, transgender and lesbian health.
      SWING promotes HIV prevention among male and female sex workers and provides both community
      outreach and clinical services at their center. Both locations offer PrEP as part of their
      service.

      Participants who visit the DICs seeking to receive PrEP will undergo HIV testing at several
      time points: before receiving PrEP (Month 0), one month after starting PrEP (Month 1), three
      months after starting PrEP (Month 3), and every three months thereafter.

      The routine HIV testing algorithm in the DIC is as follows:

        -  Determine® HIV-1/2 (Alere Medical Co., Ltd.), if reactive followed by two other rapid
           3rd generation immunochromatography anti-HIV tests. These are all rapid tests on whole
           blood as collected by finger prick, performed by trained community health workers in the
           DIC.

      For the purpose of this study, two additional blood samples will be taken by phlebotomy to
      perform:

        -  The Anonymous Clinic HIV-testing algorithm (see Annex 1): Architect® HIV-1/2 Combo
           (Abbott), if reactive followed by Determine® HIV-1/2 (Alere) and Elecsys® HIV combi PT
           (Roche). Samples that are non-reactive by Architect® HIV-1/2 Combo will be tested by
           pooled NAAT using Aptima HIV-1 RNA qualitative assay (Hologic®) to screen for acute HIV
           infection. Samples that are positive by Architect®, Determine® and Elecsys® will be
           tested by second generation EIA (which detects IgG Ab) to identify acute HIV infection
           (i.e. 4th generation reactive and 2nd generation negative). This is the standard HIV
           testing algorithm performed at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic Laboratory and will
           identify acute HIV infections.

        -  Alere™ HIV Combo Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect Both the regular DIC algorithm and the
           Anonymous Clinic algorithm will be used as comparator methods.

    <description>The HIV test results will be reported by number and proportions for Alere™ HIV Combo, Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect and the standard HIV testing algorithms; the number of acute HIV infections detected by Alere™ HIV Combo and Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect will be calculated as the proportion of the total number of participants who have confirmed acute HIV infection. The reliability and validity assessment of Alere™ HIV Combo and Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect will be compared with the standard HIV testing and we will present the results as the sensitivity, specificity, number of false positives and number of false negatives. The measuring agreement of HIV test results will be compared between the standard HIV testing algorithms and Alere™ HIV Combo, the standard HIV testing algorithms and Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect.</description>

    <description>At each visit, the DIC HIV testing algorithm will be performed, and additionally, HIV testing by the Anonymous Clinic Algorithm, the Alere™ HIV Combo and the Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect. The latter two tests will be performed at the DICs. In case of an invalid result for the Alere™ HIV Combo or the Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect, the test will be repeated. If the repeated test is invalid after the second attempt, it is recorded as 'invalid result'.</description>

    <description>The feasibility assessment will comprise of two components:
User's perspective: A questionnaire will be developed and used to assess the level of satisfaction among community health workers performing the two new tests, using a 5 point Likert scale. We will assess the training and manual, the use of the test, the user's confidence, troubleshooting and technical support components and resolving problems.
The laboratory component: For each test we will evaluate:
The percentage of assays completed
The percentage of assays incomplete (i.e. invalid result on two attempts)
Reasons for incomplete assays, e.g.
The sample could not be delivered to the strip or cartridge correctly
Invalid control
Results could not be interpreted
