  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous single-center studies have indicated gadolinium-enhanced stress CMR perfusion
      imaging has excellent diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease and negative clinical
      event rates, with its diagnostic accuracy exceeding nuclear scintigraphy. However, current
      prognostic evidence supporting clinical use of stress CMR is limited by study size,
      single-center settings with a predominance of academic centers, and a lack of &quot;real-world&quot;
      study design. Large-scale multicenter real-world evidence from a registry will provide the
      much needed information to guide evidence-based clinical adaptation that benefits patient
      care.
