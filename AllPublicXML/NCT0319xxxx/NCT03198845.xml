  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 80 patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomized into two groups, including
      video game group and exercise group.

      Physical activity, quality of life, emotion, and balance were assessed at before treatment
      and follow-up assessments, including at after 2 week of treatment; after 4 weeks of
      treatment; and 1 and 3 months after treatment is terminated, respectively.
