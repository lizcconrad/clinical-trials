    <textblock>
      The RUTIVAC-1 study is a Phase I Clinical Trial designed to evaluate the systemic and mucosal
      immunological response and provide safety information after the use of RUTI® administration
      to individuals with NMIBC.

      The study will enroll individuals treated with Transurethral resection of bladder tumor
      (TURBT), diagnosed to have high-risk Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and suitable
      candidates for BCG therapy and who meet all eligibility criteria.

      Forty individuals will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to receive two subcutaneous shots of
      25 μg RUTI® or placebo. After vaccination, individuals will receive the standard intravesical
      Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy with induction course (weekly BCG for six weeks) and
      maintenance course (three courses of weekly BCG for three weeks at 3, 6 and 12 months after
      induction).

      After the last intravesical BCG administration (BCG15, end of Interventional Phase)
      immunological assays will be performed and data will be analyzed. At the end of the
      Interventional Phase the blind will be opened, except for the study physicians who will
      remain blind during all the follow-up. All the individuals will be followed up for three
      years since TURBT.
