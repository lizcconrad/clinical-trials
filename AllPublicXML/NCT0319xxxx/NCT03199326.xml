    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a collaborative care
      practice for infants investigated by state Child Protective Services (CPS) for suspected
      maltreatment. Recognizing the vulnerability of infants referred into CPS in the first year of
      life, as well as the frequent contact of infants with health care providers in the first year
      of life, the investigators will conduct a RCT to measure the impact of a collaborative
      practice model linking CPS caseworkers with primary health care providers during an
      investigation for suspected infant maltreatment. With this trial, the investigators will ask
      (3a) Can a collaborative practice model improve parent-reported infant health-related quality
      of life 6 months following child welfare involvement for suspected infant maltreatment? and
      (3b) Does a collaborative practice model impact repeat child welfare involvement for
      suspected child maltreatment over 6 months?

    <description>CPS caseworkers will be randomized to collaborative or comparison practice. For any infant investigated by a caseworker in the collaborative practice, the caseworkers will conduct a standard CPS investigation. Additionally, caseworkers will seek parental permission to contact an identified primary health care provider at two points in the CPS investigation for information sharing related to health needs, social risks, and recommended interventions.</description>

    <description>CPS caseworkers will explain collaborative care to parents, ask parents to allow communication with an infant's primary care provider, and have willing parents sign a release allowing communication with the infant's provider during the investigation. Caseworkers will make at least two attempts to contact identified providers with parental consent. In the first week, caseworkers will contact the provider, identify the infant, and summarize the child maltreatment concerns. The caseworker will ask whether the provider recognizes any additional strengths or vulnerabilities for the infant. Prior to case closure, caseworkers will provide a summary of investigation findings, disposition, and service referrals including placement changes, safety planning, family preservation, and community resources, with a summary letter delivered to the provider after case closure.</description>
