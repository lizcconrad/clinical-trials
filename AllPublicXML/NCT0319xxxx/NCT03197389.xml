  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts: a retrospective study, and a prospective clinical study with
      pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) (Phase 0).

        1. Retrospective study (S58910):

           This is a retrospective analysis to study the expression of PD-L1 in ER/PR negative
           breast tumors and to correlate this PD-L1 expression with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
           (TILs), proliferation, expression of apoptosis and clinical outcome (development of
           distant metastases).

        2. Phase 0 study:

      This is a Phase 0 single center, open-label, non-randomized, study in patients with early
      ER/PR negative breast cancer. Patients will be treated with one injection of Pembrolizumab
      (Keytruda®) administered intravenously at 200 mg 10 +/- 4 days before surgery. This phase 0
      study will consist of 2 cohorts; cohort A will include patients who are scheduled for upfront
      surgery. Cohort A1 will include patients with Her2 negative tumors and Cohort A2 patients
      with Her2 positive tumors. Cohort B will include patients who received neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (with anti-Her2 therapy if Her2 positive) and who have clear signs of residual
      tumor on imaging after finishing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (i.e. on imaging estimated residual
      tumor size of at least 10 mm). Cohort B1 will include Her2 negative tumors and Cohort B2 Her2
      positive tumors. The injection will be given in the oncological outpatient unit. Patients
      will be monitored carefully for the development of adverse experiences/events. Adverse
      experiences/events will be evaluated according to criteria outlined in the NCI Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 agent or
             co-inhibitory T-cell receptor therapy (e.g. OX40-CD137, CTLA-4)

         15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and

             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
