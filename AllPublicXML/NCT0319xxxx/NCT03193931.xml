             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

             usage of highly effective contraception methods (allowed methods of contraception,
             meaning methods with a rate of failure of less than 1% per year are combined (estrogen
             and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation, progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation, intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS),
             vasectomized partner, bilateral tubal occlusion, sexual abstinence. If an oral

             condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge) has to be applied
             additionally). Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             (serum β-hCG) at Screening.

         22. Any psychiatric illness that would affect the patient's ability to understand the
             demands of the clinical trial
