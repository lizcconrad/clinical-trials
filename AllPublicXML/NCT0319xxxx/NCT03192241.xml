  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to pilot an intervention of providing manual breast
      pumps at hospital discharge to low-income, first-time mothers and to generate initial
      estimates of the effect of this intervention on exclusive breastfeeding rates at 3 months (12
      weeks). In this pilot study, we will compare receipt of a breast pump and brief instructions
      of its use to the active control of receipt of a children's book and brief instructions about
      reading with baby. As a secondary objective, we will investigate mothers' attitudes and
      opinions about the manual breast pump intervention with the goal of fine-tuning it to best
      fit mothers' needs before a larger, multi-center trial. To support our objectives, we will
      examine the following specific aims:

        1. To test the intervention of providing low-income, first time mothers with a manual
           breast pump at hospital discharge on exclusive breastfeeding rates at 12 weeks.

           Hypothesis: Among low-income first-time mothers, receipt of a manual breast pump at
           hospital discharge will lead to improved exclusive breastfeeding rates at 12 weeks
           postpartum compared to receipt of a children's book.

        2. To use qualitative methods to determine best practices associated with successful
           implementation of a breast pump intervention to improve breastfeeding rates among
           low-income, first-time mothers.

        3. To test the effect of receiving a children's board book during the birth hospitalization
           on parents reading to the baby at 3 months (12 weeks).
