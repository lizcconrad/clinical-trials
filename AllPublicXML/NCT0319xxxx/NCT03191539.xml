  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate more objectively, through an imaging technique such as
      ultrasound, changes in joints and entheses of patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PAs)
      who will start treatment with Apremilast after the failure of other therapies such as
      synthetic DMARD (metrotrexato , Leflunomide ...).

      The hypothesis of the study is that the technique of ultrasound can demonstrate the efficacy
      of Apremilast in the treatment of patients with active PAs
