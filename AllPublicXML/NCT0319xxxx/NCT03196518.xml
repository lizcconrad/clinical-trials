  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate a new imaging test that may allows the investigators to
      predict the uptake of radioactive iodine by thyroid cancer faster than the current standard
      and that does not interfere with the uptake of radioactive iodine used for therapy.

    <description>The intervention is the administration of a single dose of approximately 5-10 mCi 18F-TFB (mass &lt;= 50 μg) for imaging purposes. This will be followed by a 30 minute dynamic PET/CT study immediately after injection, at 60 minutes (+/- 10 min) and 4 hours (+/- 15 min) post injection. The second and third scan will last up to 30 minutes.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed thyroid carcinoma of
             follicular origin (including papillary and its respective variants).

          -  Patients should have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal
             lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan or MRI. Tumors in
             previously irradiated fields may be considered measureable if there is evidence of
             tumor progression after radiation treatment.

          -  RAI-refractory and/or metastatic disease on structural imaging (CT, MRI) with RAS or
             RET mutations or BRAF-wild type thyroid cancer

          -  Scheduled to undergo RIT for metastatic disease

          -  No recent treatment for thyroid cancer as defined as:

               1. No prior 131I therapy is allowed &lt; 6 months prior to initiation of therapy on
                  this protocol. A diagnostic study using &lt; 400 MBq of 131I is not considered 131I
                  therapy.

               2. No external beam radiation therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy on
                  this protocol. (Previous treatment with radiation for any indication is allowed
                  if the investigator judges that the previous radiation does not significantly
                  compromise patient safety on this protocol.)

               3. No chemotherapy or targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is allowed
                  &lt; 4 weeks prior to inclusion on this protocol.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (or Karnofsky ≥60%).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and bone marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.5x10^9/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

               -  Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x institutional ULN

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2x
                  institutional ULN unless it is related to the primary disease

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL OR calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault
                  formula) ≥ 50 mL/min OR 24-hour urine creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min

          -  Negative pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting the study in premenopausal
             women. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without pregnancy test if
             they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for ≥ 1 year.

          -  Fertile men and women must use an effective method of contraception during treatment
             and for at least 6 months after completion of treatment as directed by their
             physician. Effective methods of contraception are defined as those, which result in a
             low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly
             (for example implants, injectables, combined oral contraception or intra-uterine
             devices). At the discretion of the Investigator, acceptable methods of contraception
             may include total abstinence in cases where the lifestyle of the patient ensures
             compliance. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant, lactating, or breast feeding women.

          -  Patients unable to follow a low iodine diet or requiring medication with high content
             in iodide (amiodarone).

          -  Patients who received iodinated intravenous contrast as part of a radiographic
             procedure within 3 months of study registration. Those that have had iodinated
             intravenous contrast for CT imaging within this time frame may still be eligible if a
             urinary iodine analysis reveals that the excess iodine has been adequately cleared
             after the last intravenous contrast administration.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with study procedures.
