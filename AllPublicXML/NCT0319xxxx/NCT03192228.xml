  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic education programs allows in diabetic patients to promote self-care and better
      perception of the disease

      Our multidisciplinary program of therapeutic education regroups in one day: individual
      interview, nutritional workshop, self-monitoring blood glucose workshop, physical activity
      and glycemic objectives workshop.

      At the end of the program, individual and personalized goals are given to the patient.

      This study aims to evaluate this program success rates and the psychological, anamnesis, and
      sociological factors linked to success.
