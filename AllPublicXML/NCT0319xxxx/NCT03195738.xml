  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effects of a cognitive
      intervention for youth following concussion
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussion, a form of mild traumatic brain injury, is one of the most commonly reported
      injuries in youth. While most recover quickly, a substantial subset (30-58.5%) report
      symptoms that persist at one month with a reported 11-14% who continue to report symptoms
      beyond three months. Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines for treatment that
      address occupational (meaningful activity) concerns for youth who are slower to recover
      post-concussion. It is postulated that a top-down rehabilitation approach with metacognitive
      strategy training as the core of the intervention might be effective.The Cognitive
      Orientation to Occupational Performance (CO-OP) Approach is a metacognitive strategy training
      approach with a growing body of literature supporting it's value in improving participation
      in meaningful activity and achieving self-selected occupation-based goals for adults with
      brain injury and youth with moderate to severe brain injury.Given the long-term occupational
      concerns in youth with persistent post-concussion symptoms, and the lack of evidence based
      interventions for these youth, it is hypothesized that the CO-OP Approach may facilitate
      return to meaningful occupation in this population.

    <measure>Change in Occupational Performance and Satisfaction (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure will be administered at baseline, within one week post intervention (i.e. at 8 weeks) and again at 3 month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>A change score of two points is considered clinically significant (McColl, Carswell, Law, Pollock, Baptiste, &amp; Polatajko 2006). During a semi-structured interview, clients are asked to identify a minimum of five occupational performance issues (OPI's). The five most important OPI's as determined by the client are identified using a ranking scale (1=not important at all to 10=extremely important) and then ranked according to performance and satisfaction with performance using 10 point scales (Performance score of 1=not able to do it to 10=able to do it extremely well; Satisfaction score of 1=not at all satisfied to 10=extremely satisfied).</description>

    <measure>Change in mood and self-concept (Beck Youth Inventories)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure will be administered at baseline, within one week post intervention (i.e. at 8 weeks) and again at 3 month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Youth Inventories for children and adolescents-Second Edition (BYI-II) (Beck, Beck, Jolly, &amp; Steer, 2005) provides insight into youth's negative thoughts about their self, life and future, and feelings of sadness, worry, guilt, anger, disruptive behaviors and self-worth. The depression, anxiety and anger inventories were administered. Higher scores are associated with negative affect. Psychometric properties are strong with high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficients from .91-.96) and test-retest reliability (r=.83 to .93).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms (Post Concussion Symptom Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure will be administered at baseline, within one week post intervention (i.e. at 8 weeks) and again at 3 month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The 22-item Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) (Sady, Vaughan, Gioia, 2014) (adolescent version) measures the presence and severity (on a scale of 1 (not a problem)-6 (severe problem)) of concussion symptoms. The PCSI has moderate to good inter-rater reliability (r=0.4 to r=0.5), test-retest reliability (r=0.62 to 0.84) and internal consistency (r=0.72 to 0.93). Higher scores indicate presence of more/worse symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Cognitive Orientation to Occupational Performance (CO-OP) Approach will be delivered over 10 30-60 minute sessions over a seven week period as follows: 2 sessions/week for 3 weeks, then 1 session per week for 4 weeks. In the CO-OP intervention participants are first assisted to identify 3-5 occupation based goals which will be the focus of the intervention sessions. Over the course of the 10 intervention sessions, participants are guided to learn and practice problem solving using a metacognitive strategy, &quot;Goal-Plan-Do-Check&quot; applied to their self-identified goals. Study therapists use 'guided discovery' an iterative technique to facilitate problem solving by the participant to develop plans to work toward their goals and to evaluate their progress. Intervention takes place in the location that is most meaningful for the participant's selected goal (e.g. home, school, playground etc.). Participants are provided with a work book to track progress.</description>
