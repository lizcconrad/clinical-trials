      Description of the role of a post-operative external beam radiotherapy in patients with
      differentiated thyroid cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of post-operative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in differentiated thyroid cancer
      is still discussed considering the low clinical aggressiveness and the availability of
      ablative 131Iodine therapy. However, there is a subgroup of tumors which lose the ability to
      capture Iodine over time. This study wants to describe the role of a post-operative external
      beam radiotherapy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
