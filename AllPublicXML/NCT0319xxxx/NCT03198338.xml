  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Transversus Abdominis Block (TAP) block is known to be an effective means of reducing
      patient pain after abdominal surgery. In the meantime, the general TAP block has been studied
      in patients who were in the recovery room and the ward after surgery. The purpose of this
      study was to determine the effect of pain reduction and opioid saving effects in patients
      with TAP block in ICU settings.

      This study is a prospective study in a single institute of Seoul National University Bundang
      Hospital and is assigned to the test group and the control group by random assignment. In
      both groups, PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) was used as a post-operative pain control
      modality. In the Intervention group, a 0.25% Bupivacaine was used for transverse nerve block
      , and normal saline was used for placebo(control) group

      The TAP block will be performed within 1 hour after entering the intensive care unit (ICU) in
      double blinded state
