    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab with
      or without pembrolizumab works in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread to
      other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab,
      pertuzumab, and pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab with pembrolizumab may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will improve the progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, relative to a regimen of
      paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab in patients with newly documented HER2-positive
      metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will improve the overall survival (OS) relative to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.

      II. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab will improve the overall objective response, as assessed by
      RECIST 1.1 criteria, relative to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.

      III. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab will improve the duration of objective response, as assessed by
      RECIST 1.1 criteria, relative to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.

      IV. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab will decrease the incidence of subsequent brain metastases in
      patients without known brain metastases at study entry relative to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.

      V. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will contribute to increased patient-reported fatigue in comparison to a
      regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.

      VI. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab will contribute to poorer patient-reported physical function in
      comparison to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.

      VII. To determine the toxicity profile of the two treatment regimens using patient-reported
      symptom assessments in addition to standard adverse event reports.

      VIII. To determine the immune-related toxicity profile of the two treatment regimens.

      IX. To determine the cardiac safety profile of the two treatment regimens. X. To identify
      potential biomarkers that can predict benefit from the addition of pembrolizumab in patients
      with newly documented HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with a regimen of
      paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will improve the progression-free survival and overall objective response, as
      assessed by immune-related response criteria immune-related response criteria (irRECIST),
      relative to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.

      II. To determine the feasibility and added value of frequent assessment of toxicity using
      patient-reported outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (PRO-CTCAE) with electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) reporting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      ARM I: Patients receive pertuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and
      trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment with paclitaxel repeats every 3 weeks for up to 9 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel as in Arm I. Patients also
      receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to
      2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and
      then every six months for 2 years.

          -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis
             or history of interstitial lung disease

          -  Has received a live-virus vaccination within 28 days of randomization; seasonal flu

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or excipients, (e.g., Cremophor EL)

          -  Other non-malignant systemic disease that would preclude the patient from receiving
             study treatment or would prevent required follow-up
