  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : findings have been reported about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids on decreasing the
      incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective was to compared the effects of
      walnut (plant omega-3 fatty acid) and fatty fish (marine omega-3fatty acid) and their
      combination on cardiovascular risk factors. In this clinical trail 99 over weight and obese
      female adults were on three diets with fish (300 g), walnut (6 walnuts) or fish-walnut (150g
      fish and 3 walnuts) for 12 weeks. Three diets were Low in calories and similar. Fasting blood
      sugar, inflammatory markers serum lipids, coagulation factors (fibrinogen, D-Dimer), oxidant
      markers and leptin were measured at baseline and the end of study. Anthropometric indices,
      blood pressure levels, food records were assessed before study and by 3-wk intervals until
      the end of trail

    <description>Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) will measured twice after 15 min of rest in sitting and comfortably position using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. Blood sugar (FBS) will measured on the day of blood sampling and quantified by colorimetric method by the glucose oxidize technique. hs-CRP will measured by The Immunoturbidimetry method with with a polyclonal antibody (Pars Azmoon Inc). Serum concentrations of, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) will quantified using commercially available enzymatic reagents (Pars Azmoon, Tehran, Iran) adapted to an autoanalyzer system (Selectra E, Vitalab, Holliston, the Netherlands)</description>

    <description>A trained dietitian will measured height, body weight and waist circumference. Body weight will measured using calibrated digital scales (SEACA) with light clothing and no shoes and will recorded to the nearest 100 g. Height will estimated using tape, while shoulders will in normal position and not wearing shoes. BMI will calculated as body weight in kg divided by height in m2.We asked participants to record the duration of all physical activities in 24h for three days at weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12 of the intervention. Then the recorded physical activities were multiplied by the relevant metabolic equivalents task hours per day (MET-h/d) and were calculated the MET.h/d values of all activities to obtain the value of physical activity in a day. the recorded physical activities will multiplied by the relevant metabolic equivalents task hours per day (MET-h/d) and will calculated the MET.h/d values of all activities to obtain the value of physical activity in a day.</description>
