      To test the safety and efficacy of giving targeting CD138 or B-cell maturation antigen T
      cells in treating patients with CD138 or BCMA positive multiple myeloma that is refractory to
      further chemotherapy or relapsed(after stem cell transplantation or intensive chemotherapy).

      Background:

        -  Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory into
           patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to
           kill cancer cells. Genetically engineered lymphocyte (CART) therapy has showed good
           safety and efficacy in treatment of lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
           Researchers want to see if this helps people with multiple myeloma.

      Objective:

        -  To test the safety and efficacy of giving targeting CD138 or B-cell maturation antigen T
           cells in treating patients with CD138 or BCMA positive multiple myeloma that is
           refractory to further chemotherapy or relapsed(after stem cell transplantation or
           intensive chemotherapy).
