  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a genetic historical cohort study in a military combat recruits - this study
      does not examine a specific treatment but rather examines a statistical link between medical
      history of traumatic fractures, clinical diagnosis of stress fractures and the presence of
      unique SNPs in subjects DNA.

    <textblock>
      Finding a statistically significant correlation between SNPs associated with BMD -
      Osteoporosis, with recruits who were diagnosed with Stress Fractures during basic and
      advanced infantry training. Greatest importance will be shown in the power calculation: we
      suggest that the P-value threshold value of the selected SNPs be adjusted downwards to a
      lower threshold of P &lt;1.0x10-3 (i.e. equal to 50 independent tests).

      We will examine the presence or absence of 96 SNPs - 76 SNPs that were previously validated
      as significant with low BMD or Osteoporosis and 20 SNPs offered for Stress Fractures with
      recruits who were diagnosed with Stress Fractures during basic training (basic training lasts
      four months - six months) using SNP Genotyping Analysis-TaqMan Assays. The buccal swab will
      be taken from recruits who served for at least four months and up to six months in the IDF -
      Infantry Corps. Buccal swabs will be taken at a single meeting from recruits serving between
      4 and 6 months in the IDF - Infantry Corps, which will be used to compare using SNP
      Genotyping Analysis-TaqMan Assays with the SNPs listed above. In addition, in this single
      meeting, the recruits will fill out a questionnaire in which they will be asked whether they
      experienced traumatic fracture from their youth to the time of filling the questionnaire
      (recruits who experienced traumatic fractures but are not diagnosed with stress fractures
      constitute as a control group in the research).

      There will be one meeting with recruiters who served for at least four months and up to six
      months in the IDF - infantry. At this meeting, the recruits will be sampled with a buccal
      swab and fill out a questionnaire.
