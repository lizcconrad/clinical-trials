  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the current sun safety policies and practices in programs for
      young children and to determine the willingness of stakeholders to incorporate more
      protective measures.

      The primary hypothesis is that children in Head Start programs, daycare programs, elementary
      schools, or summer camps are exposed to significant UV radiation throughout the day, and are
      not adequately protected with sunscreen, hats, or sun-protective clothing. The secondary
      hypothesis is that these programs value sun safety as an important health behavior, but
      probably do not have the funding avilable to make it a priority.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims are:

        1. To assess current exposure to sun and UV in programs of children participating in an
           early childhood educational program.

        2. To assess current policies regarding sun protection and sunscreen use in programs for
           early childhood education.

        3. To assess the current attitudes towards sun safety among caregivers and teachers in
           programs for early childhood education.

        4. To explore association of sun protective behaviors with risk factors such as
           socioeconomic status, per student classroom budget, program setting (i.e. urban,
           suburban, or rural), race/ethnicity, size of school program, school budget for supplies,
           and ages of children enrolled in program.

      The sample of stakeholders, who will be surveyed, is consistent with samples used in our
      prior research. A sample size of 250 phone interviews will be adequate to show trends in sun
      safety policies among early education programs. Power analysis is based on the use of sun
      protection, our primary outcome. Our preliminary data show that 15% of schools almost always
      or always schedule outdoor activities to avoid times when the sun was at peak intensity. The
      sample size required to sensitively detect a 20% difference in using sun protection between
      those that comply with recommendations and those that do not is 250 respondents assuming an
      alpha &lt; 0.05 and power &gt;= 0.8 in a two-tailed test on a two-group sample. This sample size
      will adequately power the study for detecting 30% difference in sun protection use between
      the two groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Someone 18 years of age and older, who is a teacher, administrator, aide, or other
             staff member of a Head Start program, day care program, camp, or elementary school.

          -  Participants agree to a structured phone interview regarding their program's policies
             for sun safety, their opinions on certain health behaviors, and the demographics of
             their student population.

          -  Participants will be interviewed on the phone and guided through a questionnaire which
             should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who do not know their program's procedures for sun protection will not be
             able to participate, but may transfer the phone call to another colleague who can
             answer the questions accurately. Participants without the ability to speak in English
             will be excluded from the study.
