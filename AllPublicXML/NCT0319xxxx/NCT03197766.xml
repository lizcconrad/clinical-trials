  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent and design of this Phase 3 study is to assess BMN 111 as a therapeutic option for
      the treatment of children with Achondroplasia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter study with
      approximately 110 subjects, aged 5 to &lt; 18 years old. Subjects with documented Achondroplasia
      confirmed by genetic testing will have been enrolled in Study 111-901 for at least a 6-month
      period immediately before entering into the 111-301 study. Eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups: placebo or BMN 111 at 15 μg/kg. The route of
      administration is subcutaneous injection and the frequency is daily.
