  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess feasibility and safety of the Prostatic Urethra Lift (PUL) procedure in patients with
      acute urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-centre, prospective evaluation of PUL and retrospective review of
      invasive surgery as potential comparator. The study is intended to be conducted at up to 3
      different centres in the United Kingdom to enrol up to 50 subjects. Subject follow-up visits
      are at post-procedure, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.
