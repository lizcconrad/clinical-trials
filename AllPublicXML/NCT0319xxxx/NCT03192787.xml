      The purpose of this study is get to know what and how Sanwujiaowan capsule in hospital
      results in drug-induced liver injury or adverse drug reactions from a cohort event monitoring
      as registration research.

      In order to improving monitoring drug-induced liver injury or adverse drug reactions of
      Chinese medicine containing Radix Polygoni Multiflori in hospital, registry study is suitable
      method in this area. Otherwise, nested case control study is used to find out the mechanism
      of drug-induced liver injury. Calculate the incidence of drug-induced liver injury or adverse
      drug reactions is one of the main aims for this study. Safety surveillance on Chinese
      medicine containing Radix Polygoni Multiflori is an important problem that needs to be sorted
      out through large sample observational study. According to the relevant regulations of the
      CFDA, 3000 cases need to be registered at least. The aim population is who using Sanwujiaowan
      capsule 's with abnormal liver function before medication from June 2017 to December 2018.
