        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged ≥18 years and ≤75 years;

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed inoperable locally advanced
             (Stage IIIb, not suitable for multidisciplinary treatment), metastatic (Stage IV), or
             relapsed non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer. Diagnostic result of
             non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer obtained based on sputum cytology should
             be immunohistochemically confirmed. If a variety of tumor ingredients are mixed, the
             main cell types should be classified;

          -  ECOG score of 0-1 points;

          -  At least one measurable lesion can be evaluated according to RECIST1.1 criteria;

          -  Patients who have not received systemic anti-tumor therapy of locally advanced or
             metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (if the subject received adjuvant
             therapy after completing the radical treatment of early non-small cell lung cancer,
             but then the disease relapsed, the subject can be enrolled. In this case, the end time
             of the adjuvant therapy is required to be more than 6 months from the time of the
             first administration of this study, and various toxic reactions resulting from the
             adjuvant therapy should have recovered (≤ Grade 1 by CTCAE 4.03 criteria, except for
             alopecia);

          -  Expected survival time ≥24 weeks;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Central squamous cell carcinoma, and mixed gland squamous cell carcinoma with squamous
             cell as the main ingredient;

          -  ALK fusion gene is known to be positive;

          -  Medical history or examination shows thrombotic disease within 6 months prior to
             screening;

          -  Imaging shows signs of tumor invasion of large vessels, and the investigator or
             radiologist must exclude patients whose tumor has been completely close to or
             surrounded or invaded the lumen of large vessels (e.g., the superior pulmonary artery
             or superior vena cava);

          -  Patients with a past history of symptomatic brain metastases or meningeal metastases,
             or spinal cord compression;

          -  Patients who received palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions outside the chest
             within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drug;

          -  Patients who received major surgical procedures (including thoracotomy), or suffered
             from major trauma (such as fractures) within 28 days

          -  prior to screening, or need to undergo major surgery during the expected study
             treatment period;

          -  Patients who received a minor surgical procedure within 48 hours prior to the first
             treatment with Anivitis® QL1101 (the investigator judges whether there is bleeding
             tendency);
