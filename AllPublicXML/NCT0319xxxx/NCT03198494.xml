  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the feasibility and physiological effect of
      low-frequency (1 Hz) acoustic stimulation delivered during nocturnal NREM sleep in epilepsy
      patients. The long-term goal is to develop this protocol for daily, long-term use in a home
      setting, for nocturnal seizure and IED suppression

      1. To test the feasibility of wearing an earphone system delivering acoustic stimulation
           during a night of sleep in adult epilepsy patients monitored in an inpatient unit.

        2. To determine the acute physiological effects of low-frequency acoustic stimulation on
           interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) frequency during NREM sleep in adult patients
           with epilepsy in an ambulatory setting.

        3. To determine the feasibility of applying low-frequency acoustic stimulation in a
           long-term home setting in adult epilepsy patients with frequent nocturnal seizures.
