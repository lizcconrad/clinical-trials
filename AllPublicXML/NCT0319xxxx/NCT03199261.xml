      The study design is an Open-Label Randomized, Single-Dose, 2-way Crossover Bioequivalence
      Study with a washout period of 7 days. During each session, the subjects will receive a
      subcutaneous single dose of rE-4 (rE-4 Injection 10µg or rE-4 Freeze-dried Powder 10µg)
      administered 30min prior to the start time of a standard breakfast.
