    <textblock>
      Aiming to validate the use of bone age determined by ultrasound (BAUS) in Brazilian children,
      normal control students will be studied. X-Ray bone age (RXBA) and BAUS will be determined in
      500 children and adolescents of both genders, with chronological age varying from 6-16 years.

      Concordance analysis and the correlation between both BA determination methods will be
      performed.

      Bone age is a valuable method to recognize the maturation status of development and growth.
      Classical analyses is performed by using the Greulich and Pyle X-Ray measurement. Such
      analyses have some restrictions such as intra- and inter observer variability, and variable
      synchronicity of bone maturation.

      Bone age determined by ultrasound (BAUS) has been indicated as a fast and reproducible
      method, allowing decimal BA determination and avoiding the need for X-Ray.

      Our aim is to validate the BAUS method in Brazilian normal controls. School students of both
      genders, with age varying from 6 to 16 years will be included.
