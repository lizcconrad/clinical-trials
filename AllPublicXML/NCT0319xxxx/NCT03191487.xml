      The primary objective of this study is to compare an experimental organization for
      chemotherapy session planning based on early, standardized, and prioritized means of data
      transmission via secure e-mail (laboratory results) and the use of a smart phone (for
      clinical toxicity data) compared to the regular organization, in terms of the rate of
      prescriptions of chemotherapy prepared at the latest the day before a session and then
      administered in full (over a 6-month observation period) among colorectal cancer patients in
      need of cancer treatment in an outpatient setting.

      Compare the two arms of the study in terms of:

      A. each element contributing to the primary criterium;

      B. the quality of chemotherapy related care;

      C. logistics;

      D. patient satisfaction with respect to support for chemotherapy care;

      E. the feasibility and acceptability of the organization by patients will be assessed by the
      rate of optimal use of toxicity collection tools and patient satisfaction rates relative to
      the tool (experimental arm)

      F. Comparison of the overall cost of care in both arms and estimated cost of the strategy

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of prescriptions for chemotherapy in the outpatient clinic prepared at the latest the day before a session (except for predefined, limited stability products) and administered in full, per patient, during a follow-up period of 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This criterion is aggregated per patient but its components are collected for each prescription, according to the following coding:
Prescription prepared in advance and administered in full: 1
Prescription prepared in advance but not administered in full: 0
Prescription not prepared in advance : 0
For each patient, the sum of the results for each prescription will be the numerator. The denominator is the number of prescriptions during 6 months follow-up for each patient.
The limited stability products that will necessarily be prepared at the last minute are:
Aflibercept
Panitumumab

    <description>Systematic collection of clinical and laboratory toxicities (TXs) during the 2-4 days preceding a chemotherapy (CT) session (48H before a session (D-2 towards the end of the afternoon) and a maximum of 96h before sessions occurring on Mondays (D-4 towards the end of the afternoon). Clinical TX data will be collected via ChimioPal (a self-questionnaire administered by smartphone) and laboratory TX data will be collected via Apicrpyt (secure messaging service) or a fax-to-email service. Data flow management by a nurse dedicated to this activity in each centre will be implemented. If the results of the assessment do not authorize CT, additional assessments may be prescribed. If the experimental data transmission does not occur, the usual pathways will be implemented.
Patient training on how to use a smart phone and the questionnaire will be performed by a nurse before the start of the first chemotherapy session, with reminders at the following sessions if required.</description>
