      The study aims to investigate the effect of the Popliteal plexus block (PPB) on postoperative
      pain after total knee arthroplasty
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cadaver dissection studies have shown a spread of dye to the popliteal fossa and colored the
      popliteal plexus by injecting in the distal part of the adductor Canal.

      The popliteal plexus is formed by contribution from the tibial and the obturator nerves.

      Investigators hypothesized that a PPB may reduce postoperative pain after total knee
      arthroplasty.
