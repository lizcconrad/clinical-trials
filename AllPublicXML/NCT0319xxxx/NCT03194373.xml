  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and
      tolerability of the investigational drug combination of palbociclib (Ibrance) plus
      carboplatin in patients with metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer.

    <description>The primary clinical objective of this trial is to estimate disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks in patients with metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer treated with carboplatin and palbociclib. DCR will be defined as either CR (Complete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.), PR (Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.) or SD (Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.) at 12 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented progressive squamous cell head and neck cancer with or
             without metastases, not amenable to curative treatment; or the patient has documented
             refusal of curative treatment.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status:
             an attempt to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of daily
             life. The score ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and 5 is death.

          -  Presence of measurable disease by CT scan per RECIST v1.1.

          -  Age ≥18 years.
