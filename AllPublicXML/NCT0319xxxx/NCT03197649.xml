      Evaluate mature burn scars before and after treatment with CO2 for patients age 3-21 while

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser phototherapy has gained growing acceptance and popularity for management of burn scars.
      The most commonly used laser is the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Laser. At this institution, the
      investigator has used CO2 for management of Burn Scars since 2012. While the existing
      literature and the investigator's anecdotal experience thus far has been positive overall,
      there is no conclusive evidence to support that CO2 does indeed improve the quality of mature
      burn scars

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate mature burn scars before and after
      treatment with CO2 for patients age 3-21 while comparing the treated areas to an untreated
      control area in the same patient.
