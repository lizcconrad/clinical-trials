    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, open-label randomized phase 1 trial of neoantigen DNA vaccine
      alone vs. neoantigen DNA vaccine plus durvalumab in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      patients following standard of care therapy. Patients with newly diagnosed clinical stage
      II-III TNBC are eligible for enrollment. Patients will receive standard of care therapy
      including chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy as clinically indicated. Following
      standard of care therapy, patients will be randomized to receive either a neoantigen DNA
      vaccine alone, or a neoantigen DNA vaccine + durvalumab.

    <description>The first neoantigen DNA vaccine injection will take place up to 90 days following the completion of standard of care therapy. The day of the first vaccine injection will be referred to as Day 1
The schedule of vaccination is Day 1, Day 29 ± 7, Day 57 ± 7, Day 85 ± 7, Day 113 ± 7, and Day 141 ± 7 with at least 21 days between injection days
For patients who are randomized to the neoantigen DNA vaccine plus durvalumab arm, the neoantigen-specific T cell response will be assessed prior to Day 85. If a neoantigen-specific T cell response is present, durvalumab will be started on Day 85, and will be administered Q4W at a dose of 1500 mg over the course of 60 minutes. If a neoantigen-specific T cell response is not present, these patients will be replaced but may continue to receive the neoantigen DNA vaccine on study. They will not be transferred to the vaccine-only arm.</description>
