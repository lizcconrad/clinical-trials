  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is now recognised as an increasing clinical problem in
      children. Steatosis without significant liver cell injury or fibrosis is the most common form
      of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in both adults and children. Studies in the adult
      population have variably suggested that steatosis is a benign nonprogressive condition and
      NASH is recognised as a potentially serious condition with significantly risk of morbidity
      and mortality.

      A growing body of evidence suggests that children with NASH frequently show histopathological
      features that differ from those of adults. The prevalence of this pattern in a wide range of
      paediatric cases as well as other histopathological lesions and their relevance and
      prognostic significance in children with NAFLD remains to be determined. Thus the
      investigators would like to conduct a study of biopsies and clinical information to document
      the histological features of paediatric NAFLD, to explore the natural history of paediatric
      NAFLD, and to determine the frequency and prognostic value of these features.
