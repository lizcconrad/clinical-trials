  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main limitation in bone regeneration is the lack of vascularization of the newly shaped
      tissue. The main objective of this project is to check if the simultaneous differentiation of
      dental mesenchymal stem cells toward osteoblastic and endothelial lineage permits to obtain a
      new pre-vascularized tissue engineered bone construct.

      We will then evaluate the boosting effect of the conditionned medium on cell differentiation
      and production of a prevascularized bone construct.

      This project aims to develop a new pre-vascularized tissue engineered bone construct, using
      human cells of a simple and non invasive tissue source: dental pulp.

      We will isolate mesenchymal stem cells from dental tissue of wisdom teeth, extracted from
      patients aged between 13 and 17 years old.

      The objectives are: (i) to assess in combination the endothelial differentiation and
      osteoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (immature third molar); (ii) to study
      the boosting effect of the conditionned medium on cell differentiation and production of a
      prevascularized bone construct.

      The differentiation will be monitored by evaluation of biosynthesized matrix, bone
      mineralization (immunohistochimie, Westen Blot), histological response (Von Kossa, Alizarin
      Red) and presence and quantification of pseudo-vascular structures (angiogenesis assay),
      compared to reference value (commercial differentiation medium).
