    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase I/Ib study of crenolanib combined with ramucirumab/paclitaxel as
      second line therapy for patients with advanced/metastatic adenocarcinoma of the esophagus,
      GEJ or stomach. Patients will be enrolled in two phases; dose escalation phase and dose
      expansion phase.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MTD of oral continuous dosing of crenolanib (3 different doses) plus ramucirumab/paclitaxel in patients defined as the highest dose level in which &lt;2 of 6 patients develop a DLT. The DLT is based on the 1st cycle adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DLT is based on the first cycle (35 days) adverse events. If at least 2 of 3 or 2 of up to 6 patients experience a DLT at the starting dose level, then the study will be paused and the starting dose will be re-assessed. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level in which &lt;2 of 6 patients develop a DLT. This will constitute the first part of the study which will enroll a maximum of 18 patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, GEJ or stomach.

          -  Stage IV disease or locally advanced/unresectable tumors

             this therapy

          -  Known pre-existing liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B or C,
             nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis)

             within 7 days of enrollment

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure &gt;140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm
             Hg on repeated measurement) despite optimal medical management

          -  Active or clinically significant cardiac disease

          -  Patients with arterial thrombotic events, such as cerebrovascular accident or
             myocardial infarction, within 6 months of enrollment
