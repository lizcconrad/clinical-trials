  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare two human milk fortifiers with different protein
      content and LCPUFA in a group of very low birth weight infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, third party-blinded, randomized, controlled, parallel- group,
      prospective trial comparing growth with a liquid human milk fortifier with higher protein
      content and LCPUFA and a control powdered human milk fortifier added to breast milk and fed
      to premature infants. The trial will be conducted in 11 centers in Chile. The enrollment
      period is expected to be approximately 18 months. To allow for dropouts, approximately 160
      participants will be randomized.
