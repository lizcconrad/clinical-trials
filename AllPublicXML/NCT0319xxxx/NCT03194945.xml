  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short-term intensive insulin therapy(SIIT) is able to reverse β cell dysfunction and induce
      glycemic remission in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. However, proportion of
      patients with response gradually decreases over time. There is no consensus on which
      treatment should be given in order to maintain the benefit in glycemic control and β cell
      recovery. In this multi-center, randomized, controlled study, effects of various sequential
      treatments ( metformin, linagliptin and combined with both drugs) on long-term blood glucose
      control as well as preservation of β cell function after SIIT were investigated.

      In total, 448 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who meet the inclusive criteria
      will be enrolled in eight centers in China. After baseline assessments, all patients will be
      treated with insulin pump to achieve and maintain euglycemia for 2 weeks. After completion of
      intensive treatment, insulin pump will be stopped. Different treatments will be applied to
      patients for 48 weeks according to randomization: Group A: Linagliptin 5 mg Qd + Metformin
      0.5 g bid; Group B: Linagliptin 5 mg Qd; Group C: Metformin 0.5 g bid; Group D: No oral
      drugs. Primary endpoint is proportion of patients achieving glycosylated hemoglobin A1C &lt;7%
      at the end of the study. Secondary endpoints include proportion of patients achieving
      glycosylated hemoglobin A1C &lt;6.5% at the end of study; differences in β-cell function ,
      insulin sensitivity, GLP-1 and glucagon secretion among treatment groups, and differences in
      adverse events among treatment groups.
