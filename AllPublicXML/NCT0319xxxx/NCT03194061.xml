  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of hypofractionated radiation therapy
      and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin for locally advanced head and neck cancer in a
      high volume brazilian center.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate if concomitant cisplatin and hypofractionated radiation therapy wold be feasible
      in a brazilian population.

      Patients eligibility criteria:

      older than 18 years old Biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx, larynx and
      hypopharynx. Stage III an IV, with no distant metastasis. ECOG performance status 0-2.
      Adequate renal and liver function. Good status for radical treatment

      Treatment considered feasible if:

        1. Patient receive at least 90% of radiation dose (18 of 20 fractions of 275cGy)

        2. Patients receive at least 3 of 4 weekly cycles of cisplatin (35mg/m2)

        3. Treatment length up to 35 days.

        4. Grade 4 toxicity lower than 25%
