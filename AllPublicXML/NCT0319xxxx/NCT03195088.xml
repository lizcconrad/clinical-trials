  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of single
      rising doses of BI 473494 in healthy male subjects.

      The secondary objective is the exploration of PK including dose proportionality, and PD of BI
      473494 after single dosing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             [BP], Pulse Rate [PR]), 12-lead Electrocardiogram [ECG], and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass Index [BMI] of 20.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice [GCP] and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure [BP], Pulse Rate [PR]
             or Electrocardiogram [ECG]) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication if that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply
