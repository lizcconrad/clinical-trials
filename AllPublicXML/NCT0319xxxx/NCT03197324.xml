  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the drug-drug interaction in your body when given the
      study drug, bexagliflozin, with the heart failure medication digoxin. The study will evaluate
      whether bexagliflozin effects the amount of digoxin in your blood and how safe the study drug
      is and how well the study drug is tolerated when taken with digoxin.
