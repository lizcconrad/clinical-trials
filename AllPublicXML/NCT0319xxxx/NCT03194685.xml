    <textblock>
      A Phase 1/2a dose escalation and dose ranging study of FF-10101-01 in subjects with relapsed
      or refractory acute myeloid leukemia to determine the safety, tolerability, PK and
      preliminary efficacy. A total of 9 cohorts will be enrolled in Phase 1 to establish the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). Phase 2a will consist of up to 3 dose levels (high, medium, and
      low) of which subjects with FLT3 mutations will randomly be assigned.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive FF-10101-01 orally once a day repeated every 28 days =1 cycle Frequent
      blood draws will be collected to measure pharmacodynamic parameters and pharmacodynamic
      activity.

      Disease assessments, including bone marrow aspirates, will be performed at the beginning of
      cycles 1-3, and every 3 months thereafter. Subjects who demonstrate objective response or
      stable disease will be allowed to continue therapy with FF-10101-01 until , observation of
      unacceptable adverse events, or until the subject is no longer deriving benefit based on the
      opinion of the investigator.

      For Phase 2a long term phone follow-up for assessment of overall survival will also occur.

Recurrence (Relapse after confirmed CR): Reappearance of leukemia blats in peripheral blood or ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable in the Investigator's opinion to any other cause (e.g., bone marrow regeneration after consolidation therapy) or appearance of new dysplastic changes.
PR: Defined as ≥50% decrease in bone marrow blasts to 5% to 25 % abnormal cells in the bone marrow, or CR with ≤5% blasts if Auer rods are present Treatment failure: defined as failure to achieve CR, CRi, CRp or PR</description>
