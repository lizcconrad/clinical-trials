      The primary purpose of this trial is to test the feasibility of implementing a meditation
      program in the perioperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study involving 30 adult patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery. Investigators will test the feasibility of implementing a meditation program
      in the perioperative period. Patients will be randomized to one of three groups: those who
      complete Isha Kriya (IK) meditation before and after surgery, those who complete
      postoperative IK meditation only, and those who receive the standard of care with no
      meditation intervention. In addition to testing feasibility, the investigators will explore
      whether a meditation program can affect recovery after surgery. Patients enrolled will be
      followed postoperatively for up to one month to assess their cognitive function, pain, and
      sleep. Blood will also be collected for analysis of biomarkers of inflammation.

    <description>In this descriptive, feasibility study, evaluation of feasibility will include adherence to meditation intervention (total number of sessions completed).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function - MoCA</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and hospital discharge (approximately 5 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) will be administered at baseline and hospital discharge. This is a validated test that measures cognitive impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative Day 1 through hospital discharge (approximately 5 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain will be assessed with a standard 11-point scale. Pain scores will be obtained by asking the subject.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Opioid Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperatively through 48 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The total opioid dosage received in the intraoperative period and the first 48 hours postoperatively will be abstracted from the medical record.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Sleep - PSQI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in sleep will be measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) which measures quality and patterns of sleep during the past month. This will be completed at baseline and 1 month postoperatively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Sleep - PROMIS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 1 month postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in sleep will be measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance and Sleep Related Impairment questionnaires. The PROMIS sleep questionnaires assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality and sleep impairment and will be completed weekly from baseline through 1 month postoperatively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarkers of inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, preoperatively, and Day 2 postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be collected at baseline and on postoperative Day 2 to investigate whether the use of a meditation regimen results in a reduction in inflammation and stress secondary to surgery. Subjects randomized to meditation before surgery will also have blood collected preoperatively. Specimens will be frozen for analysis at a later date.</description>
