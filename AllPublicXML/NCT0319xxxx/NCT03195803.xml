  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-pharmacological study evaluating the differential effects of a computerized
      cognitive stimulation program according to the existence or not of white matter
      hyperintensities in elderly with mild cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are increasingly recognized as a factor determining the
      heterogeneity of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and have been associated to executive and
      processing speed impairment. Cognitive interventions in MCI remain quite limited for these
      MCI with vascular profile and studies often distinguish patients by clinical subtypes rather
      than brain profile before an intervention. Considering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data,
      this study investigated the effects of a computer-based cognitive stimulation (CCS) program
      on MCI with WMH compared to MCI without WMH.
