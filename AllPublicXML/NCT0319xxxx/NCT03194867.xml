  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of isatuximab (also known as
           SAR650984) and cemiplimab (also known as REGN2810) in patients with relapse/refractory
           multiple myeloma.

        -  To compare the overall response of the combination of isatuximab and cemiplimab versus
           isatuximab alone in patients with RRMM based on International Myeloma Working Group
           (IMWG) criteria.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy as assessed by clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of
           response (DOR), time to response (TTR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall
           survival (OS).

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of isatuximab and cemiplimab when given in
           combination.

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of isatuximab and cemiplimab when given in combination.

      The duration of the study for a patient will include a period for screening of up to 21 days
      and 3-month post treatment follow up. The cycle duration is 28 days. Patients will continue
      treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, consent withdrawal, or any
      other reason.

          -  Has received a live-virus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start.
             Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.

          -  Has allogenic haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant.

          -  Poor bone marrow reserve.

          -  Poor organ function.
