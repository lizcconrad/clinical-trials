  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of AMCPR (Augmented-Medication CardioPulmonary
      Resuscitation: administration of additional vasopressin to titrate to arterial diastolic
      blood pressure over 20 mmHg) on cardiopulmonary resuscitation results and outcomes in
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients receive standard advanced cardiac life
      support according to the 2015 AHA guideline, including chest compression, intubation,
      ventilation, defibrillation, drug administration, including epinephrine and antiarrhythmic
      drugs if indicated, in the emergency department.

      A research associate generates a random sequence using Excel software, and assignment of
      participants to their respective groups will be undertaken by the principal investigator.

      Arterial line insertion is performed within 6 minutes after randomization and diastolic blood
      pressure will be monitored.

      If diastolic blood pressure is &lt; 20 mmHg, drugs (vasopressin 40 IU or normal saline) will be
      administered for two times during CPR.

      Arterial blood gas analysis will be analyzed for 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after arterial
      line insertion or termination of CPR.

      End-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations is monitored in real time during CPR and recorded
      every minute.

      The resuscitated patients receive standard post cardiac arrest care according to the 2015 AHA
      guideline.

    <measure>Sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)</measure>

    <description>CPCR result Achievement of sustained ROSC was declared when patients had a palpable pulse for more than 20 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of arterial diastolic blood pressure assessed by arterial line</measure>
    <time_frame>during CPR, every 10 seconds after arterial line insertion until the termination of CPR due to ROSC or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Successful adult resuscitation is more likely when diastolic blood pressure is &gt; 25 to 30 mmHg.
The 2015 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend &quot;trying to improve quality of CPR by optimizing chest compression parameters or giving vasopressors or both&quot; if diastolic blood pressure is &lt;20 mmHg.
Investigators will record the hemodynamic monitor in real-time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of end-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations assessed by capnography</measure>
    <time_frame>during CPR, every one minute after endotracheal tube insertion until the termination of CPR due to ROSC or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>End-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations during CPR are primarily dependent on pulmonary blood flow and therefore reflect cardiac output.
Failure to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations &gt; 10 mmHg during adult CPR reflects poor cardiac output and strongly predicts unsuccessful resuscitation.
Investigators will record the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations in real-time.</description>

    <measure>Improvement of acid-base status measured by blood-gas analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>during CPR, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minute after arterial line insertion and termination of CPR</time_frame>
    <description>Data are insufficient to make a conclusions, acid-base status can reflect the status of the ischemic insult on a cellular level. The changed of acid-base status during CPR may be associated with outcomes in cardiac arrest patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of lactate level measured by blood-gas analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>during CPR, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minute after arterial line insertion and termination of CPR</time_frame>
    <description>In previous studies, low lactate level was prognostic factors for favourable outcome after sustained ROSC.
Lactate level can reflect the status of the ischemic insult on a cellular level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Low level of neuron specific enolase level</measure>
    <time_frame>24, 48, and 72 hours after ROSC</time_frame>
    <description>Low level of neuron specific enolase level is known as a prognostic indicator of neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Good neurological outcome based on Cerebral Performance Categories Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>checked at hospital discharge (participants will be followed for duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>CPC 1. Good cerebral performance: conscious, alert, able to work, might have mild neurologic or psychologic deficit. CPC 2. Moderate cerebral disability: conscious, sufficient cerebral function for independent activities of daily life. CPC 3. Severe cerebral disability: conscious, dependent on others for daily support because of impaired brain function. CPC 4. Coma or vegetative state: any degree of coma without the presence of all brain death criteria. CPC 5. Brain death: apnea, areflexia, EEG silence, etc.
Good neurologic outcome is defined as CPC 1 and 2.</description>
