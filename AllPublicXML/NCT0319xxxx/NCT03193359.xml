    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a participant using an investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.</description>

    <description>Mean change from Baseline (28-days prior to first treatment) in frequency (number) of headache days during the 28-day period ending with Weeks 12 and 24. A headache day was defined as a calendar day [00:00 to 23:59] for which the participant reported ≥ 4 continuous hours of headache per patient diary.</description>
