  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited agents have been approved after standard first and second line treatment. Regorafenib
      and Trifluridine/Tipiracil (TAS-102) are still not approved in China.Apatinib has shown
      significant efficacy in refractory advanced gastric cancer regarding PFS and OS with
      controllable toxicity.This study is aimed to explore the efficacy,safety as well as
      predictive biomarker in advanced colorectal cancer failed to standard therapy in Chinese
      population.
