  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effectiveness of reducing discomfort during flexible nasal endoscopy using
      simple distraction techniques compared to topical anaesthetic spray and a control group that
      does not receive topical anaesthetic spray or a distraction technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomised controlled study patients will be randomly allocated into one of four
      groups; the first group will receive topical (co-phenylcaine) anaesthetic spray without
      distraction, the second group will receive topical (co-phenylcaine) anaesthetic spray with
      distraction, the thirds group will receive no topical (co-phenylcaine) anaesthetic spray
      without distraction and the fourth group will receive no topical (co-phenylcaine) anaesthetic
      spray with distraction. The distraction technique that will be employed is counting backwards
      from 30 to 1 in even numbers only. All flexible nasal endoscopies will be performed by either
      of the two most senior clinicians involved in the study. The procedure will be carried out in
      standard outpatient clinic room setting. Post procedural discomfort assessments will be
      undertaken using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Power calculations shows that &gt;24 patients
      would result in an adequately powered study (&gt;80%). Data analysis will be undertaken by SPSS
      and independent T-tests will be performed to assess for statistical significance.
