    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate in obese patients the changes induced by bariatric
      surgery on the various components of the physical condition and their postoperative evolution
      following an intervention combining a physical activity program (aquabike vs bicycle) with or
      without protein supplementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical condition will be evaluated in obese patients before surgery and 1, 4, 6, 12, 18 and
      24 months after surgery.

      Between 1 and 4 months after surgery, participants will be assigned to one of the
      postoperative care groups:

        -  Control

        -  Control + protein supplementation

        -  Training in aquabike

        -  Training in aquabike + protein supplementation

        -  Bicycle training
