    <textblock>
      Project Narrative This 3-city proposal seeks to address HIV disparities among young (ages
      15-24) Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in a multilevel intervention to identify,
      engage and retain, high-risk HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected urban YBMSM in the HIV
      prevention and treatment cascade. The mobile-enhanced engagement intervention (MEI) is driven
      by the expressed and self-determined needs of each HIV infected and uninfected participant
      and includes care navigation, engagement, treatment and adherence. MEI also includes a
      supplemental Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment (SBIRT), to support
      YBMSM who face barriers accessing substance use treatment. By building upon existing case
      management services and flexibility to be adapted across ages and maturity and for prevention
      services, this intervention has the ability to transform networks, HIV and prevention care in
      YBMSM in cities with very high primary and secondary HIV transmission.

      Project Summary the U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2020 calls for increasing access to care
      and improving outcomes of people living with HIV and targeting biomedical prevention efforts
      (including access to pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) where HIV is most heavily concentrated.
      Baltimore, MD; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, PA (BWP) are disproportionately burdened by
      high rates of new cases of HIV infection, with disproportionate rates in young Black men who
      have sex with men (YBMSM) aged 15-24. High incidence underscores the need for increased
      identification, linkage and initiation in HIV and preventive care for YBMSM. Grants focused
      on high rates directly address NIH research priorities to reduce health disparities in the
      incidence of HIV, in antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes or in high HIV prevalent or
      high-risk areas.

      This innovative proposal seeks to test, treat and retain YBMSM living in BWP along the
      prevention and treatment continuum using the following aims:

      Aim 1. Identify and recruit young (ages 15-24) Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in 3
      urban cities who are (1) HIV-infected, not virally suppressed; and (2) high-risk
      HIV-uninfected YBMSM, including gender variant and questioning men, using respondent driven
      sampling (RDS) with targeted seed identification; Aim 2. Compare the efficacy of two study
      arms (mobile-enhanced engagement intervention (MEI) vs. standard of care (SOC)) to achieve
      sustained retention (measured by â‰¥ 4 follow up visits per 18-months) and engagement in HIV
      care (measured by durable viral suppression (HIV VL &lt; 200 copies/ml) and substance treatment
      among 240 HIV-infected YBMSM who are not virally suppressed and recruited from RDS; and Aim
      3. Modify and implement mobile-enhanced intervention for 225 high-risk HIV-uninfected YBMSM,
      recruited from RDS to promote linkage, retention and engagement of pre-exposure prophylaxis
      (PrEP) and substance treatment uptake over 12-months, comparing younger (15-19) and older
      (20-24) participants.
