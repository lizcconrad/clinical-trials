      A protocol named as &quot;CIP-2015&quot; for patients with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome may reduce the rate
      of GvHD.

      The details of the protocal followed with:

        1. Conditioning regimen Busulfan 16 mg/kg in total, Fludarabine 160 mg/m2 in total.

        2. GvHD Prophylaxis:

      Rabbit antihuman thymocyte globulin 7.5 mg/kg post-transplant cyclophosphamide (CY) (50
      mg/kg.d on days +3 and +4) Cyclosporine or tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, on days +5

      Patients were enrolled in CIP-2015 Protocol at the Capital Institute of Pediatrics (Beijing).
      The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (40 mg/m2) from days −6 to −3, and Busulfan
      was administered intravenously for 4 days, from days -5 to -2，using dose targeting based on
      therapeutic drug monitoring. Thymoglobulin (Sanoﬁ, Cambridge, MA) 7.5 to 10 mg/kg (cumulative
      dose over 4 days) was administered over 4 days, from days -5 to -2. Bone marrow (BM) and PBSC
      were infused on day 0, followed by post-transplant CY (50 mg/kg/day, on days +3 and +4). To
      protect against hemorrhagic cystitis, MESNA (2-mercaptoethane sodium sulfonate) was
      administered at 150% of the CY dose. Post grafting immunosuppression with mycophenolate
      mofetil and tacrolimus commenced on day +5 and extended until days +28 and +84, respectively.
      Tacrolimus was tapered off by day +90 if there was no GVHD.
