  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examining whether men with greater Avoidance to Femininity subscores using the Male Role
      Norms Inventory - Short Form will demonstrate differences in skin care knowledge, attitudes,
      and behaviors, compared to men with lower subscores.

      This purpose of this study is to examine whether a man's adherence to traditional masculine
      norms correlates with his skin care attitudes or behaviors. A stronger understanding of these
      associations may enable dermatologists to better understand their patient's perception of
      skin care. The utility of this knowledge lies in creating outreach interventions and
      informing risk stratification. The study also seeks to determine whether skin care knowledge
      varies by adherence to masculine norms. This knowledge can be used to guide patient education
      in a clinical setting.
