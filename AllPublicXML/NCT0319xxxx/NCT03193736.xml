  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the implant and IOP lowering effects with
      or without glaucoma medications. The procedure will be a stand-alone surgery. Overall, the
      patient will be asked to perform several examinations up to 24 months after surgery.

      The primary efficacy objective of the present study is to show the IOP reduction under
      medication 6 months after surgery compared to medicated diurnal IOP at screening.
