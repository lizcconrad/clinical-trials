  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the healing of peri-implat tissue following surgical
      uncovering with the adjunctive use of Chlorohexidine (CHX) gel.

      Patients who received implants in our department, and scheduled for surgical uncovering of
      the implants will be asked to participate in this clinical trial (40) Patients from
      Department of periodontology, Rambam Health campus, Haifa in Israel will be recruited to
      Randomized clinical trial; patients will be divided randomly in to 2 groups:

        1. Control: following uncovering of the implant a 4 mm height healing abutment will be
           screwed to the implant (the standard treatment modality) without using Chlorohexidine
           gel or any other gel.

        2. Test group: following implant exposure this group will receive Chlorohexidine 1% gel
           (Corsodyl®) the gel will be applied on the abutment as well as on the implant internal
           hex and then a 4 mm healing abutment will be connected.
