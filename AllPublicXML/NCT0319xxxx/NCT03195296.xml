  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves orbitopathy (GO) is an inflammatory eye disease associated in 95% of patients with
      Graves' hyperthyroidism (GH), in ~3-4% with hypothyroid autoimmune thyroiditis, and in ~1-2%
      with thyroid autoimmunity in the absence of thyroid dysfunction, the former known as
      euthyroid GO. The pathogenesis of GO is autoimmune, with the TSH-receptor being considered
      the major autoantigen, thereby establishing a pathogenetic link between the thyroid and
      orbital tissue. Thus, TSH-receptor is expressed by orbital fibroblasts, where it forms a
      complex with the IGF-1 receptor. Unlike GH, which is notoriously caused by TSH-receptor
      stimulating autoantibodies, GO is believed to reflect cell-mediated autoimmunity, as
      suggested by studies showing a Th1-like pattern of cytokine release by primary cultures of
      orbital infiltrating lymphocytes from GO patients. On the other hand, a role of B lymphocytes
      has emerged in recent years based on the observation that the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
      rituximab has a beneficial effect on GO activity, as demonstrated by a recent randomized
      clinical trial in which rituximab was compared with intravenous glucocorticoids (GC), being
      the former the standard treatment of moderately-severe GO. The explanation for the findings
      was that B lymphocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of GO as antigen-presenting cells.
      However, in spite of the above mentioned promising observations, another randomized clinical
      trial in which rituximab was compared with placebo provided opposite results. Thus, rituximab
      had no effect at all on GO. Data from the two studies were confronted and major differences
      between the two cohorts emerged, especially concerning GO activity, leading to the conclusion
      that rituximab may be effective for active, but not for inactive GO. Rituximab has been
      employed also for autoimmune diseases other than GO, including type 1 diabetes. In the
      former, it was shown that the effectiveness of rituximab paralleled the presence of
      CD20-positive infiltrating lymphocytes in pancreas islets. We therefore postulated that
      something similar may occur in GO, because of which we planned the present, perspective,
      observational study, aimed at determining the presence and immunohistochemical features of
      lymphocytes infiltrating orbital tissues in patients with GO and to relate them with the
      clinical features of GO.

The number of infiltrating lymphocytes is the sum of the number counted in four representative fields.
The clinical activity score comprises 7 items (eyelid edema, conjuctival redness, eyelid redness, chemosis, caruncle edema, spontaneous eye pain, gaze-evoked eye pain), resulting in a numerical score going from 1 to 7</description>
