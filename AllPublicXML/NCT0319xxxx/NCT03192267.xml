      The primary goal of this study is to investigate lung disease, through pulmonary function and
      high resolution chest CT, in newly diagnosed RA patients. Extra-articular disease occurs in
      approximately 50% of RA patients, with the lung being a common site of involvement.

      Investigators goal is to understand the prevalence of lung disease in early RA patients and
      to better characterize it through questionnaires, imaging, and serum studies. Additionally,
      the goal is to find novel biomarkers to predict lung disease in RA patients.

      The purpose of this study is to gather, in a prospective manner, information on patients with
      newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and their disease course.

      Specific aims of the study are:

        1. To determine whether anti-malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA) adduct antibody
           concentrations predict CT changes consistent with RA-lung involvement.

        2. To determine whether anti-MAA antibody concentrations predict pulmonary function
           abnormalities in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second
           (FEV1), and diffusion lung capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and decline in these
           parameters at 1 year follow-up.

        3. To characterize the prevalence and classification of lung disease in early RA patients.

        4. To develop a cohort of newly diagnosed RA patients who can be followed long-term through
           electronic medical record (EMR) surveys, and biobank samples

      This study would be the first to look at the correlation of anti-MAA antibody with lung
      disease.

      The long-term goal of this study is to create an inception cohort of RA patients that can be
      followed for many years to come. This would be done through electronic medical records (EMR)
      and obtaining consent to contact patients in the future if needed. Subjects will be
      separately consented for UNMC rheumatologic serum and tissue biobank (IRB#292-14-EP), which
      would allow future use of early RA samples.

        The project is designed to study adult rheumatoid arthritis patients. While new onset RA is
        more likely to occur in young to middle age adults, we would also like to study those
        patients with more long standing disease. In particular, older RA patients with
        cardiovascular disease are of interest. Therefore, we are including a wide age range.
