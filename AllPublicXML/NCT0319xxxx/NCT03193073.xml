  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fibroblast growth factor-23-bone-kidney axis is part of newly discovered biological
      systems linking bone to other organ functions through a complex endocrine network that is
      integrated with the parathormone/vitamin D axis and which plays an equally important role in
      health and disease . Most of the known physiological function of fibroblast growth factor 23
      to regulate mineral metabolism can be accounted for by actions of this hormone on the
      kidney.In a recent experimental study, fibroblast growth factor-23 was shown to cause
      pathological hypertrophy in rat cardiomyocytes by &quot;calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T
      cells&quot; and treatment with fibroblast growth factor -blockers reduced left ventricular
      hypertrophy in experimental models of chronic renal failure.The current hypothesis is that,
      in healthy individuals, iron deficiency stimulates increased production of fibroblast growth
      factor23. At the same time, iron is thought to be the cofactor of enzymes taking part in the
      degradation of intact fibroblast growth factor-23 and thought to have a role in the excretion
      of degraded FGF-23 parts .Studies speculated that Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors
      may exert their anti-proteinuria effects at least in part by reducing serum fibroblast growth
      factor-23 levels although it is difficult from the results of this study to understand which
      comes first and brings about the other; decrease in proteinuria or fibroblast growth
      factor-23. Available evidence points to the deleterious effects of increased fibroblast
      growth factor-23 level in proteinuria, but the precise molecular mechanism still remains to
      be explored. An intricate and close association exists among parathormone, phosphorus, active
      vitamin D with FGF23, but the independent role of the latter on proteinuria is the least
      explored. Elaborately conducted studies that control effects of confounding factors
      adequately are needed to demonstrate the independent pathogenic role of FGF23.
