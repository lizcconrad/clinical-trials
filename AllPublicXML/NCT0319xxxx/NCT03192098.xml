    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled prospective clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of
      progressive esophageal dilation (up to 6mm) compared to esophageal dilation according to the
      rule-of-3 in patients with severe benign esophageal strictures. Patients will be followed up
      for 6 months. When recurrent dysphagia occurs within 6 months the patients will be dilated
      according to the previously allocated strategy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dysphagia due to benign esophageal stricture (e.g. surgery, radiation therapy, caustic
             ingestion, peptic injury, photodynamic therapy) requiring esophageal dilation

          -  Requiring first esophageal dilation for dysphagia due to a severe benign esophageal
             stricture with no patency for standard upper endoscope (9-10mm diameter)

          -  No history of esophageal endoscopic dilations for benign strictures the past 6 months

          -  Dysphagia for solid, semisolid or liquid food (dysphagia score ≥ 2 [Ogilvie]16, and
             dysphagia score ≤ 21 [Dakkak and Bennett]19, see appendix)

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient &lt; 18 years old

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to sign and date the informed consent

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with the follow-up schedule

          -  Patient is unable to understand informed consent and fill in the questionnaires due to
             a language barrier

          -  Patient is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant in the next 12
             month

          -  Patient is simultaneously participating in another drug or device study or the patient
             has completed the follow-up phase for the primary objective of any previous study less
             than 30 days prior to enrollment in this study

          -  Previous esophageal dilation for benign stricture within the past 6 months

          -  Patient with a life expectancy &lt; 12 months

          -  Patient with a known eosinophilic esophagitis or motility disorder (such as achalasia)

          -  Patients with a known malignant esophageal stricture

          -  Patients with a benign stricture due to a previous performed laryngectomy

        Endoscopic exclusion criteria:

          -  Benign strictures in the upper part of the esophagus too close to the cricopharyngeal
             muscle (for the purpose of this protocol, within 1½ cm of the upper esophageal
             sphincter)

          -  Patients with stricture ≥ 10 cm in length

          -  Patients with an active esophageal perforation, leak, fistula, or varices

          -  Stricture within necrotic chronically bleeding tumors

          -  Highly suspected esophageal malignancy

          -  Stricture within polypoid lesions

          -  Known or strongly suspected dysmotility esophageal disorder

          -  Patient with high suspicion for an esophageal web, Schatzki ring, eosinophilic
             esophagitis, or motility disorder (such as achalasia)
