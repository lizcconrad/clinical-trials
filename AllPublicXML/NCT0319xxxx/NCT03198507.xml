  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;test and treat&quot; strategy for treating dyspeptic patients who are H. pylori positive is
      rapidly becoming the standard of care. This study will test the effectiveness of RHB-105, a
      new triple therapy to treat H. pylori infection in dyspeptic patients against an active
      comparator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a, randomized, double blind, active comparator-controlled study of RHB-105 in adult
      subjects complaining of epigastric discomfort that have been screened and found to be
      positive for H. pylori infection via 13C UBT and gastric biopsy.

      The biopsy samples will also be used to conduct H. pylori antibiotic
      susceptibility/resistance assessment.

      The study will be conducted at up to 65 sites in the USA. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized in a ratio of 1:1 between the RHB-105 arm (n=222) and the active comparator arm
      (n=222). Subjects will receive RHB-105 or active comparator for 14 consecutive days.
      Eradication of H. pylori infection will be determined at Visit 5 based on 13C UBT testing
      conducted between 43 and 71 days after initiation of study drug therapy.

      All subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and have positive13C UBT will undergo
      upper endoscopy with sampling for culture and sensitivity testing (to rifabutin, amoxicillin,
      clarithromycin, and metronidazole) prior to randomization. After test of cure at Visit 5, all
      H. pylori eradication failures will receive susceptibility directed Standard of Care therapy
      based on initial culture results for subjects, and undergo repeat upper endoscopy for post
      treatment antibiotic susceptibility/resistance assessment.
