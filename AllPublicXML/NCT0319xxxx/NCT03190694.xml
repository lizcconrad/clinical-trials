  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the hypothesis that dapagliflozin lowers proteinuria in patients with
      non-diabetic chronic kidney disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite optimal treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) inhibitors, many
      patients with non-diabetic kidney disease show progressive kidney function loss, which is
      associated with high residual proteinuria. Novel treatment strategies are therefore required
      to further decrease proteinuria and to slow kidney function decline.

      Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose transport (SGLT2) inhibitor and inhibits the reabsorption
      of glucose and sodium in the proximal tubule. The increased natriuresis following
      dapagliflozin administration normalizes tubuloglomerular feedback resulting in a reduction in
      intra-glomerular hypertension, which is in turn manifested by acute reversible reductions in
      glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. Since many etiologies of non-diabetic nephropathy
      are characterized by intraglomerular hypertension, we hypothesize that dapagliflozin acutely
      decreases GFR and proteinuria in patients without diabetes at risk of progressive kidney
      function loss via a glucose independent hemodynamic mechanism.
