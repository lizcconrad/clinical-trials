          -  Subjects with a history of known central nervous system (CNS) metastases must have
             documentation of stable or improved brain imaging for at least 2 weeks after
             completion of definitive treatment. Definitive treatment may include surgical
             resection, whole brain irradiation, and/or stereotactic radiation therapy.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

             antineoplastic therapy.

          -  Last dose of any antineoplastic therapy greater than or equal to 2 weeks (including
             chemotherapy, small molecule inhibitors, radiation, and/or other investigational
             anticancer agents).

          -  Able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 2 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving steroid therapy of any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to first dose of trial treatment.
             Subjects who receive daily steroid replacement therapy serve as an exception to this
             rule. Daily prednisone at doses of 5 to 7.5 mg (or hydrocortisone equivalent doses) is
             an example of replacement therapy.

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., â‰¤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., less than or equal
             to Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.
             Note: Subjects with less than or equal to Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this
             criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they
             must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the
             intervention prior to starting therapy.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 2 weeks prior
             to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to
             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has known history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has
             current pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-MistÂ®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
