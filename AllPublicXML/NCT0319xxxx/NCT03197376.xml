  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the consistency of 3 batches of the Pneumosil vaccine by looking at
      the immune response in infants. In addition, the study will compare the immunogenicity of the
      Pneumosil vaccine to another WHO-prequalified vaccine, Synflorix.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 study in 2,250 healthy infants
      (6 to 8 weeks of age). Subjects will receive 3 doses of either PNEUMOSIL (3 groups receiving
      vaccine from different lots) or Synflorix (1 group) at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. The first
      675 randomized subjects will receive a booster dose of either PNEUMOSIL or Synflorix at 9
      months of age that matches the treatment assignment for the priming phase. Standard EPI
      vaccinations in The Gambia will be given concomitantly with all 4 doses of the study
      vaccines.

      The primary objectives are to demonstrate that the three lots of the Pneumosil vaccine is
      consistent by evaluating the immune responses, and to demonstrate that the immune responses
      generated by Pneumosil are non-inferior to those generated by Synflorix. The safety and
      tolerability of Pneumosil will also be evaluated.
