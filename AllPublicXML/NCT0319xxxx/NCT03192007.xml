      The goals of this study are:

        -  To optimize and evaluate multiple kidney MRI methods; and

        -  To investigate the potential of MRI in the assessment of transplant kidney functions; To
           achieve these goals, we will perform pilot MRI studies with kidney transplant patients.
           We will study if MRI can reflect different levels of kidney function. The investigators
           will also evaluate if MRI can differentiate causes for declining kidney function.
           Finally, the investigators will explore how MRI measures changes before and after
           medical treatment for worsening kidney function.

      You may be invited for MRI exams with different exam options. An MRI exam may use either of
      two types of MRI machines at the CMRR: the 3T scanner and the 7T scanner. You may also be
      invited for a multi-session exam. A description of the MRI exam types with different exam
      options and the types of multi-session exams is provided later in this document.

        The proposed studies are pilot studies to obtain preliminary data for the development of
        hypotheses and estimate the power for future large-scale studies. To accomplish the
        objectives of the proposed pilot studies, we will enroll a total of 140 renal transplant
        patients. Based on our previous experience, there will be about 20% patients who may
        withdraw after informed consent. Equal number of male and female subjects will be recruited
        for each patient group. In addition, the age of patients will be matched or ensured
        insignificant across the groups of the study objectives.
