      Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose-finding study of UCART123 administered
      intravenously to patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), followed by a dose-escalation
      stage in Relapsed or Refractory AML patients and a dose expansion stage in
      Relapsed/Refractory AML patients, and in poor-prognosis, newly diagnosed AML patients in the
      European LeukemiaNet (ELN) Adverse genetic risk group.

      This study's primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of Universal Chimeric
      Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting Cluster of Differentiation (CD) 123 (UCART123)
      administered to patients with relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed high-risk acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML), and to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of UCART123. The primary
      benefit expected from UCART123 for participating patients is a high degree of T-cell
      expansion that could induce high and sustained anti-CD123 activity, leading to durable
      remission in poor-prognosis patients with AML. Also, patients are expected to benefit from
      the immediate availability of UCART123 cells and the higher, more homogenous transduction
      success rate expected from healthy allogeneic cells, compared to autologous T-cells. The
      absence of cell-surface expression of the TCR complex on UCART123 eliminates the
      TCR-recognition of histocompatibility antigens, the primary mechanism of GVHD, and confers a
      &quot;universal&quot; character to UCART123, which circumvents the necessity of human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA) matching between donor and recipient.
