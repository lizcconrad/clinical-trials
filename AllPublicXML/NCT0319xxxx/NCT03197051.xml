  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial glycocalyx, the luminal structure of healthy vasculature, plays critical roles in
      regulation of inflammatory responses, vascular permeability, blood coagulation. It can be
      easily damaged by ischemia/reperfusion, hypoxemia, oxidative stress, endotoxin. Accordingly,
      the relationship between the shedding of endothelial glycocalyx and the prognosis of diseases
      such as diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, malignancy has been researched.

      In cases of cardiac surgery, patients cannot help but be exposed to ischemia/reperfusion,
      oxidative stress which can damage endothelial glycocalyx. In this research, the investigators
      would like to discover the impact of perioperative shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx on
      the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing valvular heart
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syndecan-1, Heparan sulfate serve as biomarkers of glycocalyx degradation. Both biomarkers
      will be measured 2 times, before the anesthetic induction, and immediately after weaning from
      cardiopulmonary bypass, during the valvular heart surgery.

      Postoperative acute kidney injury up to postoperative 48 hours, Composite morbidity and
      mortality up to postoperative 30 days will be checked.
