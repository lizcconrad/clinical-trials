  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will measure skin barrier function using noninvasive devices and sample their
      skin and blood to study the expression anti-oxidative enzymes, skin barrier proteins and
      inflammatory molecules. These results will be correlated with the disease severity in atopic
      dermatitis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40 healthy and 40 atopic dermatitis subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will be
      enrolled. Medical records will be reviewed pertaining to the subject's diagnosis of atopic
      dermatitis and specific therapeutic interventions.

      For atopic dermatitis subjects, AD severity will be assessed using Eczema Area and Severity
      Index (EASI). Study sites will be chosen by the investigator. One lesional and one
      nonlesional site on the trunk, upper, or lower extremities will be selected. Digital photos
      of the study skin site(s) will be taken. Skin barrier function indices (transepidermal water
      loss, pH, sebum and hydration levels) of an active lesion and adjacent nonlesional skin will
      be measured using noninvasive skin barrier measurement devices.

      Two 3mm punch biopsies will be performed over the same skin sites that skin barrier
      measurements were performed. One biopsy will be performed over an active AD lesion and
      another on adjacent nonlesional skin. Tissue will be sent out for immunohistochemical
      staining to study the expression anti-oxidant biomarkers. Five mL of peripheral venous blood
      will be collected for immunoassay to measure the level inflammatory cytokines.

      For healthy subjects, digital photo of the study skin site(s) over either the trunk, upper,
      or lower extremities will be taken. Skin barrier function indices (transepidermal water loss,
      pH, sebum and hydration levels) of skin be measured using noninvasive skin barrier
      measurement devices. One 3mm punch biopsy will be performed over the same skin site that skin
      barrier measurements were performed. Tissue will be sent out for immunohistochemical staining
      to study the expression anti-oxidant biomarkers. Five mL of peripheral venous blood will be
      collected for immunoassay to measure the level inflammatory cytokines.
