  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-pharmacological study evaluating the impact of a computerized cognitive
      stimulation program on verbal learning and on the progression white matter hyperintensities
      in elderly with mild cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      White matter hyperintensities (WMH) can appear in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and have
      been associated to executive, attention and processing speed deficits. Some findings indicate
      that the presence of WMH may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in addition to ÃŸ-amyloid,
      suggesting a greater vulnerability of MCI. One important challenge is to prevent or slowing
      down the progression of WMH. Few studies investigated the effects of computerized cognitive
      interventions in MCI with WMH, which deserve special attention. This study aim to investigate
      the effects of an intensive computer-based cognitive stimulation (CCS) program on the verbal
      learning in episodic memory in MCI with WMH and to explore the effects on the progression of
      WMH at 1-year interval.
