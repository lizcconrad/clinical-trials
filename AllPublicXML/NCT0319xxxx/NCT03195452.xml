    <textblock>
      Raltegravir (RAL) is a very effective antiretroviral drug with a favorable long term
      tolerability. RAL offers many advantages such as lack of drug-drug interactions, a good
      safety profile particularly on lipids, inflammation and bone parameters. Ral can be an very
      interesting for patient with comorbidities and comedications, intolerance or toxicities with
      their current ARV treatment. However its current formulation of one tablet of 400mg twice a
      day coul not suit many patients.

      A new once-a-day formulation of RAL has been developed, with two tablets of 600 mg QD.
      Pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers has shown that this dosing provides increased RAL
      exposure compared to the standard formulation of 400 mg given twice a day.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the maintain of virologic suppression with
      raltegravir 600mg 2 tablets qd as part of a triple antiretroviral regimen in virologically
      controlled patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults of both gender ≥ 18 years

          -  Signed informed consent form

          -  Documented HIV-1 infection

          -  Stable antiretroviral therapy for ≥ 6 months consisting of 2 NRTIs (TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC
             )+ a 3rd agent either as a once or twice daily regimen, unless there is intolerance
             requiring change of therapy. In this situation of intolerance, patient with less than
             6 months of current antiretroviral therapy will be allowed in the study.

        As soon as TAF/FTC will be available in France, patients receiving TAF/FTC + 3rd agent
        could be enrolled.

        Switch of TDF/FTC to TAF/FTC will be authorized as long as the change has occurred for more
        than 3 months prior to the screening visit. Such switch will be also allowed during the
        study, and, unless urgently needed, after the W24 visit.

        Patients on stable raltegravir 400 mg 1 tablet twice daily plus 2 NRTI can be enrolled;
        number of these patients will be limited to 30% of the total cohort.

          -  Indication to current change antiretroviral therapy for at least one of the following
             reasons :

               1. Intolerance or prevention of toxicity

               2. Presence of a comorbid condition justifying change of the 3rd agent

          -  Patients receiving raltegravir 400mg, 2 tablets in one daily intake

          -  Patients with prior virological failure on NRTI+PI/r based regimen can be enrolled as
             long as historical plasma genotype and/or screening DNA genotype demonstrate absence
             of resistance or possible resistance to any drug. Subjects with previous failure to
             any other antiretroviral regimen cannot be enrolled.

          -  Presence of possible resistance or resistance to any nucleoside reverse transcriptase
             inhibitor or integrase inhibitor on a historical plasma genotype.

          -  Presence of possible resistance or resistance to any non- nucleoside reverse
             transcriptase inhibitor on a historical plasma genotype, with the exception of

          -  Presence of resistance to any PI on a historical plasma genotype

        In case were historical plasma genotype being not available or incomplete, resistance
        genotype will be performed on DNA at screening visit. Full treatment and cumulative
