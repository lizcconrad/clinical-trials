  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized study which will be done at main campus Cleveland Clinic.
      The investigators will be comparing the colon cleansing by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale
      in participants undergoing colonoscopy as an inpatient at our hospital. Participants will be
      randomized to the the standard of care (4 Liter polyethylene glycol based preparation) or a
      low volume bowel preparation (sodium picosulfate, a stimulant laxative, magnesium oxide and
      anhydrous citric acid (SP/MC)). Both agents will either be administered as full dose the
      evening before or as split-dose on the evening before and on the day of the procedure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine if a 4L bowel cleansing agent is more effective than
      a low volume bowel preparation, and if the time of dosing (single dose night before vs split
      dose) of the bowel preparation results in better bowel cleansing in participants undergoing
      colonoscopy. Eligible participants undergoing colonoscopy with conscious sedation will be
      randomly assigned to one of two bowel preparations and one of two dosing schemas of bowel
      preparation. Participants not eligible for conscious sedation and are undergoing colonoscopy
      with general anesthesia will be randomized only to the single dose arms of the study.
      Participants will complete a questionnaire while drinking the bowel preparation to determine
      timing and tolerability of the bowel preparation.

    <description>Bowel cleansing efficacy will be measured using the Boston Bowel Prep Scale (BBPS). The BBPS divides the colon into 3 segments (right, transverse, left); each is scored from 0-3 (0=colonic mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared, 1=only a portion of the mucosa of the colon segment is seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid, 2=minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid but mucosa of colon segment is seen well, and 3=entire mucosa is seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid). A total BBPS score of 6 or greater AND 2 or greater in all segments will be defined as satisfactory bowel prep. BBPS score of less than 6 or less than 2 in any segment of the colon will be taken as unsatisfactory bowel cleansing in the final analysis.</description>

    <description>Participants in Group A will begin drinking the bowel preparation Golytely (4 liter Polyethylene glycol based preparation) at 4:00 PM on the day before colonoscopy - an 8-ounce glass of the bowel preparation every 10 minutes. Participants must finish drinking the bowel preparation by 7:00 PM, and may continue to drink clear liquids until midnight.</description>

Participants may continue to drink clear liquids until midnight. The next day, 4 hours before the scheduled time of colonoscopy, participants will be asked to drink an 8 ounce glass of bowel preparation every ten minutes for a total of 8 glasses over no more than 1.5 hours. Participants may continue to drink clear liquids until 2 hours before the scheduled time of colonoscopy.</description>

At 10:00 PM, participants will drink another 5 ounces of the bowel preparation, and will then be asked to drink at least three (3) additional glasses of clear liquids by midnight.</description>
