  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need to restore water losses resulting from physical activity has become established and
      diffused into international consensus for healthy individuals or high-performance athletes.
      However, the influence of fluid replacement when administered during and after exercise on
      cardiorespiratory parameters, cardiac autonomic modulation, and subjective perceptions of
      effort and pain of individuals with autonomic alterations known as the coronary arteries
      remain poorly understood. In this sense, this study intends to investigate the influence of
      hydration on cardiac autonomic modulation, cardiorespiratory parameters, subjective
      perception of exertion and pain of coronary arteries submitted to aerobic exercise in the
      model of a cardiovascular rehabilitation session. A total of 31 individuals will be recruited
      in this study and will perform four standardized cardiovascular rehabilitation sessions. Only
      in the second and the fourth session will the volunteers be instructed to ingest a quantity
      of water predetermined by the evaluator, based on the loss of body mass measured in the first
      and the third sessions. The outcomes (autonomic modulation, cardiorespiratory variables and
      perceptions) will be evaluated before, during and after exercise. The results of this study
      will enable professionals working with this population to implement awareness strategies on
      the importance of fluid intake in cardiovascular rehabilitation programs.
