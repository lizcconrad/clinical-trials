    <textblock>
      The Corazón de la Familia study is a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of a
      novel family-focused lifestyle modification intervention to reduce risk for type 2 diabetes
      and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among Hispanics/Latinos. Facilitated by community health
      workers, the family-focused intervention engages two members of a family in an educational
      program addressing lifestyle behaviors to support sustained engagement in healthy lifestyles
      among Hispanics with high risk for type 2 diabetes or CVD. In this study, we will conduct a
      randomized controlled trial using a 2-group design and compare the short-term and long-term
      impact of the family-focused active intervention to an individual-focused control condition
      on biological and behavioral type 2 diabetes and CVD risk factors. Furthermore, we will
      examine outcomes of participants in the family-focused intervention to determine how each
      family member's engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and level of support for the other
      family member's engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors affects their own and their
      partner's outcomes.

      The Corazón de la Familia study is a randomized controlled trial conducted to examine if a
      novel family-focused lifestyle modification intervention is more effective in reducing risk
      for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) than an individual-focused lifestyle
      modification intervention. We will enroll 220 Hispanic family pairs or dyads, of whom one
      member has two or more risk factors for type 2 diabetes or CVD but does not have type 2
      diabetes or CVD. The second member of the family dyad may or may not have type 2 diabetes or
      CVD or may or may not be at risk for type 2 diabetes or CVD. Of the 220 family dyads, 110
      will be randomly selected to participate in the family-focused intervention and 110 will be
      randomly selected to participate in the individual-focused intervention. The interventions
      for both groups will be provided by community health workers. Both groups will receive eight
      educational sessions about healthy lifestyle behaviors and support to address personal and
      environmental barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors. After the eight sessions, the
      community health workers will follow up with participants once a month by phone over the next
      12 months. Primary outcomes include short-term and long-term impact of the family-focused
      active intervention compared to the individual-focused control condition on type 2 diabetes
      and CVD biological risk factors (for example, blood pressure and weight) and behavioral risk
      factors (for example, physical activity and tobacco use). Outcomes are measured at baseline,
      immediately post-intervention, and at the end of the 12 month period of the study for both
      groups.

    <intervention_model_description>We will conduct a randomized controlled trial with Hispanic family dyads using a 2-group design (Corazón de la Familia active intervention versus control condition) to test effects of a type 2 diabetes and CVD risk reduction intervention at 3 (short-term) and 12 (long-term) months. For dyads randomized to the active intervention, the participant with 2 or more CVD or type 2 diabetes risk factors (index participant) and their co-participating family member will attend 8 sessions that provide type 2 diabetes and CVD risk reduction and lifestyle modification education. For dyads randomized to the control condition, only the index participant will attend 8 educational lifestyle modification sessions. Participants in both groups will receive monthly follow up phone calls up through 12 months post-baseline. The sessions for both the intervention and the control group and the monthly post-intervention phone calls will be provided by community health workers.</intervention_model_description>
