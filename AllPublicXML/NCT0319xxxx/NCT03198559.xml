  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically reduces Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
      replication leading to restoration of immune function and a near normal life expectancy, but
      treatment is lifelong and there is no cure. The major barrier to a cure is the persistence of
      long lived cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T-cells that contain a &quot;silenced&quot; form of HIV,
      called HIV latency.

      The purpose of this research is to investigate whether it may be possible to reduce the
      amount of dormant HIV infection in immune cells, by &quot;turning on&quot; or activating the virus and
      hence force it out of the latently infected memory T cells. This leads to production of HIV
      by the cell, which will either die or will be recognized and eliminated by the immune system.
      As very few T cells are latently infected with HIV, the death of these cells is not expected
      to affect the function of the immune system and further infection of new cells is expected to
      be prevented by ART.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One strategy aimed at reducing the frequency of latently infected cells in HIV-infected
      individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of pharmacological agents to reverse
      HIV latency, thereby initiating virus-mediated cell lysis or immune-mediated killing. Recent
      clinical trials of latency reversing agents (LRAs) in HIV infected subjects on ART, including
      histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and the anti-alcoholism drug disulfiram, have shown
      that inducing an increase in Cell Associated Unspliced (CA-US) HIV RNA or plasma HIV RNA is
      possible. Yet, these interventions did not have a demonstrable effect on the frequency of
      latently infected cells or time to viral rebound after cessation of ART, potentially because
      latency reversal alone didn't trigger an adequate immune response or cell death or that the
      potency of latency reversal with a single-agent intervention over a very short period of
      time, lacked sufficient potency, as suggested by recent in vitro studies. It is highly likely
      that long-term remission off ART will require interventions that lead to both a reduction in
      latently infected cells and an increase in HIV-specific immunity, therefore identifying a
      strategy to increase viral antigens on the surface of latently infected cells will be a key
      component of this strategy.
