    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether the plasma concentration-time profile and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of suvorexant (MK-4305) in participants with impaired renal function
      are similar to those observed in healthy participants; and will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of suvorexant both in participants with impaired renal function and in healthy
      participants.

      Study Design:

      This study plans to enroll 16 participants in Part I (8 participants with severe renal
      impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants) and 32 participants in Part II (8
      participants with moderate renal impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants;
      and 8 participants with mild renal impairment and a control group of 8 healthy participants).

      Part II will be conducted only if the primary hypothesis is not met in Part I and there is a
      significant difference in the PK of suvorexant between healthy participants and severe renal
      impairment participants.

            <groups_desc>The geometric mean (GM) for each participant group and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for AUC(0-∞) using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.
The AUC(0-∞) geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the 2 participant groups was used to test the primary hypothesis, which was that the AUC(0-∞) of suvorexant following a single oral dose would be similar between participants with renal impairment and healthy matched control participants.</groups_desc>

            <non_inferiority_desc>AUC(0-∞) GMR = AUC(0-∞) GM for Severe Renal Impairment Participants ÷ AUC(0-∞) GM for Healthy Participants.
A 90% CI for the AUC(0-∞) GMR was computed from the ANCOVA model. As prespecified by the analysis plan, if the 90% CI for the AUC(0-∞) GMR was contained within the interval [0.50, 2.00], then the hypothesis would be met and the AUC(0-∞) of suvorexant would be similar in both groups of participants. That is, if the true ratio of the GM AUC(0-∞) is greater than 0.50 and no more than 2.00.</non_inferiority_desc>
