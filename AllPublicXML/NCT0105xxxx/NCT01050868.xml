  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled, interventional study will determine whether
      the Roche automated bolus caclulator (ABC) reduces post-meal hyperglycemia better than the
      competitor's ABC without causing significant hypoglycemia.
