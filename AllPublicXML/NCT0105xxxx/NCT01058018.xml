  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-third of the US population, almost 80 million adults, have cardiovascular disease and
      mortality associated with heart disease still remains as a leading cause of death around the
      world. The major risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with atherosclerosis is
      dyslipidemia, characterized by high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or low levels
      of high density lipoprotein (HDL). The widespread use of statins in patients at risk for
      cardiovascular disease has led to lower LDL levels but has had little effect on HDL levels.
      HDL has a well established role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease protection. HDL
      mediates the removal of cholesterol from the atherosclerotic plaques for elimination from the
      body. The cardioprotective component of HDL consists of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). Recent
      intervention studies with synthetic HDL particles and recombinant ApoA1 have shown that HDL
      has the capacity to reverse coronary atherosclerosis. Increasing ApoA1 is likely to have a
      favorable effect on atherosclerotic plaque size and stability, and on cardiovascular
      diseases. RVX000222 is a member of a novel class of small molecules that are candidates for
      the treatment of dyslipidemia by increasing plasma levels of HDL through increased ApoA1
      transcription.
