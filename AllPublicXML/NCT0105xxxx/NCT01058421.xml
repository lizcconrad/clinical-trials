    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure is a heterogeneous disorder that results in more than 300,000
      Americans requiring admission to an intensive care unit for invasive mechanical ventilatory
      support each year. Though acute respiratory failure is a pulmonary disorder, patients who
      survive their hospitalization are not limited by respiratory symptoms after discharge. Rather
      persistent neuromuscular weakness is the primary disorder that adversely alters their quality
      of life and ability to function on a daily basis. In this application the investigators plan
      to conduct a randomized clinical trial called the Do It Now study (Diagnosis and Treatment of
      Neuromuscular Weakness) to determine the effectiveness of an intensive physical therapy
      program for patients recovering from acute respiratory failure. This trial will establish the
      efficacy of the physical therapy programs that is currently performed for patients with acute
      respiratory failure in a non-evidence based manner across the United States.

      Acute respiratory failure is a heterogeneous disorder that results in more than 300,000
      Americans requiring admission to an intensive care unit for invasive mechanical ventilatory
      support each year. Though acute respiratory failure is a pulmonary disorder, patients who
      survive are not limited by respiratory symptoms after discharge. Rather persistent
      neuromuscular weakness is the primary disorder that adversely affects their quality of life
      and ability to function on a daily basis. Weakness in these survivors is related to the
      development of critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM). Presently, there are no therapies
      to treat the estimated 110,000 acute respiratory failure survivors who have developed CIPNM
      each year. Based on the results of our national surveys of physical therapists and intensive
      care physicians, the utilization and types of physical therapy for patients recovering from
      acute respiratory failure with neuromuscular weakness varies significantly depending on the
      type of hospital and primary diagnosis of the patient. The investigators plan to perform a
      randomized clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of an intensive four week physical
      therapy program for patients with acute respiratory failure. This trial will determine the
      efficacy of the physical therapy programs that is currently performed in a non-evidence based
      manner for patients with acute respiratory failure across the United States. If successful,
      this study will pave the way for a larger multi-center clinical trial of intensive physical
      therapy for survivors of acute respiratory failure.

    <measure>The Primary Outcome Variable for This Study Will be the Short Form of the Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance Test (CS-PFP) Called the PFP-10</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The CS-PFP-10 provides an overall score and scores for upper body strength, upper body flexibility, lower body strength, balance and coordination, and endurance. The test is used to assess an individual's overall capacity to carry out activities of daily living by measuring and quantifying 10 typical activities including sweeping a floor, transferring clothes from a washer to a dryer, and carrying groceries. Tasks are quantified using time alone, time and weight, and distance. This test provides a realistic and practical measure of movement capacity and ability to accomplish sustained activity. CS-PFP-10 scores are scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function. If patients remained in the hospital or in a long-term care facility a the time of assessment, then received a score of 0. All tests were conducted in a standardized physical therapy laboratory by a physical therapist formally trained in conducting the CS-PFP-10 and blinded to group/arm assignment.</description>

        <title>The Primary Outcome Variable for This Study Will be the Short Form of the Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance Test (CS-PFP) Called the PFP-10</title>
        <description>The CS-PFP-10 provides an overall score and scores for upper body strength, upper body flexibility, lower body strength, balance and coordination, and endurance. The test is used to assess an individual's overall capacity to carry out activities of daily living by measuring and quantifying 10 typical activities including sweeping a floor, transferring clothes from a washer to a dryer, and carrying groceries. Tasks are quantified using time alone, time and weight, and distance. This test provides a realistic and practical measure of movement capacity and ability to accomplish sustained activity. CS-PFP-10 scores are scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function. If patients remained in the hospital or in a long-term care facility a the time of assessment, then received a score of 0. All tests were conducted in a standardized physical therapy laboratory by a physical therapist formally trained in conducting the CS-PFP-10 and blinded to group/arm assignment.</description>
