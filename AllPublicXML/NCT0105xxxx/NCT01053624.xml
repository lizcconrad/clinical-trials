  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol has been designed to determine if tracheostomy performed immediately after lung
      operation (i.e. concomitant tracheotomy) could improve the postoperative outcome of high risk
      patients. We hypothesized that concomitant tracheotomy could reduce the length of mechanical
      ventilation and the number of respiratory complications.

      Background: Respiratory failure after lung resection is a major complication. Several studies
      suggest that low predictive postoperative pulmonary function is a predictive factor of
      mechanical ventilation (MV). In critically ill patients requiring MV, early tracheostomy may
      shorten the duration of MV and length of stay in intensive care.

      Study objective: To determine whether concomitant tracheostomy (CT) would decrease the length
      of MV and improves outcome in patient with predictive postoperative forced expiratory volume
      in 1 second (FEV1ppo) &lt; 50%. We call CT a tracheostomy performed immediately after the lung
      resection under the same general anesthesia.

      Method: An open monocentric randomized controlled trial has been design. Inclusion and
      exclusion criteria are mentioned below. FEV1ppo will be calculated by the mean of the
      scintigraphic method for pneumonectomy and by the mean of the number of resected segments for
      lobectomy and segmentectomy. Randomization will be made the day before the operation. The
      procedure will be an open surgical tracheostomy. A daily data base will be completed from
      randomization until discharge. The primary and secondary criteria are mentioned below.
