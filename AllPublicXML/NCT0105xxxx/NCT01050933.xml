  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post operative ileus (POI), a temporary paralysis of the intestines, is a serious health care
      problem. It normally occurs in all patients after surgery to the abdomen but in some cases
      can result in serious complications. The objective of this study is to determine if inhaling
      very low doses of carbon monoxide (CO) before and after colon surgery will shorten the
      duration of normal POI and/or prevent the development of POI complications in patients
      undergoing colon surgery.

      This preliminary study will be conducted in ten healthy volunteers to monitor for blood
      levels and adverse effects that occur at different durations of exposure of inhaled CO to
      establish a safe dose for patients in the main trial. For the main trial, patients requiring
      surgery to their colon will be assigned randomly to receive one hour treatments of either CO
      or oxygen by face mask before and after their operation.

      We hypothesize that healthy volunteers will be able to tolerate 1 hour doses of 250 ppm of CO
      with minimal side effects. It is also anticipated that for each dose of CO administered, the
      blood levels of CO will remain well under poisonous levels. Finally, we anticipate blood
      levels of CO will return to baseline level within 24 hours following the last dose of CO.

    <description>Healthy volunteers will receive 250 ppm of carbon monoxide by face mask. This dose will be administered for 1 hour with continuous COHb monitoring. At baseline and at each half hour time point, a blood sample will be drawn to be analyzed by the gas chromatograph. After 1 hour, the volunteer will be excused and asked to return in 4 hours and this procedure repeated. At any point, if the COHb level reaches 10%, administration of CO will be terminated.</description>
