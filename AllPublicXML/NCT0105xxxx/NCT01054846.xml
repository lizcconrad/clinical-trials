      -  To test the hypothesis if provision of helmet education and free helmet distribution
           will significantly increase helmet use in preschool children of low-income families
           compared to those children receiving helmet education without free helmet distribution;

        -  To test the hypothesis if helmet users in preschool children will significantly reduce
           head and facial injuries compared to those non-helmet users
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current literature review shows that there were no definite prospective research studies that
      indicate the effectiveness of helmet promotion and wearing in injury prevention/reduction
      particularly to head and facial injuries among preschool children of low-income families.

      The magnitude and seriousness of the injury problem in these children in the community could
      be high. Many injuries may occur that are not treated in emergency departments. Even the
      occurrence of a minor injury in the face is undesirable. These ages are learning periods to
      ride, are liable to fall, and are prone to injuries by using, not only, bicycles but also
      tricycles, scooters, roller skates/roller blades and other riding toys (vehicles).
