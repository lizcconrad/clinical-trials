      This study plans to learn more about how to prevent blood clots in the veins of your
      extremities. You are at risk of forming these clots after a major injury and when you have
      had surgery and are hospitalized on bed rest.

      Usually, patients in the SICU at Denver Health who are at risk for blood clots receive
      preventative treatment with a FDA-approved medicine called Fragmin. Fragmin is intended to
      prevent blood clots from forming but, with the way it is generally used, some patients may
      still develop blood clots. All patients treated with Fragmin to prevent blood clots at Denver
      Health, currently receive the same Fragmin dose. This treatment is called the &quot;standard of
      care&quot;.

      So far, in the US, there has not been a commonly available test that can tell us:

        -  if the standard dose of Fragmin is enough to prevent blood clots for everyone, or

        -  if different patients need different doses, or

        -  if other blood clot preventing medicines, that work in a different way, should be used
           in addition to Fragmin.

      The ability of your blood to clot and the strength of the clot formed can be described by a
      FDA-approved blood test called thrombelastography, referred to as TEG. TEG may provide us
      with answers to each of the questions above. Our preliminary data indicate that it is helpful
      in assessing both clotting and bleeding tendencies and may prove useful in guiding treatment
      for the prevention of blood clots.

      The aim of this study is to determine if a treatment plan using Fragmin, and, if indicated,
      one or two additional FDA-approved medicines called anti-platelet drugs, guided by the
      results of TEG testing, may be better at preventing blood clots than our current standard of
      care.

      This preliminary/pilot study involves a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel group
      comparison of Denver Health's current standard of care for prevention of venous
      thromboembolism (VTE), commonly known as blood clots, using LMWH (Fragmin) 5000IU
      subcutaneously daily, with a thrombelastography (TEG)-guided, algorithm-based, individualized
      regimen of LMWH (Fragmin) plus/minus anti-platelet therapy (aspirin) guided by platelet
      mapping, in patients admitted to the SICU following trauma.

      Approximately 50 trauma patients for whom prevention of VTE with LMWH is indicated, will be
      enrolled over a six month period.

      The specific aims of this study are as follows:

        1. To determine the incidence of, and to characterize, hypercoagulability using TEG and
           conventional clinical coagulation testing (APTT, INR), Antithrombin III levels and
           Protein C activity.

        2. In the group of patients receiving LMWH (Fragmin) therapy alone for prevention of VTE:

             1. to assess the anticoagulant effect of standard LMWH (Fragmin) dosing (5000IU
                subcutaneously once daily) using TEG and Anti-Factor Xa level measurement, and

             2. to determine the extent of correlation of relevant TEG parameters with measured
                Anti-Factor Xa levels (U/ml).

        3. To assess whether TEG is a useful clinical tool for monitoring and optimizing
           prophylactic LMWH (Fragmin) therapy and for identifying the need for anti-platelet
           therapy to minimize the risk of VTE in these patients.

        4. To evaluate the clinical utility of platelet mapping for guiding anti-platelet therapy
           in those patients for whom it is indicated by TEG results.

        5. To determine the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in
           each randomized group and in the subgroup receiving anti-platelet therapy in addition to
           LMWH (Fragmin) for prevention of VTE.

      The overall aim is to utilize the above data to evaluate a) the adequacy of our standard
      Fragmin dosing regimen (5000IU subcutaneously once daily) alone for prevention of VTE in our
      trauma/SICU patients, b) the need for anti-platelet agents in addition to LMWH (Fragmin) for
      prevention of VTE in our population, and c) to validate/further develop the TEG-guided
      algorithm for optimal prophylaxis of VTE using LMWH (Fragmin) plus/minus anti-platelet
      therapy guided by platelet mapping.

    <description>R is a reaction time. The time from the start of a sample run until the first significant levels of detectable clot formation (amplitude = 2 mm in the TEG tracing).
Rf is a difference in reaction time between Fragmin-active and Fragmin-neutralized samples.
Achievement of a certain clot strength K is a measure of the time from R until a fixed level of clot strength is reached (amplitude = 20 mm).
Angle or α measures the rapidity of fibrin build-up and cross-linking (clot strengthening). This most represents fibrinogen level. Angle relates to K, since both are a function of the rate of clot formation.
MA, or Maximum Amplitude, is a direct function of the maximum clot strength. In tests where platelets are part of the clot, this parameter most reflects platelet function/aggregation. Clot strength is the result of two components - the modest contribution of fibrin and the much more significant contribution of the platelets.</description>

    <description>Shear elastic modulus strength (SEMS). The MA parameter can be transformed into the actual measure of clot strength (G) using the formula below, and is measured in dyn/cm2 divided by 1000 (displayed in the software as Kd/sc).
The absolute SEMS of the sample can be calculated from MA as follows:
G = (5000MA/(100-MA))/1000 An amplitude of 50 mm corresponds to a SEMS of 5000 dyn/cm2. An increase in MA from 50 mm to 67 mm is equivalent to a two-fold increase in the SEMS. The G parameter not only provides a measurement of clot firmness in force units, but also is more indicative of small changes in the clot strength or clot breakdown than is the amplitude in mm because it is an exponential reflection of MA.</description>

        <title>TEG Parameters</title>
        <description>R is a reaction time. The time from the start of a sample run until the first significant levels of detectable clot formation (amplitude = 2 mm in the TEG tracing).
Rf is a difference in reaction time between Fragmin-active and Fragmin-neutralized samples.
Achievement of a certain clot strength K is a measure of the time from R until a fixed level of clot strength is reached (amplitude = 20 mm).
Angle or α measures the rapidity of fibrin build-up and cross-linking (clot strengthening). This most represents fibrinogen level. Angle relates to K, since both are a function of the rate of clot formation.
MA, or Maximum Amplitude, is a direct function of the maximum clot strength. In tests where platelets are part of the clot, this parameter most reflects platelet function/aggregation. Clot strength is the result of two components - the modest contribution of fibrin and the much more significant contribution of the platelets.</description>

        <title>TEG Parameters</title>
        <description>Shear elastic modulus strength (SEMS). The MA parameter can be transformed into the actual measure of clot strength (G) using the formula below, and is measured in dyn/cm2 divided by 1000 (displayed in the software as Kd/sc).
The absolute SEMS of the sample can be calculated from MA as follows:
G = (5000MA/(100-MA))/1000 An amplitude of 50 mm corresponds to a SEMS of 5000 dyn/cm2. An increase in MA from 50 mm to 67 mm is equivalent to a two-fold increase in the SEMS. The G parameter not only provides a measurement of clot firmness in force units, but also is more indicative of small changes in the clot strength or clot breakdown than is the amplitude in mm because it is an exponential reflection of MA.</description>
