      Prospective controlled study evaluating cryocontact therapy of infantile hemangiomas of
      preterm infants

      Principal investigator: Rangmar Goelz, MD Coworkers: M Möhrle, M Moll, HM Häfner, W
      Schippert, C Meisner, M Röcken, CF Poets

      Background Despite their frequent occurrence, there is no established therapeutic procedure
      for localized infantile hemangioma in preterm infants. A PubMed search with the key words
      hemangioma, controlled study, infant or childhood revealed five studies (1-5), none of them
      included preterm infants, even though low birth weight and prematurity have been described as
      the most significant risk factors

      Aim:

      To evaluate cryocontact therapy of infantile hemangioma (IH) of 1 - 10 mm diameter in preterm
      infants &lt;=34 weeks of gestational age (GA) using a liquid nitrogen cooled metal at the
      Department of Neonatology at the Tuebingen University Hospital.

      Method:

      In a prospective controlled study, preterm infants &lt;= 34 weeks GA with at least 2 IH should
      be randomized to have one treated with cryocontact therapy using a liquid nitrogen cooled
      metal (-196°C), while the other one is left untreated. Primary endpoint is an intact skin at
      the site of the hemangioma at 1 year corrected age . The study starts at August 1st, 2004.
      Cryocontact is done by 3 trained dermatologist (MM, HMH, WS), outcome documentation,
      including photodocumentation, by 2 neonatologist (RG, MoMo).

      Statistical Analysis: A sample size of 25 intrapersonal pairs of treated and untreated IH is
      needed to show a significant difference with alpha=0.05 and beta=0.9 between treated IH and
      controls, assuming that 5% of the treated IH and 40% of the controls have an unsuccessful
      primary outcome. Documentation will be made on standardized forms and the data will be
      transferred to Excel. Biometric calculations will be handled with SAS 9.1.3. for Windows
      using Fisher´s Exact Test for difference in proportions.

      Ethics:

      The study is approved by the Ethics Committee of Tuebingen University Hospital; all parents
      must give written informed consent.
