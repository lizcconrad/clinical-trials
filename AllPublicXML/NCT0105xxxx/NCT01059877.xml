  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a double-blind, placebo-controlled approach to assess the effect of
      1072nm infrared (IR) phototherapy on the behavioral and cognitive symptoms associated with
      early and mid-stage dementia.

      What hypotheses are you testing?

      We are seeking to determine if the provision of brief, repeated exposure to 1072nm infrared
      stimulation of the cortex surface improves cognitive and behavioral functioning as indicated
      by normalization of EEG activity, increased cerebral oxygenation and demonstrated improvement
      on standardized neuropsychological measures.

      Intensive near infrared stimulation has been shown to be effective in accelerating healing of
      injuries and functional modification including increasing blood flow and perfusion. Dementia
      research has suggested that hypoperfusion is a significant underlying mechanism in the
      progression of dementia. Infrared spectroscopy has been shown effective in the non-invasive
      measurement of changes in cerebral oxygenation and perfusion. This study therefore seeks to
      explore whether the increasing of regional cerebral perfusion and oxygenation using infrared
      light stimulation will result in improved cognitive and behavioral functioning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged between 50 - 85 years.

          -  Have established cognitive impairment, Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score
             between 15- 25 (from a possible score of 30).

          -  Generally healthy otherwise as indicated by recent physical examination.

          -  Have a caregiver/informant who has cared for the patient at least 5 days a week and is
             willing to attend study visits and provide information about the patient.

          -  If taking any psychotropic medication should have been stable for the previous 3
             months.

          -  Must have had B12, folic acid, full blood count and ferritin screen within the
             previous 6 months or be on B12 and/or folic acid replacement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled or unstable chronic illness, e.g., hypertension, COPD.

          -  Diagnosed actively growing intracranial pathology (tumors etc).

          -  An associated psychotic illness.

          -  Misusing illegal substances or alcohol.

          -  On regular systemic steroids or anti-metabolites.

          -  Systemic malignancies and/or space occupying lesions in the brain.

          -  History of aggression or violence.

          -  Inability to travel to the research venue for multiple assessments.

          -  A history of major psychiatric illness, seizure disorder, or physical illness that
             would compromise their participation in a daily treatment regimen.

          -  A participant may be disqualified if their performance is above the normative mean or
             below the lowest interpretable score of neuropsychological tests provided during the
             initial assessment (see #6, Sources of research material obtained from study
             participants, below).
