  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, sickle cell disease has not been viewed in the chronic pain paradigm because of
      its recurrent nature. Patients with sickle cell disease may be hospitalized for extended
      periods of time. As the hospital stay progresses, patients with SCD pain are often observed
      by clinicians to have improvements in function in areas such as self-care, mobility, and
      recreation despite continued self-report of high pain scores. This pattern of functional
      improvement with continued report of high pain intensity scores is common in patients with
      recurrent and chronic pain. A functional assessment tool that can assess function in the
      acute inpatient setting is needed.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Inpatient Pediatric Physical Activity
      Questionnaire (IPPAQ), as a measure of daily function in children with sickle cell disease
      hospitalized with vasoocclusive pain.
