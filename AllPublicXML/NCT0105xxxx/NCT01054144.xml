    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to estimate the effectiveness of a response adapted approach
      with the use of the drug, lenalidomide in the treatment of older adults with newly diagnosed
      standard risk multiple myeloma. This means that participants will be given the study drug,
      lenalidomide but depending on how they respond to this drug they may also be given
      dexamethasone and/or prednisone to help with their treatment.

      Summary: Patients will be started on the study drug, lenalidomide on Day 1, Cycle 1.
      Lenalidomide is a capsule that is to be taken orally (by mouth). If the patient's disease
      progresses after 2 cycles of therapy, a low dose of dexamethasone will be added. If the
      patient's disease is stable after 2 cycles of therapy, the use of an alternate corticosteroid
      (prednisone) will be added to the lenalidomide therapy they are receiving. Dexamethasone and
      prednisone are in tablet form and will be taken orally (by mouth). However, if the patient
      has a minimal response after an additional 2 cycles of lenalidomide therapy, the therapy will
      be continued until their disease progresses. See the intervention descriptions for further
      details.
