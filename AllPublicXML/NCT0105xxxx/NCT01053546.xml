      RATIONALE: Swallowing exercise therapy may improve the quality of life of head and neck
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying early onset of swallowing exercise
      therapy to see how well it works compared to late onset of swallowing exercise therapy in
      treating patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the difference between early and late onset swallowing exercises on swallowing
      quality of life in patients undergoing chemo/radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the difference between early and late onset swallowing exercises on swallowing
      function in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the difference between early and late onset swallowing exercises on: individual
      domains of swallowing quality of life; Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) as assessed via
      FEES; diet level (Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) as assessed via FEES; feeding
      tube duration (days); Eating Assessment Tool (EAT); lingual strength as assessed via lingual
      manometry; and percent weight loss and percent weight recovery.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I (Early exercise group): Patients perform swallowing exercises comprising lingual press,
      head lift, breath hold, Masako swallow, high pitch e, effortful swallow, and neck stretch and
      massage for 2 weeks prior to beginning radiotherapy and again immediately after completion of
      radiotherapy.

      Arm II (Late exercise group): Patients begin performing swallowing exercises as in arm I 1
      month after completion of radiotherapy.

      In both arms, swallowing exercises are performed twice daily, 6 days a week, for 12 months
      following completion of radiotherapy.
