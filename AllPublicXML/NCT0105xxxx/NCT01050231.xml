      The purpose of this study is to develop an upper extremity robotic training system for use by
      people with stroke to practice arm and hand movement in the clinic.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year in the U.S. over 400,000 people survive a stroke and approximately 80% of acute
      stroke survivors lose arm and hand movement skills. Movement impairments are typically
      treated with intensive, hands-on physical and occupational therapy for several weeks after
      the initial brain injury. Unfortunately, due to economic pressure on the U.S. health care
      system, stroke patients are receiving less therapy and going home sooner. Our goal for this
      study is to develop an upper extremity robotic training system for both acute and chronic
      stroke population to improve movement ability with intensive and repetitive movement in the
      clinic without continuous supervision from a therapist.
