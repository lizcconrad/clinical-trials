      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity (i.e. primary immune
      response, immunogenicity of two different doses, antibody persistence 360 days after the
      first vaccination, immune response to a heterologous booster given on Day 360) of a Vero
      cell-derived whole virus H5N1 influenza vaccine in healthy infants, children and adolescents
      aged 6 months to 17 years.
