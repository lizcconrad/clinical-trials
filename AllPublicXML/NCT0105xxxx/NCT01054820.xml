  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although approved for minor strains, sprains and contusions, FLECTOR Patch has not been
      studied extensively in the setting of acute back strain. This study is being conducted as an
      initial step in demonstrating the benefit of FLECTOR Patch specifically for back strain. In
      particular, this study is expected to provide information about the amount of improvement in
      back strain among subjects using the FLECTOR Patch, which may then be used to inform
      subsequent studies.

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to EOT in Response to Modified Brief Pain Inventory (mBPI) Question 8: Percent Reduction in Pain From Baseline</title>
          <description>Participant-rated instrument to assess functional activities (general activity, mood, walking ability, relations with other people, sleep, normal work, and enjoyment of life) in past 24 hours. Question 8: Rate your percent reduction in pain from Baseline (0% = no relief to 100% = complete relief).</description>
          <population>ITT population; EOT score calculated by taking average of any non-missing scores recorded last 3 days of treatment; if no score on those days, EOT was single, most recent non-missing score recorded on a treatment day. N=number of participants with analyzable data for Question 8 at observation.</population>
