  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a telephone social support and empowerment
      intervention is more effective than usual community services in improving the mental health
      of community-dwelling women abused by their intimate partners.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the most common mental health sequelae of intimate partner violence
      (IPV). Although a range of interventions have been tried to improve the mental health of
      women survivors of IPV, the results are inconclusive. In this trial, a 12-week advocacy
      intervention consisting of empowerment and telephone social support is provided to abused
      Chinese women in a community setting. Usual community services provide the control condition.
