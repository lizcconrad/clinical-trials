    <textblock>
      Soft tissue realignment of the tibial insertion of the patella tendon is a simple operative
      technique for treating dislocation of the patella in childhood and adolescence. It is
      performed in children with either recurrent dislocation or complicated primary dislocation in
      cases with malalignment or maltracking of the patella and a lateralised tibial tuberosity. It
      can be performed in patients with open epiphyses. We investigate long-term outcome after this
      procedure.

      Method. Investigation of the outcome of a relatively new method for centralisation of the
      insertion of the patella tendon in patients with open epiphyses. Using a soft tissue
      technique the patella tendon is released from the tibial tuberosity with the tendon still
      fixed to the distal periosteum. The tibial periosteum is split on the lateral border of the
      tibia distally. Together with lateral release this procedure releases the patella tendon
      which finds a new insertion more medially. Because the tendon is still fixed at the distal
      periosteum no additional fixation is needed and therefore no complications occur at the
      tibial apophysis due to osteosynthetic material. Full weight bearing is possible after 4
      weeks and movement is not restricted.Results. From 1999 to 2004 a total of about 90
      operations in about 80 patients for soft tissue centralisation of the distal insertion of the
      patella tendon were carried out on children and adolescents aged between 10 and 18 years old.
      This study is a retrospective analysis of the outcome after 6 to 10 years. Relevant outcome
      criteria will be evaluated with the occurrence of recurring dislocation, the Lysholm score,
      the Tegner activity scale and subjective measurement with the VAS scale and an additional
      functional outcome score, that we created especially for children. Eventual occurrence of
      growth disturbance or osteoarthritis will be documented be clinical or radiological features.
