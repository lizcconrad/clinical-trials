  <brief_summary>

      Background:

        -  Advanced cases of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) usually are not successfully
           treated with standard therapies. Even treatments that attempt to specifically target
           NSCLC cells have not proved effective.

        -  Researchers are interested in determining whether a combination of the chemotherapy
           drugs SS1 (dsFv) PE38, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab may be effective in
           shrinking the size of NSCLC tumors. Three of the drugs (paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
           bevacizumab) are commercially available, while the other is a drug that is currently
           being tested to determine its usefulness in cancer treatment. This study will help to
           determine if the combination of all four drugs is more effective and as safe, safer, or
           less safe than other drug combinations given to treat NSCLC.

      Objectives:

      - To determine a safe and tolerable dose for the combination of SS1 (dsFv) PE38 with
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing lung
      adenocarcinoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age &gt; 18 years of age

        -  Newly diagnosed advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma

        -  No prior chemotherapy for lung cancer

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma
           that has not responded to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  The study will last for two 21-day cycles of treatment for the four-drug combination,
           with additional treatment cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.

        -  Two to three weeks prior to the study, participants will be screened with a full medical
           history and physical exam, bone marrow biopsy (we do not do bone marrow biopsies) (if
           one has not been performed in the last 6 months), computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound
           scan, tumor measurements, and other tests as required by the researchers. Participants
           will provide blood and urine samples at this time as well.

        -  During the study, participants will receive SS1 (dsFv) PE38, carboplatin, paclitaxel,
           and bevacizumab for a maximum of two cycles. On Day 15 of the first cycle, participants
           will provide a blood sample to be tested to see if SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is being effective.
           If the tests show that SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is not effective, participants will not receive
           another dose of it, but will continue to receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
           bevacizumab for the second cycle.

        -  After the first two cycles, participants will continue to receive carboplatin,
           paclitaxel, and bevacizumab every 3 weeks for up t...

      -  Treatment with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy results in a median survival of 7 to
           10 months in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  In a randomized clinical trial of patients with non-squamous cell lung cancer, treatment
           with carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab resulted in an objective response rate of
           35%, overall survival of 12.3 months compared to objective response rate of 15%, overall
           survival of 10.3 months in patients treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone.

        -  Mesothelin is a cell surface glycoprotein present on normal mesothelial cells that is
           highly expressed in many human cancers including lung adenocarcinoma.

        -  SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is a recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin that has undergone phase I
           testing and is currently in clinical trials in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin
           for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.

        -  Pre-clinical studies demonstrate increased anti-tumor activity of SS1 (dsFv) PE38 in
           combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab against mesothelin-expressing tumors.

      Primary Objectives:

      - This is a phase I study to determine a safe and tolerable phase II dose for the combination
      of SS1 (dsFv) PE38 with paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab in patients with advanced
      mesothelin-expressing lung adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival (PFS).

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SS1 (dsFv) PE38 in combination with
           chemotherapy and bevacizumab.

        -  Monitor serum mesothelin levels prior to and during chemotherapy.

        -  To identify T-cell epitopes responsible for neutralizing SS1 (dsFv) PE38 activity using
           mononuclear cells obtained by apheresis.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed stage IIIB (malignant pleural effusion) or IV or recurrent
           NSCLC (non-squamous cell, with mesothelin expression greater than or equal to 10% of
           tumor cells by IHC).

        -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function.

        -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

      Design:

      - Open label phase I trial.

               4. Stage IIIB (malignant pleural effusion) or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer or
                  recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

                  than or equal to 1.5 times ULN (In patients with evidence of Gilberts disease,
                  elevated bilirubin should not be related to tumor or other liver diseases and
                  should be less than or equal 2 times upper limit of normal).

                  document and the ability to comply with the requirements of the protocol. The
                  effects of SS1 (dsFv) PE38 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason and because immunotoxins are known to be teratogenic, women of
                  child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry

                  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy at study
                  enrollment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                  immediately.

             anti-hypertensive treatment.

          6. Any of the following within 6 months prior to study enrollment: myocardial infarction,
             unstable angina pectoris or uncontrolled angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery
             bypass graft, NYHA class III or IV congestive heart failure, clinically significant
             peripheral vascular disease (Grade II or greater). History of stroke or transient
             ischemic attack within 6 months.

         20. Urine protein: creatinine ratio greater than or equal to 1.0 at screening.

         21. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with chemotherapy. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

         22. Significant laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause
             undue risk for the subject's safety, inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with

             the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.
