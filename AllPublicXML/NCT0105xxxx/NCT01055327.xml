  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2007 a case control study was completed within the EUROCAT European network of congenital
      anomaly registers to test the hypothesis that first trimester lamotrigine monotherapy
      exposure is associated with an increased risk of isolated oral clefts. This study found no
      statistically significant increased risk of oral clefts compared with other defects following
      lamotrigine exposure in the uterus. The EUROCAT Antiepileptic Drug (AED) Database,
      established for the original case control study in 2007, will now be expanded to include an
      additional five to six years worth of data. These data will provide greater power to
      investigate the risk of isolated oral clefts, specific cleft types and potential associations
      with additional specific malformation types (e.g. neural tube defects). Data on cases of
      isolated oral clefts registered between 1993 and 2012 will be extracted from EUROCAT member
      registers meeting set inclusion criteria (ensuring completeness of outcome and exposure
      data). The primary comparison group will include all non oral cleft, non chromosomal
      malformations as the registers do not collect data on non malformed infants. This study will
      also be powered to include a second control group of chromosomal malformations, very unlikely
      to be associated with medication exposure. Data on exposure to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)
      during the first trimester of pregnancy will be extracted along with other key covariates
      including age of mother, history of epilepsy and gestational age of the infant. Primary
      analyses, using logistic regression, will compare the lamotrigine monotherapy versus no AED
      use across case and control groups and a secondary analysis will compare lamotrigine
      monotherapy versus other AED monotherapy (with and without valproate). Data will also be
      monitored for patterns of lamotrigine exposure across additional specific malformation groups
      of interest.

        All infants/fetuses with congenital malformations registered on EUROCAT anti-epileptic drug
        database between 1995 and 2012 (start date depends on date of lamotrigine registration in
        country of participating register).

        EUROCAT is a European network of population-based congenital anomaly registers for
        surveillance. EUROCAT surveys 1.5 million births per year covering 29% of births in EU
        Member States.

        In 2007, 19 population-based congenital malformation registers within EUROCAT participated
        in an initial study of the association of lamotrigine exposure in pregnancy and the risk of
        isolated oral clefts. These registries covered at least part of the population of Austria,
        Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Norway, Poland,
        Spain, Switzerland and Wales.

        It is anticipated, that if these registers participate in the current study, the study will
        cover 8 million births and 200,000 congenital malformation registrations between 1995 and
        2012.
