  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of intrathecal morphine on
      post-operative pain following instrumented fusion for degenerative lumbar spine disease.
      Secondary objectives of this study aim to assess side effects, overall narcotic use and
      duration of hospital stay following administration of intrathecal morphine.

      Based on our literature review, we expect a significant improvement in pain scores and
      functional status and minimal side effects with the use of intrathecal morphine. With
      improved pain and function we would also expect shorter hospital stays in those patients
      receiving intrathecal morphine.

      Adult patients (&gt;18 yrs or older) undergoing instrumented fusion for degenerative lumbar
      spine disease will be recruited and randomized to receive one of two treatments. The first
      group will receive an injection of morphine (200mcg) into the intrathecal space at the time
      of the operation. The second group will receive a saline injection. The pharmacy will prepare
      the aforementioned injections and deliver them to the operating room to ensure all parties
      are blinded. Both groups will then have a standardized analgesic regimen (including PCA
      morphine and parenteral analgesics) available to them in the post-operative period. Each
      group will be followed at regular intervals post-operatively. At each follow-up, visual
      analogue pain scores, side effects and narcotic use will be assessed. Patients will also have
      a daily functional assessment which will dictate the time of discharge. Hospital stay will be
      measured from time of admission to time where patient no longer requires acute hospital care
      based on the functional assessment.
