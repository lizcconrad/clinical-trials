      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of naltrexone in reducing ICD symptoms in
      Parkinson's disease patients taking a dopamine agonist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impulse control disorders (ICDs), including compulsive gambling, sexual behavior, buying, and
      eating, are increasingly recognized as a significant clinical problem in Parkinson's disease
      (PD), occurring in up to 15% of patients. Dopamine agonist (DA) treatment is thought to be
      the primary risk factor for the development of ICDs in PD. ICDs often lead to significant
      impairments in psychosocial functioning, interpersonal relationships, and quality of life.
      The management of ICDs in the context of PD can be complex. Patients may be reluctant to
      discontinue DA treatment due to the motor benefits derived from treatment, so patients often
      have chronic symptoms. Thus, additional treatment approaches are needed.

      A medication shown to be efficacious for the treatment of ICDs with minimal impact on
      parkinsonism would allow many ICD patients to continue on full-dose DA treatment. Naltrexone,
      a long-acting opioid receptor antagonist, helps in the treatment of alcohol and opioid
      dependence. In addition, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that it helps in the
      treatment of pathological gambling in the general population. Opioids regulate dopamine
      pathways in areas of the brain linked with impulse control disorders, and opioid antagonists
      block opioid receptors in these regions. In this study, 48 PD patients with an ICD will be
      treated either with naltrexone (50-100 mg/day) or placebo for a period of 8 weeks. The study
      will assess if naltrexone improves ICD symptoms in PD and is well tolerated. To our
      knowledge, the proposed study is the first controlled trial of an agent to treat ICDs in PD.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Assessed as Very Much Improved or Much Improved Based on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The CGI-I was administered at Visit 2 (week 2, two weeks after baseline) and Visit 5 (week 8, termination visit 8 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale rates total improvement on a 7 point scale:
= Very much improved
= Much improved
= Minimally improved
= No change
= Minimally worse
= Much worse
= Very much worse
A participant scoring a 1 or 2 is considered a responder on the CGI scale. For the change in response status over time, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease - Rating Scale (QUIP-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The QUIP-RS was administered at baseline and the termination visits (Visit 5, 8 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) was developed for use in clinical trials and added as a secondary outcome measure for assessment of change in severity of ICD symptoms, to be completed at baseline and end of study only. For the QUIP-RS, scores for each compulsive behavior range from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating greater severity (frequency) of symptoms. Given that ICD symptoms are frequently comorbid in patients with PD, total QUIP-RS ICD scores (range from 0 to 64) were used to compare overall severity of ICD symptoms. Please note that this measure is reporting a change from baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Diagnosis of possible or probable idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).

        <title>Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease - Rating Scale (QUIP-RS)</title>
        <description>The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease–Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) was developed for use in clinical trials and added as a secondary outcome measure for assessment of change in severity of ICD symptoms, to be completed at baseline and end of study only. For the QUIP-RS, scores for each compulsive behavior range from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating greater severity (frequency) of symptoms. Given that ICD symptoms are frequently comorbid in patients with PD, total QUIP-RS ICD scores (range from 0 to 64) were used to compare overall severity of ICD symptoms. Please note that this measure is reporting a change from baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>The QUIP-RS was administered at baseline and the termination visits (Visit 5, 8 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
        <population>A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate changes in QUIP-RS ICD scores from baseline to termination (visit 5, 8 weeks after baseline). Positive estimated change values represent a decrease in severity (frequency) of symptoms.</population>
