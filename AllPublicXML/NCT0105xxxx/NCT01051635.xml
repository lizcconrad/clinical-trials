  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Indenoisoquinolines are experimental cancer treatment drugs that damage the DNA in
           cells, resulting in cell death. Researchers have been studying these drugs and their
           usefulness in treating types of cancer that have not responded well to standard
           therapies like surgery or radiation.

        -  LMP400 (NSC 743400) and LMP776 (NSC 725776) are indenoisoquinolines that have not been
           given to cancer patients before. These drugs have very similar chemical structures and
           work the same way, but researchers do not know which one will work best. More
           information is needed about how LMP400 and LMP776 are processed by the body and how
           effective they are in treating difficult-to-treat types of cancer.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of LMP400 (NSC 743400) and LMP776 (NSC 725776).

        -  To study how the body handles LMP400 and LMP776.

        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of LMP400 and LMP776 as a treatment for tumors and
           lymphoma that have not responded to standard treatment.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have malignant solid tumors or Hodgkin s
      disease/non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not responded to standard therapies.

      Design:

        -  Participants will receive either LMP400 or LMP776. The treatment cycle will be 28 days.
           On the first 5 days of each cycle, participants will receive intravenous doses of their
           specific study drug, followed by 23 days without the drug. The 28-day cycle will be
           repeated as long as the drug does not cause severe side effects and the cancer remains
           stable or improves. The study doctor may increase or decrease the dose of study drug
           depending on how well it is tolerated.

        -  Blood, urine, and hair samples and skin and tumor biopsies will be collected during the
           first treatment cycle. Routine blood samples will be taken throughout the study.

        -  Other tests, including additional blood and urine samples, computed tomography (CT) or
           other scans, and bone marrow samples, may be performed as directed by the study doctors.

      Background:

        -  Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 (top1) with
           improved characteristics over their predecessors. Indenoisoquinolines have better
           chemical stability, producing stable DNA-top1 cleavage complexes, and exhibit a
           preference for unique DNA cleavage sites, compared with their camptothecin counterparts.

        -  They have demonstrated activity against camptothecin-resistant cell lines and produce
           DNA-protein crosslinks, which are resistant to reversal. They also show less or no
           resistance to cells overexpressing the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCG2,
           and multidrug resistance (MDR-1).

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMP400 (NSC 743400) and LMP776 (NSC 725776)
           administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days (QDx5).

        -  Define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and toxicity profile associated with
           administration of LMP400 and LMP776.

        -  Evaluate the effect of LMP400 and LMP776 on the pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint,
           gamma-H2AX, in tumor biopsy pre- and post-treatment. In particular, compare the PD
           response, defined as the mean percent nuclear area that is gamma-H2AX positive (%NAP) in
           tumor biopsies, at the MTD for LMP400 and LMP776, and the toxicity profile versus PD
           dose-response relationship.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of LMP400 and LMP776.

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP400 and LMP776.

      Eligibility:

      -Adult patients must have histologically confirmed relapsed solid tumor malignancy or
      lymphoma that is metastatic or unresectable for which standard curative measures do not exist
      or are associated with minimal patient survival benefit.

      Study Design:

        -  Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will be randomized to receive either LMP400 or
           LMP776 administered IV QD over 1 hour on days 1-5 followed by 23 days without drug
           (28-day cycle).

        -  PK and PD samples will be collected in cycle 1 only. Tumor biopsies will not be
           collected during the escalation phase; however, tumor biopsies will be mandatory during
           the expansion phase.

             recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities.

          -  Patients must have recovered to at least a Grade less than or equal to toxicity
             eligibility levels due to adverse events (AEs) and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy
             or biologic therapy. They must not have had chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 4
             weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C, or 2 months for UCN-01), or therapy

             to entering the study. Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any
             prior administration of study drug in an exploratory IND/Phase 0 study. Patients must
             be greater than or equal to 1 month since completion of any prior radiation (greater
             than or equal to 2 weeks for palliative radiation therapy). However, patients
             receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen deprivation therapy
             for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy. Prior therapy with topoisomerase I
             inhibitors is allowed.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to
             2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL

             (measured) creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal

             *we will allow patients with Gilbert s syndrome with total bilirubin up to 2.5 mg/dL

               -  The effects of indenoisoquinolines on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
                  this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior
                  to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after
                  discontinuation from the study. Women of child bearing potential must have a
                  negative pregnancy test in order to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant
                  or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform
                  her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential
                  risk to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
                  indenoisoquinolines, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
                  treated with indenoisoquinolines.

               -  Willingness to undergo skin biopsies.

               -  At the point when tumor biopsies become mandatory rather than optional, disease
                  amenable to biopsy and willingness to undergo biopsies or patient will be
                  undergoing a procedure due to medical necessity during which the tissue may be
                  collected, or tumor biopsy tissue from a previous research study or medical care
                  is available for submission at registration. Criteria for the submission of
                  tissue are:

          -  Tissue must have been collected within 3 months prior to registration

          -  Patient has not received any intervening therapy for their cancer since the collection
             of the tumor sample

          -  Tumor tissue must meet the minimum requirements outlined in Section 9.1.

               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial, with the
             exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for
             greater than or equal to 2 months after treatment of the brain metastases, without
             steroids or anti-seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the discretion
             of the principal investigator.

          -  Patients with clinically significant illnesses which could compromise participation in
             the study, including, but not limited to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune
             deficiencies, known HIV infection requiring antiretroviral therapy, Hepatitis B,
             Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6
             months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.
