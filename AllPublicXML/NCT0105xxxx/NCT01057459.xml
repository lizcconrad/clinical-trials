      This research trial studies deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis in predicting response to
      antibody therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma treated on clinical trials Cancer and
      Leukemia Group B (CALGB)-50402 or CALGB-50701. Studying samples of blood from patients with
      follicular lymphoma in the laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond
      to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. To test the hypothesis that killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) genotypes predict overall response (partial response [PR], complete
      response[CR], and unconfirmed complete response [CRu]) within 12 months to
      rituximab-containing monoclonal antibody combinations in follicular lymphoma patients treated
      on CALGB protocols 50402 and 50701.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that KIR and HLA genotypes are associated with survival outcomes
      (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]) in follicular lymphoma patients
      treated with rituximab-containing monoclonal antibody combinations on CALGB protocols 50402
      and 50701.

      OUTLINE:

      Genomic DNA is extracted from previously collected blood samples for KIR and HLA genotyping
      and polymorphism analysis.
