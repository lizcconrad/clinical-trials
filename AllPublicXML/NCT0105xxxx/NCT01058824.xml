    <textblock>
      To assess the relative bioavailability of two different batches of Frademicina® drug product,
      containing 500 mg lincomycin hydrocloride, manufactured by Pfizer Laboratories Ltd. The
      formulations' comparative bioavailability after oral administration will be assessed based on
      the statistical comparisons of the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from the
      drug concentrations in the blood. The lincomycin hydrocloride concentration will be measured
      by a proper and validated analytical method.
