  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, parallel group study will assess the effect on response rate and
      the safety of MabThera added to either bendamustine or chlorambucil in patients with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia. Patients will be randomized to receive six 4-week cycles of either A)
      MabThera (375mg/m2 iv day 1 of cycle 1, 500mg/m2 iv cycles 2-6) plus bendamustine (90mg/m2 as
      first-line or 70mg/m2 as second-line therapy, iv on days 1 and 2, cycles 1-6), or B)MabThera
      plus chlorambucil (10mg/m2 po daily, days 1-7, cycles 1-6). Patients in group B can receive
      up to 6 further cycles of chlorambucil as monotherapy. Anticipated time on study treatment is
      6-12 months, and target sample size is 600-700 individuals.

    <time_frame>At least 2 months after completion of therapy (up to 32 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The definition of confirmed CR required all of the following criteria as assessed at least 2 months after completion of therapy: peripheral blood lymphocytes less than (&lt;) 4 times 10^9 cells per liter (cells/L); absence of significant lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly due to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) involvement; absence of constitutional symptoms; normal complete blood count (CBC) without need for transfusion or exogenous growth factors, as exhibited by neutrophils at least (&gt;/=) 1.5 times 10^9 cells/L, platelets greater than (&gt;) 100 times 10^9 cells/L, and hemoglobin &gt; 11.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL); normocellular bone marrow (BM) aspirate with &lt; 30 percent (%) lymphocytes; absence of lymphoid nodules; and BM biopsy without CLL activity.

    <description>The criteria for CR are identified in previous outcome measure(s). Those fulfilling CR criteria but who have persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia were considered CRi. The definition of PR required that the following be documented for minimum 2 months: &gt;/= 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes from Baseline; reduction in lymphadenopathy; &gt;/= 50% reduction in spleen or liver enlargement; and CBC with one of the following without need for transfusion or exogenous growth factors: polymorphonuclear leukocytes &gt;/= 1.5 times 10^9 cells/L, platelets &gt; 100 times 10^9 cells/L or &gt;/= 50% improvement from Baseline, or hemoglobin &gt; 11.0 g/dL or &gt;/= 50% improvement from Baseline. Participants with lymphoid nodules who otherwise met CR criteria were considered nPR.

    <description>The criteria for CR, CRi, PR, and nPR are identified in previous outcome measure(s). PD was defined by at least one of the following: the presence of lymphadenopathy; an increase in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen by &gt;/= 50% or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly; an increase in the number of blood lymphocytes by &gt;/= 50% with &gt;/= 5000 B-cells per microliter (B-cells/mcL); transformation to a more aggressive histology; or occurrence of cytopenia attributable to CLL. Participants not achieving a CR or PR, and who did not exhibit PD, were considered to have stable disease (SD). The percentage of participants achieving each level of response was calculated as the number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number of participants analyzed. The rows below are labeled first by the level of response at the end of 6 cycles (C6), then by level of response at the confirmation assessment.</description>

          <description>Participants received a specialized first-line or second-line regimen based upon prior chemotherapy exposure. Participants received intravenous (IV) rituximab 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6. In those requiring a first-line regimen, bendamustine was administered IV at a dose of 90 mg/m^2 on Days 1 and 2 of Cycles 1 to 6. In those requiring a second-line regimen, the bendamustine dose was lowered to 70 mg/m^2. Each cycle was 4 weeks in duration. Treatment was discontinued early in participants who experienced progressive disease (PD).</description>

        <description>The criteria for CR, CRi, PR, and nPR are identified in previous outcome measure(s). PD was defined by at least one of the following: the presence of lymphadenopathy; an increase in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen by &gt;/= 50% or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly; an increase in the number of blood lymphocytes by &gt;/= 50% with &gt;/= 5000 B-cells per microliter (B-cells/mcL); transformation to a more aggressive histology; or occurrence of cytopenia attributable to CLL. Participants not achieving a CR or PR, and who did not exhibit PD, were considered to have stable disease (SD). The percentage of participants achieving each level of response was calculated as the number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number of participants analyzed.

          <description>The criteria for CR, CRi, PR, nPR, and PD are identified in previous outcome measure(s). Duration of response was defined as the time from the first assessment of CR, CRi, PR, or nPR to the first documentation of PD or death, whichever occurred first. Duration of response was calculated in months as [first event date minus first assessment date of CR/CRi/PR/nPR plus 1] divided by 30.44.</description>
