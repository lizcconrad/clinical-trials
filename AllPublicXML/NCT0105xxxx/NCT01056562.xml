    <textblock>
      The male sex-hormone called testosterone is known to play a key role in the growth of
      prostate cancer. The usual treatment for the disease involves suppression of hormones
      (testosterone) by anti-hormonal treatment for an unknown period of time until the cancer
      progresses. This anti-hormonal treatment usually consists of injections every three months
      with an LHRH(Leutinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone) agonist and a short course of
      anti-androgen pills, which together help to lower the production of testosterone. Long-term
      hormonal treatment has potentially serious side effects and is expensive.

      In this study, hormonal treatments will be with held from those patients eligible and willing
      to participate. The aim of this study is to see if we can decrease the amount of hormone
      injections that patients require. This might lead to a decreased side effects(such as
      decrease in bone health, cardiovascular problems and metabolic syndrome which occurs when
      several health conditions happen at the same time and can lead to an increased risk of heart
      disease, stroke and diabetes) as well as to decrease the cost of hormonal therapy to treat
      prostate cancer.

      Most men respond to initial ADT with a fall in serum PSA and improvement in symptoms, if
      present initially; the median duration of response is about 1.5 - 2 years, but is highly
      variable. Increase in serum PSA despite a castrate testosterone level signifies that the
      disease has become castration resistant. Some patients may have short periods of response to
      other hormonal manipulations such as adding a peripheral antiandrogen such as bicalutamide,
      and later withdrawing it. Other hormonal manipulations may be tried sequentially before or
      after chemotherapy with varying success: this tertiary hormonal manipulation may include
      glucocorticoids such as prednisone or dexamethasone, ketoconazole and hydrocortisione,
      estrogens such as DES, and alternative anti-androgens such as flutamide and nilutamide. In
      most institutions, the policy is to continue the LHRH agonist indefinitely. Despite its
      proven role in prostate cancer treatment, ADT has multiple toxicities which include
      osteopenia/osteoporosis, a potentially lethal metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular
      complications. Also, continuous long term LHRH injections are very expensive.

      In this study, we propose a prospective cohort study at Princess Margaret Hospital to answer
      the following important questions regarding tertiary hormonal manipulations:

        1. What is the relationship between serum testosterone and time after stopping an LHRH
           agonist in men who have received chronic LHRH therapy for ≥ 1 year?

        2. What clinical factors influence recovery of testosterone?

        3. What is the saving of cost achieved by dosing the LHRH agonist on the basis of
           measurement of testosterone as compared to routine 3-monthly injection?
