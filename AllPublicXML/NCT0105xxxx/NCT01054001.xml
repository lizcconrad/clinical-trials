    <textblock>
      The investigators try to investigate the benefit of early administration (immediately after
      urethral catheter removal) of sildenafil after nerve-sparing RALP for 3 months. The
      investigators will compare the potency rates up to 2 years after nerve-sparing RALP in men
      with on- demand sildenafil 100mg dosing from the early postoperative period (immediately
      after urethral catheter removal) with from the delayed postoperative period (3 months after
      RP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various studies using animal models of CN neuroparaxia and clinical trials have demonstrated
      somewhat beneficial effect of PDE-5 inhibitors on smooth muscle cells of the corpus
      cavernosum. PDE-5 inhibitors including sildenafil have demonstrated the effectiveness in the
      management of postprostatectomy ED. In the animal experiments, PDE-5 inhibitors lowered the
      severity of the fibrosis in the corpus cavernosum of rats with CN cutting. In the clinical
      trials, on-demand dosing or routine dosing of PDE-5 inhibitors improved the potency rates in
      men received NSRP, and improvements of the potency rate did not appear to be statistically
      different among two dosing regimens.

      But, there are few studies on the potency rate according to the start time of the
      administration of PDE-5 inhibitors (eg. early vs. delayed post-operative dosing). At present,
      it is not conclusive that whether nerve-sparing RALP provides more higher potency rate than
      conventional surgery in men with prostate cancers. But, with more precise dissection of CN,
      the robotic surgery appears to have more chances to maintain the potency in men received RP.
