  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is one form of chronic pain lacking effective pharmacotherapy. Interest in
      the role of complementary and alternative medicine is growing and diet is at the forefront of
      the search for alternative treatments for pain. Soy protein is one of the most promising
      dietary ingredients tested for its pain-relieving properties. Results from animal studies
      show that soy-enriched diets reduce pain due to nerve injury. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effects of soy protein supplementation on facial pain.

      Neuropathic pain is a complex disorder with mixed results in response to pain medication due
      to a high degree of variability between patients. To address this issue, we are implementing
      a unique methodology using a series of N-of-1 or single subject randomized, double blind,
      controlled studies. With this, we will explore the role of soy protein supplementation in
      neuropathic pain patients. Each patient will be exposed in 3-week intervals to soy protein
      and a control, milk protein, in three paired treatment periods for a total of 18 weeks. This
      method allows for the measurement of treatment efficacy in individual distinct patients and
      has the potential for immediate and continued medical benefit using a simple and readily
      available dietary ingredient.
