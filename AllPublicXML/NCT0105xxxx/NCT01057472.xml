    <textblock>
      This is a study examining repeatability and feasibility of a new method for measurement of
      lung function in babies. A flexible vest is placed around the torso of the baby, and changes
      in tidal volume and flow is measured. The study will enable a better understanding of the
      usefulness of this equipment in a neonatal intensive care unit. The equipment is made by
      VOLUSENSE Norway AS, and marketed under the name FloRight. The equipment is owned by
      Volusense Norway AS during the study period.
