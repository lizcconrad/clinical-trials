  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leishmaniasis with diverse clinical manifestations is caused by different species of
      Leishmania and is endemic in many countries. Although Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a
      self-healing disease, but it takes a long time to heal. Pentavalent antimonials are still the
      first-line treatment of CL which needs multiple injections, are painful and as such not
      tolerated by most of the patients, in addition available treatments are not always effective
      and resistance is reported. Paromomycin sulfate (PM) reported to show anti-Leishmania
      activity against both CL and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) since 1960s. Therapeutic strategy
      with high efficacy is urgently needed especially for Anthroponotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
      (ACL). Liposomes are lipid bilayer molecules which entrap water-soluble molecules in their
      internal water compartment and water-insoluble ones into their lipid bilayers. Liposomes, in
      proper formulations and sizes, deliver drugs to the skin based on the similarity of the
      bilayers structure of lipid vesicles to that of natural membrane and target the macrophages
      within dermis. Several lipid-based formulations have been developed to treat experimental
      leishmaniasis. Recently different doses of liposomal formulation of PM and liposomal
      formulation of Glucantime were prepared and showed high efficacy in vivo against L. major
      infection in BALB/c mice.

      In this study the efficacy of liposomal formulation of PM or liposomal formulation of
      Glucantime in combination with systemic Glucantime in the treatment of ACL parasitologically
      proven patients will be evaluated. The clinical trial will be carried out according to the
      International approved GCP (Good Clinical Practice) guide lines.
