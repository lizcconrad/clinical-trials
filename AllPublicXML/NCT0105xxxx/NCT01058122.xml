  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed cohort study collected within a 5-month observation period adverse drug reaction
      (Adverse Drug Events - ADE) in patients at the Department of Oncology at the University of
      Zurich. ADE have been recorded using prospective monitoring and assessed using standardized
      algorithms regarding causality and severity. Data sources included information from the
      medical records, laboratory values and internal rounds. Additional information has been
      collected using a standardized patient questionnaire.

      The primary endpoints of this study are to determine the frequency of ADE, the comparison of
      the quality of data sources and collection methods for the detection of ADE in regard to
      patient characteristics, size, number of medications, the category of ADE, severity,
      causation, diagnosis, hospitalization, cause of hospitalization and medication cause.
      Secondary endpoint is the assessment of the ADE causality, severity and predictability.
