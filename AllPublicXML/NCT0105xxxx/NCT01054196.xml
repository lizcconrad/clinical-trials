      A) Phase 1: To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide that can be safely
      added to high-dose melphalan prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

      B) Phase 2: To determine whether the addition of high-dose lenalidomide to ASCT followed by
      maintenance standard-dose lenalidomide improves the response rate and duration of response
      for relapsed multiple myeloma (RMM).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed, primary
             refractory, or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease as defined by the International Uniform Response
             Criteria,defined as any of the following:

               -  serum M-protein of &gt; = 500mg/dL

               -  urine M-protein of &gt; = 200mg/ 24 hours

               -  involved free light chain &gt; = 10mg/dL provided serum free light chain ratio is
                  abnormal

          -  Patients must have received at least one prior line of therapy.

          -  Age &gt; = 18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status &gt; = 2.

          -  All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist program, and be
             willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  ANC &gt; = 1,000/uL

               -  platelets &gt; = 50,000/uL

               -  total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 X upper limit of normal

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt; = 2.5 X upper limit of normal

               -  Cardiac Ejection Fraction &gt; = 45 %

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min

          -  Patients must have an adequate number of CD34+ stem cells collected to allow for
             transplantation. This number is defined as â‰¥ 2 x 106 CD34+ cells / kg body weight. If
             not previously collected and stored, the patient must be willing to undergo stem cell
             mobilization and collection as per standard practice.

          -  The effects of lenalidomide on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown; however, it has been shown to be teratogenic other
             primates. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days and again
             within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled within
             7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse
             or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one
             additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts
             taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree
             to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a
             successful vasectomy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. The
             treating physician will follow the adverse reporting guidelines as outlined in further
             detail below for pregnancies.

          -  Lenalidomide has been shown to carry a risk of thromboembolic events, especially when
             used in combination with either corticosteroids or alkylating chemotherapeutic agents.
             All patients who participate in this study must be willing and able to tolerate
             prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the required
             dates in treatment protocol. Patients also must be able to tolerate low-dose aspirin,
             81 mg daily, during the maintenance phase of the treatment protocol.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had myeloma therapy within 14 days prior to entering the study or
             those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than
             2 weeks earlier. Patients may have received bisphosphonate therapy as part of routine
             myeloma care at any time prior to study entry.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to lenalidomide (including thalidomide) or melphalan.

          -  Known positive for HIV or infectious hepatitis, type B or C.

          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study because the risks to an
             unborn fetus or potential risks in nursing infants are unknown.

          -  History of thrombosis or thromboembolic event within last 60 days prior to study
             entry.
