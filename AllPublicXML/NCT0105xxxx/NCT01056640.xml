  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Older adults with multiple chronic illnesses are at risk for worsening functional
      and medical status with ensuing hospitalization. One goal of medical care is to prevent this
      decline. One method that may help slow this functional and medical decline is home
      telemonitoring.

      Specific aim: To determine the effectiveness of home telemonitoring compared to usual care in
      reducing combined outcomes of hospitalization and emergency room visits in an at risk
      population over 60 years of age.

      Materials and Methods: This will be a randomized trial of 200 patients into one of two
      interventions. Home telemonitoring involves the use of a computer device at home which
      records biometric and symptom data from patients. This information is monitored by mid level
      providers associated with the primary care medical practice. Usual care involves patients who
      make appointments with their providers as problems arise and utilize ongoing support like a
      24 hours nurse line. The study participants are adults over 60 years of age within the
      highest 10% on elderly risk assessment (ERA) scores. Patients will have initial evaluations
      of gait, quality of life (SF12), Kokmen test of mental status, and PHQ 9. Patients will be
      followed for 1 year for primary outcomes of hospitalizations and emergency room visits.
      Secondary analysis will include quality of life, compliance with the device and attitudes
      about telemonitoring. Sample size is based upon an 80% power to detect a 36% difference
      between the groups. The primary analysis will involve Cox proportional time to event analysis
      comparing both interventions for telemonitoring or usual care. Secondary analysis will use
      T-test comparisons for continuous variables (quality of life, attitudes) and chi square for
      proportional analysis.

    <description>The usual care intervention will include appropriate primary care and specialty office practice visits as required. It also includes home health care, timely post-hospital outpatient visits, a nurse generated phone call progress report within one business day of hospital dismissal, and standard clinic phone triage during business hours. It also involves a 24 hour nurse triage line for questions. Patients will be informed of the general options currently available to patients including the above as well as options for care in extended hours and at Mayo Express care.</description>

This allows for an individualized home care plan based upon multiple concerns which have not been adequately studied.

            <description>The usual care intervention will include appropriate primary care and specialty office practice visits as required. It also includes home health care, timely post-hospital outpatient visits, a nurse generated phone call progress report within one business day of hospital dismissal, and standard clinic phone triage during business hours. It also involves a 24 hour nurse triage line for questions. Patients will be informed of the general options currently available to patients including the above as well as options for care in extended hours and at Mayo Express care.
