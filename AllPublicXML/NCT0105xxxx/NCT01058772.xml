  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether, in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)
      pregnancies, induction of labour at 38-39 weeks of pregnancy is superior to expectant
      management in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and
      its incidence is estimated as around 7%. Babies born from women with GDM are significantly
      more exposed to perinatal risk. Furthermore in GDM pregnancies an increased C-section rate
      has been observed, mostly unjustified.

      Strong evidence, based on prospective studies and randomized controlled trials, in favour or
      against the effectiveness and safeness of induction in women with GDM, are missing. The aim
      of the present study is to identify the best management for these women at term and provide
      evidence that could change the current clinical practice.

      To reach this objective, 1760 eligible women will be recruited at 9 Teaching Hospitals (5 in
      Italy, 4 all over the world). Sample size has been estimated to demonstrate a difference
      between the two arms ≥ 6% (31% of C-section in the expectant group and 25% in the induction
      group; relative difference between the 2 groups equal to 20% in favor of induction; Kjos et
      al, 1993), considering an α error equal to 5% and 80% power.

      Patients will be randomized to induction of labour (N=880) or expectant management (N=880).
      Data on maternal and neonatal outcomes will be collected at delivery and until maternal and
      neonatal discharge.

    <description>At enrollment patients assigned to the induction group will be admitted to the obstetric ward and will undergo induction of labour as described in the intervention section.
Once patient's Bishop score exceeds 7 or regular contractions are diagnosed, patients will be transferred to the delivery ward for artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) or Oxytocin augmentation as indicated.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled in the conservative management arm will be followed up twice weekly for foetal wellbeing by Non-stress test and Biophysical profile. Patients will be followed up to 41+0 weeks.
Patients, who will not deliver by this gestational age, will be admitted for labour induction (see the above protocol). Induction of labour will be offered when non-reassuring foetal status is suspected. All patients in the conservative arm will undergo foetal weight ultrasound estimation prior to induction. Patients with estimated foetal weight over 4000 gr will be offered a C-section.</description>

    <description>Induction of labour will be performed by using dinoprostone 2 mg vaginally or dinoprostone 0.5 mg intracervically at 6-8h interval (up to 5 doses) or dinoprostone 10 mg vaginal device. Patients, in which cervical ripening does not occur (Bishop score &lt; 7) after 5 attempts with PGE2, will be offered either oxytocin or Foley catheter induction or C-section, according to local protocols.</description>
