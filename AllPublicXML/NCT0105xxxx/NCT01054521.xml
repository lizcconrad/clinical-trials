    <textblock>
      Currently, there are several alternative treatments for patients with chronic rhinitis (CR)
      who failed medication. Although, most of the researches have been focusing on
      temperature-controlled RF (TCRF), the cost is a major limitation for applying it worldwide.
      The investigators objective of this study is to compare the subjective and objective outcomes
      of Bipolar RF (BRF) with the more popular TCRF for CR treatment. The investigators
      hypothesized that both have equivalent outcomes but with less operative time and potentially
      at lower cost.

    <description>The temperature-controlled RF was done under local anesthesia (0.5% xylocaine with adrenaline 1:200,000 injection at both inferior turbinates.) The RF probe will be inserted at inferior turbinate for 5 points both left and right nasal cavity (2 at anterior end, 2 at middle part and 1 at posterior end). We apply energy of 300 J, 85 C, and 15 W each point. After procedures the patients was observed at 1 hour before discharge without any packings.</description>

    <description>The bipolar RF (BRF) probe will be inserted at the same area with TCRF. We use 2.5 watt and 3 sec for each point but will stop immediately if the burning color or sound are detected. Otherwise was the same with TCRF.</description>

For nontemperature-controlled RF, the probe will be inserted at the same area with TCRF. We use 2.5 watt and 3 sec for each point but will stop immediately if the burning color or sound are detected. Otherwise was the same with TCRF.</description>
