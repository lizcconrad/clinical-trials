      The primary endpoint for this study is the clinical response after 12 weeks of treatment,
      defined as a change in total score from baseline depressive symptoms as measured by the Beck
      Depression Inventory-Amended (BDI-IA) total score.

      ACCORDO is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study conducted in
      12 Italian centres. Subjects are screened by means of the BDI-IA (cut-off 15) and randomised
      to treatment with rasagiline or placebo for 12 weeks.

      Subjects have to be on stable treatment with dopaminergic agents at least 4 weeks before
      baseline, and maintained so during the course of the study.

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether rasagiline compared to placebo improves
      depressive symptoms as evaluated by the BDI-IA total score.
