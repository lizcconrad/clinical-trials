  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will enroll adult recipients of HLA-identical living kidney transplants
      who are at least 1 year post-transplant. All subjects will be taking Prograf (tacrolimus) or
      cyclosporine and mycophenolic acid (CellCept or Myfortic) and then be randomized (1:2) to
      either continue calcineurin inhibitors or to taper off of calcineurin inhibitors. The
      hypothesis is that mycophenolic acid monotherapy permits long-term rejection-free renal
      allograft function in the absence of long-term calcineurin inhibitors in this fully matched
      renal transplant cohort.

  <detailed_description>

      The objective of the study is to safely move HLA-identical renal transplant recipients from 2
      immunosuppressive drugs (calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolic acid) to mycophenolic acid
      monotherapy. Safety will be assessed by monitoring renal function in subjects in the
      withdrawal group compared to those who remain on the standard 2-drug immunosuppression
      protocol. Results of immunological monitors such as DTH regulation in response to donor minor
      antigens and development of anti-donor antibodies will be correlated with successful
      withdrawal.
