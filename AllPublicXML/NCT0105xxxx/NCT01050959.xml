    <textblock>
      The purpose of this compassionate use study is to provide clinical and technical support of
      the Bion速 microstimulator system to the subjects who have decided to keep the system for
      relief of headache symptoms that have not responded to medical treatment. These study
      subjects were enrolled and implanted with the Bion速 system during a previous clinical
      investigation of the Bion速 for occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in the United States.
