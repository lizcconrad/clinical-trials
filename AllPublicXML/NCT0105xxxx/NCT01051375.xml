      The current application targets patient education and enablement, implementation of best
      practices, continuity of care, and an improvement model to improve efficiencies by
      investigating whether a brief targeted intervention prior to the first formal ED assessment
      is efficacious in altering outcome and treatment course.

      The Eating Disorder Program at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) offers a
      continuum of treatment options to child and adolescent patients with eating disorders (EDs).
      Although our own funding has increased in recent years, so too have the number of referrals,
      which has resulted in lengthy wait times for therapeutic assessments by our team. The current
      application targets patient education and enablement, implementation of best practices,
      continuity of care, and an improvement model to improve efficiencies by investigating whether
      a brief targeted intervention prior to the first formal ED assessment is efficacious in
      altering outcome and treatment course. It is well known that early recognition and
      implementation of treatment as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms is protective in
      eating disorders and leads to better success rates and recovery (APA Treatment Guidelines for
      EDs). It is hoped that the outcome of this study will influence the way in which centers look
      to address the ongoing issue of lengthy wait times in hopes of offering cost-effective
      interventions that ultimately improve patient outcomes. By offering an added level of support
      to families whose referral has been initiated, we hope to ease the burden of primary care
      providers and increase their satisfaction as it relates to patient safety concerns and
      complex case management.
