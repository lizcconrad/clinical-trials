  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of gabapentin on symptom control
      in patients with defined functional dyspepsia refractory to conventional proton pump
      inhibitor therapy and to compare these effects to that of placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study we hypothesize that the patients on gabapentin will have an increase in
      the adequacy of dyspepsia symptom control at two months as well as improvement in dyspepsia
      symptom index scores which are a surrogate of quality of life measures, when compared to
      placebo.

      While functional dyspepsia is divided into four subtypes most studies have grouped all four
      as 'functional dyspepsia' and treated them as one. Proton pump inhibition may benefit those
      with epigastric pain or burning but typically not those with post-prandial fullness or early
      satiety. (Tack et al). Those patients with symptoms refractory to proton pump inhibition
      might benefit from a medication that modifies visceral hypersensitivity such as gabapentin.
      It is possible that by modifying their pain syndrome we can decrease the need for follow-up
      appointments and improve patient quality of life.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients to be included in this study are adults (age &gt;18 years) with defined
             functional dyspepsia per the ROME III criteria with a negative EGD who are on proton
             pump inhibitor therapy yet still have a sense of inadequate symptom control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients excluded will be women of childbearing age who refuse to have a baseline
             pregnancy test and/or who refuse to prevent pregnancy during the trial period.
             Exclusion criteria will also include anyone with a history of adverse effect or
             allergy to gabapentin. Finally, any patient undergoing hemodialysis or with a history
             of creatinine chronically greater than 1.5 will be excluded.
