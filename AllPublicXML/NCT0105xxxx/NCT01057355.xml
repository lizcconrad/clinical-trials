  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cysts are common, and some pancreas cysts have malignant potential. Usual
      treatment of these cysts is either observation or surgical removal of part or all of the
      pancreas. Minimally invasive treatment via endoscopy has been described, using endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS) guided ethanol injections. Such studies exclude cysts that communicate with
      the main pancreatic duct, to avoid burning the main pancreatic duct with ethanol. In this
      study, pancreas cysts communicating with the main pancreas duct are treated with ethanol via
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and/or EUS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo EUS and/or ERCP as outpatients. For cysts shown to communicate with the
      main pancreas duct, a balloon catheter will be placed in the main pancreatic duct via ERCP.
      The balloon catheter will isolate the cyst from the main pancreatic duct, allowing ethanol
      injections of the cyst. A pancreatic duct stent will be placed in some patients, requiring
      repeat endoscopy for removal at another time.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a pancreatic cystic lesion, at least 2 cm in maximum diameter

          -  Cyst may communicate, or definitely communicates, with the pancreatic duct (based on
             prior CT, MR, ERCP, or EUS images)

          -  Treatment of the cystic lesion is desired due to symptoms or concern for subsequent
             malignancy

          -  Age at least 18 years

          -  Able to give informed consent

          -  Surgical treatment has been considered and a surgical consultation offered to the
             patient, OR the subject's cyst does not meet consensus criteria for surgical
             resection. (Current consensus criteria for resection are one or more of the following:
             cyst is symptomatic, â‰¥ 3 cm in diameter, contains a mural nodule, cytology of cyst
             fluid is positive for malignancy, or main pancreatic duct diameter is &gt; 6 mm.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected pregnancy, or nursing

          -  History of pancreatitis within 3 months prior to study endoscopy procedures

          -  Cyst has a primarily microcystic architecture on EUS
