      Role fo oxidative stress in adrenal insufficiency has not been studied. The degree of
      oxidative stress and it's role in pediatric critical illness is unknown. Potential for
      significant alterations to many of thew body's regulatory pathways may result from severe
      oxidative stress. Further is needed to delineate what if any role oxidative stress may play

      Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is common in critically ill children and adults. AI is a condition
      in which the adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, do not make enough hormones or our
      body is unable to use the hormones made. A hormone is a chemical that helps control different
      kinds of body functions. The hormones being studied can influence blood pressure and how fast
      the heart beats. Doctors want to know why children need extra hormones when they are
      critically ill. In our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) we treat AI with a set of
      standard orders. By doing this, we have shown that AI is common in many types of sickness and
      that blood pressure improves when extra hormones are given. We also found that people's heart
      and blood pressure did not always match the level of a certain hormone, called cortisol, in
      their blood.

      Since cortisol levels alone don't always show AI, and children with normal hormone levels
      still benefit from steroids, doctors are looking for a better understanding of AI. Finding
      reasons that children develop AI may help doctors find other ways to improve AI.

      One promising focus of AI is the role of oxidative stress (OS). OS is a term used to describe
      a group of chemical reactions that involve oxygen. Emory's adult intensive care units have
      shown a significant increase in OS in critically ill patients. Normally our body's cortisol
      acts by binding to glucocorticoid (a class of hormone) receptors (GR) within cells. Many
      studies have shown that OS increases steroid resistance by changing the GR structure and
      function. Studies involving OS and GR problems have not been done with children.

      We aim to:

        1. Find out how many sick children have OS in the PICU.

        2. Find out the normal OS level of healthy children.

        3. Decide if OS causes adrenal insufficiency.

    <description>Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction also known as the PELOD Score is a marker of severity of illness for Critically ill children. The PELOD includes six organ dysfunctions and 12 variables.
To calculate the PELOD score, each organ dysfunction received points for the single variable associated with the most points. The minimum number that can be assigned to an organ is 0 and the maximum number of points for an organ is 20, and the maximum possible PELOD score is 71. Organ dysfunction is identified if the score for any organ system was more than 0.</description>

Serum, and when available endotracheal samples, will be obtained within 24 hours of admission and at 5 days provided patients are 1) still in the PICU and 2) blood draws and endotracheal aspirates are part of their standard of care. Endotracheal aspirates will be sent on day 14, 21, and 28 provided patients are intubated and require suctioning as part of their standard of care.</description>

        <title>Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score in Critically Ill Children</title>
        <description>Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction also known as the PELOD Score is a marker of severity of illness for Critically ill children. The PELOD includes six organ dysfunctions and 12 variables.
To calculate the PELOD score, each organ dysfunction received points for the single variable associated with the most points. The minimum number that can be assigned to an organ is 0 and the maximum number of points for an organ is 20, and the maximum possible PELOD score is 71. Organ dysfunction is identified if the score for any organ system was more than 0.</description>
        <time_frame>1 years</time_frame>
        <population>PELOD scores are not calculated for healthy controls. The score was developed to assess critically ill patients only.</population>
