      The purpose of this 52-week clinical trial is to see if the meditation-based intervention,
      adjunctive to standard of care therapy, can reduce relapse and improve psychological health
      among adults recovering from alcohol dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this partially-blinded, two-arm clinical trial was to test whether the
      Mindfulness Meditation Relapse Prevention (meditation), combined with 'standard of care'
      (SOC) therapy, is more effective in preventing a return to drinking than SOC alone (wait-list
      control) among adult recovering alcoholics. The intervention was manualized and based on
      existing models. It was proposed that meditation may improve outcomes of interest through
      reduction of the severity of stress-related relapse risk factors such as perceived stress,
      anxiety, depression, craving and emotion dysregulation, and the level of stress-sensitive
      biomarkers (cytokine interleukin-6, liver enzymes).

      For this study, 123 adult alcohol dependent subjects were recruited from collaborating
      treatment centers, randomly assigned to one of two equal study arms, and followed for
      26-weeks (Period 1, Randomized Controlled Trial, RCT). The RCT evaluated the efficacy of the
      meditation intervention using self-reported alcohol consumption as primary, and
      drinking-related harms and subject treatment satisfaction and adherence as secondary
      outcomes. It also gathered preliminary data on potential mechanisms of meditation action.
      After the completion of their 26-week RCT (Period 1), controls were eligible to receive the
      meditation intervention (&quot;cross-over&quot;), and all participants were followed-up for additional
      26 weeks (non-randomized Period 2).

      This study will provide evidence about the efficacy of meditation for alcohol relapse
      prevention, will further our understanding of relapse and the potential mechanisms of
      meditation action, direct future research and guide clinical decision-making.

The intervention is an extension of existing meditation-based therapies for stress, relapse prevention in addictive disorders, and depression.

Its curriculum includes both meditation and &quot;traditional&quot; cognitive therapy relapse prevention components. The intervention consists of an 8-week, manualized meditation course (2 hours/week group sessions) guided by trained instructors. In addition, experimental subjects are asked to meditate at-home (30 min/day, 6 days/week) during the study.</description>

        <population>Only 105 participants provided data for this measure at 26-week follow up; due to participants either: declining participation for the visit, being unable to reach within the 26-week follow up time, or withdrawing from the study before 26-week follow up. Of the 105, 3 meditation/0 controls met criteria for having relapsed during this time frame.</population>

            <description>Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention intervention + Standard of Care therapy
Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for Alcohol Dependence: All study subjects receive outpatient standard of care (SOC) therapy for alcohol dependence. In addition, experimental subjects receive the Mindfulness Meditation Relapse Prevention ('meditation') intervention. This intervention is an extension of existing meditation-based therapies for stress, relapse prevention in addictive disorders, and depression. It has been directly patterned after Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention and tailored to the specific needs of alcoholics. Its curriculum includes both meditation and &quot;traditional&quot; cognitive therapy relapse prevention components. The intervention consists of an 8-week, manualized meditation course (2 hours/week group sessions) guided by trained instructors. In addition, experimental subjects are asked to meditate at-home (30 min/day, 6 days/week) during the whole study.</description>

Subjects in the control group receive SOC only. Subjects in the experimental arm will receive the study meditation intervention in addition to SOC.</description>
