      An open clinical trial transplanting CHONDRON (autologous chondrocytes) to ankle cartilage
      defect patients who are appropriate for the trial, and evaluating the validity and safety for
      12 months.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was designed to observe effects of CHONDRON (autologous chondrocytes) for
      12 months in patients with ankle cartilage defects. In this clinical trial, 30 subjects were
      screened- 4 were excluded half way and 26 finished the trial. Full-thickness articular
      cartilage specimen was obtained from sites that do not have direct articulation within the
      ankle joint(anterior talus, anterior process of calcaneus, calcaneocuboid joint area.)
      Gel-type CHONDRON (Fibrin mixed Autologous chondrocytes) was transplanted at the defects.
      Evaluation variables were AOFAS, 100 mm VAS, HANNOVER score, self-assessment of improvement
      by the patient, MRI and arthroscopy.

    <measure>Average Change From Baseline in 100mm Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) at 12months Post-surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline(preoperative stage),12months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS is a horizontal line, 100mm in length, anchored by word descriptors about pain at each end.The VAS is measured degree of pain from 0mm to 100mm. Severe pain is represented by 100mm and no pain is represented by 0mm. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.
The difference of secondary evaluation variables VAS at baseline and after the end of the trial were analyzed by using paired t-test. Improvements were compared and analysis by each time point.</description>

    <measure>Average Change From Baseline in the Modified Hannover Scoring System at 12 Months Post Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline(preoperative stage),12months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Hannover Score System contains information about patient's status(pain-36, clinical finding- 4, patient's subjective assessment- 25, statics- 6, fuction- 26, radiology-7;best score-104, worst score-0).The scores of 27 patients in the FAS group were taken in the screening period (Visit S), 12 months after transplantation (Visit 7). The difference of the scores at screening and 12 months after transplantation was compared by using the paired t-test. Improvements were compared and analyzed at each time point.</description>

Directions and dosage:
Suspend the cells in the vial sufficiently, and implant them in the defective part, making sure that sufficient amounts are injected.
*30 subjects participated in this open clinical trial. Those who agreed to participate voluntarily went through screening to confirm the appropriateness for the clinical trial, and then received Gel type CHONDRON (fibrin mixed autologous chondrocytes) transplantation.</description>

        <title>Average Change From Baseline in 100mm Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) at 12months Post-surgery</title>
        <description>A VAS is a horizontal line, 100mm in length, anchored by word descriptors about pain at each end.The VAS is measured degree of pain from 0mm to 100mm. Severe pain is represented by 100mm and no pain is represented by 0mm. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.
The difference of secondary evaluation variables VAS at baseline and after the end of the trial were analyzed by using paired t-test. Improvements were compared and analysis by each time point.</description>
