  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Engagement in substance-free activities, such as exercise, has an inverse relationship to
      substance use in college students. While exercise has numerous physical and mental health
      benefits, the majority of college students are sedentary, infrequently engaging in exercise.
      Although exercise interventions to date often suffer from significant attrition and poor
      adherence, motivational interventions for exercise are beginning to show promise. In this
      pilot study we propose to develop and evaluate a novel exercise intervention combining
      Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) with contingency management (CM) in sedentary college
      students who use alcohol.
