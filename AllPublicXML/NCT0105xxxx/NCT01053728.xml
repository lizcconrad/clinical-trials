      Primary Objective:

      - To establish initial safety/tolerability and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles
      of four formulations of SAR161271 in patients with T1DM.

      Secondary Objective:

      - To establish relative potency of SAR161271 compared with insulin glargine in patients with
      T1DM

      The total per patient is between 31 and 67 days; including post-study visit between 108 and
      172 days. In case of an additional late post-study visit after last dosing, approximately 213
      to 279 days, broken down as follows:

        -  Screening: 3 to 27 days;

        -  Treatment Periods each 1 day with institutionalisation from Day -1 to Day 3;

        -  Wash-out between doses: 7 to 10 days;

        -  End of Study visit: 7 to 10 days after last dose.

        -  Post-study visit 84 to 112 days after last dosing. If necessary, additional post-study
           visit 6 to 7 months after last dosing.
