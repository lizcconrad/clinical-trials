  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if oral (mouth) delivery prior to tumor
      removal in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) results in tumor shrinkage
      allowing for successful surgery. Therapy will be administered orally and the response of the
      tumor will be assessed using CTs or MRIs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare cancer affecting primarily the digestive
      tract and sometimes abdominal cavity in adults. The most common site is the stomach followed
      by the duodenum and small intestine.

      Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for GIST patients whose primary tumor is felt to be
      resectable. Prior to the introduction of Gleevec, patients with inoperable GIST had
      essentially no therapeutic options. However, sunitinib trials offer options to patients who
      are Gleevec resistant or have intolerant GIST. Clinical benefit has been demonstrated with
      positive results in several sunitinib studies of varying phases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients more than 19 years old with pathologically proven GIST which is bulky or
             marginally resectable

          -  Patients must have at least one bidimensionally measurable disease site of 5 cm or
             greater not previously irradiated. Bone lesions do not qualify.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance of greater than or equal to 2, with projected
             survival of at least three months.

          -  Patients must have adequate laboratory parameters:

        Hematologic: Hb &gt;9.0; WBC &gt;3200 and platelets &gt;100,000/mm3; Hepatic: Bilirubin &lt;2.0 and AST
        within 4 times upper limit of normal; Renal: Creatinine of less than or equal to 1.6 or
        eGFR greater than or equal to 50 mL/min

          -  Men and women who are of childbearing potential must practice strict birth control for
             the duration of the study.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be non-lactating and non-pregnant with a negative
             pregnancy test within two weeks of trial registration.

          -  The patient, a witness, and attending physician will have signed an IRB-approved
             informed consent prior to Sunitinib administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known brain metastases or significant pleural effusion or ascites.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, or other medical condition.

          -  Major surgery within 21 days of registration.

          -  Patients wtih organ grafts with the exception of prior high dose chemotherapy with
             autologous bone marrow (or stem cell) transplantation.

          -  History of seizures, central nervous system disorders, dementia, or psychosis that
             might preclude adequate informed consent or protocol compliance.

          -  Prior therapy for GIST.

          -  A history of HIV or hepatitis virus infection.

          -  Any recent medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the
             patient unsuitable for study participation.

          -  Patients with impaired kidney function.

        <title>Alteration in Diffusion and Vascularity Kinetics</title>
        <description>The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria may be insensitive in assessing GIST so the Choi criteria will be used. The Choi criteria accounts for morphologic tumor changes and biologic alterations. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic contrast magnetic resonance will be used to find the vascular permeability and apparent diffusion coefficient 9ACD) at baseline, Week 2 and Week 6. Weeks 2 and 6 values will be compared to the baseline values using paired t tests.</description>

            <description>Patients will receive six weeks of sunitinib and then subsequently continue for an additional 6 weeks if the evaluation at 6 weeks shows stable disease or objective response. Restaging CT scans will be performed again after 12 weeks of therapy to determine response in preparation for surgical resection anticipated to occur around week 14-16.
Sunitinib: All patients will receive sunitinib 37.5 mg p.o. daily for up to 12 weeks to be taken orally.
Surgery: Following sunitinib therapy, patients will be evaluated for surgery. It is anticipated that the quality of response will allow for complete resection of residual tumor. Surgical resection, if eligible, will occur around week 14-16.</description>
