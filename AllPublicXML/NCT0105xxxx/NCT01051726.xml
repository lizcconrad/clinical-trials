    <textblock>
      Aromatherapy is a form of complementary medicine that uses scented materials known as
      essential oils for the purpose of affecting a person's health or mood. Although aromatherapy
      has been used in childbirth for centuries, there are no high-quality studies examining
      whether the treatment works.

      Methodology

      We would like to see if aromatherapy affects a woman's experience of childbirth by lowering
      associated anxiety and pain. Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to one of
      these groups:

        1. Aromatherapy oils (e.g. clary sage, peppermint, lavender, frankincense)

        2. Non-essential oil (baby oil)

        3. Standard maternity care

      We will gather primary data, e.g. if she's been in labour before and her awareness of
      complementary medicine. We will also conduct the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
      with her, and provide her with the oil and swab if she is in groups 1 or 2 with instructions
      to keep the swab with the oil on it near to her. She can also put more oil on the swab as she
      requires.

      Postnatally, data will be collected from her notes regarding pain relief used, duration of
      labour, augmentation of labour, and any other medical interventions of note. We will also
      complete the anxiety scale with her once more. Before her discharge we ask the mother for any
      comments regarding her experience of the labour. The results from all three cohorts will then
      be compared. There will also be opportunity for the midwife to make any comments regarding
      his/her perception of the participant's labour. Finally we will hold a focus group with
      midwives regarding the practicalities for implementation of aromatherapy in maternity care
