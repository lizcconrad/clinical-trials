  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the NEC device can effectively occlude the
      intracranial aneurysm or the carotid/vertebrobasilar fistula and maintain parent vessel
      patency

    <textblock>
      SAH (subarachnoid hemorrhage) is a devastating medical emergency. As many as 60% of patients
      who are afflicted die in the first 30 days as a result of the SAH, or remain severely
      disabled from the bleed. Existing treatment options include: medical management; endovascular
      therapy and surgical therapy. Endovascular techniques using detachable coils have now been
      refined to include stents which serve to prevent the coil mass from dislodging. Further
      improvement is believed to be possible with the NEC which creates a seal to exclude the
      aneurismal lumen from blood flow without the need for coils. This study involves the
      endovascular placement of the NEC across the aneurysm neck in order to treat a subset of
      aneurysms without coils.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of unruptured aneurysm OR ruptured aneurysm in clinically stable
             patients in whom coils alone are not an efficient treatment in the opinion of the
             investigator (i.e., large neck or fusiform aneurysm) OR direct fistulae (Type A -
             traumatic or aneurismal) and indirect if dural branches come from the internal carotid
             or vertebral artery and cannot be embolized selectively

          -  Subject has a confirmed diagnosis of an intracranial (including intracavernous and
             intrapetrous regions) sidewall saccular aneurysm or carotid vertebrobasilar fistula

          -  Parent artery reference diameter is &gt;2.5mm and &lt;4.5mm

          -  Subject is an adult above age 18

          -  Subject is able to provide written Informed Consent

          -  Subject has good general health, is clinically stable, and is considered to be
             mentally sound

          -  Subject is able and is willing to meet all expected requirements of the clinical
             protocol, including attending the scheduled follow-up examinations for the duration of
             this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) &lt; three (3) weeks prior to NEC procedure

          -  Subject has had prior stenting of the target aneurysm.

          -  Subject is contraindicated for antiplatelet therapy,anticoagulant therapy, or
             radiographic contrast media.

          -  Subject has collagen vascular disease.

          -  Subject has a contraindication to angiography (e.g., serum creatinine level &gt; 2.5
             mg/dL)

          -  Subject has evidence of active infection at the time of treatment

          -  Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or unwilling to use birth control for duration of
             study

          -  Subject has participated in a study involving an investigational drug or device within
             30 days prior to proposed entry into subject study

          -  Subject is unable to comply with study procedures or protocol

          -  Subject has co-morbid disease or condition expected to compromise survival or ability
             to complete follow-up assessments to 180 days
