    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of temporary gastric mucosal electrical stimulation (tGES) in 30
      patients with gastroparesis (GP). After a 7 day baseline assessment of symptoms, subjects
      will have an endoscopically-placed tGES lead implanted into the mucosa of the antrum. This
      lead is connected to a thin wire that runs up the esophagus and out the nostril, similar to a
      nasojejunal feeding tube, although much thinner. It is then attached to a programmable
      battery pack which provides the desired level of stimulation.

      Patients will then be randomized to 7 days OFF or 7 days ON stimulation in a double-blind
      fashion. After 7 days, subjects will crossover to the other study arm (ie ON patients will be
      switched off; OFF patients will be switched on). Symptoms and QoL measures will be assessed
      at baseline, ON, and OFF periods. Serum ghrelin and other hormones, as well as EGG will be
      assayed after 6 days in each arm.

    <description>The lead is a sterile, 2mm diameter insulated wire (Temporary Transvenous Pacing Lead 6416-200cm, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) with 2 electrodes on the distal end. The mucosal stimulation parameters(Current:10 mA; Frequency: 14Hz; Pulse width: 330 ms; Cycle ON: 0.1 s; Cycle OFF: 5 s) are within the range used for standard permanent implanted GES (Enterra therapy) within the serosa and muscle layers of the stomach, and which has been shown to be safe, without any tissue damage.</description>

             study gastroenterologist based on past medical history, clinical symptoms

          -  Sufficiently symptomatic at time of proposed study (Minimum total baseline GCSI score
             of 1.5 or higher)

          -  Delayed gastric emptying (&gt;10% retention at 4 hours) on standard scintigraphic
             emptying study with patients off narcotics for at least 48 hours. Normal upper

          -  Medically fit to undergo endoscopy

          -  Able and willing to remain in Calgary for the duration of the study (baseline period
             excepted)

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical evidence (including physical exam and/or EKG) of significant cardiovascular,
             respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological,
             psychiatric or other disease that may interfere with the objectives of the study
             and/or pose safety concerns

          -  Current use of anticoagulants, ASA, NSAIDS, clopidogrel, etc. which cannot safely be
             stopped for up to 5 days prior to the procedure in the opinion of the investigators
