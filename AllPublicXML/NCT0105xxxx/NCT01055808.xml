  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to address the gap in the literature related to changing treatment
      regimen or formulation between different types of insulin, and how this change impacts
      quality of life, adherence, individual patient treatment satisfaction and glycemic control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To measure changes in Health Related Quality of Life (as measured by the Insulin Therapy
      Related-Quality of Life: ITR-QOL) in insulin treated type 2 diabetes over a 12 weeks period
      following a significant change in insulin treatment regimen. Definition of significant change
      is a) increase or decrease the in number of injections per day, or/and b) change in
      formulation of insulin (human or analog insulin, basal or bolus, rapid or mix insulin),
      and/or c) change in administration method (syringe or pen, disposal or re-usable).

             informed consent. (i.e. receiving the same type of insulin preparation at the same
