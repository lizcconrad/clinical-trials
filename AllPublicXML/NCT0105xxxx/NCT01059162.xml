        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Patient must have primary open angle glaucoma or pseudo-exfoliative glaucoma in the
             study eye; diagnosis is based on glaucomatous optic neuropathy, Shaffer angle of +2
             and visual field defect attributed to glaucoma (at least two consecutive abnormal
             visual field test results, defined as a pattern SD (PSD) outside the 95% normal
             confidence limits and/or glaucoma Hemifield Test (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc.).

          3. Eye to be treated must be phakic or pseudophakic eye with no ocular disorder or ocular
             diseases but cataract, and no prior surgical intervention in study eye but cataract
             surgery with clear corneal incision and trabeculoplasty performed &gt; 3 months ago.

          4. Patient is indicated for filtration surgery.

          5. Presence of ocular hypertension, defined as an intraocular corrected pressure (IOP) ≥
             21 mm Hg in the study eye, while on maximal tolerated medications . This IOP level of
             above or equal 21 mmHg must be verified and recorded in the most recent 2 consecutive
             measurements (but not taken on the same day) prior to operation.

          6. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) better than 20/200 in the fellow eye.

          7. Optic neuropathy is attributed exclusively to glaucoma.

          8. Patient or legal guardian agrees to sign written informed consent prior to study
             participation.

          9. Patient is able and willing to complete post-operative follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has previously undergone a non-penetrating glaucoma surgery with the IOPtima
             CO2 Laser System in fellow eye.

          2. Diagnosis of glaucoma other than primary open angle glaucoma or pseudo-exfoliative
             glaucoma.

          3. History of previous intraocular surgery in the study eye; referring to but not limited
             to glaucoma filtering surgery (penetrating and non-penetrating), laser gonioplasty,
             corneal transplant, and history of any other laser ocular procedures except for laser
             trabeculoplasty surgery.

          4. Laser trabeculoplasty surgery within the last three months in the study eye.

          5. Study eye is aphakic.

          6. Patients with previous cataract extraction with scleral tunnel and or conjunctival
             incision in the study eye.

          7. Proliferative or severe non-proliferative retinopathy in either eye.

          8. Eyes with (dilated) pupil diameter of less than 2 mm in the study eye.

          9. Discernable congenital anomaly of the anterior chamber angle in the study eye.

         10. Patients with neuropathy other than glaucoma in the study eye.

         11. Patient with RVO (retinal vein occlusion) in the study eye.

         12. Patient with RAO (retinal artery occlusion) in the study eye.

         13. History of prior vitrectomy or Vitreous Hemorrhage (VH) in the study eye.

         14. Patient with media opacification which may interfere with optic nerve evaluation in
             the study eye.

         15. Patient with a history of severe eye trauma in the study eye

         16. Patient with ocular malformations such as microphthalmia in the study eye.

         17. Patient with concurrent inflammatory / infective eye disorder (e.g. episcleritis,
             scleritis) in the study eye

         18. Patient with any sign of past or present uveitis (anterior / posterior)

         19. Patient with known allergy to the study medications.

         20. Patient with severe systemic disease or disabling conditions such as: chronic renal
             failure requiring dialysis, severe and disenabling neurological disease, and post
             organ transplants.

         21. Patient participating in another clinical trial or participation in another clinical
             trial is &lt; 3 months.

         22. Patient is pregnant or breast feeding. Women of child bearing age will submit a urine
             sample result for β-HCG (Pregnancy test) within 2 weeks of surgery.
