      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Microplasmin administered as an
      intravitreal injection, in subjects with focal vitreomacular adhesion. Ultimately, it is
      believed that intravitreal microplasmin may offer physicians a safe agent for pharmacologic
      vitreolysis and induction of Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) without the need for
      vitrectomy. This clinical study is justified because the study sponsor believes the potential
      benefits outweigh the potential risks, as outlined below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  I. Male or female patients aged &gt; 18

          -  II. Presence of focal vitreomacular adhesion (ie, central vitreal adhesion within 6mm
             OCT field surrounded by elevation of the posterior vitreous cortex

          -  III. BCVA of 20/32 or worse in the study eye

          -  IV. BCVA of 20/400 or better in the contralateral eye

          -  V. Written informed consent obtained from the patient prior to inclusion in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  I. Evidence of complete macular PVD in the study eye on biomicroscopy, B-scan or OCT
             prior to planned study drug injection

          -  II. Any evidence of proliferative retinopathy meeting the definition for PDR in the
             study eye

          -  III. Patients with vitreous hemorrhage which precludes either of the following:
             visualization of the posterior pole by visual inspection OR adequate assessment of the
             macula by either OCT and/or fluorescein angiogram in the study eye

          -  IV. Patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, PVR, or retinal degenerative
             changes associated with increased risk of retinal detachment in the study eye. Such
             retinal degenerative changes include lattice degeneration or cystic retinal tufts.
             Thorough retinal examination should be performed in all patients to rule out these
             changes.

          -  V. Patients with high myopia (&gt; 8D) or aphakia in the study eye

        VI. Patients with history of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the fellow eye VII.
        Patients who have had ocular surgery in the study eye in the prior three months VIII.
        Patients who have had a vitrectomy in the study eye at any time. IX. Patients with glaucoma
        that is not controlled with topical medication or that is associated with severe visual
        field loss, documented by perimetry, in the study eye X. Patients who have had laser
        photocoagulation treatment in the study eye in the previous 3 months XI. Intravitreal
        injection of any drug in the study eye in the previous 3 months XII. Patients who are
        pregnant or of child-bearing potential not utilizing a form of contraception acceptable to
        the Investigator XIII. Patients who, in the investigators view, will not complete all
        visits and investigations, including the last visit at 6 months after the last injection
        XIV. Patients who have participated in an investigational drug study within the past 30
        days XV. Patients with hypertension (either SBP &gt; 170 or DBP &gt; 100 mm Hg) XVI. Patients
        with a life expectancy less than 6 months XVII. Patients who have previously participated
        in this trial
