  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the effect and safety of oral administration of VECAM 40/300
      administered at bedtime compared to Esomeprazole 20 mg administered 30-60 minutes before
      dinner, for control of nighttime and daytime HB and other 24 hour GERD symptoms.

      The rational for the study is based on the contention that VECAM exhibits potent inhibition
      of acid secretion and because of its mechanism of action, it can be administered at bedtime
      without food. Such timing of drug dosing will allow effective inhibition of nighttime acid
      secretion. Because of its mechanism of action, VECAM exhibits improved 24-hour inhibition of
      acid secretion and hence, its bedtime administration will not compromise its effect during
      the daytime. This improved control of acid secretion will predictably result in better
      control of nighttime as well as daytime heartburn (HB) symptoms.
