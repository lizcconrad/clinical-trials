    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability of AZD5069 at
      steady-state, following twice a day oral dosing in healthy subjects.

      AZD5069 is being developed by AstraZeneca and this study is being carried out on behalf of
      the sponsor by Quintiles Drug Research Unit at Guy's Hospital, London. This is the second
      time that AZD5069 will be administered to humans in clinical trials. We are conducting this
      study to determine whether AZD5069 is safe and well tolerated by healthy males and females at
      different dose levels over an 8-day dosing period. We will also be studying how quickly
      AZD5069 is absorbed into and cleared by the body. It is planned that there will be up to 3
      dose groups in the study and each group will consist of up to 12 volunteers, with 9 receiving
      the active drug and 3 receiving placebo. The study involves 3 visits over approximately 8
      weeks, and will include 1 residential visit lasting 10 nights and a follow up.
