      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of proton pump inhibitor (PPI), comparing
      to the mucosal defensive drug, in the prevention of the recurrence of gastric and/or duodenal
      ulcers during 12 weeks observation in patients receiving low-dose aspirin for vascular
      protection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The events of recurrence of gastric and/or duodenal ulcers will be evaluated due to a blinded
      manner by specialized endoscopists at pre- and post administration during 12 weeks
      administration of PPI (Rabeprazole sodium 10 mg or 20 mg tablet once a day) or the mucosal
      defensive drug (Gefarnate 50mg Capsule twice a day).
