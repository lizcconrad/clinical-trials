    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is common in some areas , ranking as the fourth leading cause of death from
      cancer in China and sixth worldwide. Although the prognosis of surgical resection for
      esophageal cancer has been improved, more than 50% of such patients are inoperable and have
      to undergo palliative treatments because of late stage cancer or metastasis. Dysphagia is the
      predominate symptom of patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. To relieve the dysphagia
      and improve the quality of life of such patients, brachytherapy has previously been utilized.
      Recently, stent placement has been widely accepted to be an option for palliation of the
      symptoms due to the esophageal strictures. Brachytherapy and esophageal self-expanding stent
      insertion have longer benefit. Stent insertion provides fastest improvement of
      dysphagia.However, recurrence of the neoplastic stricture remains a challenge after stent
      placement, complications in later setting occur and require further endoscopic treatment.
      Brachytherapy has slower onset of benefit but has fewer complications and longer benefit.To
      combine the advantages of the immediate relief of the esophageal dysphagia with the stent
      placement and radiation therapy with brachytherapy, a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I
      seeds has been developed in the authors' institute. The technical feasibility and safety with
      this new stent has been demonstrated to be adequate in a healthy rabbit model. And a
      small-sample and unicentric prior clinical trial in the authors' institute certificated the
      novel esophageal stent can relieve the dysphagia caused by advanced esophageal cancer rapidly
      and improve the quality of life markedly. This current multicentric randomized clinical trial
      is further studying the novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds to see how well they
      work compared with a conventional covered stent in patients with malignant dysphagia caused
      by advanced esophageal cancer.

      PURPOSE Rationale: Placing a stent in the esophagus may relieve the dysphagia caused by
      inoperable esophageal cancer rapidly and improve the quality of life . But recurrence of the
      neoplastic stricture remains a challenge after solitary stent placement. Brachytherapy is an
      option for palliation of the symptoms due to the esophageal strictures,however,it can not
      relieve the dysphagia rapidly. So a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds combines
      the advantages of the immediate relief of the esophageal dysphagia with the stent placement
      and radiation therapy with brachytherapy.

      Purpose: A small-sample and unicentric clinical trial in the authors' institute had
      certificated that a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds for intraluminal
      brachytherapy can relieve the dysphagia caused by advanced esophageal cancer rapidly and
      improve the quality of life . This multicentric randomized clinical trial is further studying
      the novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds to see how well they work compared with a
      conventional covered stent in patients with malignant dysphagia caused by advanced esophageal
      cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicentric, randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo placement of a novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds on
           day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo placement of a conventional covered stent on day 1.

        -  Health-related quality of life is assessed at baseline, I, 3 and 6 months.

      Condition :Esophageal Cancer Intervention (Procedure): Esophageal stent placement,dysphagia
      scores,complications of therapy,survival time of therapy Phase :Ⅲ

      Case exfoliation :

      Definition:any participant who has signed and entered the trial do not insist to the end.The
      reasons may be:

        -  The participant do not cooperate with the designed tests or receive other therapies
           without the permission,

        -  The participant exfoliate from the trial or follow-up lost ,

           the treatment.

      Exfoliation handle:

        -  Inquest the reason and supply the date by telephone and follow-up visiting,

        -  Corresponding methods should be adapted to handle the adverse reactions,adverse events

           rejected case should be supplied with the reason and quit the curative effect
           statistical analysis.However, the record of those who have been treated for at least one
           time should be included into the adverse reactions analysis.

      RANDOMIZATION

      Trial design:

        -  Multicentre: all patients come from sixteen hospitals disseminated in China,

        -  Completely randomized：Number are completely randomized formed depending on the SAS
           statistics software and are administered by the sponsor,every collaborator apply for the
           number once a participant enrolled and choose the treatment arm according to the random
           number.

        -  Single Blind:the participants is unaware which treatment will to be took

        -  Active Control: there are treatment arms. Arm I: patients undergo placement of a novel
           esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds. Arm II: patients undergo placement of a
           conventional covered stent.

        -  Sample estimation:It has been demonstrated in the preclinical trial that the median
           survival time of the advanced esophageal cancer patients with self-expandable esophageal
           radiation stent insertion is about 7 m, while those with conventional covered stent
           insertion is about 4 m. Considering the enrollment time of 3 m(T1 is 0.25y),whole trial
           time of 1.5y.and α is 0.05 (test of two-sided) or 0.10(test of one-sided），the least
           sample number is 152.If the exfoliated cases are considered, the least sample number is
           186 (increasing about 20 percent).

      Case diffusion

      Be sent to one of two arms according to the random number randomized formed by the SAS
      statistics software.

      Radiation dose estimation:

      After balloon dilation ( the special balloon producted for esophageal dilation by Nanjing
      MicroInvasive Medical,Nanjing,China) in participants[the balloon diameter is 16mm in superior
      segment of esophagus and 18mm in the midpiece and inferior segment of esophagus],CT scan of
      the esophagus with the balloon in is performed.Then the images will be send to the Treatment
      Planning System(TPS, Nanjing MicroInvasive Medical,Nanjing,China),and the bulk of the
      oesophageal cancer will be calculated according to the CT three-dimensional reconstruction
      images.At last,the radiation dose will be estimated(with radioactivity 0.7mCi according to
      the preclinical study).

      Choice of stent and seeds fixation:

      The esophageal irradiation stent combined a self-expandable covered esophageal
      stent(MTN;Nanjing MicroInvasive Medical,Nanjing,China) loaded (or not loaded) with 125I
      radiative seeds(CIAE-6711;Chinese Atomic Energy Science Institution,Beijing,China) are
      chose.The diameter varies from 16 to 18mm(16mm in superior segment of esophagus and 18mm in
      the midpiece and inferior segment of esophagus), the length is the length of disease with
      additional 20mm. The seeds (number is decided according to the radiation dose estimated in
      advance)are fixed around the stent,covering the superior and inferior border of the cancer
      (the distance of seeds varies from 10mm to 15mm and the distance of seeds and inlet/outlet
      less than10mm).

      Post-operation Care Participants lie on the back with waist raised after stent insertion,
      common treatments include hemostasis, infection prevention, mucous membrane of esophagus and
      stomach protection.No cold diet,except eating fluid slowly.

      Follow-up

      Calling or visiting the patients every month after test insertion.

      Objectives:

      [Time Frame: Follow-up in intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after stent placement ]

      Primary:

        -  Overall survival

        -  Median Survival

      Secondary

        -  Quality of life [ECOG performance status]

        -  Dysphagia grade [STOOLER stand]

        -  Change of the oesophageal cancer [ RECIST standard]

        -  Restenosis degree[esophagus visualization]

        -  Pathologic change of the cancer,

        -  Successful rate of stent placement,

      Safety

        -  Immune function(IgA,IgG,IgM,CD3,CD4,CD4/CD8)

        -  Myelosuppression

        -  Distribution and attenuation of isotope[ECT or PET]

        -  Adverse events [CTCAE v3.0 standard] Determine the individual rates of complication
           associated with each type of esophageal stent in these patients.

      Statistical analysis:

      All primal date should be stored completely and precisely and submitted to the special date
      administrator in time by the Internet.Before entering the date into the special database by
      two people independent, all submitted data must be reviewed, verified to ensure the accuracy,
      currency(according to the primal date).

      Statistical analysis software of SAS 9.0 is adapted. Test of two-sided, if P ≤0.05,there are
      significant difference. Mean, standard deviation(SD),median, maximum and minimum value are
      used to describe the measurement data of two groups;the rank sum test is used to valuate the
      relief of dysphagia;log-rank test is used to compare the survival curves of two groups which
      have been drawn with the Kaplan-meier method.At last the median survivals will be obtained
      and compared by t test and rank sum test .

      Constituent ratio is used to describe the numeration data of two groups; u test is used to
      valuate the difference of survival rates;and the reasons of restenosis are analysed with
      Fisher`s exact test or chi-square(X2) test.

      The balance-analyses of fundament data(population data and others): t test or chi-square(X2)
      test is chose.
