  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study at the UC Davis MIND Institute in patients age 3.5-16 years of
      age with fragile X syndrome (FXS), funded by a National Fragile X Foundation Grant. It is a
      controlled trial of minocycline, an antibiotic commonly used in children for infection or for
      treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. We are investigating its use in FXS because it
      lowers matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels, which are high in FXS, and it also
      strengthens brain connections in the animal models of FXS. We hypothesize that minocycline
      will likely be helpful for language, behavior and/or cognition in fragile X patients.

      This is a single center study at the UC Davis MIND Institute in patients age 3.5-16 years of
      age with fragile X syndrome (FXS), funded by a National Fragile X Foundation Grant. It is a
      controlled trial of minocycline, an antibiotic commonly used in children for infection or for
      treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. We are investigating its use in FXS because it
      lowers matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels, which are high in FXS, and it also
      strengthens brain connections in the animal models of FXS. We hypothesize that minocycline
      will likely be helpful for language, behavior and/or cognition in fragile X patients.

      The aim of this study is to carry out a double-blind placebo controlled trial of minocycline
      treatment in children with FXS who are 3.5 to 16 years of age. At baseline, we will assess
      behavior and perceptual and cognitive development. After the children have been treated for 3
      months with either minocycline or placebo, they undergo the same baseline testing. They will
      then cross over and be treated for a second 3 months. We will carry out testing again at the
      end of the second 3 month period. We will also assess the side effects of minocycline
      treatment throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months (post first treatment) and 6 months (post second treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I utilizes history from primary caregivers and incorporates it into a seven step clinical rating for follow up throughout treatment, from 1 &quot;very much improved&quot; to 7 &quot;very much worse&quot;. Lower scores indicate more improvement. Scores were obtained post treatments. Scores from when the patients were on minocycline either first or second were combined and averaged to determine a least squares mean and placebo scores were obtained in the same manner.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale- Behavior 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS is used to represent a caregiver's assessment of given behaviors, which were chosen by the parents. Caregivers marked a 10 cm horizontal line representing a visual continuum of each behavior from &quot;worst behavior&quot; to &quot;behavior not a problem.&quot; Greater values indicate greater improvement. This measure represents the first behavior that the caregivers noted, out of three.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale- Behaviors 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS is used to represent a caregiver's assessment of given behaviors, which were chosen by the parents. Caregivers marked a 10 cm horizontal line representing a visual continuum of each behavior from &quot;worst behavior&quot; to &quot;behavior not a problem.&quot; Greater values indicate greater improvement. This measure represents the second behavior that the caregivers noted, out of three.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expressive Vocabulary Test-2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EVT-2 standard score assesses language development through a participant's one word synonym response to visual stimuli. Standard scores range from 20-160. A standard score of 100 is average, with a 15 point standard deviation. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II (VABS-II)Adaptive Behavior Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VABS-II Adaptive Behavior Composite Score was used to assess adaptive skills. An Adaptive Behavior Composite Score may range from 20-160 with an average of 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores show improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C)Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC-C composite scores were used to quantify the severity of a patient's behaviors. A composite score consists of subscale scores including Irritability and Agitation, Lethargy and Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity and Noncompliance, and Inappropriate Speech. The composite score may range from 0-174. Lower scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS is used to represent a caregiver's assessment of given behaviors, which were chosen by the parents. Caregivers marked a 10 cm horizontal line representing a visual continuum of each behavior from &quot;worst behavior&quot; to &quot;behavior not a problem.&quot; Greater values indicate greater improvement. This measure represents the third behavior that caregivers noted, out of three.</description>

    <measure>VAS Categorized by Behavior: Aggression/ ADHD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS is used to represent a caregiver's assessment of given behaviors, which were chosen by the parents. Caregivers marked a 10 cm horizontal line representing a visual continuum of each behavior from &quot;worst behavior&quot; to &quot;behavior not a problem.&quot; Greater values indicate greater improvement. This measure represents the least squares mean of all behaviors having to do with aggression or ADHD behaviors.</description>

        <description>A VAS is used to represent a caregiver’s assessment of given behaviors, which were chosen by the parents. Caregivers marked a 10 cm horizontal line representing a visual continuum of each behavior from “worst behavior” to “behavior not a problem.” Greater values indicate greater improvement. This measure represents the third behavior that caregivers noted, out of three.</description>
