      This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of palonesetron in preventing CINV
      (Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting) when administered to patients who have experienced
      either vomiting and or at least moderate nausea during their last cycle of low emetogenic
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palonosetron is currently approved for prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting
      associated with initial and repeat chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) caused by
      moderate and highly emetogenic chemotherapy. This study is designed to assess the safety and
      efficacy of palonesetron in preventing CINV (Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting) when
      administered to patients who have experienced either vomiting and or at least moderate nausea
      during their last cycle of low emetogenic chemotherapy.

      Palonosetron will be given intravenously approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of the
      chemotherapy regimen. Efficacy and safety including episodes of nausea, retching and or
      vomiting will be assessed over five 24 hour periods starting on Day 1 and ending on Day 6 in
      patient diaries. On Day 2 and Day 6 a FLIE (Functional Living Index- Emesis) assessment will
      also be completed in order to help evaluate the patient's quality of life from the start of
      the chemotherapy cycle through Day 6.

        Inclusion Criteria

        In order to be eligible for enrollment, subjects must meet the following inclusion
        criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent

          2. Male or female â‰¥18 years of age

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant disease

          4. Karnofsky Index of 50%

          5. Experienced either vomiting and/or at least moderate nausea during their last cycle of
             LEC

          6. Scheduled to receive, on Study Day 1, a single dose of one of the qualifying LEC
             agents listed in the protocol.

          7. Known mild to moderate hepatic, renal or cardiovascular impairment may be enrolled at
             the discretion of the Investigator Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          1. Inability or unwillingness to understand or cooperate with the study procedures as
             determined by the Investigator

          2. Women who are pregnant, nursing or planning to become pregnant, women of childbearing
             potential who are not using an effective method of pregnancy prevention (including
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices,
             vasectomized partner or sexual abstinence), or women who have had a positive serum
             pregnancy test at screening or within 7 days prior to receiving chemo on Day 1.
             Non-childbearing potential includes women who are post-menopausal (12 months of
             amenorrhea with no other demonstrable cause, in the appropriate age group) or
             documented surgical sterilization, or hysterectomy at least 3 months before study
             start.

          3. Previous use of palonosetron in association with a LEC regimen

          4. Received more than one antiemetic agent for prevention of CINV (Chemotherapy-Induced
             Nausea and Vomiting) during their last cycle of LEC (other than dexamethasone or
             prednisone as outlined in number 7 below). The use of an antiemetic in addition to a
             corticosteroid during the last cycle of LEC is allowed if the corticosteroid is
             intended for the prophylactic treatment of taxane-related hypersensitivity or
             pemetrexed-related skin reactions as long as the corticosteroid regimen remains
             unchanged during the trial

          5. Suspected or confirmed ongoing vomiting for any organic etiology (e.g., food
             poisoning, gastroenteritis, etc)

          6. Received any drug with potential anti-emetic effect within 24 hours prior to the start
             of qualifying LEC agent

               -  NK1 receptor antagonists

               -  Dopamine receptor antagonists (metoclopramide)

               -  Phenothiazine anti-emetics (prochlorperazine, promethazine, thiethylperazine and

                  hypersensitivity reactions associated with the administration of taxanes (e.g.,
                  paclitaxel, docetaxel) and ixabepilone

               -  All benzodiazepines except Triazolam or Zolpidem used once at night time due to
                  sleep disturbances

                  associated with the administration of taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel) or
                  prevention of rash associated with pemetrexed. Prednisone will be allowed if
                  given for as part of standard regimen with mitoxantrone or docetaxel for prostate
                  cancer.

               -  Any non-prescription medication, nutritional supplements, vitamins or herbal-type
