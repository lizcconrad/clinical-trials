  <brief_title>Gadobutrol Magnevist-controlled Body Study</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Multi-center/Multi-national, Randomized, Controlled, Single-blind, Group Comparison Phase 3 Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of Gadobutrol 1.0 Molar in Comparison to Magnevist Following Single Injection in Patients Referred for Contrast-enhanced MRI of the Body/Extremities Regions (Breast, Heart, Abdomen, Kidney, Pelvis, or Extremities)</official_title>

      The purpose of the study is to look at the safety (what are the side effects) and efficacy
      (how well does it work) of gadobutrol when used for taking MR images of the body/extremities
      regions. The results of the MRI with gadobutrol injection will be compared to the results of
      MR images taken without contrast and with the results of the MR images taken with Magnevist.
