    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation, if any, between the nutritional
      content of breast milk pumped by the mothers of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in the
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the nutritional value they are actually receiving in
      a 24 hour period, since as a practical matter, these may not be the same.
