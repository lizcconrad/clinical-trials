      Primary Objective is to assess the safety of extended treatment with Daclizumab High Yield
      Process (DAC HYP, BIIB019) monotherapy in participants with relapsing remitting multiple
      sclerosis (RRMS). Secondary Objective is to assess the long-term immunogenicity of DAC HYP
      and to assess the durability of response to DAC HYP in preventing multiple sclerosis (MS)
      relapse, slowing disability progression, and reducing new MS lesion formation in this study
      population.

      This study will provide participants who complete Study 205MS202 (NCT00870740) with the
      option to receive continued open-label Daclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP) monotherapy
      and to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of DAC HYP monotherapy in
      participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Approximately 60 to 100
      participants will be enrolled into an optional open-label, 16-week autoinjector substudy at a
      selected subset of sites which will run concurrently during the main study, and will evaluate
      the systemic exposure and local tolerability of subcutaneous administration of DAC HYP by
      autoinjector. The 2013-2014 trivalent influenza vaccine will be offered to all eligible
      participants as an optional substudy to assess the effect of DAC-HYP treatment on the immune
      response to vaccination,

    <description>Relapses are defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the Examining Neurologist. The ARR will be calculated by tabulating the total number of relapses experienced in the group divided by the number of days up to the end of study, and the ratio then multiplied by 365.</description>

The EDSS measures the disability status of people with multiple sclerosis on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability.</description>

          -  Subjects who have completed 52 weeks in Study 205MS202 (NCT00870740) and were
             compliant with the 205MS202 protocol in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception during the study
             and be willing and able to continue contraception for 4 months after their last dose
             of study treatment.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any significant change in their medical status from the previous study
             that would prelude administration of Daclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP) as
             determined by the Investigator including laboratory tests or a current clinically
             significant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have excluded
             the subject's participation in the 205MS201 (NCT00390221) or 205MS202 (NCT00870740)
             studies. The Investigator must re-review the subject's medical fitness for
             participation and must consider any diseases that would preclude treatment.

          -  Any subject who has permanently discontinued study treatment in Study 205MS202
             (NCT00870740) due to an adverse event.

          -  Current enrollment in any investigational drug study other than Study 205MS202
             (NCT00870740).

          -  Ongoing treatment with any approved or experimental disease-modifying treatment for
             multiple sclerosis.

               -  Subjects treated with any of these agents for fewer than 6 months prior to study
                  entry are excluded from study participation unless they discontinue the agent(s)
                  prior to study entry.

               -  Subjects treated with 2 or more of these agents for more than 6 months prior to
                  study entry are excluded from study participation unless they reduce to ≤1 agent
                  prior to study entry.

               -  Subjects who have had dose escalations of one of these agents within the 6 months
                  prior to study entry are excluded from study participation unless they revert to
                  a previous dose that had been used for at least 6 months prior to study entry or
                  unless they discontinue the agent prior to study entry

          -  Subjects who are currently receiving treatment with isoniazid, propylthiouracil, or
             nimesulide at the time of study entry and are not able to discontinue the agent or
             change to an alternative medication allowed by the protocol.
