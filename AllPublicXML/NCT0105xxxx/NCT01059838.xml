      The purpose of this study is to determine whether speech recognition in noise can be improved
      by the addition of a special listening program to the sound processor. Thus we propose to
      assess speech perception in noise for pediatric cochlear implant patients using both their
      everyday listening program as well an ASC program.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether speech recognition in noise can be improved
      by the addition of a special listening program to the sound processor. Thus we propose to
      assess speech perception in noise for pediatric cochlear implant patients using both their
      everyday listening program as well an ASC program.

      You will be asked to listen to sentences in quiet and in noise and repeat the sentences. You
      will be seated in a comfortable chair inside the sound booth with 8 loudspeakers placed in a
      circular pattern around your head. We will test your sentence recognition abilities in your
      listening program as well as in the new listening program. The sentences and noise will be
      presented through loudspeakers at levels typically encountered in everyday communication
      environments. Your participation would involve approximately 20 minutes of testing plus 10
      minutes to add the new listening program to their processor.
