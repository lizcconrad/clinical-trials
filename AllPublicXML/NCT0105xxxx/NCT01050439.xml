      Unrelated matched donor (cord blood, bone marrow or peripheral blood) allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation (UDAlloSCT) with either myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning will
      be well tolerated and result in a high degree of engraftment in patients with selected
      malignant and non malignant disorders.

      This is a non-randomized study to determine the tolerability and degree of engraftment of
      unrelated matched donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation with either myeloablative or
      reduced intensity conditioning in patients with selected malignant and non malignant
      disorders. Patients will receive one of either full intensity or reduced intensity regimen
      based on the patient's disease status, organ function and performance and determined by the
      PI.

    <description>This is a non-randomized study to test the safety and response of unrelated matched donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation (UDAlloSCT) with either myleoablative (full intensity) or reduced intensity conditioning therapy in patients with selected malignant and non-malignant disorders. UDAlloSCT has been performed in both adults and children as an alternative transplant for patients who lack and HLA-matched family donor in both malignant and non-malignant disease with varying degrees of response.</description>
