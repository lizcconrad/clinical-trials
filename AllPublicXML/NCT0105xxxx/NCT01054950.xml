    <textblock>
      Food allergies are becoming more prevalent with more children being diagnosed with food
      allergies each year. Food allergies place a tremendous burden not just on the patient but on
      his/her family as well. In an attempt to provide better care to the investigators patients,
      the investigators would like to determine if regular contact with our food allergy nurse has
      a positive effect on a family's perceived quality of life.

      We intend to show a difference between the intervention group, who will receive a food
      allergy packet, along with three follow up phone calls from our trained allergy nurse, and
      the control group, will be given the food allergy packet only. We expect the intervention
      group to score higher on the quality of life survey, showing that the support and education
      of our allergy nurse has a positive effect on quality of life of our patients and their
      families.
