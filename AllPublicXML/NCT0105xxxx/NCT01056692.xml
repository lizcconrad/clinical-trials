      OC0000459 reduces inflammation in the tissues in response to allergic stimuli in patients
      with asthma. This clinical trial, in mildly asthmatic patients, studies the effects of
      OC000459 and placebo on the asthmatic response to two known stimulants of the asthmatic
      response in the lungs, namely cat hair, pollen or house dust mite and methacholine.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is the diminution in the late asthmatic response to bronchial allergen challenge as measured by the AUC and the maximum of percentage reductions in FEV1 between 3 and 10 hours after allergen challenge.</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary outcome is measured after 15 days of treatment with active or placebo</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary biological activity endpoints include the diminution of the early asthmatic response to bronchial allergen challenge sputum eosinophilia, the methacholine PC20 after allergen challenge and exhaled NO pre- and post-allergen.</measure>
    <time_frame>These measures are examined after 15 days of treatment with either active or placebo</time_frame>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Known history of asthma (intermittent wheezing, cough, dyspnoea responsive to inhaled
             short acting beta agonists).

          -  FEV1 &gt;65% of predicted on at least two occasions at screening.

          -  At the screening allergen challenge, a decrease in FEV1 of ≥20% in the early asthmatic
             reaction and of ≥15% in the LAR to allergen on 3 separate occasions between 3-10hrs
             post allergen, 2 of which must be consecutive.

          -  No steroid usage in the past 12 weeks.

          -  Testing positive to skin prick challenge with at least one of the following allergens:
             house dust mite, pollen or cat hair within the previous 12 months.

          -  Non smokers for a minimum of 6 months; less than 10 pack year history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Respiratory tract pathology other than allergic asthma.

          -  Lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to an allergen challenge.

          -  Receipt of prescribed or OTC medication other than paracetamol or short acting inhaled
             beta agonists within 14 days of screening or of the first day of each dosing period.
