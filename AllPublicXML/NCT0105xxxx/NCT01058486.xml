  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' proposed study is a randomized controlled trial that will prospectively
      examine the effect of a multicomponent intervention on the rate of hospitalizations, daily
      physical activity, self efficacy and health status in patients who have COPD and have been
      hospitalized because of a COPD exacerbation.

      In the study, a convenience sample of patients recently hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation,
      who meet the selection criteria and agree to participate will be randomized to receive one of
      the following at the time of hospital discharge: (1) the current standard of care plus a
      multicomponent intervention (counselor + pulmonary rehabilitation) or (2) the current
      standard of care without the intervention.

      This study plans to test the following hypotheses: (1) The primary outcome of the study to be
      the composite endpoint of death or COPD hospitalization (2) Time to first rehospitalization
      will be shorter in the intervention group than the control group (3) At follow-up, the
      physical activity level measured in terms of the average number of steps and active energy
      expenditure will be higher in the intervention group than in the control group.

    <description>Post hospital discharge, patients will be referred (&lt;2 weeks) to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) (1-2 sessions per week for 6-8 weeks). PR visits (approximately 1 hour) will include education, strengthening and endurance exercise as the patient tolerates.
A counselor (RN or RRT) and patient will meet once weekly after PR session. The counselor will assess the patient's self efficacy and knowledge of self-management principles of COPD. Based on the assessment and greatest needs identified by patient, the counselor will work with the participant to collaboratively develop a specific SM plan.Motivational interviewing techniques will be used.
Following completion of PR, the counselor will contact the patient monthly to provide clinical support on SM of COPD. To ensure consistency of intervention, we will use standardized treatment procedures and phone scripts.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be â‰¥40 years old

          -  Clinical diagnosis of COPD or pulmonary function testing reflecting an FEV1/FVC ratio
             of &lt;0.70

          -  Current or previous smoker with at least 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking

          -  Recently hospitalized for an exacerbation of COPD

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a high likelihood of being lost to follow-up or contact (patients with
             active chemical dependency, are planning to move out of the state, are not living in
             the healthcare area, or have no telephone at home).

          -  Patents with characteristics that can confound the analysis of the primary outcome
             (patients who are living in a nursing home, have unresectable lung cancer, or have
             another advanced neoplasm).

          -  Patients with an inability to provide good data or follow commands (patients who are
             disoriented, have a severe neurologic or psychiatric condition).

          -  Patients with an inability to do mild exercise, such as cycling or walking, when their
             COPD is stable (patients who have orthopedic-neurologic problems; patients who have
             severe heart failure, characterized by an ejection fraction of &lt;20% or by New York
             Heart Association Class IV disease; patients who should be at complete rest, confined
             to a bed or chair; or patients in whom any physical activity brings on discomfort and
             in whom symptoms occur at rest).
