  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single arm phase II trial of the combination of
      bevacizumab and ixabepilone in patients with advanced- or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC
      progressive after first or second-line therapy. The main objective is to evaluate the
      progression-free survival in patients with advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC being
      treated with ixabepilone and bevacizumab.

      The first six patients will be enrolled in a lead-in phase of the study utilizing a reduced
      dose of ixabepilone. Patients will be monitored for safety and toxicity. If the combination
      is found to be tolerable and feasible, accrual will continue with the full-dose regimen.
      Toxicity will be monitored in real-time by the study investigators. Should unexpected or
      increased toxicity be detected, trial accrual will be halted for full analysis.

      Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously, 10 mg/kg, every two weeks. Ixabepilone will
      be administered intravenously, 16 mg/m2, once weekly for 3 of 4 weeks on a 28-day schedule,
      to the first six patients enrolled. Ixabepilone will be administered intravenously, 20mg/m2,
      once weekly for 3 of 4 weeks on a 28-day schedule, to the remaining 40 patients enrolled.

          -  Proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by either:

               -  Urine protein: creatinine (UPC) ratio ≥ 1.0 at screening OR

                  on dipstick urinalysis at screening should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and
                  must demonstrate ≤ 500 mg of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).
