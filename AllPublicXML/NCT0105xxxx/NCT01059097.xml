    <textblock>
      The independent impact of surgeon volume on outcome of patients undergoing
      pancreaticoduodenectomy in a high-volume Institution was assessed. A significant reduction of
      pancreatic fistula rate was found in the high-volume surgeon group in comparison with
      low-volume surgeon group. However, no difference between groups was found in mortality, major
      complications, and hospital stay.

      Objectives: To define the independent impact of surgeon volume on outcome after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in a single high-volume institution.

      Summary Background Data: The impact of surgeon volume on PD outcome is still controversial.
      So far, data available are from retrospective multi-institutional reviews, considering
      in-hospital mortality as the only outcome variable.

      Methods: Prospectively collected data on 610 patients who underwent PD from August 2001 to
      August 2009 were analyzed. Cut-off value to categorize high and low-volume surgeons (HVS and
      LVS, respectively) was 18 PD/year. Primary endpoint was operative mortality (death within
      30-day post-discharge). Secondary endpoints were morbidity, pancreatic fistula (PF) and
      length of stay. Demographic, clinical, and surgical variables were recorded.
