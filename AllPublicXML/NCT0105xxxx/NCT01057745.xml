      Women of reproductive age who will undergo cancer treatment may participate in a study to
      surgically remove ovarian tissue and store it, frozen, for their potential use in the future.
      20% of collected tissue will be used for research.

      Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer can compromise the ability to become pregnant.
      Experiments in animals and humans have tried to collect, freeze and store eggs to see if they
      can be saved for possible later use. While studies are promising, it is still uncertain
      whether such approaches will ultimately prove to be useful in practice for achieving
      pregnancy in humans. The main purpose of this study is to see whether it is possible to
      remove and store ovarian tissues by freezing. It is hoped that, in the future, frozen, stored
      ovarian tissue can be used to achieve pregnancy. Before receiving chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy, subjects will have a piece of the ovaries, or one of two ovaries, removed by
      surgery. The tissues will be frozen by a special method in an effort to prevent the eggs from
      being damaged. The majority (80%) of the tissue will be stored for potential use in case the
      patient is unable to achieve pregnancy in the future, and part of the tissue (20%) will be
      used for studying how the eggs can be grown in the laboratory.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patient between the ages of 18 and 42 years.

          -  In need of imminent cancer treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy or radiation
             therapy, which is viewed as likely to result in a permanent and complete loss of
             subsequent ovarian function or have a health condition that will result in premature
             ovarian failure. These include, but are not limited to: abdominopelvic irradiation,
             total body irradiation, alkylating-intensive chemotherapy, and removal of ovaries as
             part of their cancer treatment.

          -  Reasonably good health.

          -  Two ovaries.

          -  Able to defer definitive cancer therapy for approximately 3 days until the patient
             recovers from laparoscopic oophorectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients considered as high risk for surgical complications will be excluded from the
             research protocol.
