  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to elucidate how environmental, healthcare, and
      patient-level factors and patients' level of perceived control impact sleep duration and
      quality in hospitalized older patients and to assess whether better in-hospital sleep is
      associated with improved physical activity and health outcomes.

      We hypothesize that environment, healthcare disruptions and patient symptoms will be
      significantly associated with objective and subjective sleep duration and sleep quality in
      hospitalized older patients.

      We also hypothesize that a high level of perceived control will be associated with improved
      sleep duration and quality in hospitalized older patients.

      We further hypothesize that shorter sleep duration and quality in hospitalized older adults
      will be associated with adverse health outcomes, namely higher blood pressure and blood
      sugar.

      This research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of inpatient sleep on health
      outcomes for hospitalized older patients and can help inform the design and evaluation of
      interventions designed to improve sleep in hospitalized older patients. This work can also
      form the foundation for understanding the longer term health effects of inpatient sleep loss
      for older patients that are potentially modifiable.
