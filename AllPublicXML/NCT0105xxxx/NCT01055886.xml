  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the relationship between PTSD, mood, craving and
      withdrawal symptoms and factors associated with relapse in the context of a randomized
      clinical smoking cessation trial. The use of supplemental nicotine administration (SNA)
      during a &quot;pre-treatment&quot; phase before a targeted quit date is an innovative development in
      smoking cessation, and may be helpful in treating smokers with PTSD. The use of SNA during ad
      lib smoking for smokers with PTSD is predicted to reduce both the physiological and emotional
      dependence on inhaled nicotine, thereby increasing the odds of successful smoking cessation.

      Smokers with PTSD will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 pre-cessation patch therapy conditions
      (active patch versus placebo patch) for 2 weeks before a target quit-smoking date. All
      participants will receive brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and will begin standard
      nicotine replacement therapy on their quit day. PTSD symptoms, mood, smoking craving and
      withdrawal symptoms will be evaluated using electronic diary assessment for one week prior to
      the pre-cessation period, during the 2-week pre-cessation period, and 6 weeks post quit date.
      The study is designed to address the following aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To examine the effects of SNA on PTSD symptoms, mood, craving and withdrawal
      through electronic diary assessment.

      Hypothesis 1.1. SNA will decrease craving for cigarettes during the 2 week pretreatment
      period as compared to the placebo patch condition.

      Hypothesis 1.2. SNA will decrease the perceived improvement in mood and PTSD symptoms
      associated with smoking behavior.

      Hypothesis 1.3. SNA during the pre-cessation period will result in a reduction of withdrawal
      symptoms following the quit-date.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of SNA on quit rates among smokers with PTSD.

      Hypothesis 2. SNA during the pre-cessation period will result in improved quit rates Specific
      Aim 3: To investigate potential predictors of relapse including PTSD symptom severity, mood,
      anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, and self-efficacy.

      Hypothesis 3.1 - 3.5 Increased PTSD symptom severity, increased baseline negative affect,
      increased anxiety sensitivity, decreased distress tolerance, and lower self-efficacy each
      will independently be associated with shorter abstinence from smoking.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants Self-reporting Abstinence During 6 Weeks Post Quit</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-quit (from quit date to Session 12); evaluated weekly from Session 7 to Session 12</time_frame>
    <description>In the 6 week post-quit period, participants completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA), or diary, ratings of their smoking behavior. This outcome reflects the number of participants who reported not relapsing (i.e., smoking 7 days in a row) during the 6 weeks post-quit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abstinence as Measured by Exhaled Carbon Monoxide (CO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 12, 6 weeks post-quit</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome reflects the number of participants whose exhaled carbon monoxide (CO; a measure of smoking) indicated abstinence (i.e., 6 parts per million or less) at Session 12, which occurred six weeks post-quit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Diary Ratings of Cravings</measure>
    <time_frame>During pre-quit period; two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants provided (through ecological momentary assessment) ratings of their smoking craving. This outcome reflects differences between ad lib (or typical) smoking craving compared to smoking craving reported during the pre-quit period. Craving was reported from a single item &quot;Please indicate your desire/craving to smoke,&quot; and answers were provided in a 5-point Likert scale where 1=no craving and 5=severe craving. Higher scores are presumed to be &quot;worse&quot; because they indicate increased craving, which is likely to lead to non-abstinence.</description>

        <title>Diary Ratings of Cravings</title>
        <description>Participants provided (through ecological momentary assessment) ratings of their smoking craving. This outcome reflects differences between ad lib (or typical) smoking craving compared to smoking craving reported during the pre-quit period. Craving was reported from a single item &quot;Please indicate your desire/craving to smoke,&quot; and answers were provided in a 5-point Likert scale where 1=no craving and 5=severe craving. Higher scores are presumed to be &quot;worse&quot; because they indicate increased craving, which is likely to lead to non-abstinence.</description>
