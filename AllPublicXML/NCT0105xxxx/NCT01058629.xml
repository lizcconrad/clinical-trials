      This is a multicenter study to evaluate the clinical performance of the SynergEyes A2 lens in
      patients with refractive errors with or without astigmatism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hybrid contact lenses have been previously shown to be a safe and effective method to correct
      refractive errors with and without astigmatism. The hybrid contact lens design may provide
      greater visual acuity and comfort than other soft or rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses
      currently available. The purpose of this study is to confirm the design of the SynergEyes A2
      lens by evaluating clinical performance and, if necessary, modify certain lens parameters in
      order to optimize lens performance. Objective and subjective parameters will be used to
      evaluate the lens.
