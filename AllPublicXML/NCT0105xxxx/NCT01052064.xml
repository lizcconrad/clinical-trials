  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation(rTMS) is a safe and tolerable
      procedure in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD); it also could be a
      complement to the treatment of patients with poor symptomatic control to conventional
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a common disorder in the infancy; the majority of
      ADHD have good clinical response to amphetamines alone or in association with antiepileptic
      drugs. It is described that some patients(10-30%) with ADHD do not respond to conventional
      pharmacological and psycho- pedagogical treatment; in those patients non invasive brain
      stimulation methods could be a supplementary option for symptomatic control. There are not
      many published papers describing the effects of rTMS in persons younger than 18 years; so the
      first step to extent its use in pediatric population should be to obtain evidences about its
      tolerance and safety.

    <description>There are evidences that rTMS has a modulating effect in cortical and subcortical neural networks, reinforcing or depressing synaptic activity by mean of long term potentiation or depression like mechanism. Depression is the most study neuropsychiatric condition in which rTMS is useful as a therapeutic option; but in other diseases such as ADHD there are many pathophysiological elements that make it very likely that rTMS could be useful for symptomatic treatment modulating activity in prefrontal and basal ganglia neuronal networks.</description>

    <description>rTMS will be administered in one daily session during 5 consecutive days of 1 Hz, 90% of motor threshold for a total of 1500 stimuli. The stimulation will be focal over left dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex(F3, from the international 10-20 system)</description>
