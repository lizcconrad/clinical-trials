  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been reports that stimulants may be effective for bipolar depression without
      triggering mania. This study will examine whether lisdexamfetamine can improve depressive
      symptoms over the course of eight weeks. Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug stimulant that is
      currently approved for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants take the
      study drug or placebo in addition to a mood stabilizer. The study includes functional
      magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine whether the
      medication alters the response to affective stimuli or glutamate, glutamine, or gamma
      aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. Neuropsychological testing is also included to determine
      whether the study drug improves memory and attention in this population. The primary
      hypothesis is that lisdexamfetamine is clinically effective in this population. The secondary
      hypothesis is that it will result in an increased response to affective stimuli and altered
      neurotransmitter levels in the anterior cingulate cortex.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score Over Time.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in MADRS score from the baseline visit to the week 8 visit is reported. The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale that consists of 10 items rated on a from 0 to 6 (maximum score of 60), with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. An increase in score indicates a worsening of symptoms whereas a decrease indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impressions Severity (CGI-S) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S score reflects the clinician's overall impression of the patient's functional status. The scoring for the single item ranges from 1 with an anchor of &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; to 7 with an anchor of &quot;among the most extremely ill patients&quot;. Thus, higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1 and week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I score indicates the clinician's overall assessment of improvement in function from one visit to the next. The single item is scored from 1 to 7 with anchor points ranging from very much improved (1) to very much worse (7). A decrease in score reflects an improvement in functional status.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The recruitment period began in June 2010 and concluded in early 2012. Recruitment was through media advertisements and patients in the hospital outpatient clinic. Out of hundreds of individuals who were pre-screened by telephone, 31 were invited to the clinic for screening visits.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants who were not on an approved mood stabilizer (lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine) at the time of enrollment were eligible for a one-month lead in to start a mood stabilizer prior to randomization. Several participants were excluded due to psychiatric co-morbidity, unclear diagnosis, history of stimulant use, or medical concerns.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score Over Time.</title>
        <description>The change in MADRS score from the baseline visit to the week 8 visit is reported. The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale that consists of 10 items rated on a from 0 to 6 (maximum score of 60), with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. An increase in score indicates a worsening of symptoms whereas a decrease indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S score reflects the clinician's overall impression of the patient's functional status. The scoring for the single item ranges from 1 with an anchor of &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; to 7 with an anchor of &quot;among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.
