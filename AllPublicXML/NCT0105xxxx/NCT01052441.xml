  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate diagnostic performance of high iodine (iopamidol 370
      mg/dl) content versus low iodine (iodixanol 300 mg/dl) content for diagnostic accuracy by
      contrast-enhanced Coronary Cardiac Computed Tomography (CCTA) using a 64-detector-row CT
      scanner for detection of presence or absence of coronary artery obstruction when compared
      against invasive coronary angiography, the standard of truth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Cardiac CT (CCTA) is a widely accepted modality for non-invasive evaluation of
      coronary atherosclerosis. The diagnostic performance of CCTA for detecting coronary artery
      plaque burden has been validated in numerous studies, reaching a negative predictive value of
      99%.

      The current gold standard for anatomic coronary imaging is Invasive Coronary Angiography
      (ICA) which portends a small but significant procedural-related complication of 1.7%.
      Non-invasive coronary imaging has the potential to replace ICA but the variability in
      diagnostic performance of CCTA remains under study. Among the potential variables causing
      differences in diagnostic performance is perhaps the degree of opacification of coronary
      artery by iodinated contrast. While numerous contrast agents exist, those that provide
      improved low and high contrast resolution (for delineating plaque from arterial wall and
      lumen from plaque, respectively) are hypothetically, the most optimal agents. To date,
      however, this has not been well evaluated. Further, use of a contrast agent which maximizes
      patient comfort is desired, as this may reduce heart rate increases and heart rate
      variability, which may in turn improve diagnostic image quality of CCTA.

      We hypothesize that the use of lower iodine content iso-osmolar agent - iodixanol - will
      improve diagnostic performance and patient comfort, as compared to higher iodine content low
      osmolar iodinated contrast - iopamidol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is ≥18 years old.

          -  The subject has typical or atypical chest pain suspected of Coronary Artery Disease
             (CAD) and is referred for an elective coronary angiography.

          -  The subject must be scheduled to undergo a CATH procedure between 72 hours and 3 weeks
             of the CCTA procedure.

          -  The subject must not undergo any cardiac interventional treatment between the 2
             procedures.

          -  The subject must have a sinus rhythm with stable heart rate of ≤75 beats per minute
             (bpm) and if heart rate is &gt;65 bpm, the subject must agree to the use of
             beta-blocker(s) prior to the CT scan procedure to achieve stable heart rate of ≤65
             bpm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has an established diagnosis of CAD by a) previous ICA, b) prior
             myocardial infarction confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG), or c) prior
             revascularization (balloon angioplasty, stent placement, or coronary artery bypass
             grafting (CABG).

          -  The subject has a known allergy to iodinated contrast agent, including but not limited
             to hives, anaphylactoid or cardiovascular reactions, laryngeal edema and bronchospasm.

          -  The subject has impaired renal function with a serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL
             (150 μmol/L) or above.

          -  The subject has atrial fibrillation/flutter or any irregular heart rhythm considered
             by the investigator to interfere with temporal acquisition of cardiac CT images.

          -  The subject has a resting heart rate of &gt;100 bpm and/or a resting systolic blood
             pressure of &lt;100 mm Hg.

          -  The subject has an artificial heart valve(s).

          -  The subject has had prior pacemaker or internal defibrillator lead implantation.

          -  The subject's resting heart rate is &gt;65 bpm and beta-blocker therapy is
             contraindicated.

          -  The subject has a contraindication to Verapamil when beta-blocker therapy cannot be
             administered.

          -  The subject has a contraindication to nitroglycerin.

          -  The subject has evidence of ongoing or active clinical instability.
