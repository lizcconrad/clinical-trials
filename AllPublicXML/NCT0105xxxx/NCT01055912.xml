      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of oral lixivaptan capsules in patients
      with congestive heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diuretics are used extensively in the treatment of patients with CHF, and their efficacy is
      well established. However, there is a tendency for currently used diuretics to increase
      afterload and deplete electrolytes, and in many patients ventricular function continues to
      deteriorate over time.

      Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, also have known negative effects on renal function
      reducing the glomerular filtration rate, and have been shown to activate the RAA system.

      Lixivaptan is a potent, non-peptide selective antagonist of the vasopressin V2 receptor.

      Lixivaptan treatment results in increased free water excretion, thus decreasing urine
      osmolality, increasing urine flow, and increasing serum osmolality. Short-term treatment with
      lixivaptan has demonstrated improved fluid management and electrolyte balance in HF patients.

      This study was designed to assess the effects of vasopressin blockade with lixivaptan in
      patients with CHF with volume overload. A placebo-control arm will allow for assessment of
      the effect of lixivaptan in addition to standard diuretic therapy as compared with standard
      diuretic therapy alone.
