  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis in managing chronic low
           back and/or lower extremity pain in patients without post lumbar surgery syndrome or
           spinal stenosis and compare with fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural steroid
           injections.

        -  evaluate and compare the adverse event profile in all groups.

      Recruitment is indicated in patients with chronic low back pain and/or lower extremity pain
      without post lumbar laminectomy syndrome or spinal stenosis, non-responsive to conservative
      therapy with physical therapy, chiropractic, medical therapy, and fluoroscopically directed
      epidural injections.

      This is a single-center study performed in an interventional pain management referral center
      in the United States.

      The study involves 120 patients assigned to one of 2 groups with 60 patients in each group.

      Data management analysis includes sample size justification of 40 patients in each group with
      a power of 80% and a 0.05% 2-sided significance level. Statistical methodology includes
      chi-squared statistics, Fisher's exact test, t-test, and paired t-test with significance
      evaluated at P value &lt; 0.05.
