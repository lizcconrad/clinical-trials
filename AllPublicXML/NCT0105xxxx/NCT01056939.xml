  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if NAVA-technology is better in detecting patients
      own inspiratory efforts during mechanical ventilation than currently used flow-triggering in
      PRVC (pressure regulated volume controlled) ventilation, and if NAVA gives real benefits for
      patients or not.

      The investigators study hypothesis is that NAVA-technology can detect spontaneous inspiration
      more accurately than currently used methods, and thus will lead to more smooth adaptation to
      mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients. The investigators expect this to decrease the
      time of ventilatory support needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asynchrony means that the timing of support given by ventilator is different from patients
      own breathing pattern. Asynchrony during ventilatory care may increase the risk for
      complications, make the weaning more difficult and may affect the survival rates.

      In our study we randomly treat pediatric patients needing ventilatory support with neurally
      adjusted ventilatory assist and pressure controlled or PRVC-ventilation. We are willing to
      find out if there are any special benefits for patients with each treatment mode.
