      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the drug
      Cloratadd D ® (loratadine + pseudoephedrine sulfate - EMS S/A) compared to the drug Claritin
      D ® (loratadine + pseudoephedrine sulfate - Schering Plough) in patients with allergic
      rhinitis by quantification of the scores of clinical parameters (signs and symptoms) and
      laboratory (nasal flow) down through time.

      Secondly, it will be observed safety (tolerability) clinic after the administration of the
      drug in patients by comparing the clinical parameters and the incidence of adverse events.
