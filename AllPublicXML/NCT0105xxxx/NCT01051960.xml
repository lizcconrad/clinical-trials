  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical characteristics and hemodynamic
      profiles that predict exercise induced pulmonary hypertension in 15 patients with systemic
      sclerosis. The study also aims to determine the effectiveness of Ambrisentan for subjects
      with exercise induced Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) with scleroderma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current literature addresses therapies for patients with resting PAH only, diagnosed by
      right heart catheterization. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) also recognizes and
      defines exercise induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (ex-PAH), which may precede the
      development of resting PAH. The natural progression of PAH, especially during exercise, has
      not been well delineated. An exercise hemodynamic study previously showed that in normal
      healthy subjects the mean pulmonary pressure does not exceed 30mmHg even at maximal cardiac
      outputs. A prior study evaluated exercise Doppler echocardiography systemic sclerosis
      patients with normal resting echocardiograms, finding an abnormal response which was defined
      as an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure greater than 40 mmHg. In the same study,
      6.6% of the patients progressed to resting PAH over the followup period of 12 months. Limited
      data is available regarding the prevalence of ex-PAH in systemic sclerosis using right heart
      catheterization.
