      Introduction. Despite adequate steroid therapy, a subpopulation of approximately 10% of
      asthmatics develops severe persistent airflow obstruction. It is now widely agreed that the
      latter is the consequence of a remodeling process of the airways, characterized by an
      increase in airway smooth muscle mass, mucus gland hypertrophy, increased thickness of the
      subepithelial basement membrane, extracellular matrix protein deposition, angiogenesis,
      fibroblast and myofibroblast accumulation. These phenomena are responsible for airway wall
      thickening and for decreased airway caliber leading to persistent airflow obstruction.

      Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a small peptide, synthesized in the lung by airway epithelial and
      smooth muscle cells, as well as inflammatory cells. ET-1 induces bronchoconstriction,
      mediates eosinophils recruitment during allergic inflammation and contributes to airway
      remodeling by inducing fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells differentiation and proliferation.
      In a recent work from Inserm Unit 700, it has been shown that ET-1 was overexpressed in
      epithelial cells from severe asthmatic patients as compared to patients with less severe
      disease, and that ET-1 expression was strongly correlated with airway obstruction (measured
      by FEV1) and on bronchial biopsies with airway smooth muscle areas. In another study, we have
      shown that a polymorphism of the receptor for ET-1 was strongly associated with the degree of
      airway obstruction in a population of asthmatic patients. All these data suggest that
      inhibition of the ET-1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic option in patients with
      steroids refractory asthma and irreversible airway obstruction. Bosentan, a specific
      inhibitor of ET-1 receptors which is actually used in patients with pulmonary hypertension,
      improves survival and inhibits vascular remodeling.

      Aim and strategy. To study the impact on airway remodeling and clinical status of an
      antagonist of the endothelin receptors (Sitaxentan 100mg/day) over a 12-month period, in a
      prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial involving two parallel groups of 25 severe
      asthmatic patients with irreversible airflow obstruction (FEV1≤ 70% of predicted) . Various
      hallmarks of airway remodeling will be analyzed on bronchial biopsy specimens by
      immunohistochemistry and morphometry. These findings will be correlated with the results of
      pulmonary function tests. Twenty-five patients will be included in each group. Remodeling
      will be measured on bronchial biopsies performed during fiberoptic bronchoscopy at inclusion
      and after one year, by assessing smooth muscle area, submucosal fibroblasts count and
      basement membrane thickness. Every 3 months, bronchial obstruction (FEV1), clinical status,
      asthma exacerbations, steroids use, need for emergency care, asthma symptoms and quality of
      life will be assessed. Evaluation of airway inflammation will be assessed every 3 months by
      exhaled NO and induced sputum cytology.

      This proof of concept study will validate ET-1 as a new molecular target for treating airway
      remodeling in patients with severe asthma.
