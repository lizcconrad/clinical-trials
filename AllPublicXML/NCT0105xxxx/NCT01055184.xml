  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unlike most influenza viruses, the 2009 H1N1 virus has affected people between 5 and 40 years
      old more often than people 60 years old or older. It may be that older people have had
      greater exposure to previous strains of H1N1 influenza, and this previous exposure protects
      them from infection. This study will examine how older people respond to a version of the
      H1N1 virus vaccine that includes a live, noninfectious version of the virus.

    <textblock>
      Unlike most influenza viruses, the 2009 H1N1 virus affects many individuals between 5 and 40
      years old, but very few 60 years old or older. It is not completely understood why, but
      scientists believe it may be because older people may have been exposed to other H1N1 viruses
      in their lives. H1N1 viruses were common until 1957, when they were eclipsed by H2N2 viruses.

      In order to test susceptibility to the 2009 H1N1 virus, this study will examine how often
      people older than 60 get infected by the 2009 H1N1 live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).
      The LAIV is made from a live virus that has been weakened, so the ability of the immune
      system to combat this weakened form is likely to mimic its ability to combat the normal form.
      Additionally, this study will examine how LAIVs work in older people; inactivated virus
      vaccines are used more often than LAIVs in older people, so little is known of LAIV's effects
      on this population.

      Participation in this study will last 6 months. Participants will be people older than 60,
      divided into equal groups of people between the ages of 60 and 70 and people older than 70.
      Both groups will receive one dose of LAIV for 2009 H1N1 vaccine.

      There will be six study visits, occurring at baseline and 2, 5, 7, 28, and 180 days after
      vaccination. Nasal wicks and throat swabs will be taken on Days 2, 5, and 7; a nasal wick
      alone will be taken at baseline and on Day 28. Blood samples will be taken at baseline and on
      Days 7 and 28. Participants will undergo physical exams at each visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior history of infection with novel H1N1 virus or immunization with novel H1N1
             vaccine documented by a laboratory

          -  Female participants must not be capable of becoming pregnant or take steps to prevent
             pregnancy from 30 days before enrollment to 30 days after receiving the study vaccine

          -  In good health, as determined by medical history and targeted physical examination

          -  Able to understand and comply with the planned study procedures, including being
             available for all study visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Previous history of vaccination against novel H1N1 virus or a laboratory documented
             history of previous novel H1N1 infection

          -  Immunosuppressed as a result of an underlying illness or treatment with
             immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs or use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation
             therapy within the preceding 36 months

          -  Active neoplastic disease (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer or prostate cancer that
             is stable in the absence of therapy) or a history of any hematological malignancy. For
             this criterion, &quot;active&quot; is defined as having received treatment within the past 5
             years.

          -  Long-term (greater than 2 weeks) use of oral or parenteral steroids or high-dose
