    <textblock>
      The differential diagnosis of patients with polyuria/ polydipsia is often complex, but
      important for the therapeutic strategy.

      Challenging is in particular the clinical differentiation between patients with a partial
      Diabetes insipidus centralis and patients with primary polydipsia as underlying disease,
      because both groups are associated with similar urinary osmolalities.

      The determination of plasma arginine vasopressin is unusual in this context, since
      measurement of AVP is not reliably.

      C-terminal ProVasopressin (copeptin) is secreted stoichiometrically with AVP from the
      neurohypophysis, but has a longer half life in the circulation, and is thus easier to
      measure.

      Therefore, the investigators will analyze in that study the diagnostic utility of plasma
      copeptin in the differential diagnosis of polyuria and polydipsia.
