  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with colorectal cancer that cannot be cured by surgery are being asked to participate
      in this study.

      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of
      drugs, ABT-888 and temozolomide for patients with colorectal cancer. Temozolomide acts by
      damaging deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in rapidly dividing cells, in other words, cancer cells.
      ABT-888 inhibits an enzyme called &quot;PARP&quot; which helps to fix damaged DNA. By inhibiting this
      enzyme, ABT-888 prevents cancer cells from repairing the damage caused by the temozolomide,
      and will hopefully increase the killing of cancer cells, and decrease the tumors in the body.

      ABT-888 is an investigational or experimental anti-cancer agent that has not yet been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in colorectal cancer.

      This study will help find out what effects (good and bad) the combination of drugs,
      temozolomide and ABT-888 has on colorectal cancer.

      This research is being done because it is not known if ABT-888 will increase the
      effectiveness of temozolomide for colorectal cancer.

      We will initiate a single arm, open label Phase II study to test the clinical activity of
      ABT-888 and temozolomide in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Treatment will continue weekly with restaging scans to be performed every 8 weeks. The trial
      will follow a Simon's two-stage optimal design. For the first stage, 21 patients will be
      accrued. If two (9.5%) or fewer of the 21 patients exhibit a partial or complete response
      with ABT-888 plus temozolomide, the agent will be rejected and the trial stopped. However, if
      at least 3 patients of the 21 (14%) exhibit a response in the first stage, then an additional
      29 patients will be entered into the second stage, for a total of 50 patients in this phase
      II study. If 8 (16%) or more patients exhibit a response, then the treatment will be
      considered for further investigation. The sample sizes of 21 and 50 patients and the decision
      rules, in stages 1 and 2 respectively, are designed to differentiate a 25% overall response
      rate from a 10% overall response rate.
