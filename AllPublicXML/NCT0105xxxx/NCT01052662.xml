    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of memantine and buprenorphine on opioid
      abusing behavior, to determine the effect of memantine and buprenorphine on early relapse and
      to evaluate the tolerability of memantine co-administrated with buprenorphine. The study
      seeks to determine if combined treatment of memantine and buprenorphine may provide
      shorter-term treatment for opioid dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opiate dependence is an increasing problem among young adults (18-25 years old) whose rates
      of current use of illicit drugs are generally high (19.7 %)according to data from the 2007
      National Survey on Drug Use &amp; Health (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
      Administration 2008). Young adults start using heroin around this age range, and more
      recently have had increasing rates of prescription-type drug use. Given that young adults
      with opiate dependence who are seeking treatment are relatively treatment na√Øve, have a
      shorter period of addiction, and are more likely to choose buprenorphine over methadone,
      developing short-term buprenorphine treatment alternatives to long-term methadone agonist
      treatment is needed.

    <measure>Change of Opioid Use From Week 1 to 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly from week 1 to 13</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable was the change from baseline of the mean proportion of weekly opioid use assessed by self-reported days of use and/or positive urine drug screen during the previous week using the time-line followed-back method (TLFB) . A positive urine counted as 1, as did each self-reported day of use. Each participants total was divided by 8. Mean proportion by group were calculated by averaging the proportions across participants in that group.</description>

    <description>Calculated survival curve from abstinence in Week 8 to first positive opioid urine screen or first reported relapse to opioid use to evaluate the effect of memantine on reducing early relapse and after rapid buprenorphine discontinuation on week 9. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used to perform our event survival analyses.</description>

    <description>Participants were inducted onto buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets during the first week of study participation. The dose was titrated from bup/nal 8mg to bup/nal 16mg in three days where it will remain until the last day of week 8. The 7-day discontinuation of buprenorphine-naloxone on week 9 was 12mg, 10mg, 8mg, 6mg, 4mg, 2mg, 2mg and stopped.
Memantine 5mg in the morning was started on week 2. The dose was titrated on a twice a day schedule until the target dose of 30 mg/day was achieved by week 4. The medication was discontinued over a one-week period on week 13. Patients received a 7-day supply of their medication each week.</description>

The 7-day discontinuation of buprenorphine-naloxone on week 9 was 12mg, 10mg, 8mg, 6mg, 4mg, 2mg, 2mg and stopped.
Memantine 5mg in the morning was started on week 2. The dose was titrated on a twice a day schedule until the target dose of 15 mg/day was achieved by week 4. The medication was discontinued over a one-week period on week 13. Patients received a 7-day supply of their medication each week.

This instrument has 5 questions that are scored on a four-point scale from 0 ( never/almost never or not difficult) to 3 (always/nearly always or impossible). Overall scores range from 0 to 15, with scores above 10 indicating high severity.</description>

This instrument obtains a reflection of the respondent‚Äôs general heroin craving. This instrument was modified to include craving for prescription opioids. Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 1 for &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to 7 for &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; The total score is the average of the sum all 14 items with range from 1 to 7 with higher score indicating worse craving.</description>

          <title>Inhibitory Control (mean % error)</title>
          <description>Antisaccade Task: Participants view a computer screen displaying two placeholder outline boxes on either side of a fixation cross. Subjects are instructed to look away from the go signal when it appears inside one of the placeholder boxes. For each trial, the first saccade that follows the go signal will be labeled an impulsivity error (i.e., a prosaccade) if it lands on the box containing the go signal and a correct response (i.e., an antisaccade) if it lands in the goal box. This task is an excellent measure of the control over impulsive behavior with higher scores indicating worse control.</description>

        <title>Change of Opioid Use From Week 1 to 13</title>
        <description>The primary outcome variable was the change from baseline of the mean proportion of weekly opioid use assessed by self-reported days of use and/or positive urine drug screen during the previous week using the time-line followed-back method (TLFB) . A positive urine counted as 1, as did each self-reported day of use. Each participants total was divided by 8. Mean proportion by group were calculated by averaging the proportions across participants in that group.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Rapid discontinuation of buprenorphine was associated with dropout that may have limited the statistical power to evaluate some variables. Memantine for 7 weeks may have been too short, and a longer exposure may have yielded better results.</limitations_and_caveats>
