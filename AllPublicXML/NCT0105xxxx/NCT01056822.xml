It has 5 subscales (reflux, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain and indigestion) with scores rating from 1 to 7 (with a higher score representing more gastrointestinal symptoms)</description>
        <time_frame>Visit 1 (30 days +/-4), visit 2 (90 days +/- 15), visit 3 (150 days +/- 15), visit 4 (210 days +/- 15), visit 5 (365 days +/- 15)</time_frame>
        <population>Intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomised patients who gave signed informed consent and received at least one dose of study medicinal product and had at least one baseline visit and one post-baseline visit (containing data to allow primary endpoint to be calculated, i.e. dose of MPA or MMF and Tacrolimus).

        <title>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL): Impact of Gastrointestinal Symptoms on Quality Of Life (SIGIT)-QoL Questionnaire. Total Score.</title>
        <description>The SIGIT-QoL scale is a 17 items instrument, the score of each item ranges from 0 (always) to 4 (never). The scale score is obtained by adding the scores of the 17 items. Therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 68 points. Higher score means, less impairment of Health Related QoL of the patient and vice versa, the lower the score, the greater severity of symptoms and worse perceived by the patient</description>

        <population>Intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomised patients who gave signed informed consent and received at least one dose of study medicinal product and had at least one baseline visit and one post-baseline visit (containing data to allow primary endpoint to be calculated, i.e. dose of MPA or MMF and Tacrolimus).

        <description>Sub-study primary endpoint. SIGIT-QoL scale is a 17 items instrument, the score of each item ranges from 0 (always) to 4 (never). The scale score is obtained by adding the scores of the 17 items. Therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 68 points. Higher score means, less impairment of Health Related QoL of the patient and vice versa, the lower the score, the greater severity of symptoms and worse perceived by the patient</description>
