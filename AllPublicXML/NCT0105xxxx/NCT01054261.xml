        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male subjects,

          -  21-78 years of age, must be medically healthy with no clinically significant screening
             results (except for the subjects in Groups 2 and 3).

          -  Subjects with normal renal function (Group 1) must have an estimated CLcr of ≥80
             mL/min.

          -  Subjects with renal impairment (Groups 2 and 3) must fulfill the additional following
             criteria: (a) Stable renal impairment; (b) Group 2 subjects with mild renal impairment
             must have a CLcr of ≥50 to &lt;80 mL/min and (c) Group 3 subjects with moderate renal
             impairment must have a CLcr of ≥30 to &lt;50 mL/min.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major exclusion criteria include: history or clinical evidence of clinically relevant
             cardiovascular (including thromboembolic disorders), hepatic, renal (with the
             exception of renal insufficiency for subjects in Groups 2 and 3), hematological,
             endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, psychiatric or neurological impairment; any
             clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as judged by the Investigator;
             systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 or &gt;160 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 or &gt; 95 mmHg;
             allergy to or previous adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors or its constituents; use of
             prescription or over-the-counter drugs that are known to interfere with metabolism by
             the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme within 30 days prior to Day 1; use of any
             investigational drug within 30 days prior to Day 1; use of any prescription or
             over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies within 14 days prior to Day 1; history of
             alcohol or drug abuse within 18 months, history of smoking within 6 months; positive
             breathe alcohol test; positive cotinine test, positive urine drug screen (except in
             renally impaired subjects following approval by Sponsor). Additional exclusion
             criteria are listed in Section 4.2.
