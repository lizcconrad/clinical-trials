  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety profile for LTX-315 a lytic-peptide that has shown effect
      in animal models to kill cancer tumours when injected directly in to the tumour. The study
      will also monitor the immunological response in the body after injection of LTX-315.

    <textblock>
      A phase I study with an initial concentration/volume escalating part followed by an expanded
      cohort at the recommended dose (RD). This is an open label, multicentre study assessing the
      safety, tolerance, PK and efficacy of LTX-315 injected directly into transdermally accessible
      tumours on days 1 and 8.

      Additional weekly injections may be made, for up to a total of 6 injections.

      Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:

        1. Histologically confirmed malignant tumour

        2. Transdermally accessible lesion (in or close to the skin)

        3. Age ≥ 18 years

        4. ECOG Performance status (PS): 0 - 2

        5. Life expectancy: At least 3 months

      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety profile of LTX-315 by
      assessment of adverse events and abnormal laboratory values recorded during the study and to
      determine the recommended dose of LTX-315.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to preliminarily assess the anti-tumour activity of
      LTX-315 in patients with transdermally accessible tumours, monitor immunological response,
      pharmacokinetic assessment, and determine duration of response.
