    <textblock>
      Using scintigraphic imaging including planar scintigraphy and SPECT, this study will evaluate
      the utility of two different ex vivo 99mTc-HMPAO labelled mononuclear cell populations in
      order to select the optimal methodology (using PBMC or purified lymphocyte subpopulations)
      for future drug intervention studies in Crohn's disease.

      Two parallel exploratory approaches will be investigated to enrich for lymphocyte populations
      expressing leukocyte trafficking inhibitors. In the first, whole blood will be fractionated
      on a ficoll gradient to purify a heterogeneous population of all the peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) for labelling. Secondly, further enrichment will be attempted using
      depletion of PBMC fractions of monocytes and B cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the established technology of scintigraphic 'white cell scanning', in
      which the leukocytes in a limited volume of patient's blood are radiolabeled with indium-111
      or technetium-99m, re-introduced into the circulation, and their subsequent trafficking and
      accumulation in areas of active inflammation is visualised by scintigraphic imaging. This
      methodology is routinely used for diagnosis of inflammatory conditions and pharmacodynamic
      changes have been documented in the literature. As it is intended that this technology could
      be used in future drug intervention studies.

      However, because this sub-population labelling methodology remains exploratory, this study
      will investigate the utility of such techniques for use in future clinical trials in Crohn's
      patients.

      Two parallel exploratory approaches will be investigated to enrich for lymphocyte populations
      expressing leukocyte trafficking inhibitors. In the first, whole blood will be fractionated
      on a ficoll gradient to purify a heterogeneous population of all the peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) for labelling. Secondly, T lymphocytes will be further enriched by
      depletion of monocytes and B cells from PBMC fractions. In part A one scintigraphy scan will
      be performed in healthy volunteers to confirm that the purification and labelling procedure
      does not show abnormal biodistribution compared to the known physiological distribution of
      labelled mononuclear cells [Bennink, 2008].

      In part B, Crohn's disease patients will then be recruited to undergo two scintigraphy scans
      48-72 hours apart to establish intra-patient variability and feasibility of the repeated
      procedure that will be used in subsequent studies for therapeutic intervention. Analysis of
      SPECT images will be performed using a standardized scoring system.

        Inclusion

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

        Part A only:

          1. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, complete
             blood count and clinical chemistry. A subject with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may
             be included only if the investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             the study procedures.

             Part A and B:

          2. Male or female over 18 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

             â€¢ Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section
             8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

             Part B only:

          4. A history of CD for at least 3 months with a diagnosis confirmed by radiologic,
             endoscopic or histological assessment.

          5. Moderate to severe CD as evidenced by an elevated retrospective CDAI score (of

             â‰¥150) and 1 or more of the following:

               -  CRP (of â‰¥5 mg/L); or

               -  recent (within 4 weeks before the screening visit) evidence of active CD by CT
                  scan, MRI scan or endoscopy. Scans must be part of the patients routine care and
                  should not be conducted as a screening test for this study.

          6. Radiographic (barium, CT, MRI) or endoscopic evidence of small bowel involvement (if a
             patient has had a surgical intervention, evidence of small bowel involvement must have
             been obtained after the procedure).

        Exclusion

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

        Part A and B:

          1. Known or positive infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV.

          2. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to Day 1 of the current study: 30 days,
             5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational
             product (whichever is longer).

          3. Previous inclusion in a research and/or medical protocol involving nuclear medicine,
             PET or radiological investigations with significant radiation burden (a significant
             radiation burden being defined as ICRP category IIb or above: no more than 10 mSv in
             addition to natural background radiation, in the previous 3 years including the dose
             from this study).

             Part B only:

          4. Patients with active Crohn's disease with small bowel involvement who are not yet
             receiving treatment for whom it is judged inappropriate to defer initiating steroid or
             other treatment for up to 13 days (the maximum interval from screening to last imaging
             session).

          5. Patients who are corticosteroid dependent for whom it is judged inappropriate to defer
             increasing the dose of steroids or initiating other treatment for up to 13 days (the
             maximum interval from screening to last imaging session).

          6. Patients who are refractory to steroids or immunosuppressants or anti-TNFs for whom it
             is judged inappropriate to defer change of medical management or surgical intervention
             for up to 13 days (the maximum interval from screening to last imaging session).

          7. The subject is taking &gt;20mg/day Prednisolone or a prednisolone equivalent during the 4
             weeks prior to screening

          8. The subject received treatment natalizumab within 12 weeks prior to study entry;

          9. The subject has Hb&lt;10 g/l or Lymphocyte count &lt;10^9 /l

         10. Known C. difficile infection, or a clinical suspicion of a pathogenic bowel infection
             (including significant infection due to fistula).

         11. Suspected or diagnosed intra-abdominal abscess or bowel perforation

         12. The subjects has had bowel surgery (other than appendectomy) within 12 weeks prior to
             randomization or is likely to require abdominal surgery within 1 month of screening

         13. Concurrent illness, infection or disability (including malignancies or neoplastic
             disease of the bowel) that may affect the interpretation of clinical data, or
             otherwise contraindicates participation in this clinical study (e.g., an unstable
             cardiovascular, autoimmune, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic,
             gastrointestinal, hematologic, psychiatric or neurological condition).
