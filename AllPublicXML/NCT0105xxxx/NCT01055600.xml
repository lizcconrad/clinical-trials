    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV study to evaluate eltrombopag concentrations in breast milk of nursing
      mothers taking marketed eltrombopag (PROMACTAÂ®). Up to 10 subjects (mother-infant pairs) at
      as many as 10 study centers in the US will be enrolled. Nursing mothers who are registered
      with the PROMACTA Pregnancy Registry will be offered the option to participate in this trial
      if they continue to take commercial eltrombopag post-delivery and decide to breastfeed their
      infant. Information will be collected in a diary. Breast milk samples will be collected
      before and after infant feedings for a 24 hour period after eltrombopag dosing to evaluate
      the eltrombopag concentrations in the breast milk. Mothers will also be given the option to
      have a pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sample collected from the infant.

    Protocol opened to recruitment in Nov 2009. No potential subjects identified in 5 years;
    therefore, study was terminated in Jul 2014 due to lack of feasibility

          -  Mother is continuing to take eltrombopag.

          -  Mother has received 7 consecutive eltrombopag doses prior to the milk sample
             collection.

          -  Infant is 4 weeks to 26 weeks of age at the time of milk sampling.

          -  Exclusively breastfeeding mother-infant pair; either via breast or with expressed milk
             from the mother.

          -  Mother is capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with

             of the infant or low milk supply).

          -  Infants who are supplemented with formula or are consuming solid foods.
