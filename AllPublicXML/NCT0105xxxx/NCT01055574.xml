  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the physical capability outcomes of patients who
      undergo single-level ProDisc-L disc replacement with those of patients who undergo
      stand-alone, single-level anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF). This study will be the
      first multi-center clinical study to use clearly measurable outcomes from physical tests to
      compare the results of lumbar disc arthroplasty with disc fusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical capability testing will be conducted once before surgery and at 6 months and 1 year
      after surgery. Physical capability testing assesses the ability to perform a number of common
      tasks: the distance a subject can walk comfortably in 6 minutes; the amount of weight a
      subject can lift, push, pull, and carry; and the ability to squat and work bending forward in
      the kneeling and standing positions. The results of this testing will be evaluated to
      determine whether the subject's physical capability meets the physical requirements of their
      job, based on their responses to a pre-study questionnaire. Each physical capability testing
      session will require from 1 to 1 ½ hours of the subject's time. Physical capability testing
      will be provided without charge.

        The target study population are those meeting all the FDA criteria for ProDisc-L. Patients
        with third-party coverage for ProDisc-L that received surgical implantation of this device
        will be in one group. Patients without third-party coverage for ProDisc-L that underwent
        stand-alone ALIF with a device that incorporates fixation of the superior vertebral body to
        the inferior vertebral body, and where an osteoinductive biologic agent is placed within
        the device will be in the other group.
