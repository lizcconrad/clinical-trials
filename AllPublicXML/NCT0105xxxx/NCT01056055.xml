      This prospective, randomized study was conducted to compare the clinical outcomes of the
      modified Brostrom procedure using a suture anchor and bone tunnel for chronic lateral ankle
      instability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With With the increased number of participants in sports and leisure time activities, the
      incidence of ankle ligament injuries has been correspondingly increased. Various surgical
      methods have been reported for chronic ankle instability. Of these methods, the modified
      Brostrom procedure is currently used most frequently, and its excellent treatment outcomes
      have been reported. If there are any methods for obtaining a strong ligament fixation force
      which are both technically simple and safe, such methods would shorten the operative time and
      be helpful for surgeons with little experience in managing chronic ankle instability to
      obtain excellent treatment outcomes. In recent years, a procedure using a suture anchor,
      which is used for various types of ligament or tendon reconstructions, has been frequently
      performed. To date, however, few studies have reported clinical outcomes of suture anchor
      techniques and comparisons of clinical results between suture anchor techniques and other
      procedures. Given the above background, we prospectively compared the clinical outcomes
      between the bone tunnel and suture anchor techniques in the modified Brostrom procedure for
      chronic lateral ankle instability.

        Of patients who underwent the modified Brostrom procedure under the diagnosis of chronic
        lateral ankle instability, 40 patients (40 ankles) who could be followed during a minimum
        period of 2 years were enrolled in the current study. The current study included patients
        who complained of unilateral ankle joint instability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who complained of subjective instability of the ankle joint in whom repeated
             sprain injuries for &gt; 6 months and pain were confirmed

          -  Patients with marked ankle instability confirmed by the anterior drawer test as
             compared with the contralateral ankle joint and tenderness involving the lateral
             ligament of the ankle joint was confirmed on physical examination

          -  Patients with an talar tilt angle exceeding 10o or a discrepancy of &gt; 5o as compared
             with the non-affected side on stress radiography

          -  Patients with an anterior talar translation exceeding 10 mm or a discrepancy &gt; 3 mm as
             compared with the non-affected side.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who concurrently had an ankle fracture or marked tendon damage were excluded
             from the current analysis.
