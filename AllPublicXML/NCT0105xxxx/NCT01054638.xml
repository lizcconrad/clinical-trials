  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been associated with HIV infection. However, it is uncertain
      whether increased CVD rates are associated with HIV-related factors (e.g., HIV-infection or
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may worsen dyslipidemia) or reflect differences
      in the prevalence of underlying risk factors for CVD. Furthermore, the association between
      initiation and duration of HAART exposure and CVD risk, including which specific drugs within
      the HAART classes may contribute to the increased risk, is unknown. The primary objectives of
      the study are therefore:

      1. To estimate the absolute and relative incidence rate (IR) of CVD claims-based diagnoses
      among a cohort of adult patients from a large managed care population with a claims diagnosis
      of HIV, AIDS, or AIDS-related complex (ARC) during periods of exposure to:

        -  Any HAART compared to no HAART exposure

        -  HAART class [i.e., NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, and Other (i.e., fusion inhibitors)] compared to
           no HAART class exposure

        -  Specific NRTI medications compared to no specific NRTI exposure

  <detailed_description>

      The scientific approach is to conduct a retrospective cohort study of patients with a claims
      diagnosis of HIV, AIDS, or ARC (simply referred to as HIV infection) among commercially
      insured people in the U.S. to estimate the IR of acute MI (AMI), AMI including coronary
      revascularization (CR) procedures, and CVD, comparing exposure to HAART treatments. We will
      identify a primary cohort of patients with an initial claims diagnosis of HIV infection
      occurring after at least 6 months of continuous enrollment in the Ingenix National Health
      Informatics (NHI) or Ingenix Impact National Managed Care (Impact) Databases between 01
      January 1998 and 31 December 2007. For each eligible primary cohort member, we will identify
      all HAART dispensings during the baseline and follow-up periods and categorize person-time of
      exposure by any HAART, HAART class, and specific NRTI medications. We will also specifically
      evaluate the risk associated with fosamprenavir and amprenavir use. Study outcome events,
      including AMI, AMI including CR procedures, and CVD, will be identified from the medical
      claims data for all patients during the follow-up period.

      For the primary analysis, we will estimate the absolute IR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
      of each study outcome event during periods of recent, past, non-use, and cumulative duration
      (non-use, &lt; 1 year, 1 - 2 years, and &gt; 2 years) of each HAART exposure classification. We
      will also estimate the rate difference (RD) and 95% CI of each study outcome event during
      periods of recent, past, and cumulative duration (&lt; 1 year, 1 - 2 years, and &gt; 2 years) of
      each HAART exposure classification relative to non-use. We will use Poisson regression models
      to estimate the multivariable adjusted rate ratio (RR) and 95% CIs of each study outcome
      event during periods of recent, past, and cumulative duration (non-use, &lt; 1 year, 1 - 2
      years, and &gt; 2 years) of HAART use relative to non-use for each HAART exposure
      classification, adjusting for confounding variables derived from the claims history of each
      person during their 6-month baseline period to account for channeling bias and during the
      follow-up period to account for changing risk factors for CVD. To further account for
      confounding of indication by abacavir use, analyses will be stratified by calendar year 2004,
      during which time there was a significant change in the primary indication for abacavir use
      in HIV. Analyses will be repeated as a secondary analysis on the subgroup of patients in the
      NHI Database with any outpatient laboratory test result; these analyses will account for
      values of cholesterol, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, and viral load [HIV-1
      ribonucleic acid (RNA)] laboratory tests.

      Among the primary cohort, we will identify a subcohort of patients with an initial claims
      diagnosis of HIV infection occurring after at least 6 months of continuous enrollment and
      without HAART medication in the 6-month baseline period prior to the cohort entry date. We
      will repeat the primary and secondary analyses among this na誰ve subcohort of HAART
      initiators.

        Source population is from the proprietary Ingenix NHI Database, a large, geographically
        diverse population of U.S. health insurance plan enrollees. Records are organized into a
        medical file containing claims from providers and facilities, a pharmacy file with
        outpatient pharmacy dispensing records, and an enrollment file that provides demographic
        data and dates of insurance eligibility for persons in the database. Laboratory test
        results are also available for a fraction of the population. In addition, i3 Drug Safety
        will complement the data from the NHI Database with data from the Ingenix National Managed
        Care (Impact) Database, a fully de-identified, HIPAA compliant database from health
        insurance claims and enrollment data of more than 30 health plans separate from the plan
        affiliated with the NHI Database. Patients in each data source have a common unique
        identifier; therefore, it is possible to construct a combined population without concern
        that some patients may be duplicated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients aged 18 years or older with an initial claims diagnosis of HIV infection
             associated with a physician visit occurring after at least 6 months (183 days) of
             continuous enrollment between 01 January 1998 and 31 December 2007 will be included in
             the primary cohort. Patients will be required to have commercial health insurance
             coverage and complete medical and pharmacy benefits. The cohort entry date for each
             patient will be limited to the first claim associated with a HIV infection diagnosis
             that meets the 6-month continuous enrollment criteria. Patients with a HIV infection
             diagnosis claim who do not have at least one continuously enrolled segment that is
             equal to or greater than 6 months prior to the cohort entry date will be excluded. Six
             months of continuous enrollment prior to the initial claim associated with a HIV
             infection diagnosis will be required to guarantee the availability of a 6-month
             baseline period for ascertaining exposure to HAART prior to cohort entry and
             covariates of interest for the Poisson regression models. Patients may enter the
             primary cohort already exposed to HAART and with a HIV infection diagnosis claim in
             the 6-month baseline period.
