  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lutein is one of oxygenated carotenoids. Over the past few years, there has been increased
      interest in evaluating the effect of lutein for optimizing immune functions. A large number
      of epidemiological studies support the notion that a high intake of lutein is associated with
      a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and certain types of cancer. The biological
      mechanisms for the protective effects of this carotenoid, including powerful modulation of
      functions and antioxidant properties, are only partially known. Although several nutrients
      and phytochemicals have been shown to modulate immune functions in humans, few studies have
      investigated the role of lutein consumption. No information is available as to whether lutein
      supplementation could be protective against oxidative stress. Therefore, the objective of the
      present study was to examine the effect of consuming different doses of lutein on oxidative
      stress in healthy subjects.

      Participants with a history of smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI)≥30kg/m2,
      allergies, ocular diseases and participants taking vitamins or other food supplements
      containing lutein were excluded from the study.
