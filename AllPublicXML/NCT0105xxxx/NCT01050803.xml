  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of the Farsi diabetes self-management education program on
      psychosocial, lifestyle, and clinical measures in people with newly diagnosed people with
      type 2 diabetes and those with already-diagnosed type two diabetes who had received little
      self-management education. The development of the program was guided by an innovative process
      of intervention planning: Intervention Mapping.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For designing the management program, we will use Intervention Mapping (IM) framework for
      systematically developing the theory and evidence based program.

      Based on IM approach, this study will have seven phases:

      Step 1: needs assessment (Development the problem analysis: health, quality of life,
      behavior, environment).

      Step 2: We will develop proximal program objectives with a multidisciplinary expert panel of
      participants.

      Step 3: After identification of the proximal program objectives, the next step will be to
      select theoretical methods and practical strategies based on evidence for alternative
      methods.

      Step 4: The forth step of the program development will comprise of composing program
      materials and pre-testing these materials with a sample of patients at a diabetic outpatient
      clinic.

      Step 5: By involving the future program facilitators (health care workers at outpatient
      clinics) a linkage system will be foreseen.

      Step 6: planning for evaluation Step 7: Randomized Clinical Trial
