  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine and compare the safety and efficacy of broad area photodynamic therapy with
      aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT) following topical retinoid pre-treatment vs ALA-PDT with
      occlusion only (no pretreatment) in subjects with dorsal hand/forearm actinic keratoses, with
      an incubation time of 60 minutes, using blue light.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects will be randomized such that their RIGHT dorsal hand/forearm will receive one of the
      following two treatments with the subject's LEFT dorsal hand/forearm receiving the other
      treatment; Treatment 1 will include pre-treatment of the dorsal hand/forearm with Tazorac
      0.1% gel BID for one week, followed by ALA applied to the entire dorsal hand/forearm 60
      minutes prior to BLUE light treatment for 16 minutes 40 seconds Treatment 2 will have ALA
      applied to the entire dorsal hand/forearm and occluded for 60 minutes prior to BLUE light
      treatment for 16 minutes 40 secondsNote: ALA will be applied to individual dorsal
      hand/forearm actinic keratoses (AK) lesions followed by broad area application over the
      entire dorsal hand/forearm surface. The treatment area on the side NOT pre-treated with
      Tazorac will then be occluded using plastic wrap for 60 minutes. The treatment area of the
      dorsal hand/forearm is defined as the extensor surface of the hand/forearm between the elbow
      and the base of the fingers (the fingers are NOT included in the treatment area).

        and verbal informed consent.

        3. Subject has at least four (4) AK lesions (Grade 1 or 2) on each Treatment Area (dorsal
        forearm/hand surface), with at least 3 of these lesions in a continuous 25 cm2 Target Area
        on the hand or forearm.

        4. Subject is willing to comply with study instructions and return to the clinic for
        required visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             (e.g. HIV, systemic malignancy, etc.).

             3. Subject has any skin pathology or condition that could interfere with the
