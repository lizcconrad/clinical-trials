  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be in instructed to eat a therapeutic lifestyle diet and will receive
      CP-690,550 throughout the 12 weeks of this study. After 6 weeks, half will receive the
      cholesterol lowering agent, atorvastatin, and half a matching placebo. This study will first
      measure the effects of CP-690,550 on cholesterol levels and then the effects of adding
      atorvastatin on those levels.

    <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 functional categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3, 0=least functional difficulty and 3=extreme functional difficulty.</description>
