  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this clinical trial are to assess the impacts on vascular function tests and
      circulating biomarkers of a short-term (12-week) low-to-median intensity exercise training or
      ARBs treatment in patients with DM and hypertension.

      Inclusion criteria: type II diabetic and hypertensive patients who are aged 30 to 70 year-old
      with HbA1c ≤ 8.0 % and systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg. Neither ACEI nor ARB is
      administrated in recent 6 months. None has significant concomitant systemic diseases such as
      active infection, malignancy, hepatic or significant renal dysfunction at the time of
      enrollment (i.e. total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dl，ALT &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal range
      and creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dl in our hospital). Information regarding smoking, hypertension,
      hyperlipidemia as well as history of cardiovascular disease is obtained from all subjects. No
      other medication will be modified during the study period. After enrollment, patients are
      assessed to (1) olmesartan (20 mg per day, with titration), (2) life modification/exercise
      training for 12 weeks. Vascular function and exercise capacity studies, and peripheral blood
      testing are performed at baseline and at 12- week follow-up. Data are collected as mean ± SD
      showing comparison between groups by use of 2-sample t test and chi-square analysis for
      continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Adjust for the HbA1c level will be
      adjusted using simple adjustment method (ANCOVA or equivalent regression analysis) while
      doing the data analysis. Changes between baseline and follow-up measurements are assessed by
      paired t test. The frequencies of adverse effects between groups will also be comparing by
      2-sample t test. A p value &lt;0.05 is defined as statistically significant.
