  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether specific assays of DNA damage repair
      proteins can be used in patients undergoing radiation therapy. The ultimate goal of this
      research is to develop clinically useful biomarkers from blood samples that could be used to
      customize radiation treatment for individuals, leading to reduced side effects and improved
      outcomes.

          -  prior history of chemotherapy given within 6 months before enrollment.

          -  prior radiotherapy or radionuclide treatment and/or brachytherapy within 6 months
             prior to enrollment.

          -  unwillingness to comply with tests, protocol, or informed consent.

          -  concurrent enrollment on any protocol that would require non-compliance with treatment
             procedures.

          -  chemotherapy required within 2 hours following first dose of XRT.

          -  PET scan done within 48 hours of first blood draw.
