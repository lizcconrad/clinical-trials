  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis develop frequent and potentially life-threatening lung
      infections. Recent studies suggest that the nutrient &quot;glutamine&quot; may help the body fight off
      infection. Glutamine is an amino acid; a type of nutrient the body requires to build muscle.
      It is one of the building blocks of protein. During an illness, blood levels of glutamine
      tend to be lower than normal. Also, many patients with cystic fibrosis have difficulty
      getting normal levels of nutrients from food. The aim of this study is to see if patients
      with cystic fibrosis have low levels of glutamine when they experience an infection, and
      whether a dietary glutamine supplement taken daily for three months can raise these levels.
      We also want to see if this supplement can improve other blood markers of immunity (the
      body's ability to defend itself from infection). We hope to enroll 40 people with cystic
      fibrosis who experience a lung infection, over a one year period, into this study.
