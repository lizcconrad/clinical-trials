  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this particular study the physicians want to use a new technique of how they obtain the
      PET/CT pictures. It is called breath-hold (BH) PET/CT&quot;. As the name suggests, they will ask
      the patient to hold their breath for about 20-30 seconds, and only during that time will they
      obtain pictures. This is repeated several times. In contrast to the standard PET/CT scan,
      they expect less &quot;blurring&quot; of the pictures, so that they can see the tumor better and
      measure the uptake of radioactive sugar in the tumor better and more reliably. Basically,
      this is the difference between taking pictures of a runner as compared to taking pictures of
      a person standing still. Since PET images need to be obtained over several minutes and people
      can not hold their breath for this extended time, we break the procedure into several cycles
      of 20-30 seconds (or longer, if possible) and then add all the &quot;frozen&quot; pictures in the end
      into one. They want to know if BH PET/CT scan measure changes in the cancer during therapy
      (i.e., from the baseline scan before therapy to the follow up scan at within 4 weeks later).

    <description>In collaboration with the Department of Radiation Oncology and the Interventional Radiology Service, patients with lung or liver cancer or lung or liver metastases in whom FDG PET/CT is part of the clinical standard of care for disease evaluation and response assessment will be enrolled in this study. We will perform a clinical PET/CT and BH PET/CT (for two bed positions covering the entire chest) prior to, and again 1-2 weeks after SBRT or RFA. This early time point is chosen because a few weeks after the completion of treatment, acute radiation injury in the lung begins and will likely be detectable as abnormal uptake on follow-up PET imaging making it difficult to assess tumor recurrence.</description>

    <description>First, fiducial markers will be placed and taped on the patient's lower chest/upper abdomen. This will allow for monitoring of chest motion during breathing. A BH-CT scan will then be acquired with clinical CT scan parameters used in nuclear medicine. A BH-PET scan (acquisition time: 6 min per bed position) will follow the BH-CT scan. BH-PET images will cover the whole thorax, which, on average, corresponds to 1-3 PET FOV's (~15 cm/FOV). Data for these 1-3 bed positions are acquired to cover the entire thorax. There will be no additional radiotracer injection for the BH-PET scan.</description>
