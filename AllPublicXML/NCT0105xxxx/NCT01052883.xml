    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the drug levels of darunavir obtained after
      administration of a single administration of the 800 mg tablet (new formulation) to that
      following administration of two 400 mg commercial tablets formulation when administered under
      fed and fasted conditions to those also taking low-dose ritonavir. Darunavir is marketed for
      the treatment of HIV. The short-term safety and tolerability of darunavir following
      administration of a single 800 mg dose of darunavir given to healthy volunteers taking taking
      low-dose ritonavir will also be assessed.

      This is an open label study, which means that all parties including the study doctor, the
      healthy volunteer and the sponsor will know at all times which treatment group the volunteer
      is in. This is a cross over trial, which means that every volunteer will be sequentially
      subjected to 2 different treatments. A total of 32 healthy volunteers will participate in
      this study. Volunteers will be divided over 2 panels of 16 volunteers each. Volunteers in
      Panel 1 will be randomly assigned to treatment sequence AB or BA. Volunteers in Panel 2 will
      be randomly assigned to treatment sequence CD or DC. During all treatment periods 100 mg
      ritonavir (rtv) will be dosed once daily on Day 1 to Day 5. In treatment A you will receive a
      single dose of darunavir (DRV) two 400 mg commercial formulation in the morning of day 3
      after a standard breakfast. In treatment B you will receive a single dose of darunavir (DRV)
      800 mg new formulation in the morning of Day 3 also under fed conditions. In treatment C you
      will receive a single dose of darunavir (DRV) two 400 mg commercial formulation in the
      morning of day 3 under fasted conditions. In treatment D you will receive a single dose of
      darunavir (DRV) 800 mg new formulation in the morning of day 3 also under fasted conditions.
      Treatment sessions are organized with 7 days between treatment periods. In each session, an
      extensive investigation of the levels of DRV and rtv in the blood circulation is planned.
      Levels of DRV will be assessed at 15 different time points, i.e. before administration of DRV
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after intake of DRV. Levels of
      rtv will be assessed at 13 different time points, i.e. before administration of rtv on Day 3,
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 12 hours after intake of rtv on day 3 and before
      administration of rtv on Day 4. Standard Safety assessments (blood biochemistry and
      hematology, urine analysis, ECG, pulse rate and blood pressure) will be performed on Day1, 3
      and 6 in each Treatment period. Two 400 mg DRV commercial tablet formulation (F030) single
      dose on Day 3 of treatment A and C; 800 mg DRV new tablet formulation (G002) single dose on
      Day 3 of treatment B and D; 100 mg rtv capsule once daily on Day 1 to Day 5. All intake are
      oral.
