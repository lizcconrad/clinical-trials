  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an on-line intervention for families of young children
      who have experienced moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Previous interventions
      were not designed to address the needs of young children with TBI, and feedback revealed a
      desire for more examples and materials appropriate for families of younger children. This
      project builds upon the investigators previous research by modifying the online intervention
      content to address the needs of young children with TBI. The goal of this project is to
      develop an intervention that will encourage positive parenting behaviors, improve child
      behaviors, and reduce parent distress and burden following TBI. The investigators hypothesize
      that the intervention group will exhibit more effective parenting skills as well as better
      child functioning and lower levels of parental distress at follow-up than will the active
      comparison group.

    <textblock>
      Five million young children suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year resulting in
      new child behavior problems, parental distress, and family dysfunction. Recent studies
      provide evidence that online skill building interventions can reduce caregiver distress and
      improve child adjustment following TBI. The investigators hypothesize that the I-InTERACT
      group will exhibit more effective parenting skills as well as better child functioning and
      lower levels of parental distress at follow-up than will the IRC group. The investigators
      overarching goal is to reduce the risk of long-term behavioral problems and disability in
      young children following TBI by equipping parents with increased coping and parenting skills
      in a cost effective fashion. Findings will be disseminated via presentations and
      peer-reviewed publications, a website and newsletter, workshops with advocacy groups, and
      technical assistance to interested parties

    <description>Families in I-InTERACT will look through 10 web-sessions (like chapters) and participate in 10 family meetings focusing on education about traumatic brain injury, parenting skills, communication, behavior strategies, and stress management. Meetings will be conducted in their home using a computer hook-up with a trained therapist. Families will also be contacted two times per month by the counselor to discuss individual problems or concerns.</description>
