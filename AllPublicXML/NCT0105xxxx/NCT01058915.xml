  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) increased
      LDL-cholesterol reduction (rosuvastatin 40 mg) will provide incremental plaque stabilization
      (changes in plaque composition) and plaque regression over 12 months beyond the benefit of
      moderate LDL-cholesterol reduction (rosuvastatin 5 mg) (assessed by IVUS and VH).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction

          -  20% &lt; angiographic diameter stenosis &lt; 50% on a not previously revascularized native
             coronary artery

          -  Statin na√Øve

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pharmacologic lipid lowering treatment before index hospitalization

          -  Atrial fibrillation, not well rate-controlled

          -  Ventricle frequency variation with more than a factor 2 over 1 minute

          -  Unconscious patients

          -  Total cholesterol &gt; 7.0 mmol/l

          -  History of statin induced myopathy, or serious hypersensitivity reaction to other
             HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) including rosuvastatin

          -  Pregnant women, women who are breast feeding, and women of childbearing potential who
             are not using chemical or mechanical contraception or have a positive serum pregnancy
             test (a serum-human chorionic gonadotrophin [Beta-HCG] analysis)

          -  History of malignancy (unless a documented disease free period exceeding 5-years is
             present) with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or
             in the case of a study designed to investigate antineoplastic properties of
             rosuvastatin. Women with a history of cervical dysplasia would be permitted to enter
             the study provided they had 3 consecutive clear Papanicolaou (Pap) smears

          -  Uncontrolled hypothyroidism (TSH &gt; 1.5xULN)

          -  Abnormal LFT's

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 5 years (this may affect compliance)

          -  Current active liver disease (ALT/SGPT &gt;2xULN or severe hepatic impairment (to protect
             patient safety as directed on the labels of currently approved statins)

          -  Unexplained creatine kinase (CK &gt; 3xULN) (To protect patient safety) (will be
             increased at baseline because of acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction a
             few days before enrolment)

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;176mmol/L (2.0mg/dL) (unless the protocol specifically aims to
             investigate a chronic renal disease population)

          -  Participation in another investigational drug study less than 4 weeks before enrolment
             in the study, or according to subjects local ethics committee requirements where a
             larger period is stipulated (to avoid potential misinterpretation of overlapping
             adverse events)

          -  Treatments with cyclosporine

          -  Treatment with gemfibrozil
