      This is a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, single center, three period crossover study to
      determine the oral bioavailability of a new ABT-263 formulation relative to that of the
      current ABT-263 formulation being administered in ongoing Phase 1/2a studies. Approximately
      12 healthy female subjects will be enrolled in this study.

             physical examination, vital signs, laboratory profile and a 12-lead electrocardiogram
             (ECG).

          -  Must voluntarily sign and date each informed consent, approved by an Independent

             parenteral hormonal contraceptives)

          -  Used known inhibitors or inducers CYP3A w/i 1 month prior to ABT-263; Received any
             investigational product w/i 6 weeks prior to ABT-263

          -  Used tobacco or nicotine-products w/i 6 months prior to ABT-263

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding
