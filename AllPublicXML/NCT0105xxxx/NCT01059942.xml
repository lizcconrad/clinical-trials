      The aim of this project is to develop and validate a simple, flexible, reliable, real-time
      observation tool to evaluate hand-off practices. The Hand-off CEX is a paper-based instrument
      that can be used to evaluate either the sender or the receiver of hand-off communication.
      This tool is based on a previously-validated, widely-used, real-time educational evaluation
      tool (the Mini-CEX); published expert opinion; and our prior research . The investigators'
      tool incorporates unique role-based anchors for both senders and receivers that refer to
      verbal communication, professionalism and environment, hand-off domains informed by
      preliminary work and expert opinion. The Hand-off CEX(Clinical Evaluation Exercise) will be
      used by academic hospitalists and house-staff physicians to assess feasibility. We, the
      investigators, will also assess the construct validity and inter-rater reliability of the
      tool through the use of standardized, videotaped hand-off scenarios depicting various levels
      of performance of a hand-off scenario.

      We hypothesize that the Hand-off CEX will arm educators with an innovative, necessary, valid
      and feasible method for training health professionals to conduct safe and effective
      hand-offs. Finally, the Hand-off CEX will be a useful tool to assist hospitals in improving
      patient safety.

    <textblock>
      Transitions of patient care among inpatient providers occur frequently and require providers
      to transmit critical clinical information. If information is omitted or misunderstood during
      a hand-off, serious clinical consequences may result for patient care. In fact, studies have
      shown that hand-offs are often variable and represent a major gap in safe patient care. For
      patients cared for by resident physicians, dangers posed by poor communication may be
      amplified since the implementation of resident duty hour restrictions in July 2003 has
      increased transfer frequency.In addition, few trainees receive formal training on hand-offs.
      The Joint Commission currently requires hospitals to implement a standardized, interactive
      approach to hand-off communications. Unfortunately, due to a lack of valid, standardized
      tools to evaluate hand-off quality, hospitals and educators cannot assess whether their
      hand-offs meet these criteria. More recently, the Institute of Medicine has recommended that
      all residents receive formal education on hand-off strategies.

      Education about best practices during hand-offs and assessment of hand-off quality is needed
      for several reasons: to improve clinical practice through evaluation and feedback, to
      illuminate areas of deficiency in current practices and to maximize patient safety in this
      era of duty hour restrictions. At the University of Chicago and Yale, investigators have
      extensive experience in describing hand-off quality, designing and implementing novel
      curricula to improve hand-off education amongst varying levels of trainees and have
      elucidated the relationship between patient care outcomes and poor hand-off quality.
      Therefore, drawing from our preliminary work in this area, and relevant practices in other
      industries, we aim to develop and test a generalizable tool to evaluate hand-offs in clinical
      settings.
