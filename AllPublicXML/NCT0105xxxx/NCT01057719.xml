  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the effect of inpatient physiotherapy in a warm climate
      versus physiotherapy in a colder climate in multiple sclerosis (MS), in both short- and long
      term perspectives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Empirically, several patients with MS have reported improved function in warm climate during
      therapy or vacation. This is in contrast to the heat intolerance frequently reported in MS.
      Heat intolerance seems, however, to be individually distributed among the MS patients, and
      may seem to be related to the degree of warmth.

      Sixty patients with gait problems and without heat intolerance were included in a cross-over
      study. They were randomized to a 4-week inpatient physiotherapy based on the Bobath concept
      in Norway or Spain, with cross-over the year after. Data from five physical performance
      measures and six self-reported measures were collected at screening, baseline, after
      treatment and three and six months after both treatment-periods. Change over time within
      groups and comparisons of change between groups were analyzed by mixed models.
