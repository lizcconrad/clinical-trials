      of the exclusion criteria will be excluded,and so do the healthy volunteers.For each enrolled
      participant will obtain a baseline psychiatric and medical assessment, results of the
      Mini-Mental Status-Evaluation (MMSE),Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating
      Scale(BEHAVE-AD),Activity of Daily Living Scale(ADL)and other basic information prior to
      beginning acupuncture.For each participant will get acupuncture which once a day for 7 days
