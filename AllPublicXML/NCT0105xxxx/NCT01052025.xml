  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence rate of type 2 diabetes in Thai populations is high and increasing every year.
      Cardiovascular disease is the main complication of this disease, which has been defined as an
      important cause of death among Diabetic patients. This disease is now becoming a major health
      problem and causes a great economic loss to the country. Evidence shows that Curcumin, Thai
      herbal medicine, has the effectiveness of prevention and delay of type 2 diabetes. However,
      there is no scientific study that aims to prove the efficacy of this herb particularly for
      prevention and delay the disease in Patients with impaired glucose tolerance (pre-diabetes)
      and insulin resistance.
