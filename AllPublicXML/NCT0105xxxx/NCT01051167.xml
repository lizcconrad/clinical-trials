      Cetuximab is normally given as a weekly schedule in the therapy of patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

      In order to improve the convenience for the patients in first line-therapy this study will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bi-weekly combination of cetuximab with FOLFOX.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For years the effective treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma (CRC) was limited to
      fluorouracil (5-FU). Combination of 5-FU or a 5-FU analog with oxaliplatin, which has some
      antitumor activity as a single agent, shows synergistic activity. Combining oxaliplatin with
      a twice monthly folinic acid/5-FU schedule leads to a further improvement in first-line
      treatment of advanced CRC thus emerging to a standard regimen in first-line therapy of
      metastatic CRC.

      Cetuximab is normally given as a weekly schedule. As recently shown a biweekly schedule with
      500 mg/m² instead of the weekly standard regimen (initial dose of 400 mg/m² followed by 250
      mg/m² every week) exhibits similar pharmacokinetic results with a comparable efficacy.

      In order to improve the convenience for the patients, this study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of a bi-weekly combination of cetuximab with FOLFOX. Out of the various FOLFOX
      regimens the most convenient FOLFOX-6 schedule is chosen for the study, which has been tested
      before in two studies in combination with the standard weekly schedule of cetuximab. Recent
      data suggest a decreased efficacy of cetuximab in patients bearing a k-ras mutation in their
      CRC. Therefore only patients with no evidence for a mutated k-ras gene in the colorectal
      carcinoma cells will be included in this study.
