    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study to evaluate
      the immediate benefits (at discharge and at 30 days) in terms of performance and safety of
      the implantation of the Medtronic CoreValve PAV in a failing aortic bioprosthesis. In
      addition, the study aims to evaluate the performance and the safety of the implantation of
      the Medtronic CoreValve PAV in a failing aortic bioprosthesis at subsequent annual follow-ups
      out to 48 months post procedure.

      These objectives will be achieved through the following endpoints:

        -  Primary safety endpoint - Composite of Major Adverse Events

        -  Primary performance endpoint - Technical and procedural success at discharge

      Patient Population: Eligible subjects will be at least 75 years old, presenting with a
      failing aortic bioprosthesis (stenotic, incompetent or mixed) including homograft or stented
      or stentless heterograft, considered poor surgical candidates and necessitating repeat aortic
      valve replacement. Up to 20 patients will be included in up to four hospitals.
