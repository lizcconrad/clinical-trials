    <textblock>
      The almost single disadvantage of conventional polyurethane film dressings, an uncontrolled
      leakage, is probably as often described as its numerous advantages for split-thickness skin
      graft (STSG) donor sites. This shortcoming can be overcome by perforating the polyurethane
      dressing (MPD), which permits a controlled leakage into a secondary absorbent dressing. The
      study was conducted to compare the MPD-system and Aquacel® (ConvaTec), a hydrofiber wound
      dressing, which also seems to fulfill all criteria of an ideal donor site dressing.
