      Overtesting for Acute Coronary Syndrome(ACS) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in low risk
      Emergency Department(ED) patients can increase exposure of nondiseased patients to radiation,
      intravenous contrast and anticoagulation. This project addresses question of whether
      quantitative Pre-Test Probability(PTP) assessed from two validated web-based computer
      algorithms (the project &quot;webtool&quot;), can improve the diagnostic evaluation of adult patients
      with charted evidence of chest pain and dyspnea. After a validation phase, the main study
      will randomize patients to either the Standard care group or the Intervention group, which
      will receive the output of the ACS and PE webtool that includes the PTP estimates of ACS and
      PE and one of three recommendations regarding next steps: 1. No further testing, 2. Exclusion
      with a biomarker protocol, or 3. Immediate imaging +/- empiric anticoagulation.

For ACS, PTP &lt;2.5% with low clinical suspicion and available follow-up, no further testing; PTP 2.5 to 5.5%: obtain a troponin I measurement at presentation and 120 minutes later, and if both are normal, no further testing; PTP &gt;5.5%: proceed to provocative testing. For PE, PTP&lt;2.5% with low clinical suspicion and available follow-up, no further testing; PTP 2.5-10%, obtain a quantitative D-dimer and if normal, no further testing. PTP 10-20%, proceed directly to pulmonary vascular imaging, and if PTP&gt;20% consider empiric anticoagulation with heparin if no contraindications.</description>
