      This is a four month exercise training program for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD)with a 12 month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience
      intense symptoms of dyspnea when they use their arms and shoulders. To control dyspnea they
      avoid using their arms and ultimately experience a significant loss of upper body (UB)
      strength and a decrease in the level of physical activity. Some pulmonary rehabilitation
      programs include strength training, but the training intensity is typically very low. The
      purpose of this research is to examine the effects of UB strength training (designed to
      maximize strength gains) with a self-confidence intervention to enhance adherence to
      exercise. This is an experimental study with random assignment of subjects to one
      experimental and two control groups: (a) UB strength training and self-efficacy intervention
      for adherence (experimental), (b) UB strength training with health education (control 1) and
      (c) gentle armchair fitness exercises with health education (control 2). Each subject will be
      studied for a total of 16 months.The intervention period is four months in duration with a
      12-month follow-up period. The sample will be people with moderate to severe COPD who
      experience dyspnea with UB activities. This research is innovative in that it examines the
      effects of upper body strength training designed to maximize strength gains and combines it
      with a theory-based self-efficacy (confidence-building) intervention to promote adherence to
      training in people with COPD.

    <description>Subjects in the experimental group will participate in a self-efficacy enhancing intervention designed to maximize (a) exercise-specific SE-UB strength training (b) self-efficacy for overcoming barriers to exercise and (c) SE-UB physical activities. The intervention incorporates strategies to maximize the primary sources of efficacy information: (a) mastery accomplishments, (b) social modeling, (c) social persuasion, (d) interpretation of physiological and affective symptoms.</description>

    <description>Gentle armchair fitness exercises will be used as a sham treatment to control for the attention that subjects receive in the two strength training groups. The armchair fitness exercises will be conducted in small groups (n=8-10 per group). Armchair exercises will include stretching of all major joints with an emphasis on the arms and shoulders, massage of muscles that can be reached from the armchair (scalp, neck, shoulders, lower back, abdomen and thighs) and imagery to promote relaxation. Each session will include: 5 minutes of slow stretching, 20 minutes of faster paced exercises, 5 minutes of slower paced stretches, followed by 5-10 minutes of massage and imagery for relaxation.</description>

    <description>16 weeks of lab-based upper body strength training using 8: modified lateral pull down, shoulder shrug, upright row, overhead pull down, front raise, front pull down, triceps extension, biceps curl. Training load and volume will be increased progressing from 70% to 80% of the maximum strength training and from 2 sets of 8-10 repetitions progressing to 3 sets. Each week subjects will train twice in the lab and once at home. Home exercises will include 1 set of 15-20 repetitions: biceps curl, triceps extension, front raises, lateral raises, overhead press, chest press and one-arm dumbbell row.</description>
