    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the
             protocol requirements.

          2. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future
             medical care.

          3. Patient is older than 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent.

          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential† must:

             Understand that the study medication could have a potential teratogenic risk
             (Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide which is a known human
             teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects.
             Lenalidomide induced in monkeys malformations similar to those described with
             thalidomide)

             Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without
             interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy
             (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug therapy,
             even if she has amenorrhoea. This applies unless the subject commits to absolute and
             continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are effective methods
             of contraception • Implant - Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)

               -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot • Tubal sterilisation • Sexual intercourse with
                  a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative
                  semen analyses • Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)

             Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined
             oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of
             VTE continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral contraception.

             prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly in
             patients with neutropenia due to risk of infection

             o Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25
             mIU/ml not more than 3 days from the start of study medication once the subject has
             been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This requirement also applies to
             women of childbearing potential who practice complete and continued abstinence.

             Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4 weeks
             after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilization.
             These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the start of next
             treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who
             practice complete and continued abstinence

             Male subjects must Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose
             interruption and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of
             childbearing potential and has no contraception.

             Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of
             study drug therapy.

             All subjects must Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy
             and for one week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

             Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused study
             drug to the investigator
