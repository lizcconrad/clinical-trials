  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite these initial positive signals in recent statistics, breast cancer continues to claim
      a substantial number of lives approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide in 2005 Thus the current
      treatment paradigm - surgery, radiation and systemic chemo and or hormonal therapy and
      biological therapies -still fails to cure a significant number of women with early breast
      cancer and new treatment strategies are needed to improve current results both in early and
      advance disease.

      Recurrent or metastatic breast cancer is an incurable malignancy with a median survival of
      20-24 months [Hortobagyi , 1998] and this has not changed significantly over the last decade
      with fewer than 20% of patients still alive at 5 years after a diagnosis of recurrence.
      Although there have been small improvements in survival with the new therapies, metastatic
      breast cancer remains an incurable and, ultimately, fatal disease. The introduction of novel
      combination therapies have the potential to target different pathways in the cancer cell,
      leading to improved efficacy. Further studies to optimize combination therapy, while
      ameliorating AEs, are critically important to patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      Lapatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits both EGFR and
      HER2[Spector, 2005]. Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine is approved in more than 20
      countries for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose
      tumors overexpress HER2. All patients in the study leading to the lapatinib approval had
      received prior therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.

      The relevance of the HER2/neu target in breast cancer, combined with the promising
      preclinical and clinical data regarding the use of lapatinib, provide the rationale for a
      formal evaluation of this agent combined with other non taxane agents as gemcitabine or
      vinorelbine after progression on taxanes and trastuzumab based therapies in metastatic
      disease setting as these chemotherapy options are used in daily practice in this subset of
      patients.

      This is a randomized phase II, open label,multicentric , international, 3 arms treatment
      study in patients with confirmed HER2+ metastatic breast cancer after taxane progression .
      The main objective is to investigate the (CBR) and safety in 3 different combinations of
      Lapatinib therapy (plus capecitabine or gemcitabine or vinorelbine) and to determine whether
      either, or both, of Lapatinib /Vinorelbine or Lapatinib/Gemcitabine can be considered a
      reasonable alternative to the established Lapatinib/Capecitabine standard combination . The
      decision as to whether to study either of the new combinations further will be based on both
      the toxicity and the efficacy profiles.

      In areas where trastuzumab is available with no barriers to access, all patients must have
      received trastuzumab in the adjuvant or metastatic setting . However, in countries where
      trastuzumab is not approved or is not available to patients due to reimbursement or other
      considerations, trastuzumab naïve patients are allowed considering the efficacy data of
      Lapatinib in this subset of patients.

      This trial uses a design to ensure a selection of one or more of the better treatment
      combination for additional clinical Approximately (165), who meet the criteria for efficacy
      analysis as defined, will be enrolled in the study in a single stage process. The sample size
      will be accrued in 16 months, with further follow-up for a 24 months study period from
      randomization or until progression.

      The study includes a Screening/Baseline Period, a Treatment Period and a post-treatment
      Follow-Up Period. Patients will continue to receive investigational products until disease
      progression or early discontinuation from investigational product for other reasons. Patients
      who discontinue investigational product(s) without disease progression will continue to be
      evaluated for efficacy until progression or until receiving the first subsequent anti-cancer
      therapy. Once progression is documented, all patients will be followed for survival at
      approximately 3-month intervals until death.
