  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be switched from their current medication for painful diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pregabalin as compared to placebo. All
      patients will receive pregabalin, and half of patients will receive placebo at some point
      during the study.

    <measure>Change From Single-Blind Baseline in Mean Pain Score at Week 19 During Double-Blind Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>SB Baseline, Week 19 (DB Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings. Participants rated their DPN pain over the past 24 hours on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain. A rating of 1-3 was considered as mild pain; 4-6 = moderate pain; and 7-10 = severe pain. SB baseline refers to the last 7 pain diary entries up to and including Day 1.</description>

A rating of 1-3 was considered as mild pain; 4-6 = moderate pain; and 7-10 = severe pain. SB baseline refers to the last 7 pain diary entries up to and including Day 1.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With At Least 30 Percent and 50 Percent Reduction in Mean Pain Score (Single-Blind Phase)</title>
        <description>Mean pain score was defined as the mean of the last 7 daily diary pain ratings. Participants rated their DPN pain over the past 24 hours on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain. A rating of 1-3 was considered as mild pain; 4-6 = moderate pain; and 7-10 = severe pain. Percentage of participants who had at least 30% and 50% pain reduction from SB baseline to Week 6 is reported. SB baseline refers to the last 7 pain diary entries up to and including Day 1.</description>

        <population>SBAS included all participants who were enrolled into the single-blind treatment phase and received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Missing data were imputed using LOCF.</population>
