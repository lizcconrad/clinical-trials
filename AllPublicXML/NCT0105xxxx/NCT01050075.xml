      RATIONALE: Acupuncture may help relieve nerve pain caused by chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well acupuncture works in treating
      nerve pain in patients with stage I, stage II, and stage III breast cancer who are receiving
      paclitaxel.

  <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore the potential for the use of acupuncture to prevent a worsening of the nerve
      damage in patients (during treatment) due to paclitaxel as measured by a Neuropathic Pain
      Symptom Inventory.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the impact of acupuncture based on neurological assessment, quantitative sensory
      tests and nerve conduction tests.

      II. Evaluate the improvement observed when treating patients for peripheral neuropathy
      (post-chemotherapy) with acupuncture based on the same metrics.

      III. To correlate objective measures of neuropathy (nerve conduction, quantitative sensory
      tests, neuropathy composite score, and blood cytokine levels) with the subjective
      questionnaire/quality of life measures.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel every 2 weeks for 4 courses as standard of care. Patients
      undergo acupuncture therapy comprising 2 30-minute sessions a week for 4 weeks during courses
      3 and 4.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel every 2 weeks for 4 courses as standard of care. Patients
      then undergo acupuncture therapy comprising 2 30-minute sessions a week for 4 weeks.
