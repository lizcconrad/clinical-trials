  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has established a set of consensus guidelines for
      pediatricians to follow. These guidelines can be challenging to implement in typical
      community-based practices. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) has
      developed a program called the ADHD Collaborative to promote the adoption of these guidelines
      among community pediatricians. The program focuses on modifying the office system using
      academic detailing and quality improvement (QI) methodology to accommodate prescribed
      practice changes. The ADHD Collaborative has been very successful at recruiting practices in
      the Greater Cincinnati area, changing practice behaviors, and sustaining these practice
      behaviors over time at minimal cost to the project and to the office practice. Now that
      sustainability and effectiveness have been established, the next step is to modify the ADHD
      Collaborative model to make it amenable to widespread dissemination. The primary goal of the
      proposed study is to modify the ADHD Collaborative intervention to make it transportable and
      then evaluate this version in terms of effectiveness, consumer satisfaction, and costs.. A
      transportable intervention is described that utilizes telehealth videoconferencing, a web
      portal, and long-distance data collection. Initially, three pediatric practices will be
      recruited to test and refine the distal intervention delivery methodology. Then, eight new
      pediatric practices will be randomly assigned to receive the distal intervention or to a
      control group (treatment as usual). Information about pediatric practice behavior will be
      collected at baseline, 6-months, and 1-year post-baseline. The study design will allow for a
      preliminary assessment of the feasibility and effectiveness of the distal intervention in
      terms of rates of evidence-based practice behaviors to patients, change in pediatrician
      attitudes, consumer satisfaction, and costs.

    <description>This intervention includes mapping and redesign of office flow to facilitate adherence to AAP ADHD guidelines as well as didactic sessions related to diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Didactics emphasize the importance of obtaining parent and teacher behavioral ratings (e.g. Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales) at the time of the initial assessment for ADHD and during follow-up after initiating medication treatment and making a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) based ADHD diagnosis. Practices are given a web-based ADHD portal to assist them in creating a patient registry and to help in obtaining parent and teacher ratings scales. The intervention lasts for 6 months.</description>

          <title>ADHD Collaborative Intervention</title>
          <description>This intervention includes mapping and redesign of office flow to facilitate adherence to AAP ADHD guidelines as well as didactic sessions related to diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Didactics emphasize the importance of obtaining parent and teacher behavioral ratings (e.g. Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales) at the time of the initial assessment for ADHD and during follow-up after initiating medication treatment and making a DSM-IV based ADHD diagnosis. Practices are given a web-based ADHD portal to assist them in creating a patient registry and to help in obtaining parent and teacher ratings scales. The intervention lasts for 6 months.
