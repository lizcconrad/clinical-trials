      Many treatment cases proved that autologous chondrocyte transplantation is a useful treatment
      method for patients with damaged articular cartilage.

      This investigator-sponsored trial attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of
      Chondron(autologous chondrocyte) transplantation by tracking subjects who had the Chondron
      implantation to observe effectiveness.

        In this exploratory clinical trial Chondron (autologous chondrocytes) is transplanted in
        the cartilaginous defects and the effectiveness is observed through follow-up. Target
        subjects are about 5% of about 2,000 patients with Chondron implants.

        -  Inclusion Criteria:

               1. Adult males and females aged between 15 and 65

               2. Patients with a partial cartilaginous defect in the ankle joint confirmed
                  arthroscopically or visually

               3. Patients with misalignment between tibia and talus of the ankle joint, lateral
                  ankle instability, and a bony defect in the cartilaginous defect or who had a
                  correction simultaneously or in advance

               4. Patients whose surrounding cartilage is normal

               5. Subjects who consented to the clinical trial or on whose behalf a person with
                  parental rights consented to the clinical trial

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

               1. Patients hypersensitive to bovine protein

               2. Patients hypersensitive to antibiotics like gentamicin

               3. Patients with inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and gouty
                  arthritis

               4. Patients with arthritis associated with autoimmune diseases

               5. Patients who are pregnant, nursing a baby or likely to get pregnant

               6. Patients with other diseases including tumors except for cartilaginous defects of
                  joints

               7. Patients with an anamnesis within the past two years, such as radiation treatment
                  and chemotherapy

               8. Diabetics (however, patients who were normal in the blood glucose test and have
                  no complication due to diabetes will be excluded if the doctor says Chondron can
                  be administered to them)

               9. Patients with infections who are taking antibiotics and antimicrobial agents

              10. Patients who are treated with adrenal cortical hormones

              11. Patients whom the investigators find to be unfit for this clinical trial, such as
                  mental patients
