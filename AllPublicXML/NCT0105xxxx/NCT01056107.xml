  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study the effects of an investigational (not FDA approved) medication,
      ROSE-010, on the movement of food through the stomach, small intestine and colon in females
      with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome (C-IBS).

      The study hypothesis is that ROSE-010 will delay gastric emptying of solids and enhances
      gastric accommodation without retarding colonic transit in female patients with C-IBS.

      Methodology

      Female patients with C-IBS will be screened for eligibility and informed about the study at
      the initial screening visit Visit 1. Within two weeks of Visit 1, eligible patients will be
      randomized to study medication, either 30 mcg, 100 mcg or 300 mcg ROSE-010 or placebo
      administered via abdominal subcutaneous (s.c.) injection for a total of four days, three
      consecutive days during transit scintigraphy and once prior to SPECT imaging. The allocation
      to treatment group will be concealed.

      Study medication will be administered at Visits 2, 3, and 4, the days of scintigraphic
      assessment of gastric, small bowel and colonic transit of solids performed over a 48 hour
      period.

      Within two to seven days of Visit 4, patients will be instructed to return for administration
      of a final injection of study medication followed by SPECT gastric accommodation measurements
      (Visit 5). Within seven to ten days of Visit 5, patients will return for Visit 6, final
      safety monitoring and an exit interview with study staff.

      Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration

      Patients will receive placebo or 30 mcg, 100 mcg or 300 mcg ROSE-010 administered s.c. in the
      abdomen once on Visit 2, immediately before the standardized breakfast meal, fifteen minutes
      before the first camera image is obtained. Study medication will be administered fifteen
      minutes before camera images obtained on Visits 3 and 4. Study medication will be
      administered immediately after the first fasting scan is obtained and before the second
      fasting scan during SPECT at Visit 5.

      Duration of treatment

      ROSE-010 or matching placebo will be administered via abdominal s.c injection once daily for
      three consecutive days and one final day two to seven days later, over a ten-day interval.

      Duration of patients involvement in the study

      Each patient will attend six visits at the clinic during a period of two to four weeks.

      Efficacy assessments

        1. Scintigraphic gastrointestinal and colonic transit

        2. Technetium-99m (99mTc) SPECT measurement of gastric volumes

        3. Assessment of stool frequency and consistency made by the patient using the Bowel
           Pattern Diary

      Safety assessments

      The following safety assessments will be performed:

        1. Laboratory safety tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive
           metabolic panel (CMP), and urinalysis (UA) at Visit 1 (study entry) and Visit 6 (study
           exit)

        2. A physical examination by a study physician at Visit 1

        3. Weight and vital signs (including temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respiration
           rate) at every visit

        4. Urine pregnancy tests performed at Visit 1 and within 48 hours prior to receipt of
           radiation at Visit 2 transit test and Visit 5 SPECT test

        5. Interview for concomitant medications and adverse events at every visit

      Statistical methods

      An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare transit parameters and gastric
      volumes among the treatment groups. If necessary a suitable transformation for potential
      skewness in the distributions of measured volumes may be used (e.g., ANCOVA on ranks or log
      volumes). If ANCOVA shows a p value less than or equal to 0.10, then both the 100 mcg and 300
      mcg doses will be compared to placebo (p value less than or equal to 0.25). Dunnett's Test
      will be used to compare each dose group with placebo. Since each of the primary endpoints
      assesses a separate hypothesis regarding the effects of ROSE-010, no adjustment in the alpha
      level for testing multiple types of endpoints is anticipated, and a two-sided significance
      level of 0.05 will be used in each ANCOVA model.

      Analysis data sets

      The primary analyses will follow the intent to treat (ITT) paradigm with all patients
      randomized included in the analyses. Those patients with missing response values will have
      their missing values imputed via the overall (patients with non-missing data) mean and a
      corresponding adjustment in the ANCOVA residual error variance degrees of freedom
      (subtracting one for each missing value imputed). Safety data will be presented for all
      patients receiving investigational product.

    <measure>Colonic Transit, Colonic Geometric Center at 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours (Visit 3 = Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Between Postprandial and Fasting Whole Gastric Volume by Technetium-99m (99mTc)-SPECT Imaging (Gastric Accommodation)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 1 hour after 99mTC injection, approximately 30 min after liquid meal (Visit 5 = approximately 2-10 days after Visit 4)</time_frame>
    <description>A noninvasive SPECT method was used to measure gastric volume during fasting and 32 min after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was giving by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication was given s.c. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans were obtained. Each scan required 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content. For this outcome measure, the scans for the &quot;fasting volume&quot; and 2 &quot;postprandial volumes&quot; were used. The 2 postprandial (PP) volumes were averaged. Change was calculated as (PP - Fasting = gastric accommodation).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Half Time (t1/2) of Gastric Emptying of Solids Measured by Scintigraphy (Gastric Transit)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 2 hours after radiolabeled meal is ingested (Visit 2 = Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Half time (t1/2) of gastric emptying (GE) of solids is the time for half of the ingested solids or liquids to leave the stomach. The scintigraphy for GE t1/2 was done on Visit 2 (Day 0 of the study), the first day of scintigraphy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric Residual at 2 and 4 Hours Measured by Scintigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours, 4 hours (Visit 2 = Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The gastric residual will be calculated as the proportion of isotope remaining in the stomach (at 2 and 4 hours).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colonic Geometric Center at 4 h Measured by Scintigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours (Visit 2 = Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool. (Note: when there is no radio isotope in the colon (e.g., at 4 hours) the geometric center values are recorded as &quot;zero,&quot; thus the mean values can be less than one.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colonic Filling at 6 h Measured by Scintigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours (Visit 2 = Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of the radio-labeled meal that reached the colon at 6 hours, indirectly reflecting small bowel transit time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ascending Colon Emptying Half-time (AC t1/2) Measured by Scintigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours (Visit 4 = Day 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Ascending colon emptying half-time will be estimated by power exponential analysis of the proportionate emptying over time of counts from the colon. The primary data for this analysis will be the proportion of decay and depth-corrected counts in the ascending colon on the hourly scans on the first day of transit measurement and the 48 hour data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colonic Transit, Colonic Geometric Center at 48 h Measured by Scintigraphy, as Compared to Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours (Visit 4 = Day 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>screening visit (Visit 1), 34 days (Visit 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Stool frequency was self reported in a Bowel Pattern Diary. The bowel pattern diary was dispensed at the screening visit, and the completed bowel pattern diary was collected at the completion of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool Consistency Post Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>34 days (Visit 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects rated their stool consistency using the 7-point Bristol Stool Scale. The Bristol Stool Scale is a medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories or types. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation with 3 and 4 being the &quot;ideal stools&quot; especially the latter, as they are the easiest to defecate, and 5-7 tending towards diarrhea. The Bristol stool form was part of the bowel pattern diary, which was dispensed at the screening visit, and the completed bowel pattern diary was collected at the completion of the study.</description>

        <title>Colonic Transit, Colonic Geometric Center at 24 Hours</title>
        <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>

        <title>Change Between Postprandial and Fasting Whole Gastric Volume by Technetium-99m (99mTc)-SPECT Imaging (Gastric Accommodation)</title>
        <description>A noninvasive SPECT method was used to measure gastric volume during fasting and 32 min after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was giving by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication was given s.c. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans were obtained. Each scan required 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content. For this outcome measure, the scans for the &quot;fasting volume&quot; and 2 &quot;postprandial volumes&quot; were used. The 2 postprandial (PP) volumes were averaged. Change was calculated as (PP - Fasting = gastric accommodation).</description>

          <title>Change Between Postprandial and Fasting Whole Gastric Volume by Technetium-99m (99mTc)-SPECT Imaging (Gastric Accommodation)</title>
          <description>A noninvasive SPECT method was used to measure gastric volume during fasting and 32 min after a liquid nutritional supplement meal. Subjects reported to the clinic after an overnight fast. 99mTC was giving by an intravenous injection in the forearm. The first fasting scan was obtained, and the study medication was given s.c. After 10 min, a 2nd fasting post medication scan was obtained, and the meal consumed; then two serial postprandial scans were obtained. Each scan required 9-12 min. Tomographic images of the gastric wall were obtained throughout the long axis of the stomach using a dual-head gamma camera that rotates around the body. This allows assessment of the radiolabeled circumference of the gastric wall, rather than the intragastric content. For this outcome measure, the scans for the &quot;fasting volume&quot; and 2 &quot;postprandial volumes&quot; were used. The 2 postprandial (PP) volumes were averaged. Change was calculated as (PP - Fasting = gastric accommodation).</description>

        <title>Colonic Geometric Center at 4 h Measured by Scintigraphy</title>
        <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool. (Note: when there is no radio isotope in the colon (e.g., at 4 hours) the geometric center values are recorded as &quot;zero,&quot; thus the mean values can be less than one.)</description>

        <title>Ascending Colon Emptying Half-time (AC t1/2) Measured by Scintigraphy</title>
        <description>Ascending colon emptying half-time will be estimated by power exponential analysis of the proportionate emptying over time of counts from the colon. The primary data for this analysis will be the proportion of decay and depth-corrected counts in the ascending colon on the hourly scans on the first day of transit measurement and the 48 hour data.</description>

        <title>Colonic Transit, Colonic Geometric Center at 48 h Measured by Scintigraphy, as Compared to Placebo.</title>
        <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>

        <title>Stool Consistency Post Treatment</title>
        <description>The subjects rated their stool consistency using the 7-point Bristol Stool Scale. The Bristol Stool Scale is a medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories or types. Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation with 3 and 4 being the &quot;ideal stools&quot; especially the latter, as they are the easiest to defecate, and 5-7 tending towards diarrhea. The Bristol stool form was part of the bowel pattern diary, which was dispensed at the screening visit, and the completed bowel pattern diary was collected at the completion of the study.</description>
