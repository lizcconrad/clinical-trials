  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the overall safety and continued efficacy of oral lixivaptan capsules in subjects
      with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I and Phase II clinical trials have demonstrated that lixivaptan may play an important
      role in treating hyponatremia and the signs and symptoms of water retention associated with
      HF, LCWA and SIADH. Lixivaptan was previously evaluated in disease states characterized by
      hyponatremia with euvolemia (SIADH) and hyponatremia combined with fluid overload (HF, LCWA).
      Lixivaptan demonstrated correction in serum sodium concentration together with marked
      aquaresis in patients with hyponatremia.
