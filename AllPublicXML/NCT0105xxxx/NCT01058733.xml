      Background

        -  Various kinds of interactive online communication systems have been introduced for
           long-term diabetes management, and their importance in managing patients is increasing.
           The investigators investigated the amount of physician time needed to maintain such a
           system, and the investigators developed software to maximise the cost effectiveness.

      Methods

        -  The investigators conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled trial to investigate
           the efficacy and safety of a semi-automatic response system (SARS) for online glucose
           monitoring over a 24-week period of patients with type 2 diabetes. In the SARS group,
           the &quot;SARS&quot; software filtered the recorded self-monitoring of blood glucose data
           automatically to reduce the physicians' time, and the physicians managed patients
           regularly but only manually in the control (manual) group. The investigators measured
           the time spent by the physicians for online management and compared the HbA1c levels at
           enrolment and follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  men or women aged 20-70 years with type 2 diabetes

          -  lasting more than one year who had used the online communication system for diabetes
             management at the web site https://www.bi odang.com for more than six months

          -  baseline HbA1c level was 6-10%

          -  Patients who able and willing to complete glucose-monitoring diaries on a web chart as
             instructed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who required intensive insulin therapy (multiple insulin injections or
             insulin pump therapy) or who were unwilling to use self-monitoring of blood glucose
             (SMBG)

          -  acute metabolic complications of diabetes (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar
             non-ketotic hyperglycaemia, lactic acidosis)

          -  serum creatinine concentration &gt;2.0 mg/dl at screening

          -  acute illness, chronic infection, heart failure of NYHA Class III or IV

          -  recent myocardial infarction or stroke during the past six months

          -  pregnancy or GDM, or any other factor likely to limit protocol compliance or reporting
             of adverse events
