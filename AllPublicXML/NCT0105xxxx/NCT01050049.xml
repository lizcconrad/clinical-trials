  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if the implementation of guidelines utilizing
      immediate CT Perfusion and CT Angiography in addition to non-contrast CT alters (reduces or
      increases) the time to decision-making for or against rt-PA in acute ischemic stroke, and by
      extension, time to therapy in treated patients and time to transfer from the department for
      all patients. A secondary objective is to determine if using CTP/CTA-inclusive hyperacute
      stroke guidelines improves safety by decreasing symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and
      mortality in patients who receive rt-PA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting to the emergency Signs and symptoms of acute ischemic stroke:
             impairment of language, motor function, cognition and/or gaze, vision or neglect.

          -  Patients with an NIH Stroke Scale score &gt; 4

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 19

          -  Patient symptomatic for greater than five hours. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy must
             be instituted within three hours of symptom onset in order to minimize the risk of
             Intracerebral or symptomatic hemorrhage; other interventions such as intra-arterial
             thrombolytic therapy and clot retrieval allow for a six-hour window. One hour is an
             achievable time for arrival to institution of therapy, therefore a five-hour limit on
             enrollment allows the greatest number of patients the possibility of therapy.

          -  Inability to verify a clear onset of symptoms. As noted, time elapsed since the
             patient's last known baseline state is correlated to Intracerebral and symptomatic
             hemorrhage, and therapy is approved only for patients with a clear time of onset.
