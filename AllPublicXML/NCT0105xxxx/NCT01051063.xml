  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical activity and safety of a WT1
      Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (WT1 ASCI) as post-induction therapy in adult
      patients with WT1-positive AML presenting a suboptimal clinical response to induction
      chemotherapy. The study will also assess whether this treatment induces a specific immune
      response to the malignancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 40 patients will be enrolled in this study, divided in two cohorts of 20 patients
      each. One cohort will include patients in partial remission after induction therapy and one
      cohort will include patients in complete remission but with incomplete blood count recovery.
      Patients in both cohorts will receive the same study treatment according to the same
      administration schedule.

      This protocol summary has been updated according to the Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 10 Sept
      2014).

      All active follow-up visits and procedures after the concluding visit, 30 days after the last
      treatment administration, will be stopped In addition, no more biological samples will be
      collected for protocol research purposes. For each biological sample already collected in the
      scope of this study and not tested yet, testing will not be performed by default, except if a
      scientific rationale remains relevant.Blood sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol
      will continue.
