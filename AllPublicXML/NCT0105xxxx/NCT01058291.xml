  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover comparative study of KW-6500 in
      Parkinson's disease patients with motor response complications on levodopa therapy. The
      efficacy of KW-6500 is evaluated using the change of UPDRS part III score at double blind
      period after 12 weeks subcutaneous self-injections.
