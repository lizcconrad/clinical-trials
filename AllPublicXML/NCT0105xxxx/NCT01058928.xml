    <textblock>
      Fluid leak around the cuff is minimized when the endotracheal tube size is small relative to
      the size of the trachea. In the current study, the investigators assess the influence of
      different HVLP endotracheal tube size on fluid leakage around the cuff in a benchtop model
      and in anesthetized patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of a high-volume and low-pressure (HVLP) endotracheal cuff has reduced the
      cuff-induced tracheal damage because the cuff conforms passively to tracheal contours as it
      expands during inflation and the cuff inflation pressure is assumed to be equal to
      cuff-to-trachea pressure. However, longitudinal folds of a HVLP cuff occur on inflation
      within the trachea, as the diameter of the cuff is greater than that of the trachea, and
      these folds provide channels for an aspiration or gas leakage.

      Silent aspiration of upper airway secretions has been reported in patients undergoing general
      anesthesia and in the intensive care unit (ICU). A previous study reported the 83% aspiration
      of subglottic dye detected by bronchoscopy in anesthetized patients, and other study of
      intubated patients with HVLP cuffs in the ICU showed 87% aspiration rate.

      Intubation-related (ventilator associated pneumonia) pneumonia is a leading cause of
      prolongation of hospital stay, mortality and morbidity during the postoperative period and in
      the ICU. Therefore, it is important to achieve a better seal around the cuff without tracheal
      damage, which would reduce the incidence of pneumonia in intubated patients.

      A previous benchtop study demonstrated that the leak around the cuff is minimized when the
      endotracheal tube size is small relative to the size of the trachea. In the current study, we
      assess the influence of different HVLP endotracheal tube size on fluid leakage around the
      cuff in a benchtop model and in anesthetized patients.

    <description>One milliliter of Evans blue diluted in 3.5 mL of saline solution is carefully instilled on the top of the tracheal tube cuff. In the operating room, one hour and five hours after intubation, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed to detect the possible presence of blue dye in the trachea. If a blue spot was seen on the trachea caudal to the tube's tip on any occasion, leakage was confirmed and the experiment was finished.</description>
