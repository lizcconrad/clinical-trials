      The 'Analysis of Emergency Department Volumes during Natural Disasters' retrospective study
      focuses on three specified populations including dialysis patients, trauma patients, and
      patients poisoned by carbon monoxide. These three populations have one commonality -
      hurricanes, ie. natural disasters, which is the exposure. Causal associations and significant
      correlations will be explored in all three subgroups.
