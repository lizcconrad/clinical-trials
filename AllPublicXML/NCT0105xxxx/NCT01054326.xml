  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare two different post-surgical
      rehabilitation strategies, Rehabilitation supervised by a physical therapist including
      exercises with progressive early activation of the rotator cuff versus basic home exercises
      regarding shoulder function, pain, health related quality of life and return to work after
      arthroscopic subacromial decompression.

      Patients scheduled for surgery (arthroscopic subacromial decompression)and in the age 25-65
      were offered to participate in the study. After surgery they were randomized to either
      Supervised Physical therapy with early activation of the rotator cuff (PT-group) or to home
      exercises (H-group). Patients in the PT group met the physical therapist twice a week for
      exercises and in between these visits they did their exercises at home daily. The H-group did
      home exercises daily. Shoulder function and pain(primary outcomes)and health related quality
      of life, returning to work(secondary outcomes)were assessed before surgery, one week
      after(baseline), 1,2,3 and 6 months after surgery by an independent physical therapist.
