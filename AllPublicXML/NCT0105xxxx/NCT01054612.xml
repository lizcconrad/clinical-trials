  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no technique to produce thin (0.004-0.01 mm) serial sections of large
      fresh tissue specimens that are suitable for high-resolution in situ protein/gene expression
      studies without ice artifact or fixation-induced molecular damage. Traditional frozen
      sectioning preserves protein and nucleic acid structure, but the inherent ice artifact
      precludes reconstruction of protein and mRNA expression patterns in 3-dimensions. Since the
      limitations of the existing sectioning techniques result from the fact that they rely on
      mechanical cutting which in turn require the tissue to be stiff, we suggest a new approach to
      cut tissue via an electro erosion process that utilizes focus radio frequency (RF).

    <description>Focused RF energy can be used to produce consecutive thin sections of fresh tissue for immunohistochemical and nucleic acids analysis by electro-dissociation without thermal damage, ultimately allowing high resolution reconstruction of gene and protein expression patterns of large tissue specimens in 3D.</description>
