  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a concentrate containing both FVIII and von
      Willebrand Factor (VWF) given at a high dose will induce immune tolerance in subjects who
      have already experienced and failed ITI with VWF-free FVIII concentrates. The treatment on
      this study is expected to last up to 33 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of Factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor prevents FVIII infusions from working properly
      and makes treatment of bleeding episodes very difficult. Having an inhibitor is a serious and
      life-threatening complication in patients with Hemophilia. The usual treatment of patients
      with FVIII inhibitors involves what is called &quot;immune tolerance induction&quot; (ITI). Immune
      Tolerance means that the body can accept infused FVIII and that FVIII is again effective in
      controlling bleeds. ITI involves giving high doses of FVIII regularly until the inhibitor
      disappears. This treatment is not always effective. The inhibitor persists in about 1 in 5
      patients who undergo ITI.

      There are 2 types of FVIII concentrates: FVIII concentrates derived from human plasma, which
      contain VWF, and concentrates of FVIII without VWF. Both types of concentrates are commonly
      used to induce immune tolerance in patients with Hemophilia A. Retrospective studies on
      subjects who were treated with VWF containing Factor VIII concentrates after failing ITI with
      pure factor VIII concentrates, have shown that tolerance can be achieved in a large
      percentage of patients. This study will access prospectively whether treatment with a FVIII
      concentrate containing VWF given at a high dose (200 units per kilogram) daily for up to 33
      months is able to induce immune tolerance after previous attempts with concentrates
      containing only FVIII have failed.
