    <textblock>
      In this project, UCLA's Center for Community Health (CCH) will develop an efficacious
      intervention trial integrating both individual and structural components to reduce HIV-
      related stigma among service providers in China and therefore benefit people living with
      HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).

      The purpose of this study is to develop a feasible, practical and low cost intervention
      strategy that will prevent and/or reduce the negative effects of HIV-related stigma among
      health service providers in China.

      This project will be conducted in two provinces and proceed in two phases. In Phase 1,
      confidential focus groups will take place with small samples of service providers and
      hospital administrators to finalize the intervention activities, and the investigators will
      also test and finalize the Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) assessment measures
      and implementation procedures with the same group of service providers. During Phase 1 a
      small sample of patients will anonymously test the paper-pencil baseline survey. Equal number
      of samples will be selected from two counties of each province. The findings from Phase 1
      will be used to develop intervention, and revise assessment for Phase 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV is a serious problem and HIV-related stigma in the medical setting is impeding every step
      in the battle against HIV in China. The number of annual reported HIV infections in China has
      increased steadily. The proposed study will be the first randomized controlled intervention
      trial that specifically targets stigma and access to universal precautions in medical
      settings, and is implemented at multiple sites in Yunnan and Fujian. Among the two target
      provinces, Yunnan has the highest number of reported HIV infections in China whereas Fujian
      is one of the provinces reporting the lowest HIV prevalence rate in China. With the trial
      implemented in Yunnan and Fujian Provinces simultaneously, we will examine the program's
      efficacy in two provinces that vary dramatically in HIV prevalence and infection routes. We
      propose to include two provinces that represent China as a whole, due to the varied HIV rates
      and infection routes in diverse regions; thus allowing us to disentangle the relations among
      HIV-related stigma, fear of infection, and HIV prevalence.

      Specific Aim 1: To examine whether providers in the intervention hospitals, compared to
      providers in the standard care condition, will demonstrate positive attitudinal outcomes,
      including an increase in comfort in working with PLH and a decrease in unrealistic fear of
      infection at work, prejudicial attitudes, and support of coercive policies.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine whether providers in the intervention hospitals, compared to
      providers in the standard care condition, will demonstrate more positive behavioral outcomes,
      including an increase in adherence to universal precaution, routine treatment and referrals,
      confidentiality protection, diffusion of positive messages with co-workers, and a decrease in
      critical incidents.

      Specific Aim 3: To explore whether patients in the intervention hospitals, compared to
      patients at hospitals in the standard care condition, will report a decreased level of
      perceived unfair treatment and increased service satisfaction, service utilization, and
      treatment adherence.
