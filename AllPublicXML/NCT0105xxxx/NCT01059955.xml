  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an initial clinical trial evaluating whether different doses of iontophoresis for
      delivery of dexamethasone phosphate can be tolerated by eyes of patients with non-infections,
      non-necrotizing scleritis. A secondary goal is to get preliminary information about whether
      the treatment is likely to be an effective treatment for scleritis. If the results are
      favorable, further trials evaluating the treatment may be pursued.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female age at least 18 years

          2. A diagnosis of active non-infectious, non-necrotizing anterior scleritis (nodular or
             diffuse is acceptable)

          3. Not planning to undergo elective ocular surgery during the study

          4. Provide written informed consent

          5. Be able and willing to follow instructions, return for all study visits, and willing
             to comply with all study-related instructions

          6. If female and of childbearing potential; submit a urine sample and have a negative
             pregnancy test at Visit 1; agree to use an acceptable method of contraception during
             the study. A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless she is surgically
             sterile (hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or is post-menopausal (has not had a
             menstrual cycle for &gt;2 years or has laboratory evidence of a post-menopausal state).
             Acceptable methods of contraception include: spermicide with barrier, hormonal
             contraception, IUD, or surgical sterilization of partner. Complete abstinence
             throughout the study period also is acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications to the use of the test articles

          2. Known allergy or sensitivity to any medication used in this study, including the study
             medication or its components (e.g., corticosteroids)

          3. For patients not taking systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, any condition
             constituting conferring a likelihood that systemic corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressants would need to be started during the 56-day study period

          4. For patients already taking systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, any
             condition conferring a likelihood that systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressant
             dosage would need to be changed during the 56-day study period

          5. Intraocular pressure high enough that intraocular pressure-lowering medications are
             likely to be needed (â‰¥25 mmHg or IOP&gt;target pressure for patients with glaucoma);
             and/or more than two ocular anti-hypertensive medications (prior IOP-lowering surgery
             is acceptable; combinations of two agents such as Cosopt or Combigan are considered
             two medications)

          6. Glaucoma sufficiently advanced that an intraocular pressure spike would potentially
             put the patient at substantial risk of vision loss, per the clinician-investigator's
             judgment.

          7. Cancer

          8. Subject is planning to undergo elective surgery during the study period

          9. Any active ocular infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal), active ocular inflammation
             other than scleritis (i.e., follicular conjunctivitis, iritis), or preauricular
             lymphadenopathy

         10. History or diagnosis of ocular herpes or corneal lesion of suspected herpetic origin

         11. Severe eyelid or ocular surface lesions impeding application of the iontophoresis
             applicator

         12. Severe / serious ocular pathology or medical condition which may preclude study
             completion

         13. Any condition conferring a likelihood that topical ophthalmic medications in use at
             baseline would need to be changed during the 56-day study period.

         14. History of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or mucous membrane pemphigoid

         15. Unwilling to discontinue use of contact lenses for the duration of the study

         16. Any open wounds / skin disease on the forehead where the iontophoresis return
             electrode will be applied

         17. Pacemakers and/or any other electrical sensitive support system

         18. Any significant illness or condition that could, in the investigator's or
             sub-investigator's opinion, be expected to interfere with the study parameters or
             study conduct; or put the subject at significant risk

         19. Be currently pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy; or woman who has a positive
             pregnancy test

         20. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days of entering
             the study
