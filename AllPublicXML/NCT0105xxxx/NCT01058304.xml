    <textblock>
      Pain management is a priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system,
      and knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a main cause of chronic pain. Veterans who receive care
      within the VA health care system have higher rates and more severe OA than both the general
      population of adults and veterans who receive health care elsewhere. Physical therapy (PT) is
      a primary part of treatment for knee OA, but in the VA health care system PT appointments are
      a limited resource, and veterans often do not receive enough visits to promote long-term
      improvements in pain and physical function. New models of delivery, such as the group-based
      approach examined in this study, are needed to expand PT services in a cost-effective manner.

    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common health problems and a leading cause of
      disability among veterans. Physical therapy (PT) and ongoing exercise are associated with
      reduced pain and improved physical function among patients with knee OA, yet the majority of
      veterans with OA are physically inactive. Furthermore, PT services are a limited resource in
      the VA health care system, with demand exceeding supply. VA patients with knee OA generally
      receive only one or two PT visits. Prior research indicates this amount of clinical contact
      time is not sufficient to provide patients with the assessment, instruction, and support
      needed to adopt and maintain an exercise program, particularly in the context of a chronic
      pain condition. Therefore development, testing, and implementation of mechanisms to
      cost-effectively expand PT services for knee OA may play a key role in improving pain and
      other outcomes in this large group of veterans. This research examines a group-based approach
      to delivering PT for knee OA, which can extend services to more veterans, for a greater
      number of sessions per veteran, at lower staffing costs. The objective of this study is to
      compare the effectiveness of a group-based PT program for knee OA with usual individual PT
      care for knee OA.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week, group-based PT program among
      N=320 veterans with symptomatic knee OA at the Durham VA Medical Center (VAMC). Participants
      will be randomly assigned to the group-based PT program or individual PT (usual care). The
      group PT arm will include 6 1-hour visits (every other week) led by a physical therapist and
      exercise physiologist or physical therapy assistant, with 8 participants per group. The
      individual PT arm, modeled after typical PT care for knee OA at the Durham VAMC and other
      health care settings, will include 2 1-hour visits with a physical therapist, 2-3 weeks
      apart. The group PT sessions will include group instruction in joint care (activity pacing
      and joint projection), group discussion of exercise successes and barriers, group exercise,
      and scheduled individual consultations with the physical therapist (2 per participant, 15-20
      minutes each) to address specific functional and therapeutic needs. While the individual PT
      sessions will differ in structure, they will include the same informational, assessment, and
      therapeutic content as the group sessions. Both groups will be given instructions for the
      same home exercise program. The primary outcome for this study will be the Western Ontario
      and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The secondary outcome will be
      objectively assessed physical function (Short Physical Performance Test Protocol). These
      outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 12-week follow-up. The WOMAC will also be assessed
      via telephone at 24-week follow-up to examine whether any observed intervention effects are
      maintained. Mixed linear models will be used to compare outcomes for the two study arms. We
      will also conduct an economic analysis of the group-based PT program.

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC is a measure of lower extremity pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and function (17 items). All items are rated on a Likert scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms). The total score ranges from 0-96, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms.
Note that the baseline mean is a common baseline mean generated from the mixed model used for the primary study analysis. The raw mean for this outcome, overall and by study group, is presented in the table of baseline participant characteristics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This battery of objective physical function tests examines participants' balance (3 tests), gait speed (8-foot walk), and time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position five times. For each test, the possible range if scores is 0-4, for a total range of 0-20 for all five tests, with higher scores indicating better function.
Note that the baseline mean is a common baseline mean generated from the mixed model used for the primary study analysis. The raw mean for this outcome, overall and by study group, is presented in the table of baseline participant characteristics.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Because the target recruitment goal could not be met, a new sample size target was calculated, with a goal of being able to detect an effect size of 0.35. This translated into a target of n=226, which we exceeded by enrolling n=320.</limitations_and_caveats>
