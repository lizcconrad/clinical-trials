  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lithium salts have been used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders for over five
      decades, mostly as a mood-stabilizing drug. Recent evidence points to the inhibition of the
      enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3) as one of its mechanisms of action. The
      overactivity of this enzyme has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), given its involvement in mechanisms related to the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein
      and the production of beta-amyloid peptide. These are key events leading respectively to the
      formation of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, which are the neuropathological
      hallmarks of the disease. Several in vitro and animal studies have shown that the inhibition
      of GSK3 by lithium and other agents attenuates these pathological processes, reinforcing the
      notion that GSK3 is a likely target for future disease-modifying therapies for AD. Indeed, a
      recent study published by our group showed that chronic lithium use is associated with a
      decrement in the expected prevalence of dementia, in a sample of elderly individuals with
      bipolar disorder. To investigate this putative neuroprotective effect in a prospective way,
      the investigators started 24-month randomized, double-blinded controlled trial of lithium for
      the prevention of dementia in a sample of elderly individuals with amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI), a condition associated with increased risk for the development of AD. The
      clinical and biological outcomes of this trial include the attenuation of cognitive deficits,
      and the modification of certain biological markers of the disease (as measured in the
      cerebrospinal fluid, leukocytes and platelets). The objective of the present application is
      to enable the extension of this ongoing trial to an additional 2-year follow-up. A longer
      follow-up (48 months) will increase the statistical power to ascertain the primary outcome
      variables of this study, particularly the con-version from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. This
      will warrant a more consistent conclusion about the potential of lithium treatment in the
      prevention of dementia, in addition to a better evaluation of safety and tolerability
      profiles of the long-term use of lithium in older individuals.

    <description>Patients received low doses of lithium salts (from 150 mg to 450 mg of lithium salts daily) to achieve sub-therapeutic lithium levels (target serum lithium level of 0,25 - 0,5 mEq/L). Lithium doses were administered twice a day. Lithium doses were titrated to achieve the target serum lithium levels within the first two weeks after study recruitment. After achieving the target serum lithium level, lithium salts doses remained stable until the end of the study.</description>
