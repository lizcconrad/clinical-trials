      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such
      as bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Selective estrogen
      receptor modulators, such as raloxifene, may work together with bicalutamide to stop the
      growth of prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies giving bicalutamide and raloxifene together in treating
      patients with metastatic or hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the 6-month progression-free survival rate, progression-free survival, and
      overall survival of patients receiving bicalutamide and raloxifene.

      II. To describe the adverse event profile of combined treatment with bicalutamide and
      raloxifene (adverse events graded using the NCI CTCAE version 3.0).

      III. To describe the quality of life of patients receiving bicalutamide and raloxifene.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral bicalutamide and oral raloxifene on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.

          -  Progression of measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior to registration;
             progression of non-measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior to registration;
             patients with rising PSA must demonstrate a rising trend with two successive
             elevations at a minimum interval of two weeks

          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated; if the method of castration
             is LHRH agonists (leuprolide or goserelin) or LHRH antagonists, then the patient
             should be willing to continue the use of LHRH agonists; castration using LHRH agonist
             should not be interrupted and patients who have stopped treatment should be willing to
             restart
