  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between the method of the treatment of hyperthyroidism due to Graves'
      disease and the course of Graves' ophthalmopathy is debated. The investigators aimed to
      compare the results of total thyroidectomy done in 6 months following the appearance of the
      symptoms of ophthalmopathy and the antithyroid drug therapy in patients with moderate to
      severe Graves' ophthalmopathy.

      The inclusion criteria: 1)Hyperthyroidism and moderate to severe Graves' ophthalmopathy
      within 6 months, 2)Thyroid volumes greater than or equal to 15 mL in thyroid ultrasonography,
      3)Patients taking no treatment except local medications for Graves' ophthalmopathy,
      4)Clinical activity score of 3/7 or more, proptosis greater than or equal to 21 mm in one eye
      or 2 mm difference between two eyes, presence of diplopia, the opening of the eye lid greater
      than or equal to 9 mm.

      All patients will be treated with antithyroid drug until TSH levels of the patients are
      between 0.4-1. During this period all the patients will take pulse methyl prednisolone
      treatment of a total dose of 4.5 gr. After pulse steroid treatment the patients will be
      randomised to two groups: one group will be sent to surgery for total thyroidectomy, and
      their TSH levels will be kept between 0.4-1 with levothyroxine treatment; the other group
      will be followed under antithyroid drug treatment and their TSH levels will be kept between
      0.4-1 also.

      The smoking habits will be asked. Serum TSH, fT4 levels, Hertelmeter and eye lid opening
      measurements, clinical activity scores, diplopia will be evaluated monthly; TSH receptor
      antibody, anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin levels will be measured in 3 months
      intervals for a period of 12 months.
