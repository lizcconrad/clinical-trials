             therapy exist OR patients locoregionally recurrent melanoma (including local
             metastases, in transit metastases and satellitosis) where surgery is not the best
             therapeutic option.

          -  Must be able and willing to provide written informed consent.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Female subjects must be of non-child-bearing potential or using appropriate
             contraception.

          -  Positive test for cell mediated immunity.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless treatment was completed at least 4
             weeks before entry and stable without steroid treatment for at least 4 weeks.

          -  Previous immunotherapy (except IL-2 or interferon-based therapy) for melanoma.

          -  Serum bilirubin ≥1.2 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  In absence of metastases, liver transaminase levels greater than 1.5 times the upper
             limit of normal.

          -  If metastases are evident, liver transaminase levels 2.5 times the upper limit of
             normal will be acceptable.

          -  Inadequate renal function.

          -  Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases.

          -  Unresolved toxicity ≥CTC Grade 2 from previous anti-cancer therapy except alopecia (if
             applicable) unless agreed that the patient can be entered after discussion with the
             Medical Monitor.

          -  Participation in a trial of an investigational agent within the prior 30 days.

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids within 4 weeks of screening.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding females.
