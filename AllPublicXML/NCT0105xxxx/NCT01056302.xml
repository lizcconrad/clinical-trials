  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to develop a computer-based software tool that will allow surgeons to
      plan and simulate surgery for patients with jaw trauma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed tool will allow surgeons from different specialties to simulate, plan and
      iterate on complex procedures based on individual patient data in 3-D from a CT scan. The
      software will allow surgeons to both see and feel the results of their interventions - for
      example, the quality of the bite or bone alignment of a reconstructed jaw following severe
      trauma - before the actual surgery, leading to better planning, fewer errors, shortened
      surgery time and improved outcomes for the patients. The purpose of this study is the
      evaluation of a visuohaptic planning system for mandibular trauma surgery that is based on
      interactive manipulation of CT data.

    <description>Patients will undergo whatever needed surgical repair of maxillofacial trauma that is necessary. Records such as CT imaging and plaster models of the jaws will be utilized in the standard way to plan and carry out the surgery. The CT scan will also be used within the visuohaptic computational environment to develop and evaluate the user interface. The amount of time taken to work up and plan surgery using standard surgical practice and using the computational platform will be compared. Real surgical outcome will be compared to the simulated outcome using the proposed software tool.</description>

        Study population will veterans who present to the Oral/Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic at the
        San Francisco VA Medical Center. The study will use pre-existing data from patients
        undergoing reconstructive facial surgery at the San Francisco VA with clinic indications
        that require preoperative CT scans and preoperative radiographs as well as model casts.
