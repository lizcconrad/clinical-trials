  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study for patients with solid tumors and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; for
      the Phase II part). L19-IL2 is a tumor targeted immunocytokine constituted of a single chain
      Fragment variable (scFv) format directed against the ED-B domain of fibronectin, one of the
      most important markers for neoangiogenesis, and the human cytokine interleukin-2 (IL2).

  <detailed_description>

      This is an open-label, non-randomised, multicentre, Phase I/II study to assess safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and early signs of activity of L19-IL2 monotherapy.

      In the first part of the study, there will be 5 dose escalation steps in sequential cohorts
      of patients with advanced solid tumours. In the second part of the study, patients with
      advanced RCC will be given a fixed dose of L19IL2 at the RD.

    <description>Route: i.v. infusion (60 min) Patients will receive a minimum of 2 cycles of treatment. Each cycle is comprised of treatment on Days 1, 3 and 5 followed by a 16 days rest (1 cycle= 21 days). Patients may receive up to 4 further cycles of treatment (max. of 6 cycles in total). Patients will be initially recruited into the study in cohorts of 3 and the starting dose of L19IL2 will be 5 Mio IU IL2 equivalent. Five steps of dose escalation are planned: 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 Mio IU IL2 equivalent). After the MTD has been established, the RD will be determined. A further 12 patients (with RCC) will receive the RD dose for a minimum of 2 cycles. For patients in the RD part of the study, patients can switch to maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy consists of 15 Mio IU IL2 every 2 weeks. The maximum duration of the study for a patient is 12 months.</description>
