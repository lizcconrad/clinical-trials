      The purpose of this study is to apply a recently developed screening test for dementia, the
      Memory Orientation Screening Test (MOST) to two additional groups. Group one is composed of
      150 elders who do not have dementia and are residing in the community so that we can
      determine what is a &quot;normal&quot; MOST score. These subjects will also be individually
      administered a one-hour battery composed of other commonly used tests of memory and
      information processing. Group two is composed of 150 elders who are administered the MOST by
      a nurse as part of their regular visit to the primary care doctor's office, and their scores
      will be compared against a rating of their cognitive ability made independently by the doctor
      or another nurse. Their scores will also be compared with a list of their medical problems
      and medications. Our hypothesis for the first group is that the MOST scores will be higher in
      the normal group than in the previous clinical groups and that MOST scores will correlate
      significantly with other neurocognitive tests. Our hypothesis for the second group is that
      the MOST can be administered quickly and easily by briefly trained nurses, that it will
      compare highly with doctor opinions, and that patients with known medical conditions related
      to dementia, such as hypertension or diabetes, will have lower MOST scores than patients in
      better health.
