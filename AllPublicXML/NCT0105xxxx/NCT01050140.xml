  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary consumption of fructose has increased by nearly 50% since 1960.

      A high fructose diet (HFrD) results in greater visceral adiposity and systemic insulin
      resistance than a high glucose diet. The effects of fructose on liver fatty acid and ATP
      stores, systemic oxidative stress and cardiovascular status are not fully known.

      The protocol will assess the following outcomes:

        1. The ultimate fate of this increased hepatic fatty acid production following a high
           fructose vs. glucose diet

        2. The effect of a high fructose vs. glucose diet on liver ATP stores

        3. The effect of a high fructose vs. glucose diet on markers of oxidative stress

        4. The effect of a high fructose vs. glucose diet on cardiovascular status

      Factors critical to carbohydrate metabolism such as systemic insulin resistance, body
      composition, energy expenditure, physical activity will also be assessed.

      32 centrally overweight healthy males with a low baseline fructose intake will be recruited.
      They will be randomised double blindly to receive 25% of their dietary energy requirements
      from either fructose or glucose for 14 days.

      The sugars will first be taken in an energy balanced and then an overfeeding setting.
