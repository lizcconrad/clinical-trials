  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In healthy subjects: Continuous monitoring of the glucose concentration in the skin by means
      of a non-invasive glucose sensor during a glucose clamp when systematically changing the
      blood glucose concentration (e.g. to hyperglycemia). Simultaneous frequent determinations of
      serum electrolytes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring is a promising approach in diabetes therapy. It is
      known that changes in glucose concentration in the skin can be registered by means of
      optical, spectroscopic measures in subjects with diabetes. The precision of such measures,
      however, so far has been unsatisfactory.

      This study evaluates the changes in skin glucose concentration by means of a non-invasive
      glucose sensor and compares these to blood glucose concentrations during a glucose clamp. It
      is also known that with hyperglycemic blood glucose concentrations there is a consecutive
      hyponatraemia. This study shall evaluate to which extent and how fast serum electrolyte
      parameters change when establishing a hyperglycaemic blood glucose level. This shall help
      estimate which impact these changes in electrolytes have on the non-invasive glucose sensor.

    <description>The automated glucose clamp technique was used to control glucose levels at baseline glycemia for 1h, hyperglycemia (16.7 mmol/L) for at least 2.5h and euglycemia (5 mmol/L) for another 2.5h. A continuous somatostatin infusion was initiated after 1h to suppress endogenous insulin secretion. A glucose solution was infused to increase the blood glucose towards the hyperglycemic target level. At approximately t=3.5h the somatostatin infusion was stopped and blood glucose was controlled at the euglycemic target level.</description>
