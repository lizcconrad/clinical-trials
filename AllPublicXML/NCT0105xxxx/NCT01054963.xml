  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory arthritis (IA) is a major cause of long-term disability. Peer support may be a
      solution to the common problem of delayed treatment. Early peer support may result in
      improved use of therapy, higher self-efficacy, reduced anxiety, and improved coping in the
      first two years post-diagnosis. This study involves the development and testing of a peer
      mentor training initiative as one part of an intervention study for people with early IA
      (EIA). Peer mentors will be trained and assessed to provide one-on-one support (information,
      emotional, feedback) to individuals who have recently been diagnosed with IA. This is one
      part of an intervention study. The other part is called Peer to Peer Mentoring: Facilitating
      Individuals with Early Inflammatory Arthritis to Manage their Arthritis - Peer Mentoring
      Program.

    <description>A quasi-experimental, before and after study design is proposed to obtain data for planning and implementing a larger-scale study. A training workshop for individuals with IA to become peer mentors will increase peer mentors' confidence and skills to provide one-on-one support to individuals with EIA. Using a combination of lectures, experiential learning and question/answer sessions, peer mentors will learn and practice informational, emotional, appraisal support techniques and skills (communication skills, problem-solving strategies, use of decision tools). Training will be conducted face-to-face, in small-group format by research team and others (2 sessions approx. 5 hours each), in a private meeting room at SHSC. Peer mentors will then provide support to individuals newly diagnosed with IA for 12 weeks (once per week) by telephone and /or face-to-face. Peer mentors will receive ongoing support from the research team (telephone, meetings).</description>
