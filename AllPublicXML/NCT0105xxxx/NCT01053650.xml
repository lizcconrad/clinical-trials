  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs in the world, indicated for the
      symptomatic treatment of fever and pain of mild to moderate. More precisely, it is a drug
      used to relieve pain and reduce fever. The objective of this study is to analyze whether a
      placebo effect occurs when you take paracetamol for pain, ie if the analgesic effect of
      paracetamol is partly due to the simple fact of taking a drug.

      Moreover, during the study you propose to do a saliva sample, optional, for biological
      research, pharmacogenetics, to assess how paracetamol is processed and eliminated in your
      body..
