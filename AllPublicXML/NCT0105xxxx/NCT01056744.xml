  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Safety concerns regarding use of drug eluting stent systems (DES) are related mostly to late
      stent thrombosis, which is facilitated by incomplete stent endothelial coverage. Specific
      information about time course and amount of endothelial strut coverage of different DES is
      required, in order to further refine the concept of antiplatelet therapy after DES
      implantation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is emerging as a new gold standard for
      endovascular imaging of stents, atherosclerosis progression, vulnerable plaque and neointimal
      proliferation. Very limited OCT data about endothelial coverage of DES are currently
      available. Aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of XIENCE V® everolimus eluting
      stent (Abbot Vascular) and of the bare metal stent (BMS) Coroflex® Blue postdilated with the
      drug-eluting balloon (DEB) SeQuent® Please (paclitaxel-eluting balloon, B. Braun Melsungen
      AG) in terms of endothelial coverage and neointimal proliferation using OCT.

      Study Design:

      A number of 80 patients scheduled for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with
      a native coronary stenosis suitable for DES implantation and OCT imaging are openly
      randomized 1:1 to either XIENCE V® or Coroflex® Blue/Sequent® Please. The study is
      prospectively conducted at a university high-volume PCI center with OCT expertise (Jena,
      Germany). Angiographic follow-up and OCT imaging with motorized pull-back at 1 mm/s are
      planned in all patients 6 months after implantation of the study stents. OCT endpoints are:
      (1) endothelial coverage, expressed as % of struts without coverage and % of stent length
      containing non-covered struts, and respectively (2) neointimal proliferation, given as %
      neointimal volumetric proliferation within the whole stent and also as focal peak %
      neointimal area proliferation. The study is not powered for clinical endpoints, which are:
      subacute or late stent thrombosis and need for revascularization of the stent segment. Given
      the high number of measurements (15 cross-section images / 1 mm stent length), OCT endpoints
      are likely to reach significance at the level P &lt; 0.05 even at a follow-up drop-out rate up
      to 20%.
