    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed or recurrent patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer with
             either squamous or adenocarcinoma histology.

          -  Ability to tolerate PET imaging

          -  Prior malignancy is allowed, but the expectation of survival must be that beyond that
             expected for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating females are not eligible for this pilot study.

          -  Patients having received chemotherapy in the 3 months prior to registration for any
             reason

          -  Patients with metastatic disease requiring chemoradiation for palliation are not
             allowed.
