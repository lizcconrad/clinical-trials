  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurogenic intermittent claudication is a specific symptom complex occurring in patients with
      lumbar spinal stenosis. Characteristic of this disease is the occurrence of increasing leg,
      buttock or groin pain with or without lower back pain when walking a certain distance or
      reclining. Bending forward or sitting leads to a rapid pain relief. Lumbar spinal stenosis is
      defined as a reduction of the diameter of the spinal canal. The mechanism leading to stenosis
      is a remodeling and overgrowth of the spinal canal with osteophyte formation. Any loss of
      tissue or decrease of the disc height results in a relative laxity of the ligament structures
      and accelerates the degeneration of the spinal joints. As a therapy option, conservative
      therapy with oral analgesics and physical therapy is considered. This treatment can be
      intensified by adding epidural pain treatment. Is the conservative treatment not successful
      surgical intervention is necessary. In patients over 65 years of age operative decompression
      of the lumbar spinal stenosis constitutes the most common surgical operation of the spine. A
      relatively new therapy alternative is the interspinous process decompression (IPD). Studies
      have shown that the IPDs prevent narrowing of the spinal canal and neural foramens. The study
      is intended as a randomised, monocentre study to investigate the safety and the benefit of a
      minimally invasive percutaneous IPD-device in comparison with the best non-surgical operative
      treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.

    <description>The control group will receive at least physiotherapy and physical therapy (e.g. massage and fango). Under inpatient conditions therapy will last for seven days. After discharge physical therapy has to be continued for 5 weeks. A schedule will ensure the consistency of the physical therapy. The inpatient-treatment can be repeated every 6 months if necessary.</description>
