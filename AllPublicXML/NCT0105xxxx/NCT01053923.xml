  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a prospective database of anal canal and perianal
      cancer patients treated with IMRT and chemotherapy with curative intent at PMH for the
      purposes of investigating MRI-derived primary tumor parameters. Patients who decide to
      participate in this study will be treated according to standard treatment policies and
      radiation therapy planning protocols at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) with radiation
      therapy +/- chemotherapy. IMRT for all treatment phases of radiotherapy has been implemented
      as standard treatment. Surgery is reserved for salvage treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anal cancer is an uncommon cancer, accounting for 2% of gastrointestinal cancers. Prognostic
      factors include tumor differentiation and staging, along with patient gender, race, and
      socioeconomic status. The standard of care is radical chemoradiation with 5-fluorouracil and
      mitomycin C, with surgery reserved for salvage. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      is a specialized radiotherapy technique that may be used for anal cancer. IMRT allows the
      radiation dose to conform to the three-dimensional shape of the target volume more than
      conventional two-dimensional techniques, and it may reduce treatment toxicities without
      compromising tumor control. At the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) since July 2007, IMRT for
      all treatment phases of radiotherapy has been implemented as standard treatment for patients
      with anal canal and perianal cancer.

    <description>This study involves three imaging sessions (Magnetic Nuclear Resonance -MRI), with one session before radiation therapy and two sessions during radiation therapy (one at 3 weeks of RT; the other during the last week of RT). Each imaging session will last for approximately 45 to 60 minutes.</description>
