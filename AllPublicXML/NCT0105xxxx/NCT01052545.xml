    <textblock>
      Overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is a quality, safety, and cost issue,
      particularly as unnecessary antibiotics lead to emergence of resistant pathogens. Our
      proposal to bring clinical practice in line with published guidelines has significant
      potential to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for ABU in the VA healthcare system, thus
      improving the quality and safety of veterans' healthcare. Our study will also provide
      important insights about how to implement and sustain evidence-based clinical practice within
      VA hospitals.

    <textblock>
      Anticipated Impacts on Veterans' Healthcare: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the single most
      common hospital-acquired infection. However, the majority of cases of nosocomial
      catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) are really asymptomatic bacteriuria
      (ABU). ABU is not a clinically significant condition, and treatment is unlikely to confer
      benefit. Overtreatment of ABU is a quality, safety, and cost issue, particularly as
      unnecessary antibiotics lead to emergence of resistant flora. Our proposal to bring clinical
      practice in line with published guidelines has significant potential to decrease CAUTI and
      associated inappropriate antibiotic use in VA hospitals. Our study will also provide
      information about how to maximize effectiveness of audit-feedback to achieve guideline
      adherence in the inpatient VA setting.

      Project Background/Rationale: Evidence-based guidelines recommend that providers neither
      screen for nor treat ABU in most catheterized patients. However, a significant gap between
      these guidelines and clinical practice has been documented at our VA hospital and throughout
      the world. Since many VA patients in both acute care settings and sub-acute care settings,
      such as intermediate and long-term care, have a legitimate need for a urinary catheter, the
      issue of overtreatment of catheter-associated ABU is an active problem for the VA.

      Project Objectives: We hypothesize that implementing the existing evidence-based guidelines
      about non-treatment of ABU will dramatically reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics to
      treat ABU and the incidence of incorrectly diagnosed CAUTI. Our first objective is to improve
      quality of care concerning ABU in terms of specific clinical outcomes (inappropriate
      screening for and treatment of ABU) through implementation of an audit-feedback strategy. We
      also hypothesize that successful implementation of an audit-feedback strategy will result in
      measurable changes in clinicians' knowledge and attitudes concerning ABU practice guidelines.
      Our second objective is to assess through surveys the effect of the implementation on
      clinicians' guideline awareness, familiarity, acceptance, and outcome expectancy.

      Project Methods: Our guidelines implementation strategy will employ audit-feedback, applied
      as a post-prescription antimicrobial review based on established guidelines. The study
      population for the clinical outcomes is all inpatients on certain wards at the intervention
      site (Houston VA) and the control site (San Antonio VA). Our study population for the
      audit-feedback intervention and surveys is the health care providers on these wards. We
      propose a 3-year study. During the first year we will observe the baseline incidence of
      inappropriate screening for and treatment of ABU at both sites. Blinded monitoring of
      clinical outcomes will continue during the next 2 years of the study. During the second year,
      we will distribute the guidelines at both sites. Clinicians at the intervention site will
      receive individualized feedback, either by telephone or in person, about whether their
      management of bacteriuria was guideline-compliant. Unit-level feedback will also be provided.
      During the third year, individualized feedback will cease, but unit-level feedback will
      continue as this constitutes a sustainable intervention. Clinicians will complete pre/post
      surveys of awareness, familiarity, acceptance, and outcome expectancy at the intervention
      site in year 2 and at both sites in year 3. Differences in outcomes between the
      individualized intervention in year 2 and the group-level intervention in year 3 will help to
      determine the necessary intensity of intervention for dissemination and implementation in
      other VA facilities.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Objective 1 (Clinical Outcomes), all inpatients at the MEDVAMC or STVHCS on the
             units of interest (medicine or ECL) during the 3 year period of the study will be
             included in the chart review process.

          -  For Objective 2, modifying health care provider knowledge and behavior through
             audit-feedback and surveys, we will attempt to involve all health care providers on
             rotation at the VA on the targeted wards during the study period.

          -  The audit-feedback intervention will be applied to the health care providers on the
             targeted wards who make the decision to treat CAUTI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For the chart review component, we want to capture all available data about the
             clinical outcomes during the study period.

               -  We will need to review the inpatient rosters on the wards of interest several
                  times per week to determine how many of the patients have urinary catheters, etc.

               -  We also wish to survey as many health care providers as possible who rotate on
                  the wards of interest during the study period.

               -  We anticipate that all health care providers who work at the VA hospital will be
                  competent to provide or refuse consent to participate.

The intervention was delivered to the providers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>From the bed days reviewed, we determined which patient had a positive urine culture that was associated with the presence of a urinary catheter. These cases were studied further to determine if antimicrobial use was compliant with guidelines or non-compliant.
