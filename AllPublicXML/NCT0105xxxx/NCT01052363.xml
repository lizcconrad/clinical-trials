        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed grade III Anaplastic
             gliomas (including anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and
             anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) or Grade IV Glioblastoma multiforme.

          2. Recurrence or progression after failing first line treatment of temozolomide
             chemotherapy and radiation. Patient who failed additional lines of treatment are
             eligible for participating in the trial. Patients must have measurable disease,
             defined as having contrast enhancing measurable disease on MRI of brain. Baseline MRI
             should be done no more than 2 weeks from starting treatment.

          3. At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy, 4 weeks if the last
             regimen included BCNU.

          4. Age greater than 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently
             available on the use of fosbretabulin in combination with bevacizumab in patients less
             than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          6. ECOG performance status 0-2 Karnofsky greater than 60%).

          7. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined.

          8. The effects of fosbretabulin on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because vascular disrupting agents
             as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,
             women of childâ€”bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant (including female
             partners of male study participants) or suspect she is pregnant while participating in
             this study, she should inform the Investigator and her treating physician immediately.

          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Patients with prior treatment using bevacizumab.

          3. Patients should not have received any other investigational agents within 4 weeks.

          4. History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation or intra-abdominal abscess within the
             last 6 months.

          5. Coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis. Patients on therapeutic dose of anticoagulation
             are excluded from the study.

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Also, MI/unstable angina within 6 months; stroke/TIA within 1
             year; symptomatic claudication within 1 year; abnormalities on ECG including prolonged
             QTc interval (i.e. &gt; 450 ms for males and &gt; 470 ms for females), new Q-wave, RBBB,
             LBBB,ST-segment depression.

          7. Grade 3 proteinuria (&gt; 3.5 g protein/24 hours)

          8. Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;150/100 during Screening)

          9. Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease.

         10. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to fosbretabulin or other agents used in the study.

         11. Since dilantin induces the P450 system and the effect this will have on fosbretabulin
             or bezvacazimab is not known, patients that are on seizure prophylaxis with dilantin
             will not be eligible. Switching the seizure prophylaxis to noninducers of the P450
             system such as levetiracetam is acceptable. Patients must be off dilantin for one week
             before starting this clinical trial. Additionally fosbretabulin has the potential to
             interact with drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 which includes barbiturates, diazepam and
             valproic acid. However the clinical significance of these interactions is not known.

         12. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because fosbretabulin is a vascular
             disrupting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with fosbretabulin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with fosbretabulin.

         13. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible Because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with fosbretabulin. In addition,these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrowsuppressive therapy.
