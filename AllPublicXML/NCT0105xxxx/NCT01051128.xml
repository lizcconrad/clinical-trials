  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate product performance of the
      Prometra Programmable Pump System in the delivery of intrathecal Lioresal® (baclofen) for the
      management of severe spasticity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Prometra Programmable Pump is a battery-operated, implantable, programmable infusion pump
      that dispenses drug solution into the intrathecal space through an implanted infusion
      catheter. All functions of the system (e.g., dosing) are controlled externally using a
      hand-held, battery-operated programmer. Lioresal Intrathecal (baclofen) is indicated for use
      in the management of severe spasticity. Spasticity is a major problem that has long
      challenged traditional medical treatment. While the incidence of spasticity is not known with
      certainty, it likely affects over half a million people in the United States and over 12
      million worldwide. Spasticity is associated with some very common neurological disorders such
      as: multiple sclerosis, stroke, cerebral palsy, spinal cord and brain injuries. Chronic
      spasticity seriously restricts normal daily activities and reduces the quality of life for
      many patients.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The overall goal of this study is to choose patients most likely to experience therapeutic
        success while reducing the likelihood of risks, complications and adverse events.

        Patients meeting all of the following criteria will be eligible for enrollment in the
        study:

          1. Patient with a history of severe chronic spastic hypertonia in the lower extremities
             lasting at least 6 months who:

               -  fail to respond to maximum recommended doses of antispasmodic medications
                  including baclofen, or

               -  those who experience intolerable CNS side effects at effective oral doses

          2. Patient is &gt;21 years of age

          3. Patient, or legally authorized representative (LAR), has provided written informed
             consent to participate in the study

          4. Investigator considers the patient willing and able to fulfill all study requirements

          5. Investigator has documented attempts to eliminate factors that can contribute to an
             increase in spasticity (e.g. infection)

          6. Patient has had a successful trial of Lioresal® for the management of the target
             spasticity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria are to be excluded from the study:

          1. Patient has MRI of the spine documenting structural abnormality preventing adequate
             CSF flow. (If the patient has a medical condition that contraindicates screening MRI,
             the investigator should proceed with the closest appropriate study i.e. CT scan,
             X-ray, to rule out any spinal abnormalities that would prevent intrathecal drug
             administration.)

          2. Patient's anatomy is not large enough to accommodate the pump's size and weight.

          3. Patient has a systemic infection.

          4. Patient has renal insufficiency as evidenced by a baseline serum creatinine of &gt;2.0
             mg/dl.

          5. Patient has a history of a bleeding disorder.

          6. Patient has a history of blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary
             embolism (PE) within 1 year of enrollment.

          7. Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding, or is of child-bearing potential and not
             employing effective birth control.

          8. Patient has known allergies or sensitivities to pump system materials (e.g., silicone
             rubber, titanium, polyphenylsulfone, acetal resin, polyvinylidene fluoride, tungsten).

          9. Patient has known allergies to Lioresal® (baclofen), or would be contraindicated for
             Lioresal® based on the drug labeling.

         10. Patient has other implantable electronic cardiac devices (i.e. pacemaker,
             defibrillator, CRT system)

         11. Patient has an occupation where he/she would be exposed to high current industrial
             equipment, powerful magnets or transmitting towers, such as, electricians, electrical
             engineers or MRI technicians.

         12. Patient is participating in another clinical trial.
