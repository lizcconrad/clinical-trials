    <textblock>
      This research trial collects and studies tissue and blood samples from patients with prostate
      or bladder/urothelial cancer that has recurred (come back) at or near the same place as the
      original (primary) tumor or has spread to other parts of the body. Studying samples of blood
      and tissue samples from patients with prostate or bladder/urothelial cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about new biomarkers, potential drug targets, and resistance
      developing in response to treatment. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat the
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain tissue through tumor biopsies and/or surgical resection and matched blood samples
      from patients with localized and metastatic prostate and bladder/urothelial cancer for:
      mutation mapping using OncoMap and other high throughput genotyping technologies; sequencing
      of tumor genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); global assessment of gene expression to
      generate hypotheses that can be tested in subsequent trials (by gene expression microarrays
      and/or complementary [c]DNA sequencing; profiling of genes involved in androgen metabolism
      and DNA repair; quantitating peptides, hormones and other locally-derived or systemic
      metabolites present in tumor tissues.

      II. Obtain samples from controls, including blood or tissue for comparison with samples noted
      above.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether levels of other androgen synthetic enzymes predict responses to agents
      targeting the androgen-androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis.

      II. Determine whether intratumoral androgen levels are increased compared to serum levels,
      and whether they correlate with androgen synthetic enzyme levels and/or responses to therapy.

      III. Determine whether time to progression on therapy correlates with androgen biosynthetic
      enzymes or hormone levels.

      IV. Determine whether gene expression profiling can predict response and time to progression
      for chemotherapy or targeted agents.

      V. Identify immune B and/or T cell markers, sequencing and/or antibodies that may correlate
      with response, time to progression and/or overall survival for patients undergoing
      immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood and tissue samples for analysis via mutation mapping,
      DNA sequencing, gene expression microarray, and gene profiling.
