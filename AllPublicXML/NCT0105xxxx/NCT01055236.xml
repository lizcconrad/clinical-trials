      Hydroxyzine is one of antihistamines that antagonizes H1 receptor, and it's effects are
      reducing pruritus, nausea/vomiting, and the mild effect of sedation.With these effects
      Hydroxyzine should be used in the prevention of these symptoms.

      80 patients scheduled for elective transabdominal hysterectomy under combined spinal-general
      anesthesia. they were randomized to receive either hydroxyzine 75 mg and midazolam 7.5 mg
      (ATR group) or placebo and midazolam 7.5 mg (control group) as premedication at least half an
      hour before operation. Clinical data (vital signs, pruritic score, nauseous score, sedation
      score, etc) was recorded at preoperative, intraoperative and 48-hour postoperative periods.
      All patients had spinal block with 0.5% heavy bupivacaine 2 ml with 0.3 mg preservative free
      morphine and general anesthesia with thiopental sodium 250-300 mg as induction, intubated
      with atracurium 0.6 mg/kg and maintenance with nitrous oxide, oxygen and isoflurane.
      Conventional reversal technique was done in all patients. Fentanyl intravenous was used for
      pain as needed, chlopheniramine syrup 2 tsp (4mg/10 ml) every 4 hours was used for pruritus
      and ondansetron intravenous (8 mg) was used for nausea/vomiting in postoperative period. The
      results were reported in number of patients or percent of patients who were suffered from
      pruritus, nausea, vomiting or sedation.
