  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory arthritis (IA) is a major cause of long-term disability. Peer support may be a
      solution to the common problem of delayed treatment. Early peer support may result in
      improved use of therapy, higher self-efficacy, reduced anxiety, and improved coping in the
      first two years post-diagnosis. The whole intervention study comprises of two parts: The
      first part involves the development and testing of a peer mentor training initiative, which
      is called &quot;Peer to Peer Mentoring: Facilitating Individuals with Early Inflammatory Arthritis
      to Manage their Arthritis - Peer Mentor Training&quot;. The second part, which is the focus of
      this study, involves the delivery of a one-on-one peer support intervention from a trained
      peer mentor to an individual newly diagnosed with EIA. The feasibility and acceptability of
      the program will be determined, as well as the health outcomes following the participation of
      the program.

    <description>A quasi-experimental, before and after study design will obtain data for planning and implementing a larger-scale study. Exposures and outcomes will be measured at baseline, 3 months (immediate post 12-week program) and 6 months (3 months post-program). Ten individuals with EIA will be recruited by brief screening interviews to ensure they meet inclusion criteria. Each pair of peer mentor and EIA participant will meet at SHSC for an initial contact. EIA participants will receive informational, emotional and appraisal support from trained peer mentors by telephone or neutral private location at a time convenient for both parties, at least once a week for 12 weeks.</description>
