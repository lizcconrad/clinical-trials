    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relative performance of a new daily disposable
      toric soft contact lens against a daily disposable toric contact lens currently available in
      market, specifically with regards to the comfort and vision with the lens.

    <measure>Monocular Visual Acuity on LogMAR Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>After 5 to 9 days of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Distance (4 meter) high contrast standard resolution (ETDRS) acuity was measured twice for each eye. Visual acuity describes the acuteness or sharpness of vision; the ability to perceive small details. Visual acuity is a measure of spacial resolution of the visual processing system; it's tested by requiring the person being tested to identify characters (like letters and numbers)on a chart from a set distance. LogMAR charts are used to assess visual acuity for research studies. LogMAR means Minimum Angle of Resolution. This has lead to the assertion that research is done using a logarithmic progression in size of letters on a test chart gives the most accurate visual acuity measurement. The reason for this is, unlike other charts, LogMAR chart has equal gradation between the letters on the line and the space between the lines. And, there is a fixed number of letters per line.</description>

    <measure>Subject Reported Overall Lens Comfort Using the Contact Lens User Evaluation (CLUE)TM Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After 5 to 9 days of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>The Contact Lens User Evaluation(CLUE)TM questionnaire is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3*SD).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be between 18 and 40 years old.

          -  The subject must have normal eyes.

          -  The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          -  The subject must read and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and be provided a
             copy of the form.

          -  The subject must have a subjective distance spectacle prescription in the range of
             -1.75 to -5.00D in each eye.

          -  The subject must manifest -1.25 to -2.00 D of refractive astigmatism in each eye.

        <title>Monocular Visual Acuity on LogMAR Scale</title>
        <description>Distance (4 meter) high contrast standard resolution (ETDRS) acuity was measured twice for each eye. Visual acuity describes the acuteness or sharpness of vision; the ability to perceive small details. Visual acuity is a measure of spacial resolution of the visual processing system; it's tested by requiring the person being tested to identify characters (like letters and numbers)on a chart from a set distance. LogMAR charts are used to assess visual acuity for research studies. LogMAR means Minimum Angle of Resolution. This has lead to the assertion that research is done using a logarithmic progression in size of letters on a test chart gives the most accurate visual acuity measurement. The reason for this is, unlike other charts, LogMAR chart has equal gradation between the letters on the line and the space between the lines. And, there is a fixed number of letters per line.</description>
