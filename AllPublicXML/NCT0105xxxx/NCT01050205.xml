    <textblock>
      The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large research study conducted in the United States,
      found that lifestyle intervention was effective in lowering risk for development of type 2
      diabetes. It is important to evaluate the DPP lifestyle interventions in &quot;real world&quot;
      settings. The purpose of this project is to test an adapted version of the DPP lifestyle
      intervention in several community settings, including a worksite, a health care facility
      (primary care practice and local community centers dedicated to older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence that lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes
      has been demonstrated in several clinical trials including a multi center clinical trial in
      the US, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The challenge for public health is to
      translate this promising and proven behavioral intervention utilized in the DPP research
      effort to the &quot;real world&quot;, i.e., how to make it work in diverse communities in a variety of
      local settings at a reduced cost so that the maximal number of those at risk can benefit.

      The purpose of this application is to test a framework for translation of the DPP that
      includes: 1) demonstration of a training model for community health care professionals that
      includes initial training, support, and supervision in the delivery of a diabetes prevention
      curriculum and the needed behavioral lifestyle materials both initially and over time; 2)
      evaluation of a more compact and flexible DPP intervention program administered to each
      participant in a version of his or her choice (standard face-to-face group format or a DVD
      version of the same lifestyle intervention program content). These lifestyle intervention
      programs will be carried out in three different community settings; i.e. a health care
      practice, a worksite, and local centers in the community dedicated to healthy aging for older
      adults. Lastly, the cost-effectiveness analyses of the GLB intervention program in each of
      the three community settings will be tested.

    <description>Weight was measured twice using a digital physician's scale (DETECTO® PD100) placed on a hard, flat surface. Participants were asked to remove their shoes and stand in the middle of the scale with eyes straight forward and without touching any surface. The participant was asked to step down from the scale between measures. If the measures were more than 0.5 pounds apart, a third measure was taken. Weight is reported in pounds.</description>

    <description>After the participant signed the consent, they were taken to the private phlebotomy area. The participant sat in a stationary chair and placed their arm of choice for the blood draw flat on the table, on top of the BloodBloc pad. The participant was asked the last time they had anything to eat or drink, including candy, mint, gum, cough drops, cough syrup, coffee or tea, (participants were expected to fast for 8-12 hours prior to their assessment visit). If the participant had anything to eat or drink, other than water, the blood draw was rescheduled. The fasting blood sample was analyzed by Quest Diagnostics™ laboratory for the worksite and community/senior centers.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention (assessed at 6 months after commencement of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure was measured in the right arm with the participant seated comfortably with the right arm resting on a table. All participants were asked to rest quietly with feet flat on the floor for five minutes. Following the five minute wait, the radial pulse was measured in the right arm and pulse obliteration level was assessed. The cuff was inflated to the peak inflation rate and the pressure released at a rate of 2mm/Hg per second. First appearance and last heard (phase V) Korotkoff's sounds were utilized to determine systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively. The cuffed arm was then raised for 5 seconds after each inflation with a wait period of 30 seconds between each blood pressure reading. Blood pressure was repeated twice with the average computed. If it was not possible to measure blood pressure in the right arm, the left arm was utilized and noted in the participant record.</description>

    <description>The participant was asked stand with feet together. The waist was measured using a cloth measuring tape around the abdomen. The midpoints were marked horizontally at midpoint between highest point of the iliac crest and lowest part of the costal margin in the mid-axillary line. Both sides of the waist were marked using a cosmetic pencil. The participant was asked to have arms at side and to breathe in, out and hold, and then the measurement was taken. Waist measurement was recorded to the nearest quarter inch. The measure was repeated twice. If waist measures differ by more than one-half inch, a third measurement was recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention (assessed at 6 months after commencement of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) was designed by Dr. Kriska. It has been used to assess activity in a variety of populations and age groups over various time frames and was used to assess physical activity levels in the DPP. The MAQ includes both a leisure and an occupational activity section since the homogeneity of energy expenditure related to both of these components of activity within many study populations cannot be assumed. In addition, the MAQ was designed to be modified, based upon pilot testing, prior to its usage, in order to maximize the feasibility and appropriateness of the physical activity instrument to the population of interest. The MAQ has been shown to be both reliable and valid (through comparisons with activity monitors, fitness (field) testing, and the doubly labeled water technique) in adults and adolescents alike. The MAQ has been used to assess a variety of time frames from past year and past week to a lifetime of activity.</description>

             have prediabetes AND/OR metabolic syndrome are eligible to participate in the
             intervention. Pre-diabetes is defined as having a fasting glucose &gt;100 mg/dL and
             &lt;126mg/dL. Metabolic syndrome is defined as having at least 3 of the 5 following risk
             factors:

               1. Waist circumference (&gt;40 inches men, &gt;35 inches women);

               2. Blood pressure &gt;130 mmHg (systolic) or &gt;85 mmHg (diastolic) OR history of
                  diagnosed hypertension

               3. Low HDL level (&lt;40mg/dL men, &lt;50 mg/dL women)

               4. Elevated triglyceride level &gt;150 mg/dL

               5. Fasting glucose &gt;100mg/dL and &lt;126mg/dL All individuals enrolled in the study
                  should have at least 6th grade reading/writing ability.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Screening Exclusionary Criteria: Women who are currently (or within past 6-weeks)
             pregnant or lactating, or any individual planning to leave the area before the end of
             the effort will be considered ineligible to participate in the screening.

          -  Intervention Exclusionary Criteria: Exclusionary criterion for intervention is the
             same as for screening. In addition, individuals who are on metformin or are identified
             as having diabetes as a result of the screening are not eligible. Individuals who have
             recently (within the past 3 months) initiated or changed their dosage of any blood
             pressure or lipid medication will also be excluded as being on an unstable regimen
             will complicate the interpretation of any blood pressure or lipid effects of the
             intervention.

        <description>After the participant signed the consent, they were taken to the private phlebotomy area. The participant sat in a stationary chair and placed their arm of choice for the blood draw flat on the table, on top of the BloodBloc pad. The participant was asked the last time they had anything to eat or drink, including candy, mint, gum, cough drops, cough syrup, coffee or tea, (participants were expected to fast for 8-12 hours prior to their assessment visit). If the participant had anything to eat or drink, other than water, the blood draw was rescheduled. The fasting blood sample was analyzed by Quest Diagnostics™ laboratory for the worksite and community/senior centers.</description>

        <title>Changes in Fasting Lipids (Total Cholesterol) Between Baseline and Post-intervention (Assessed at 6 Months After Commencement of Intervention) Compared to Delayed Intervention Participants.</title>
        <description>Venous blood draw: After the participant signed the consent, they were taken to the private phlebotomy area. The participant sat in a stationary chair and placed their arm of choice for the blood draw flat on the table, on top of the BloodBloc pad. The participant was asked the last time they had anything to eat or drink, including candy, mint, gum, cough drops, cough syrup, coffee or tea, (participants were expected to fast for 8-12 hours prior to their assessment visit). If the participant had anything to eat or drink, other than water, the blood draw was rescheduled. The fasting blood sample was analyzed by Quest Diagnostics™ laboratory for the work site and community/senior centers.</description>

        <title>Changes in Systolic Blood Pressure (BP) Between Baseline and Post-intervention (Assessed at 6 Months After Commencement of Intervention) Compared to Delayed Intervention Participants.</title>
        <description>Blood pressure was measured in the right arm with the participant seated comfortably with the right arm resting on a table. All participants were asked to rest quietly with feet flat on the floor for five minutes. Following the five minute wait, the radial pulse was measured in the right arm and pulse obliteration level was assessed. The cuff was inflated to the peak inflation rate and the pressure released at a rate of 2mm/Hg per second. First appearance and last heard (phase V) Korotkoff’s sounds were utilized to determine systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively. The cuffed arm was then raised for 5 seconds after each inflation with a wait period of 30 seconds between each blood pressure reading. Blood pressure was repeated twice with the average computed. If it was not possible to measure blood pressure in the right arm, the left arm was utilized and noted in the participant record.</description>

        <description>The participant was asked stand with feet together. The waist was measured using a cloth measuring tape around the abdomen. The midpoints were marked horizontally at midpoint between highest point of the iliac crest and lowest part of the costal margin in the mid-axillary line. Both sides of the waist were marked using a cosmetic pencil. The participant was asked to have arms at side and to breathe in, out and hold, and then the measurement was taken. Waist measurement was recorded to the nearest quarter inch. The measure was repeated twice. If waist measures differ by more than one-half inch, a third measurement was recorded.</description>

        <title>Changes in Self-reported Physical Activity Between Baseline and Post-intervention (Assessed at 6 Months After Commencement of Intervention) Compared to Delayed Intervention Participants.</title>
        <description>The Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) was designed by Dr. Kriska. It has been used to assess activity in a variety of populations and age groups over various time frames and was used to assess physical activity levels in the DPP. The MAQ includes both a leisure and an occupational activity section since the homogeneity of energy expenditure related to both of these components of activity within many study populations cannot be assumed. In addition, the MAQ was designed to be modified, based upon pilot testing, prior to its usage, in order to maximize the feasibility and appropriateness of the physical activity instrument to the population of interest. The MAQ has been shown to be both reliable and valid (through comparisons with activity monitors, fitness (field) testing, and the doubly labeled water technique) in adults and adolescents alike. The MAQ has been used to assess a variety of time frames from past year and past week to a lifetime of activity.</description>
