  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At a time when there is so much focus in the United States on reducing the cost of health
      care delivery while maximizing the effectiveness of health care performance, Traditional
      Chinese Medicine (acupuncture, herbal treatment, and accessory techniques) offers decision
      makers a tantalizing option. Traditional Chinese Medicine differs from its biomedical
      counterpart in that it is highly portable, inexpensive to administer, relies on a
      conversational diagnostic inquiry system to arrive at differential diagnosis for its
      patients, and has very few reported side effects associated with treatment. The World Health
      Organization cites acupuncture has a proven and effective treatment for 28 diseases/disorders
      including stroke, pain management issues and rheumatoid arthritis; the WHO lists another over
      65 diseases for which the therapeutic effect of acupuncture has been shown but for which
      further proof is needed including alcohol dependence, cancer pain and diabetes mellitus. With
      the completion of this pragmatic clinical trial and introduction of the Constant Care method
      of health care delivery to underserved communities on Chicago's south side, the investigators
      can both utilize an effective plan of health care delivery, advance the research needed to
      effectively utilize Traditional Chinese Medicine as a low cost therapeutic option in this
      country, and successfully treat disenfranchised populations that have been traditionally
      overlooked and that deserve a better health and wellness care future.
