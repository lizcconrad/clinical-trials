  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As we age, we experience a reduction in muscle and bone which inevitably decreases strength
      and the ability to perform tasks of daily living such as gardening, carrying groceries, and
      climbing stairs. Health costs associated with aging muscle and bone loss are in the billions
      of dollars. With the projected increase in life expectancy, the incidence of muscle and bone
      loss will rise and further drain the healthcare system, with greater need for
      hospitalization, treatment, and rehabilitation. Without effective strategies to counteract
      aging muscle and bone loss, we may face a healthcare crisis in the future. Creatine, a
      compound found in red meat and seafood, increases creatine phosphate stores in muscle,
      providing increased energy during high-intensity exercise. Short-term (i.e. 3-4 months)
      resistance-exercise and supplementation with creatine, have been shown to have a favorable
      effect on properties of aging muscle and bone. However, the longer-term (i.e. 1 year) effects
      of these interventions are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this innovative research is to
      determine the longer-term effects of resistance-exercise and creatine supplementation
      (0.1gâ€¢kg-1) in older adults. The primary dependent variables to be assessed will include
      muscle hypertrophy, bone mineral and bone geometry, strength, and urinary and blood
      indicators of liver and kidney function. This innovative, multidisciplinary research will
      help contribute to the successful pursuit of prolonged independent living by improving aging
      musculoskeletal health for older Saskatchewan adults. Saskatchewan provides a relevant
      setting for this research, given the higher percentage of older adults (15%), compared to the
      national average (12%).

      We hypothesize that creatine supplementation will increase muscle mass, strength, and bone
      mineral density more than placebo.
