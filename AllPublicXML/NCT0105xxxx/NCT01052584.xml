      In this stdy, patients aged above 6 months with symptomatic malaria presenting to health
      centers will be enrolled for treatment with artemether-lumefantrine for P. falciparum
      infection, and either artemether-lumefantrine or chloroquine for P. vivax infection.
      Clinical, parasitologic, and hematologic parameters will be monitored for P. falciparum and
      P. vivax infection over a 42-day follow-up period, which will be used to evaluate drug
      efficacy. Results from this research study will be used to assist Ethiopia in assessing their
      current national malaria drug policies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the rapid development of significant drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
      to chloroquine and then sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (the first line therapy in Ethiopia
      1998-2004), artemether- lumefantrine (Coartem or AL) was adopted as first line therapy in
      Ethiopia in 2004. According to the current national malaria diagnosis and treatment
      guidelines, first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum infection is AL. First-line
      treatment for Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is with chloroquine (CQ) alone without primaquine therapy
      in malarious areas. For all clinical infection without laboratory confirmation, AL which is
      effective against both Pf and Pv is the first-line treatment. Thus, in Ethiopia, where
      treatment for malaria without laboratory confirmation occurs frequently, Pv is often treated
      with AL as the standard of care. Furthermore, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends AL
      for the treatment of Pv, where AL has been adopted as first-line treatment for Pf. Now with
      wide-spread use of AL and CQ, we propose to conduct an antimalarial efficacy study to monitor
      the effectiveness of these therapies in Ethiopia and to determine how efficacious these drugs
      remain. This information will inform future policy changes with respect to appropriate
      antimalarial strategies.

      The simplest and most universally accepted measure of testing for antimalarial drug treatment
      efficacy, the standardized procedures outlined in the World Health Organization Assessment
      and monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria and the WHO Monitoring antimalarial drug resistance, will be followed.
