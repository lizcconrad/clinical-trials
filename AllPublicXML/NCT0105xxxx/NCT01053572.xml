  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of steroids and/or 10% hypertonic sodium chloride in
      percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain in
      patients with post lumbar surgery syndrome.

      To evaluate and compare the adverse event profile in all groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recruitment is indicated in patients with chronic low back pain and lower extremity pain
      secondary to post lumbar laminectomy syndrome, non-responsive to conservative therapy with
      physical therapy, chiropractic, medical therapy, and fluoroscopically directed epidural
      injections.

      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, equivalence, controlled trial
      performed in an interventional pain management referral center in the United States.

      The study involves 240 patients studied in 4 groups with 60 patients in each group.
      Randomization includes sequence generation, allocation concealment, implementation, and
      blinding.

      Data management analysis includes sample size justification of 40 patients in each group with
      a power of 80% and a 0.05% 2-sided significance level. Statistical methodology includes
      chi-squared statistics, Fisher's exact test, t-test, and paired t-test with significance
      evaluated at P value &lt; 0.05.
