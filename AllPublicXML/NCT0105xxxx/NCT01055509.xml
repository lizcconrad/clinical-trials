  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Cognitive Adaptation Training are effective
      in comparison with conventional treatment, focusing on social functions, symptoms, relapse,
      re-hospitalisation, and quality of life in outpatients with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that approximately 80% of patients with schizophrenia have reduced cognitive
      functions, representing problems with attention, verbal memory, short-term memory and
      executive functions (1-3). These impairments might have an impact on the patients ability to
      complete rehabilitation programmes, apply learned strategies to social problems, develop work
      skills and manage daily life (4,5). The effect of Cognitive Adaptation Training has been
      tested as a psychosocial treatment including training of compensatory strategies in order to
      sequence patient's adaptive behaviour, showing promising results concerning improved social
      functions (6). There are however no solid evidence for these statements. The existing few
      studies investigating the effect of Cognitive Adaptation Training (6-8) are underpowered
      (small sample sizes) and have a lack of younger patients, which limits the conclusions that
      can be drawn from the results of the improvement. The present trial employs a prospective
      design of 26 weeks with a follow-up period of 9 months after inclusion. The study will enroll
      164 consecutively recruited participants from three Danish out-patient teams for young adults
      with a first episode of psychosis.

Additionally, patients in the intervention arm receives training concerning solving concrete problems related to the patient's daily life using tools such as schedules, schemes and signs. Additional the patient can receive SMS messages or instructions for the use of schedules in cell-phones to prompt for activities. The intervention is conducted in the patients homes every 14th day in a period of six months.</description>
