    <textblock>
      Irinotecan, as one new agent used in advanced esophageal carcinoma, has been shown to be
      effective and safe in western studies. Different with westerns, squamous carcinoma is the
      main pathological type in china patients. The investigators then initiated a prospective
      phase II clinical trial with irinotecan/cisplatin as the 1st line treatment in advanced
      esophageal carcinoma to observe the efficacy and safety of the combination.
