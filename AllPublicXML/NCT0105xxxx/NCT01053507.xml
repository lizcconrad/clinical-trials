  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Treximet when taken for post traumatic headache
      by measuring any change in the number of headache days or any change in a subject's ability
      to think following treatment with study medication. Eligible subjects will complete 3 visits.
      Following Visit 1, subjects will treat with their usual medication and document headache
      symptoms and therapy in a Headache Diary. After 30 days, subjects will return for Visit 2 and
      be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to receive Treximet or matching placebo to treat at
      the same time each day. Treximet will be provided to treat any headache that occurs. Subjects
      will complete a daily Diary. After 30 days, subjects will exit the study at Visit 3.

      Subjects will be enrolled at 3 investigative sites. At Visit 1, a medical, headache, and
      medication history will be collected and a physical and neurological exam with vital signs
      will be performed. An ECG will be completed if one has not been completed in the previous 6
      months. Subjects will be administered a series of psychological tests to help the study
      doctor decide whether or not a subject is eligible. The Headache Impact Test-6 and Migraine
      Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire will be completed at each visit. During a 30-day
      Baseline Period, subjects will treat with their usual medication and complete a daily Diary
      documenting headache symptoms and treatment. At Visits 2 and 3 subjects will complete the
      Mental Efficiency Workload Test and Migraine Early Warning Tool. Following randomization at
      Visit 2, subjects will treat daily for 30 days with Treximet or a matching placebo. Subjects
      will be provided with Treximet for rescue of any persisting or recurring headache. During the
      Treatment Period, subjects will complete a daily Diary reporting headache symptoms and
      response to treatment. After the 30-day Treatment Period, subjects will exit the study at
      Visit 3 .
