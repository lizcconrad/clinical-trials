  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crinone is a micronized progesterone gel which is administrated via vaginal route and
      targeted drug delivery to uterine (first uterine pass effect) with lower serum concentration.
      This study is to investigate the difference of progesterone concentration in serum and
      endometrium after administration with crinone and intramuscular progesterone.

      The study will be conducted as a single centre, randomized, active controlled study.
      Recruitment duration will be 6-8 months long. Day 1 of Crinone administration will be the
      baseline. On Day 7 of Crinone administration endometrial tissue will be taken for P4 test.
      Last visit will be at 3-5 days after withdraw bleeding.

    <description>The women who singed informed consent were randomized into two groups, respectively received Crinone 90mg via vaginal route or progesterone 20mg via IM route, once per day, for seven days. After 7 days therapy, endometrium biopsy was taken via vaginal route for tissue P concentration test by radioimmunoassay method. Blood sample were drawn for serum progesterone level.</description>
