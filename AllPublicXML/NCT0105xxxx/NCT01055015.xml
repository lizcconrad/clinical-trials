  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is a two-arm, double-blind study to:

        -  compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of the flexible regimen of Q8003 (6 mg/4 mg up
           to 24 mg/16 mg) administered every 4-6 hours over a 48-hour Treatment Period versus low
           dose Q8003 (every 4-6 hours 3 mg/2 mg with a 6 mg/4 mg loading dose) to inpatients with
           moderate to severe postoperative pain who have undergone primary unilateral total knee
           arthroplasty.

        -  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Q8003 when administered in the Voluntary
           Extension Period starting at 48 hours after the initial dosing and extending up to Day
           12.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age at time of enrollment.

             effective contraceptive, be non-lactating, and if of child-bearing potential, have a
             negative urine pregnancy test result.

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) of 38 kg/m2 or less.

          -  Have undergone a primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty performed under under
             standardized general, spinal or epidural anesthesia.

          -  Have developed moderate to severe pain (a score of 2 or more on the 4 point Likert
             scale and at least 4 on the 11 point NPRS scale within 6 hours of discontinuing PCA on
             the morning after surgery).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, has a history of pulmonary, cardiovascular
             (including uncontrolled hypertension), neurologic, endocrine, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, or kidney disease or therapy that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would jeopardize the patient's well being by participation in this study
             or is mentally or emotionally unsuitable to participate, or unable/unwilling to comply
             with the study assessments.

          -  Used opiates continuously (including tramadol) for more than ten days in the past
             year.

          -  Hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to ibuprofen or short term opioids.

          -  Currently receiving any medications that are not at a stable dose (the same dose for &gt;
             2 months prior to date of surgery).

          -  Was dosed with another investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Screening
             Visit or has previously received treatment with Q8003.

          -  Current therapy with central nervous system depressant medications that might increase
             the risks of treatment with opioids (other than those used with surgical anesthesia).

          -  Current evidence of alcohol abuse (regularly drinks more than 4 units of alcohol per
             day; 1 unit = Â½ pint of beer, 1 glass of wine, or 1 ounce of spirit).

             entry.

          -  Has taken drugs known to interact with morphine or oxycodone metabolism, including,
             but not limited to, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), amphetamines,
             and muscle relaxants within the 4 weeks prior to the date of surgery.

          -  History of sleep apnea.
