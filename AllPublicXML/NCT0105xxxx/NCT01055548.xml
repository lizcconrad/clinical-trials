  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the pilot study is to explore and identify the issues of concern to parents whose
      babies have been cared for in a neonatal unit and exposed to imaging, its influence on
      diagnosis and information-giving process
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The aim is to explore the recent experience and views of parents in a qualitative way to
      assist the development of a questionnaire which can be used with a much larger group of
      parents. The interview guide with the topics to be covered will include: expectations,
      concerns and issues relating to the equipment used with their baby, any investigations,
      including cranial ultrasound and MR imaging and the information provided.

      The data collected will then inform the development of a standard instrument or questionnaire
      which will be used with parents participating in a trial using a randomised design to compare
      the influence of MR and ultrasound-based information on parental perceptions, stress and
      coping in association with healthcare usage and costs.
