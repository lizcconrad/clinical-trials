      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (explores what the body
      does to the drug), and pharmacodynamics (explores what a drug does to the body) of single
      doses of JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin, and co-administration of JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin in
      healthy overweight or obese adult male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician or volunteer knows the name of the assigned study
      drug), placebo controlled (substance containing no medication), study in healthy, overweight
      or obese adult male volunteers. For each volunteer, the study consists of a screening phase
      (up to 30 days), a treatment phase during which volunteers will receive 4 study treatments in
      a randomized (study sequence assigned by chance) sequence (28 days), and a follow-up phase
      (10 days). During the treatment phase there will be at least 7 days between each of the 4
      treatments. The four treatments will be JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin, JNJ-38431055 and
      sitagliptin, and placebo. The following safety evaluations will be taken throughout the
      study: Electrocardiogram (an ECG is a painless procedure that gives a picture of the
      electrical activity of the heart), blood pressure, heart rate, and blood samples for
      laboratory tests. The primary outcome will be the effect of JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin on
      glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. Study drug will be administered as single oral doses
      separated by at least 7 days. The four treatments will be JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin,
      JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin, and placebo.

             being of the volunteer or the study or prevent the volunteer from meeting or
             performing study requirements
