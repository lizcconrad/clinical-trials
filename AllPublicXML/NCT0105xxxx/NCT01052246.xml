  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatment of acne vulgaris published so far are
      controversial: Whereas Seaton et al. described a marked improvement of mild-to-moderate acne
      after low-fluence pulsed-dye laser therapy, Orringer et al. were unable to replicate said
      results in a similar, albeit not identical, study design. More recently published studies
      failed to resolve the controversy, varying in terms of treatment procedure(s) as well as
      results.

      While published results are certainly promising enough to be followed up by independent
      research, they are insufficient to justify the abdication of methods with proven efficacy.
      Considering patient treatment ethics and the short 'window of opportunity' for scar
      prevention when active inflammatory lesions are present, the investigators planned the
      adjuvant application of the PDL in the present study, providing all patients with the well
      established and evidentially effective modality of a fixed-combination clindamycin 1%-benzoyl
      peroxide 5% hydrating gel (C/BPO). The goal of the study was the assessment of the efficacy
      and safety of a low-fluence PDL treatment in addition to C/BPO in patients with facial
      inflammatory acne.

    <description>Topical monotherapy with a fixed combination of 1% clindamycin and 5% benzoyl peroxide hydrating gel (DuacÂ® Akne Gel, Stiefel Laboratorium GmbH, Offenbach, Germany). In order to provide standardized condition within the sample, the gel was applied on the whole face regardless of the lesion location. The gel was applied once per day in the evening throughout the observation period and left in place overnight.</description>
