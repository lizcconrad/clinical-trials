    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints Using C-Reactive Protein (DAS28 [CRP]) Response at Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 (CRP) calculated swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) using the 28 joints, general health (GH) using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst), and CRP (milligram per Liter [mg/L]). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score= more disease activity. DAS28 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 3.2 = low disease activity, greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission. A Day 85 responder was defined as a participant who experienced more than 1.2 decrease from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) score at Day 85.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints Using C-Reactive Protein (DAS28 [CRP]) Response at Day 85</title>
        <description>DAS28 (CRP) calculated swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) using the 28 joints, general health (GH) using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst), and CRP (milligram per Liter [mg/L]). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score= more disease activity. DAS28 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 3.2 = low disease activity, greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission.

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints Using Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28 [ESR]) at Day 85 by Region</title>
          <description>DAS28 (ESR) calculated SJC and TJC using the 28 joints, GH using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score = more disease activity. DAS28 (ESR) &lt;3.2 = low disease activity, &gt;=3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission. A Day 85 responder was defined as a participant who experienced more than 1.2 decrease from baseline in DAS28 (ESR) score at Day 85. DAS28 (ESR) response at Day 85 for the European and Japanese regions were reported.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.

        <description>DAS28 calculated SJC and TJC using the 28 joints, GH using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst) and CRP (mg/L) for DAS28 (CRP) or ESR (mm/hour) for DAS28 (ESR). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score = more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;3.2 = low disease activity, &gt;=3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission.

        <description>DAS28 calculated SJC and TJC using the 28 joints, GH using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst) and CRP (mg/L) for DAS28 (CRP) or ESR (mm/hour) for DAS28 (ESR). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score = more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;3.2 = low disease activity, &gt;=3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission. Remission was defined as less than 2.6 DAS28 (ESR) or DAS28 (CRP) score. DAS28 (CRP) and DAS28 (ESR) for the European and Japanese regions were reported.</description>

        <description>DAS28 calculated SJC and TJC using the 28 joints, GH using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst) and CRP (mg/L) for DAS28 (CRP) or ESR (mm/hour) for DAS28 (ESR). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score = more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;3.2 = low disease activity, &gt;=3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission. Response was defined as 1.2 decrease from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) or DAS28 (ESR) score. Remission was defined as less than 2.6 DAS28 (CRP) or DAS28 (ESR) score.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset for DAS28 (CRP) and DAS (ESR) Response and Remission by Region</title>
        <description>DAS28 calculated SJC and TJC using the 28 joints, GH using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst) and CRP (mg/L) for DAS28 (CRP) or ESR (mm/hour) for DAS28 (ESR). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score = more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;3.2 = low disease activity, &gt;=3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission. Response was defined as 1.2 decrease from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) or DAS28 (ESR) score. Remission was defined as less than 2.6 DAS28 (CRP) or DAS28 (ESR) score. Time to response for DAS28 (CRP) and DAS28 (ESR) by region were reported. Time to remission for DAS28 (CRP) and DAS28 (ESR) by region were not analyzed because time to remission for the overall study population could not be achieved.</description>

        <title>Duration of DAS28 (CRP) and DAS28 (ESR) Response and Remission</title>
        <description>DAS28 calculated SJC and TJC using the 28 joints, GH using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst) and CRP (mg/L) for DAS28 (CRP) or ESR (mm/hour) for DAS28 (ESR). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score = more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;3.2 = low disease activity, &gt;=3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission. Response was defined as 1.2 decrease from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) or DAS28 (ESR) score. Remission was defined as less than 2.6 DAS28 (CRP) or DAS28 (ESR) score. Expected duration of response (DOR) was calculated as response rate (in percentage) multiplied by mean DOR (in days) by using Weibull Model. Duration of DAS28 (CRP) and DAS28 (ESR) remission were not analyzed because very few participants achieved remission in the overall study population.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change in Methotrexate (MTX) and Corticosteroid (CST) Dose</title>
        <description>Participants received MTX at stable and tolerated dose during baseline were categorized as “low dose (&lt;12.5 mg per week [mg/wk])”, “medium dose (&gt;=12.5 - &lt;20 mg/wk)”, and “high dose (&gt;=20 mg/wk)”. Participants received oral CST at stable dose during baseline were categorized as “low dose (&lt;5 mg/day)”, and “high dose (&gt;=5 mg/day)”. Change in MTX and CST dose from baseline between Day 1-85 and Day 86-169 were categorized as follows: ‘Increased’, ‘no change’ and ‘decreased’. Participants were counted once with dose increases counted first, followed by no change and then dose decreases.</description>
