      Uncertainty persists regarding the usefulness of incorporating inspiratory muscle training
      (IMT) in pulmonary rehabilitation programs for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease. In this study the investigators investigate whether IMT associated with exercise
      training would be better than exercise training alone, with regard to exercise capacity,
      inspiratory muscle strength and dyspnea.

      Study design: A double-blind parallel controlled trial Setting: outpatient clinic Inclusion
      criteria: Subjects between 40 and 75 years of age referred by a physician to the Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation Program, with a clinical and spirometric diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD
      according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD).

      Outcome measurements: Inspiratory muscle strength (using maximal inspiratory pressure, MIP),
      exercise capacity (using six-minute walk test) and dyspnea were measured.

    <description>The training was performed using a threshold inspiratory muscle trainer (Respironics HealthScan, Inc, Cedar Grove, New York, USA).
The patients performed the IMT training in a seated position, with the upper limbs supported. The total duration of the respiratory training was 30 minutes, with sequences of three minutes of training followed by pauses of two minutes. The initial load was equivalent to 30% of the individual's MIP. This load was progressively increased over the first four weeks, according to the patients' tolerance, to reach 60% of the MIP. This level was then maintained until the end of the training.</description>
