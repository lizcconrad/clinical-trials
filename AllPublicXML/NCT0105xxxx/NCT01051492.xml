  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a common malignancy world-wide, and is the commonest female malignancy in
      Singapore, with rising trends in incidence over the last 2 decades. While there have been
      improvements in treatment, mortality from breast cancer remains significant. Development of
      biomarkers to predict treatment response and toxicity to anti-cancer agents can rationalize
      the choice of therapy for the individual patients to optimize treatment outcome and to reduce
      unnecessary toxicities. Development of novel therapies or novel approaches to therapy is also
      critical to improve the treatment armamentarium in breast cancer. These research strategies
      will have an significant impact on breast cancer treatment both in Singapore as well as
      globally.
