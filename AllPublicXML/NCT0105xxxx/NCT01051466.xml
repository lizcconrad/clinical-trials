  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research studies have shown that depression is associated with changes in structure
      and activity in different parts of the brain and that antidepressant medication can affect
      brain activity in different parts of the brain in individuals suffering from depression. The
      primary purpose of the study is to find out more about how the antidepressant medication
      duloxetine affects brain activity and structure in individuals with depression.

      This study will evaluate participants with depression before treatment is initiated and
      during treatment, and compare them to a control group of healthy participants. The aim will
      be to better understand both the neurobiology of depression and how the neurobiology changes
      in response to treatment of depression and the outcome of treatment. The study will include a
      variety of assessments of the neurobiology of depression including: scans of brain areas are
      involved in depression by looking at structures in the brain and how they work and blood
      tests and how these change in relation to several measures of depression severity.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12-Week Endpoint in the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Mean Blood Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) Response in the Amygdalae</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Functional MRI or fMRI is a functional neuroimaging procedure that uses MRI technology to measure brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region increases. The activation in response to the processing of sad faces was measured by the percentage of signal change in BOLD response from before to after sad faces processing. The percentage of signal change was calculated by taking the difference between BOLD response after sad faces processing and BOLD response before sad faces processing and dividing by BOLD response before sad face processing, then multiplying by 100. BOLD signals were measured using arbitrary magnetic resonance units. Amygdala BOLD activation was calculated as an average between the left amygdala activation and right amygdala activation. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for group, visit, group-by-visit, and baseline value.</description>

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a functional neuroimaging procedure that uses MRI technology to measure brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region increases. The activation in response to the processing of sad faces in each brain region (anterior cingulate, left amygdala and right amygdala) was measured by the percentage of signal change in BOLD response. The percentage of signal change was calculated by taking the difference between BOLD response after sad faces processing and BOLD response before sad faces processing and dividing by BOLD response before sad face processing, then multiplying by 100. BOLD signals were measured using arbitrary magnetic resonance units.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12-Week Endpoint in Volume of Subgenual Anterior Cingulate, Amygdalae, and Hippocampus</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The volume of specific brain regions is obtained using a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) procedure in which high-resolution spoiled gradient recall images are acquired in coronal brain slices. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for group, visit, group-by-visit, and baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Translocation of Gs Alpha (Gsα) From Lipid Rafts in the Cell Membranes of Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs) and Platelets Compared With Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Gsα is a membrane-associated protein that couples receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin to allow them to send messages between nerve cells - a process that may be altered during depression and antidepressant treatment. Gsα localization in the cholesterol-rich (lipid rafts) and cholesterol-poor regions of cell membranes of RBCs and platelets was measured with quantitative Western blots and reported as the ratio of Gsα (absorbance units) in Triton X-100 (TX-100) over Triton X-114 (TX-114), 2 detergents that discriminate between lipid raft and non-raft membrane domains. Translocation of Gsα was measured as the change from baseline in Gsα localization. Translocation of Gsα from lipid rafts in the cell membranes of WBCs was not analyzed due to technical laboratory issues. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for group, visit, group-by-visit, and baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Gs Alpha (Gsα)-Activated Adenylyl Cyclase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Gsα is a membrane-associated protein that couples receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin to allow them to send messages between nerve cells - a process that may be altered during depression and antidepressant treatment. Adenylyl cyclase is activated by Gsα, and when Gsα is translocated from lipid rafts it more effectively activates adenylyl cyclase. Gsα-activated adenylyl cyclase was not analyzed due to technical laboratory issues.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12-Week Endpoint in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and the Precursor of BDNF (proBDNF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>There is evidence that stress may decrease BDNF expression, while antidepressant treatment reverses or blocks these effects. BDNF is a protein that occurs naturally and supports the survival and growth of some nerve cells in the brain. proBDNF is a precursor of BDNF. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for group, visit, group-by-visit, and baseline value.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>There is evidence that stress may decrease BDNF expression, while antidepressant treatment reverses or blocks these effects. BDNF is a protein that occurs naturally and supports the survival and growth of some nerve cells in the brain. proBDNF is a precursor of BDNF. Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (trkB) is a receptor for BDNF, and pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) is a receptor for proBDNF. p75NTR was not analyzed due to technical laboratory issues. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for group, visit, group-by-visit, and baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HAMD17 response is defined as a &gt;50% reduction in HAMD17 total score from baseline. The HAMD17 is a standardized instrument consisting of 17 items used to measure the severity of major depressive disorder (MDD) and improvements in depression symptoms. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 2 (marked). Higher scores indicated greater symptom severity. The total score was the sum of the scores from HAMD17 Items 1 through 17 and could have ranged from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed). The percentage of participants with a HAMD17 response was calculated as the number of participants with a &gt;50% reduction in HAMD17 total score from baseline divided by the number of participants who had a HAMD17 observation at Week 12 then multiplied by 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HAMD17 remission is defined as a HAMD17 total score of ≤7 at Week 12 (endpoint). The HAMD17 is a standardized instrument consisting of 17 items used to measure the severity of major depressive disorder (MDD) and improvements in depression symptoms. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 2 (marked). Higher scores indicated greater symptom severity. The total score was the sum of the scores from HAMD17 Items 1 through 17 and could have ranged from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed). The percentage of participants with remission was calculated as the number of participants with a HAMD17 total score of ≤7 divided by the number of participants who had a HAMD17 observation at Week 12 then multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 12-Week Endpoint in the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Mean Blood Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) Response in the Amygdalae</title>
        <description>Functional MRI or fMRI is a functional neuroimaging procedure that uses MRI technology to measure brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region increases. The activation in response to the processing of sad faces was measured by the percentage of signal change in BOLD response from before to after sad faces processing. The percentage of signal change was calculated by taking the difference between BOLD response after sad faces processing and BOLD response before sad faces processing and dividing by BOLD response before sad face processing, then multiplying by 100. BOLD signals were measured using arbitrary magnetic resonance units. Amygdala BOLD activation was calculated as an average between the left amygdala activation and right amygdala activation. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for group, visit, group-by-visit, and baseline value.</description>

        <title>Translocation of Gs Alpha (Gsα) From Lipid Rafts in the Cell Membranes of Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs) and Platelets Compared With Baseline</title>
        <description>Gsα is a membrane-associated protein that couples receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin to allow them to send messages between nerve cells - a process that may be altered during depression and antidepressant treatment. Gsα localization in the cholesterol-rich (lipid rafts) and cholesterol-poor regions of cell membranes of RBCs and platelets was measured with quantitative Western blots and reported as the ratio of Gsα (absorbance units) in Triton X-100 (TX-100) over Triton X-114 (TX-114), 2 detergents that discriminate between lipid raft and non-raft membrane domains. Translocation of Gsα was measured as the change from baseline in Gsα localization. Translocation of Gsα from lipid rafts in the cell membranes of WBCs was not analyzed due to technical laboratory issues. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusted for group, visit, group-by-visit, and baseline value.</description>

        <title>Gs Alpha (Gsα)-Activated Adenylyl Cyclase</title>
        <description>Gsα is a membrane-associated protein that couples receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin to allow them to send messages between nerve cells - a process that may be altered during depression and antidepressant treatment. Adenylyl cyclase is activated by Gsα, and when Gsα is translocated from lipid rafts it more effectively activates adenylyl cyclase. Gsα-activated adenylyl cyclase was not analyzed due to technical laboratory issues.</description>

            <description>Duloxetine: Participants with major depressive disorder (MDD), who successfully completed screening, received 60 milligrams (mg) up to 120 mg orally, once daily (QD) for 12 weeks. The initial starting dose was 60 mg duloxetine QD for the first 8 weeks. Then, remitters [defined as participants with a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) total score ≤7] continued on 60 mg duloxetine QD, while non-remitters (HAMD17 total score &gt;7) could have their duloxetine dose flexed between 60 mg QD up to 120 mg QD, based on the clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator and tolerability of the participant to the dose. At study completion, participants could optionally complete a 2-week dose down-titration taper.</description>

        <description>The HAMD17 is a standardized instrument consisting of 17 items used to measure the severity of major depressive disorder (MDD) and improvements in depression symptoms. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 2 (marked). Higher scores indicated greater symptom severity. The total score was the sum of the scores from HAMD17 Items 1 through 17 and could have ranged from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed).</description>
