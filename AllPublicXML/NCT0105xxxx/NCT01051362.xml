    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is to explore the efficacy and toxicity of Pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin and Carboplatin in patients with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) not amenable to radiotherapy or surgical treatment. The planned enrollment for this
      trial is 48 patients (including a 10% rate for inevaluable patients).

      Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is the first antineoplastic drug derived from the new
      technology of liposome formulation to be introduced in clinical practice. The low myocardium
      uptake of this formulation accounts for its reduced cardiac toxicity, confirmed both in
      preclinical models and in humans. Preclinical data have shown activity in NSCLC xenografts.
      This Phase II study is to explore the efficacy and toxicity of Pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin and Carboplatin in patients with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) not amenable to radiotherapy or surgical treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma (squamous carcinoma,
             adenocarcinoma, or large cell carcinoma). Cytologic specimens obtained by brushings,
             washings, or needle aspiration of the defined lesion are acceptable. Mixed tumors with
             small-cell anaplastic elements are not eligible.

          -  Patients who have newly diagnosed unresectable stage III or IV disease are eligible.
             Patients with stage III disease should be ineligible for combined modality therapy
             (i.e., pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, etc.).

          -  Patients must not have received any prior antineoplastic chemotherapy for metastatic
             lung cancer prior to study entry.

          -  Patients who have had previous radiotherapy as definitive therapy for locally advanced
             non-small-cell are eligible as long as the recurrence is outside the original
             radiation port. Radiation therapy must have been completed greater than 4 weeks prior
             to registration.

          -  Male or female patients &gt;=18 years of age.

             informed consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of cardiac disease as defined by malignant hypertension, unstable angina,
             congestive heart failure of &gt; grade 2 per New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria,

             starting study drug, or patients who have not recovered from side effects of previous
             therapy.

          -  Patient is &lt;=5 years free of another primary malignancy, except if the other primary
             malignancy is not currently clinically significant or requiring active intervention,
             or if the other primary malignancy is a basal cell skin cancer or a cervical carcinoma
             in situ. Existence of any other malignant disease is not allowed.

          -  Concomitant use of any anti-cancer therapy or radiation therapy.
