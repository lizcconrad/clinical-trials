  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emphasizing the growing popularity of motion metrics are the majority of available virtual
      reality simulators and some newer hybrid models that offer motion tracking for performance
      assessment. A popular hybrid model (PROMIS) allows training with regular laparoscopic
      instruments in a box-trainer while automatically recording task duration and movement
      efficiency (pathlength and smoothness) that are immediately offered as feedback to trainees.

      Despite the increasing availability of simulators that track motion, our knowledge of the
      impact those metrics have on trainee learning is severely limited. We do not know if it is
      more important to use speed, accuracy, motion efficiency or a combination thereof for
      performance assessment and how these metrics impact skill transfer to the OR.

      Based on sound educational principles we have developed a proficiency-based laparoscopic
      suturing simulator curriculum. This curriculum focuses on deliberate and distributed
      practice, provides trainees with augmented feedback and sets expert-derived performance goals
      based on time and errors. We have previously demonstrated that this curriculum leads to
      improved operative performance of trainees compared to controls.

      To measure operative performance and determine transferability, we will use a live porcine
      Nissen fundoplication model. Instead of placing actual patients at risk, the porcine model is
      preferable for this purpose as it offers objective metrics (targets are established,
      distances measured, knots are disrupted for slippage scoring), complete standardization, and
      allows multiple individuals to be tested on the same day.

      We hypothesize that proficiency-based simulator training in laparoscopic suturing to
      expert-derived levels of speed and motion will result in better operative performance
      compared to participants training to levels of speed or motion alone. The study is powered to
      detect an at least 10% performance difference between the groups.

      Specific Aims

        1. Compare whether any performance differences between the groups persist long-term

        2. Assess whether the groups demonstrate differences in safety in the operating room by
           comparing the inadvertent injuries in the animal OR between the groups

        3. Identify the training duration required by novices to reach proficiency in laparoscopic
           suturing based on speed, motion efficiency, or a combination of these metrics

        4. Identify any baseline participant characteristics that may predict individual
           metric-specific performance

      OBJECTIVE:: We hypothesized that training to expert-derived levels of speed and motion will
      lead to improved learning and will translate to better operating room (OR) performance of
      novices than training to goals of speed or motion alone. BACKGROUND:: Motion tracking has
      been suggested to be a more sensitive performance metric than time and errors for the
      assessment of surgical performance. METHODS:: An institutional review board-approved, single
      blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at our level-I American College of
      Surgeons accredited Education Institute. Forty-two novices trained to proficiency in
      laparoscopic suturing after being randomized into 3 groups: The speed group (n = 14) had to
      achieve expert levels of speed, the motion group (n = 15) expert levels of motion (path
      length and smoothness), and the speed and motion group (n = 13) both levels. To achieve
      proficiency, all groups also had to demonstrate error-free performance. The FLS suture module
      (task 5) was used for training inside the ProMIS simulator that tracks instrument motion. All
      groups participated in transfer and retention tests in the OR. OR performance was assessed by
      a blinded expert rater using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills, speed,
      accuracy, and inadvertent injuries.
