  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether oral Ribavirin is safe and effective in
      treating patients with metastatic breast cancer, that have high levels of eIF4E.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overexpression of eIF4E occurs in greater than 50% of BC, where it has been associated with
      clinical progression, angiogenesis and chemoresistance. eIF4E protein expression is not
      elevated in stroma or in benign tissue. A major focus in the future management of BC is to
      develop novel targeted therapeutics, with associated biomarkers of clinical value. It is
      possible that targeting a central regulator that can control multiple pathways might be more
      effective than targeting a single downstream molecule. In our preclinical studies, we have
      demonstrated that ribavirin inhibits proliferation of BC cell lines at clinically achievable
      concentrations by inhibiting its target, eIF4E. This trial addresses the important clinical
      issue of the lack of treatment for poor prognosis BC, characterized by overexpression of
      eIF4E. We will explore the use of eIF4E as therapeutic target and a predictive marker. We
      will determine whether targeting eIF4E with ribavirin, a commercially approved, inexpensive,
      oral therapeutic compound with a favourable toxicity profile, may present a novel treatment
      option for patients with aggressive, metastatic disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer at diagnosis, with metastatic
             disease at the time of screening, who have progressed on prior anthracycline and
             taxane-containing regimens.

          -  Willing to have a screening biopsy performed from an easily accessible lesion (ex.
             skin, superficial lymph node), AND must have overexpression of eIF4E in the metastatic
             tissue.

          -  Easily accessible lesion for serial biopsies (ex. skin, superficial lymph node, or
             other easily accessible site).

          -  At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion (based on the RECIST criteria) outside
             the CNS.

          -  ECOG 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Adequate recovery (excluding alopecia) from previous surgery, radiation, and
             chemotherapy.

          -  Adequate wash-out period from last therapy for breast cancer (at least 3 weeks).

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          -  Age is ≥ 18 years. There is no upper age limit since the drug can be administered
