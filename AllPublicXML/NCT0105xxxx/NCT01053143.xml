    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of one dose of A/H1N1
      non-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine to support registration of the vaccine in India.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the safety profile (injection site reactions and systemic events) of the
           vaccine within 21 days following vaccination, and serious adverse events throughout the
           study in all subjects

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the immune response to the vaccine 21 days after vaccination by
           hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) testing in all subjects

        -  To describe the antibody persistence 6 months after vaccination by HAI testing in all
           subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each study participant will receive one dose of the study vaccine on Day 0, provide pre- and
      post-vaccination blood samples at 21 and 180 days for immunogenicity testing and undergo
      safety follow-up for 6 months post-vaccination.
