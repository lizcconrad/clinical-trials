      Background:

        -  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative and incurable neuromuscular disorder
           that is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron gene, SMN1, found on chromosome
           5. It is the leading inherited cause of infant mortality. SMA carriers (those who have
           the genetic mutation but do not have the disease) are often unaware of their status
           until they are tested.

        -  Researchers have been studying the prevalence of SMA carriers in the general population,
           but most of the information collected has come from populations within the United
           States, Europe, and Asia. Very few studies have been performed in Africa. Furthermore,
           this information does not provide much information regarding carrier frequency based on
           ethnic background and ancestry. To address this problem, researchers are interested in
           studying the prevalence of the SMA genetic mutation in the sub-Saharan nation of Mali.

      Objectives:

      - To collect blood samples for use in studying genetic data related to spinal muscular
      atrophy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Healthy volunteers who are at least 18 years of age.

        -  Volunteers will be of Malian ancestry and nationality.

      Study Location:

      -&lt;TAB&gt;Bamako, Mali, West Africa

      Design:

        -  The study will first collect blood samples from a small group of volunteers to run
           initial SMA carrier testing and resolve any technical difficulties before continuing
           with the study.

        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their personal and family medical
           history, including questions about illnesses, stillborns, and miscarriages, and then
           will provide blood samples for genetic research and testing.

      Objective

      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease that is caused
      by mutations in the survival motor neuron gene, SMN1. The objective of this study is to
      determine the SMN copy number distribution in the Malian population and to compare this to
      published data obtained elsewhere. It is anticipated that this study will help to refine the
      knowledge of SMA by assessing the distribution of SMN copy number, and the SMA carrier
      frequency in a sub-Saharan nation, thus expanding the information base available to
      clinicians and patients considering SMA carrier testing.

      Study Population

      The study population will include 1400 adult (18 years of age and older) volunteers only.

      Design

      Blood samples from volunteers will be collected from students at the School of Medicine,
      Pharmacy, and Dentistry (FMPOS) at the University of Bamako, which consists of an ethnically
      diverse population representative of the Malian ethnicities. No therapy will be provided to
      study participants.

      Outcome Measures

      Outcome measure for phase 1 is DNA extraction yield of sufficient quantity and quality for
      SMN genotyping by LabCorp in at least 90% of samples. Outcome measures for phase 2 are the
      frequency of SMA carriers (SMN1 deletion heterozygotes) and the SMN1 and SMN2 copy number
      distribution in Mali.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Medical students at the FMPOS of Malian ancestry and nationality who are 18 years of age
        and above will be considered for this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects may not be eligible to participate if they have a condition that would make a
        single 6 ml blood draw unsafe. Student assistants are ineligible for the study
        participation.
