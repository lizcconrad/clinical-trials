      The 2009 flu pandemic is a global outbreak of a new strain of influenza A virus subtype H1N1,
      commonly known as swine flu, that was first identified in April 2009. Large-scale
      immunization is an essential approach of controlling the pandemic.Vaccines are now becoming
      available for protection against pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 infection in some
      countries.In response to the pandemic, novel vaccines against the virus strain
      A/California/07/2009(H1N1) have been developed and recently were approved for vaccination
      among specific populations in China. However, the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines is
      of prime concern to the authorities and the public.This report details the findings of a
      observational clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity of a influenza A (H1N1)2009
      monovalent vaccine.

      The virus of Swine Flu H1N1 that outbroke in 2009 is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors
      (Oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) but have drug resistant to adamantanamine derivatives
      (amantadine and Flumadine), therefore neuraminidase inhibitors are recommended for antiviral
      therapy against Swine Flu H1N1, effect of which is evidence by the data that such drugs do
      modify the symptoms and decrease the death rate of H1N1 in America and Mexico. However,
      clinically, the investigators have encountered that this virus can infect resistant strains
      of Oseltamivir, which urges for a more effective treatment plan.

      In view of above situations, seeking for an effective measures against H1N1 flu should be a
      top priority and will benefit human life and economy globally. This Topic will take the
      classic strategy of passive immunity to perform basic and clinical researches on applying
      blood fix to treat critical H1N1 patients and collect blood of healthy persons who are
      inoculated with specific H1N1 vaccines to cure critical H1N1 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause
      of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread to many
      countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a
      pandemic on June 11, 2009. Antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir, may be
      effective in treating cases of swine flu, but large-scale immunization is an essential
      approach of controlling the pandemic.Although preliminary evidence from a matched
      case-control study suggests some protection from the 2008-9 trivalent inactivated vaccine
      against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009, particularly severe forms of the disease. A vaccine
      against H1N1 is expected to be the most effective tool for controlling influenza A (H1N1)
      infection.In response to the pandemic, novel vaccines against the virus strain
      A/California/07/2009(H1N1) have been developed and recently were approved for vaccination
      among specific populations in China.The primary safety objective of this study is to assess
      the safety of split- virion inactivated H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant when administered at
      the 15 ug dose.The primary immunogenicity objective is to assess the hemagglutinin antibody
      and neutralizing antibody response following split- virion inactivated A(H1N1) vaccine
      without adjuvant. Participants 148 healthy persons age 18-60 years who have no history of
      novel influenza H1N1 2009 infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is an
      observational, Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant females, aged 18-60
      years.This study is designed to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated
      influenza H1N1 virus vaccine after approved by the Chinese Food and Drug
      Administration.Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse
      events through 21 days. Immunogenicity testing will be hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
      assays and microneutralization (MN) assays on serum obtained on the day 0,7 and 21 after
      vaccination.In addition, we will take clinical researches on applying blood fix to treat
      critical H1N1 patients and collect blood of healthy persons who are inoculated with H1N1
      vaccines to cure critical H1N1 patients and further observe the effectiveness and safety, for
      the purpose of working out a new weapon against H1N1. According to the Blood Donation Law of
      the People's Republic of China, the blood donation shall follow principle of voluntary.The
      donors should be healthy persons inoculated with specific H1N1 vaccine and their titer of
      H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition antibody must be 1：320 or more than after examination (the
      kit shall be provided by the WHO) by Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and
      Prevention.
