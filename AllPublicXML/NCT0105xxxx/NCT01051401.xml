      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies rosuvastatin in treating women with
      cardiovascular complications who are undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. Rosuvastatin
      may prevent or lessen cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing chemotherapy for
      breast cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility of administering Rosuvastatin to breast cancer patients
      undergoing treatment with anthracyclines, paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab for
      breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive rosuvastatin orally (PO) once daily for 3 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive placebo PO once daily for 3 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
