  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beriplex® P/N is made from human plasma (the liquid part of the blood) and contains the
      coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X which are important for blood clotting (coagulation).
      Lack of any of these factors means that blood does not clot as quickly as it should and so
      there is an increased tendency to bleed. This observational study was designed to evaluate
      the effectiveness of Beriplex® P/N in the prevention (prophylaxis) and treatment of bleeding
      during surgery (perioperative bleeding) in a routine clinical setting.

        •≥ 16 years of age

          -  Received treatment with:

               -  Beriplex® P/N

               -  or FFP only

          -  Coagulopathy (INR &gt; 1.4 and/or PT ≥ 3 sec of upper limit of normal [ULN])

          -  Any planned major or minimally invasive procedure, except liver transplantation

        Cohort T (Treatment Group):

          -  Acquired deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (e.g., as induced
             by treatment with oral vitamin K antagonists)
