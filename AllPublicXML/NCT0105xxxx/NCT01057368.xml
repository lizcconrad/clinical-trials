  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is focused on the brain mechanisms and peripheral biological correlates of two
      different forms of meditation--mindfulness-based and compassion/loving-kindness. Project 1 is
      focused on the impact of compassion/loving-kindness meditation on emotional reactivity and
      emotion regulation. Project 2 is focused on the neural and behavioral correlates of
      mindfulness meditation and attention and pain regulation. In addition, Project 2 will examine
      the relations between changes in oscillatory rhythms during meditation and attention and pain
      processing. Project 3 will examine the impact of meditation on spontaneous brain activity
      during sleep. This project will also examine the impact of intensive meditation on regional
      changes in slow wave activity during subsequent sleep. Each of these projects will be
      conducted on the same participants so that interrelations among the various measures
      collected in the different projects can be examined. We believe that this study will
      dramatically advance the understanding of the mechanisms by which meditation produces changes
      in behavioral and biological processes.
