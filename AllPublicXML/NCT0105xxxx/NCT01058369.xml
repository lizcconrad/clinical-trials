  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study outline: Deferasirox (Exjade®) is regularly used in severe iron overload in order to
      avoid organ damage of liver, heart and other organs. It has been proposed, that iron overload
      may not only impose damage to other organs but also to the bone marrow and thus worsen
      hematopoietic insufficiency in patients with MDS. Patients presenting with low or INT-1 risk
      MDS with only mild iron overload will be treated with deferasirox in this study. It will be
      analyzed if hematological improvement can be observed during this treatment.
