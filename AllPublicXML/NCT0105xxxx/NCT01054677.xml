      Main aim and objective

      The aim was to present the treatment of infectious diseases in elderly, especially in nursing
      homes and further to evaluate the effect of an intervention package aiming at improving
      treatment with antibiotics in Swedish nursing homes

      Specific objectives

        -  Present the treatment patterns regarding infectious diseases, including gender aspects
           in elderly, especially in nursing homes.

        -  Through focus group discussions elucidate the decision making process in nursing homes
           and target the intervention.

        -  Based on the above information develop an educational intervention to contribute to the
           improvement of the prescribing of antibiotics in nursing homes

        -  Evaluate the effect of the intervention on quality of prescribing, knowledge and
           attitudes in relation to available guidelines
