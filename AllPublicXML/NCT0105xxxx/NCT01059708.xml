    <textblock>
      Carbon monoxide poisoning is common. Many adults with CO poisoning have long-term, even
      permanent brain injury following poisoning. However, very little is known about the long-term
      outcome of children with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. In this study we plan to perform
      cognitive (thinking) and vestibular (balance) testing in children (ages 6 to 16)at 6 weeks
      and 6 months following CO poisoning.

      At the 6-week visit, if the child and parents agree, we will ask each child to provide a DNA
      sample by one of three methods: mouthwash, spit collection, or swabbing the inside of the
      child's cheek. Each child's DNA will be analyzed for genes that are known to affect outcome
      following brain injury.

      Each child's participation in this study is expected to last 6 months. Testing will be
      scheduled around 6 weeks after the carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning episode. During testing,
      each child will be asked to complete tests that measure cognitive (thinking), emotional, and
      behavioral performance. We will collect information from each child's medical record about
      the CO poisoning episode, and we will have a parent complete a questionnaire about any
      problems he or she may have observed in their child since the poisoning. The cognitive
      testing will take about 3.5 hours at the 6-week interval, and 2.5 hours at the 6-month
      interval.

      Around the same time, each child will also be scheduled for vestibular (balance) testing at
      the Intermountain Hearing and Balance Center. Vestibular testing will occur twice, at 6-weeks
      and 6-months following poisoning.

      At the 6-week visit, if the child and parents agree, we will ask each child to provide a DNA
      sample by one of three methods: mouthwash, spit collection, or swabbing the inside of the
      child's cheek. Each child's DNA will be analyzed for genes that are known to affect outcome
      following brain injury such as apolipoprotein E, and the sample will also be stored for an
      indefinite period of time. If discoveries are made about other genes that affect outcome
      following brain injury, each child's DNA will be analyzed for those genes as well.

      The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of patients with cognitive sequelae
      (thinking complications or results) at 6 weeks and 6 months following CO poisoning.

      Secondarily, we will also determine:

        1. Which individual neurocognitive (thinking) outcomes at 6 weeks and 6 months differ from
           normative data.

        2. Whether there is a difference in neurocognitive (thinking) outcomes between measurement
           at 6 weeks and 6 months.

        3. If there is a difference in the vestibular (balance) health of patients between
           measurements at 6 weeks and 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 6 through 16.

          2. Acute carbon monoxide poisoning. Since we will be identifying potentially eligible
             patients using an electronic tool, the diagnosis of CO poisoning should be established
             by the evaluating physician. However, with the initial contact with the patients'
             parents, we will confirm the diagnosis, and only those patients with CO poisoning will
             be eligible.

          3. Willing to come to Salt Lake City or Provo for evaluation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior history of neurological injury with permanent sequelae.

          2. Prior history of chronic neurological disorder such as attention deficit disorder,
             learning disability, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, demyelinating disease,
             meningitis with sequelae

          3. Insulin dependent diabetes (due to the confound of possible brain microvascular
             disease and episodes of hypoglycemia)

          4. Use of illicit drugs

          5. Use of alcohol in excess

          6. Pregnancy

          7. Carbon monoxide poisoning from a suicide attempt or concomitant smoke inhalation

          8. Subject or parent/guardian non-English-speaking
