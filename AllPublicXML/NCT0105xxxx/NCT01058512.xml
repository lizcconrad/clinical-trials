      The purpose of this research study is to find out the effect of the investigational drug
      NOV-205 on the level of hepatitis C virus in the blood and whether NOV-205 is well-tolerated
      at different doses when taken by subjects with hepatitis C.

             (as determined by presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)

          -  Have received pegylated interferon and/or ribavirin within the 60 days prior to
             enrollment

          -  Any known preexisting medical condition that could interfere with the subject's
