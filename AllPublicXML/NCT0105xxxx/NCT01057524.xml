  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) has been shown to increase tracheal mucus
      clearance compared with a control group. These observations led to the development of The
      Vest® which is a non-stretchable jacket connected to an air-pulse generator and worn by the
      patient over the chest wall. The generator rapidly inflates and deflates The Vest®, which
      gently compresses and releases the chest wall between 5 and 20 times per second. This
      generates mini-coughs that are said to dislodge mucus from the bronchial walls and to
      facilitate its movement up the airways. The Vest® has been shown to reduce the viscosity of
      mucus and this should further enhance mucus clearance.

      People with cystic fibrosis (CF), admitted to hospital with an acute infective pulmonary
      exacerbation, should increase the frequency and duration of their airway clearance sessions
      owing to the increase in quantity and viscosity of purulent bronchial secretions.In the
      United Kingdom, and in many other countries, the availability of physiotherapists to assist
      with the recommended number of daily treatments is insufficient to meet patient need. If the
      use of high frequency chest wall oscillation, in addition to 'usual' self airway clearance
      techniques, in the early morning and evening was to facilitate recovery from an exacerbation,
      this would indicate an important place for high frequency chest wall oscillation in the
      management of people with cystic fibrosis.

      Hypothesis:

      The addition of high frequency chest wall oscillation to twice daily supervised physiotherapy
      is as effective as the addition of self treatment in facilitating recovery from an acute
      infective pulmonary exacerbation, as measured by improvement in lung function, specifically
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).
