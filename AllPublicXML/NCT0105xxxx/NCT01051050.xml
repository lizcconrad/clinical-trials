  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve surgical residents' skills in critically appraising the
      literature and to promote the dissemination and application of the best available evidence to
      surgical practice. The hypothesis is that mandatory participation, with faculty oversight, in
      a journal club wiki will improve the dissemination, evaluation, and application of
      evidence-based medicine (EBM) in a surgical residency program at University of Texas Health
      Science Center at Houston (UT-Houston).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The translation of evidence-based medicine (EBM) to clinical practice requires training in
      literature searching and critical appraisal, which is particularly lacking in surgery. The
      demands of surgical residency coupled with the 80-hour work week make attendance at journal
      clubs suboptimal. Internet technology such as wikis, which are free user-friendly
      collaborative websites, may be a solution to improving resident participation in journal
      club-related activities, but their utility is highly dependent upon resident contributions
      and usage. We propose a pilot randomized trial of mandatory versus voluntary participation in
      a general surgery journal club wiki to verify its feasibility, sustainability, and impact on
      resident EBM skills as measured with a validated questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will
      include resident self-assessment of wiki usage and comfort with EBM skills and
      faculty-assessed resident application of these skills in weekly morbidity and mortality
      conferences. If the wiki is feasible and sustainable, then the project will be expanded to
      include other surgical disciplines and cohorts (i.e. students, fellows, other institutions,
      other medical disciplines) to ensure generalizability. If beneficial, wikis could not only
      improve resident EBM skills, but also have a halo effect on students and faculty, and
      ultimately wikis could improve patient care. The assembled multi-disciplinary and
      multi-institutional team has significant collective expertise in evidence-based medicine,
      medical education, library skills, and clinical trial design and analysis which are necessary
      for this project.
