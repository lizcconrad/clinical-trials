      This is a Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-day repeat oral, dose
      ranging study to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      effects of SP-304 in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation.

      This is a Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 14-day repeat oral, dose
      ranging study to determine the safety, PK and PD effects of SP-304 in patients with chronic
      idiopathic constipation. Subjects diagnosed with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) will
      be screened for the anticipated 4 cohorts, to yield 80 randomized subjects for enrollment.
      Three dose cohorts are planned (1.0 mg, 3.0mg, 9.0 mg and 0.3 mg) with 20 subjects per dose
      cohort [randomization ratio 3:1 (15 receive SP-304:5 receive placebo)]. Subjects who continue
      to meet all the entry criteria and complete the pre-treatment bowel movement (BM) diary will
      receive, in a double-blind, randomized fashion, SP-304 or matching placebo. It is expected
      that each subject will complete all 14 days of dosing (including making accurate BM diary
      entries for all 14 days in the treatment period). All subjects receiving at least one dose of
      SP-304 or matching placebo will be considered evaluable for the safety endpoints. If a
      subject receives at least 5 doses per treatment week (1 dose per day for 7 days) and has
      completed BM diary entries for those 5 dosing days in each corresponding treatment week,
      he/she will be considered evaluable.
