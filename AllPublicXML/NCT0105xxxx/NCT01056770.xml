  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The currently available stock of smallpox vaccine would be insufficient in the face of an
      incident of smallpox attack. Thus, new manufacturing methods for smallpox vaccine are
      urgently needed because previous manufacturing methods using calf lymph are no longer
      acceptable in the view of current standards. Recently, CJ corporation in Republic of Korea
      has developed cell-culture derived smallpox vaccine (CJ-50300) which was manufactured by
      infecting MRC-5 cells. The aim of this clinical trial were to assess safety, reactogenicity,
      and immunogenicity of CJ-50300.
