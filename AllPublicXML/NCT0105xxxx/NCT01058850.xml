    <textblock>
      This is a research study of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. We hope to learn
      about the safety and efficacy of treating pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma patients
      with the EGFRvIII peptide vaccine after conventional radiation.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        3.1.1 Patients must be at least 3 years of age and ≤ 18 years of age at the time of study
        enrollment.

        3.1.2 Patients must have clinical findings and neuroradiographic findings consistent with
        diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Histologic confirmation of diagnosis is not required for
        diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. A copy of the MRI must be submitted for verification of
        eligibility.

        3.1.3 Patients must have received conventional radiation therapy of total radiation dosage
        ranging from 5400 to 6000 cGy administered in fractions of 150 to 200 cGy over 6 weeks.

        3.1.4 Treatment must start 14 to 28 days after completion of conventional radiation

        3.1.5 Patients receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy must be on a tapering or stable
        low (2 mg twice daily) dose of dexamethasone two weeks after conventional radiation.

        3.1.6 Patients life expectancy must be greater or equal to 8 weeks.

        3.1.7 Patients must have a performance status (Lansky or Karnofsky) ≥ 50.

        3.1.8 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ mm3.

        3.1.9 Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL.

        3.1.10 Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL.

        3.1.11 Serum bilirubin ≤ 5.0 mg/dL.

        3.1.12 If female, patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum β-hCG
        pregnancy test.

        3.1.13 Both male and female patients must agree to use hormonal or barrier birth control
        with spermicidal gel to avoid pregnancy during the study.

        3.1.14 The patient and/or their guardian must have the ability to understand and the
        willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria

        3.2.1 Prior therapy for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, aside from surgery, conventional
        radiation, and temozolomide.

        3.2.2 Use of any experimental drug for any reason within the 60 days prior to treatment.

        3.2.3 Active infection requiring treatment.

        3.2.4 Known medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise
        the patient's ability to participate in the study. This would include chronic active
        hepatitis infection, known immunosuppressive disease or concurrent neurodegenerative
        disease.

        3.2.5 Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine treatment,
        including GM-CSF, yeast derived products, or a history of anaphylactic reactions to
        shellfish proteins.

        3.2.6 Pregnant women and women who are breast-feeding.
