      The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, to determine whether nebulized RNS60 is safe in
      healthy human subjects and in subjects with mild asthma, in a single-dose administration.
      Second, to determine whether nebulized RNS60 is safe in human subjects with mild-to-moderate
      asthma over a 4-week period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For single-dose safety (Groups 1a and 1b):

        1. Male or female, aged 18 to 65 years.

        2.1. For healthy subjects; clinically considered &quot;healthy&quot; and no diagnosis of asthma.

        2.2. For subjects with mild asthma, clinical diagnosis of mild chronic asthma as determined
        by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) 2007 guidelines, and who are not
        regularly using a chronic asthma medication (&lt; 3 doses/week).

        3. Subjects must be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and provide
        written, voluntary informed consent.

        4. Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test (serum) at the time
        of study entry.

        For multi-dose safety study (Group 2e):

          1. Male or female, aged 18 to 65 years.

          2. Patients with clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate asthma, as determined by NHLBI
             2007 guidelines, who are not already using a chronic asthma medication.

          3. Historical documentation of asthma in the patient's medical record.

          4. Men and women of reproductive potential who document use of adequate contraception
             during the study and for 1 month following the last day of treatment (Day 28).

          5. Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test (serum) at the time
             of study entry.

          6. Subjects, or their legal guardians, must be capable of understanding the purpose and
             risks of the study and provide written, voluntary informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria (for all groups of the study):

          1. With a chronic or acute disease that might interfere with the evaluation of RNS60
             therapy.

          2. Pregnancy or lactation.

          3. Current or prior malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin carcinoma or carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix that has been adequately treated).

          4. History of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV); or Hepatitis A virus (HAV).

          5. Infections that require intravenous antibiotic therapy.

          6. Significant organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, liver, CNS, pulmonary,
             vascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or metabolic (e.g., creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL; ALT
             or AST ≥ 1.5x the upper limit of normal; history of myocardial infarction, congestive
             heart failure, or arrhythmias within 6 months prior to study entry).

          7. Treatment with a humanized or chimeric antibody therapy within 4 weeks prior to study
             entry.

          8. Treatment with any investigational drugs or therapies within 4 weeks prior to study
             entry.

          9. Any use of antidepressants or other psychiatric medicine in the previous 4 weeks days.

         10. Group 1b: Any use of oral, systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment. Group 2e: Any use of oral, systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior
             to enrollment.
