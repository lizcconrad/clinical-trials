  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A physical training program will improve quality of life, participation in physical activity,
      motor coordination, muscle strength, and bone and muscle strength in children with
      neurofibromatosis type 1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disorders of the Ras pathway have significant phenotypic overlap and include Noonan syndrome,
      CFC syndrome, Legius syndrome, Costello syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is
      one of the most common genetic disorders presenting in childhood with an incidence of 1/3000.
      NF1 is associated with skeletal abnormalities such as short stature, scoliosis, and long bone
      fracture with non-union. We recently reported that children with NF1 have abnormalities of
      bone and muscle architecture as evidenced by decreased bone mineral density, decreased bone
      strength, and low muscle mass, all of which may predispose them to fractures and scoliosis
      (Stevenson et al., 2005, 2007, 2009). Our preliminary data show that children with NF1 have
      poor motor coordination and muscle strength, potentially secondary to abnormal neuromotor
      learning. We hypothesize that poor motor coordination and decreased muscle strength
      contribute to the osteopenia in NF1. Our objective is to identify effective and non-invasive
      strategies to improve motor coordination, muscle strength, and bone and muscle architecture
      in children with disorders of the Ras pathway, in hopes of decreasing fractures and improving
      physical activity levels. Plyometric physical training consists of quick, high-intensity,
      weight-bearing movements, and is an encouraging intervention for use in these children.

    <description>The intervention is a year long individualized plyometric exercise training program. Examples of plyometric activities include jumping, hopping, running, and throwing. The number of plyometric exercises will increase gradually to prevent over training to a total of 5 lower extremity exercises and 5 upper extremity exercises</description>
