      The purpose of this single center, 2-week open-label pilot study is to explore the potential
      usefulness of a heated lidocaine 70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg topical patch for the treatment
      of pain associated with shoulder impingement syndrome. A number of efficacy variables will be
      employed to evaluate their utility for assessing painful responses in this population.
