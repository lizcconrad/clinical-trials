  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer and its treatments can take a toll on the physical and psychosocial well-being
      of cancer survivors. Few interventions can help breast cancer patients improve their physical
      strength, stamina, and overall well-being. Developing ways to facilitate PA behavior during
      chemotherapy for breast cancer are necessary. This trial explores ways that breast cancer
      patients receiving chemotherapy can learn about and engage in PA during chemotherapy. This
      trial will also give Southern Alberta breast cancer survivors an opportunity to participate
      in evidence-based programs designed to facilitate their health, breast cancer recovery, and
      disease-free survival.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that women receiving the PA intervention resource kit
      will report a more positive change in self-reported PA at the end of chemotherapy treatments
      when compared to the group receiving standard materials.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare the effects of an evidence-based intervention consisting of targeted breast-cancer
      specific PA print materials (i.e., Exercise for health), a step pedometer, a step-walking
      guidebook (i.e., Step into survivorship), and a physical activity and step journal (INT) to a
      comparison group receiving a generic, two-page public health PA resource (Standard Material:
      SM).

    <description>The Intervention group (INT) will receive a Physical Activity Resource Kit which includes a step pedometer, a breast cancer-specific Physical Activity Guidebook (Exercise for health), a step pedometer resource (Step into survivorship), and a physical activity and step journal to record their daily step totals and daily physical activities.
Participants will be instructed to wear their pedometer for the entire duration of the study (i.e., chemotherapy duration).</description>
