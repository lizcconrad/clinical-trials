    <textblock>
      The study is conducted as a randomized, non-blinded, 2-way crossover study. Target population
      is 60 Japanese healthy male adult subjects selected by screening examination which will be
      conducted within 4 weeks before the first drug administration of period 1 (before the
      hospitalization of period 1). Subjects will admit in the clinical institute on Day -3 and be
      discharged on Day 6 in each period. During hospitalization, standardized phosphate diet from
      Day -2 to Day 4 will start approximately 20 minutes before dosing. Subject will take about
      1300 mg of phosphate evenly at breakfast lunch and dinner for each day. Subject should
      consume at least 95% of a meal. Distilled water not to include phosphate will be used for
      drinking water and meal. Subjects are to drink at least 1 L of distilled water every day in
      clinic to make sure enough urine volume. The 24 hours urine collection will be conducted
      between Day -2 and Day 4 to investigate the urinary phosphate excretion.BAY77-1931 granule
      500 mg or Fosrenol chewable tablet 500 mg will be administered three times daily after each
      meal from Day 1 to Day 4. On day 4 single dose after breakfast will be administered. Study
      drugs will be administered immediately after each meal, that is within 20 minutes after start
      of each meal with 240 mL of distilled water. A Fosrenol chewable tablet 500 mg will be taken
      after chewing completely.
