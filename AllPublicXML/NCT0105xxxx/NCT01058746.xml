  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us learn what the best amount of fluid is that patients
      should receive during pancreas surgery. Patients will receive either the liberal fluid amount
      for this surgery or a restricted fluid amount.

      Both amounts of fluid have been used safely in patients having similar surgeries. These
      amounts have not been compared in pancreatic surgery. The fluids regimens that will be given
      are not experimental.

      This study will compare patients in the liberal and restricted fluid groups in terms of the
      nature of any surgical complications (problems)and recovery from surgery, including length of
      hospital stay.
