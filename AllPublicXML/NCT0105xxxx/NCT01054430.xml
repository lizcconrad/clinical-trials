        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects must be 21-75 years of age; inclusive. Healthy control subjects (Cohort
             1) must be medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results and
             hepatically impaired subjects (Cohorts 2 and 3) must have mild or moderate hepatic
             impairment based on the Child-Pugh Classification.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Main exclusion criteria for healthy control subjects (Cohort 1) include history or
             clinical evidence of clinically relevant cardiovascular (including thromboembolic
             disorders), hepatic, renal, hematologic, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             psychiatric or neurological impairment; any clinically significant laboratory
             abnormalities as judged by the investigatorInvestigator; systolic blood pressure &lt; 90
             or &gt;160 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 or &gt; 90 mmHg; allergy to or previous
             adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors; use of prescription or over-the-counter drugs
             that are known to interfere with metabolism by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme within
             30 days of screening; use of any investigational drug within 30 days of screening; use
             of any prescription or over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies within 14 days of
             screening; history of alcohol or drug abuse within 18 months, history of smoking
             within 6 months; positive breath alcohol test; positive serology for HIV, HCV, HBsAg;
             blood donation or significant blood loss within 56 days of dosing; plasma donation
             within 7 days of dosing.

        Main exclusion criteria for hepatically impaired subjects (Cohorts 2 and 3) include any
        significant concurrent medical condition or history of significant medical conditions other
        than hepatic impairment that may affect the interpretation of the data or which otherwise
        contraindicates participation in this study; acute exacerbation of or unstable hepatic
        disease, as indicated by worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic
        impairment, within the 2 weeks preceding study drug administration; history of esophageal
        variceal bleeding within past 6 months; history of bleeding or non-bleeding gastric
        varices; history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis within the past 3 months; history of
        portosystemic surgical shunt; autoimmune liver disease; history of organ transplant;
        Wilson's disease; diagnosis of cholestatic liver disease (e.g., primary biliary cirrhosis
        or primary sclerosing cholangitis); history of recent symptomatic cryoglobulinemia;
        alcoholic hepatitis, determined clinically or by histology; initiation of any new
        prescription or over the counter medications within 14 days before study drug
        administration and hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL, positive for AFP.
