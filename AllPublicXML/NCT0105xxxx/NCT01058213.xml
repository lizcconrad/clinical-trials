  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16 week exercise training program for people with severe to very severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of this study is to find out if performing
      strength training prior to initiating exercise training on a stationary bicycle is associated
      with greater gains in functional status than bicycle training alone or concurrent bicycle and
      strength training together.

      Volunteers are randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1). 8 weeks of resistance (strength)
      training followed by 8 weeks of bicycle exercise training, 2). 8 weeks of chair exercise
      followed by 8 weeks of resistance (strength) training and bicycle exercise training, or 3). 8
      weeks of chair exercise followed by 8 weeks of bicycle exercise training. The length of the
      training is 16 weeks for all 3 groups. Volunteers train 3 days per week in our lab located in
      the Chicagoland area and are supervised by an exercise specialist.

    <description>Supervised training will be performed on a cable exercise system (Body Solid, Forest Park, IL) using six exercises that involve concentric and eccentric muscle actions: leg press, knee flexion, knee extension, calf raise, hip adduction, hip abduction. Subjects will perform the lower extremity exercises under the direct supervision of an exercise specialist three times per week. Subjects will perform 2 sets of 8-10 repetitions at 70% of their maximum strength for 2 weeks, then will perform 2 sets of 8-10 repetitions at 80% of their maximal strength for 2 weeks, and for the next 4 weeks they will perform 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions at 80% of their maximal strength. Sets will be separated by at least a 2-3 minute rest period for multiple-joint exercises and at least 1-2 minutes for single-joint exercises. A moderate velocity of muscle contraction (~1-2 seconds for concentric and eccentric contraction) will be used.</description>

    <description>Cycle ergometry training will be performed in the lab on a stationary cycle ergometer, calibrated with a 4 kg weight (Monark 828E, Varberg, Sweden). Initial work rate will be 50% of peak work rate (PWR) as tolerated and will be evaluated weekly with progressive increases targeted to achieve the highest work rate tolerated for 3-5 minutes{: wks 1-2 50% PWR, wks 3-4 60% PWR, wks 5-6 70% PWR, wks 7-8 80% PWR}. An interval training protocol will be used with subjects performing four work sets of five minutes duration separated by rest intervals of unloaded cycling lasting 2-4 minutes.</description>
