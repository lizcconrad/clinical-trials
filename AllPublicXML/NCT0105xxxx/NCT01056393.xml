    <textblock>
      This protocol serves to extend the successful treatment for HIV positive patients beyond the
      endpoints provided by the Phase 2b TaiMed Biologics-sponsored protocol TMB202 (entitled &quot;A
      Phase 2b Randomized, Double-Blinded, 48-Week, Multicenter, Dose-Response Study of Ibalizumab
      Plus an Optimized Background Regimen in Treatment-Experienced Patients Infected with HIV-1
      (Amended to 24 Week Study)&quot;), for 24 weeks. Ibalizumab may be administered beyond 24 weeks
      under this protocol as supply permits and patients continue to demonstrate virologic
      response.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ibalizumab is to be administered to HIV-infected patients that have responded (defined as a
      minimum 0.7 log10 decline in HIV-1 viral load from TMB-202 Baseline) on the TMB-202 protocol.
      In addition to the investigator-selected Optimized Background Regimen, patient(s) will
      continue to receive the TMB-202 randomized dose of ibalizumab in open-labeled fashion (800mg
      IV every two weeks or 2000mg IV every four weeks) as per their original drug assignment for
      the TMB-202 protocol.
