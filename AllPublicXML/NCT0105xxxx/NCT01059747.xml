    <textblock>
      Addiction has been regarded as one of the most serious health and social problems in Taiwan,
      and heroin is currently considered to be the major substance of abuse. The most widely used
      treatment to date is methadone replacement therapy. It is reported that to achieve a better
      clinical response and to avoid possible side effects, the blood level of methadone should
      remain in a certain level. However, the blood level of methadone is mediated by various
      factors besides dosage. Genetic variability in genes that encodes enzymes affecting methadone
      metabolism, target receptors of methadone, and drug-drug interaction by other medication
      patients take will all affect blood level. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and
      pharmacogenomic study is crucial for evaluating and predicting the clinical response, cause
      of side effects or toxicity, as well as studies on drug-drug interactions.

      This is a cross-sectional study in order to evaluate the relationship between methadone
      plasma level and clinical response in patients under methadone maintenance therapy and to
      identify optimal therapeutic thresholds. HPLC will be used to analyze methadone and its
      metabolites. Our hypothesis is that methadone plasma levels in patients who are responsive to
      methadone maintenance therapy are higher than level in non-responsive patients, and higher
      plasma level leads to less severe withdrawal symptoms. We will also test if an optimal
      minimal dosage exists among these patients. In the meanwhile, we will aim to test if
      methadone level and clinical response is correlated with different genetic polymorphism.
      Candidate genes that involve in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic process of methadone
      (e.g. CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, ABCB1, opioid mu receptor and kappa receptor) will be genotyped
      for these analyses.

      The results of this study will provide clinical information of methadone treatment and
      pharmacogenomic data in Taiwanese for clinicians to achieve a better treatment outcome.
