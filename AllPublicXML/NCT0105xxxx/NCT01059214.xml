      Background:

        -  INFUSE AMI is an ongoing clinical trial examining how patients with heart attacks are
           treated. The study's aim is to help determine the best way to treat patients with
           specific kinds of heart attacks caused by blood clots.

        -  To evaluate the effect of the heart attack on the heart tissue and function,
           participants in the INFUSE-AMI study will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of
           the heart at specific times after their heart attack.

      Objectives:

      - To perform cardiac MRI scans on patients who are participating in the INFUSE-AMI study.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are enrolled in the INFUSE-AMI study.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have an MRI scan of the heart about 5 days and between 23 and 44 days
           after their heart attack. The MRI scan at day 5 is optional.

        -  Participants will provide a blood sample prior to the MRI scan.

        -  During the scan, participants will be given a contrast drug to show the blood flow to
           and within the heart. An electrocardiogram will be used to monitor the heart during the
           procedure.

        -  No other treatment will be provided in this protocol.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research protocol is to perform contrast enhanced cardiac MRI studies on
      patients enrolled in the INFUSE-AMI study (INFUSE-AMI is a multicenter, open-label controlled
      single-blind randomized study with up to 452 patients enrolled in approximately 50 US and
      European sites). Patients who present with anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction by
      electrocardiogram (STEMI) and an occluded proximal or mid left anterior descending artery
      (LAD) with TIMI 0/1 flow will be eligible for randomization to one of the following arms: 1)
      Local infusion of Abciximab and thrombus aspiration, 2) Local infusion of Abciximab and no
      thrombus aspiration, 3) No local infusion and thrombus aspiration, or 4) No local infusion
      and no thrombus aspiration. Cardiac MRI is performed to assess left ventricular function and
      infarct size for the primary INFUSE-AMI study. Thus, this local research protocol will
      provide the cardiac MRI scans at no cost to the participant. Additional images of the heart
      will be obtained for local research purposes. Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at around 5
      days (optional) and at 30 days after myocardial infarction.
