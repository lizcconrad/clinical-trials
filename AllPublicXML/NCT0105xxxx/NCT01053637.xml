      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To determine whether oral narcotic medication versus placebo improves the pain and
           anxiety scores for pediatric patients requiring laceration repair in the pediatric
           emergency department and receiving the standard of care with lidocaine treatment

        -  To evaluate for a statistical difference in pain scores in children during laceration
           repair

        -  To evaluate for a statistical difference in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children
           (STAIC) scores during laceration repair
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in a tertiary care
      pediatric emergency department with an annual census of 80,000 visits per year. Patients will
      be randomized by a randomization table with block randomization in the pharmacy to the oral
      narcotic or placebo group, and the pharmacist will be the only person aware of the
      randomization status of the patient. Allocation concealment will be ensured by opaque, sealed
      envelopes kept in the Emergency Department Pharmacy. Guardians of patients age 2 to 17 years
      of age will be consented for enrollment.
