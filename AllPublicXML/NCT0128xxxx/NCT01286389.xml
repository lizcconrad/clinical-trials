  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has been associated with cognitive impairments, lower blood flow, metabolic activity
      and brain volume. Obesity in adulthood is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in the
      elderly. The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition that may precede dementia. We
      hypothesized that promotion of weight loss in obese people with MCI, through caloric
      restriction could lead to improvement in cognitive performance or reduction in the rate of
      decline and decreased risk of dementia. A sample of 80 patients aged ≥ 60 years, obese, with
      MCI, will be randomized to two groups that will be followed for 12 months. The control group
      will receive conventional medical care. The intervention group will receive nutritional
      counseling individually and in groups, aiming to promote weight loss through caloric
      restriction, and medical monitoring. Before and after intervention patients will be evaluated
      for anthropometry, body composition, physical performance, control of comorbidities,
      laboratory tests (glucose, insulin, lipid profile, leptin, adiponectin, interleukin 6, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha, CRP), Genotyping apolipoprotein E, neuropsychological battery,
      questionnaires about activities of daily living, physical activity and diet.

      Objectives: To evaluate the cognitive performance of obese patients with MCI and the effect
      of weight loss induced by caloric restriction on cognition, conversion to dementia, to assess
      weight loss, changes in inflammatory and metabolic parameters, change in physical capacity,
      performance in neuropsychological tests and correlate with effects of the intervention.
      Methods: The patients will be randomized to two groups that will be followed for 12 months.
      The control group will receive conventional medical care. The intervention group will receive
      nutritional counseling individually and in groups, aiming to promote weight loss (10% of body
      weight) through caloric restriction, and medical monitoring. Everyone will be advised to
      physical activity. Before and after 12 months patients will be evaluated for anthropometry,
      body composition, physical performance, control of comorbidities, laboratory tests (glucose,
      insulin, lipid profile, leptin, adiponectin, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha,
      CRP), Genotyping apolipoprotein E, neuropsychological battery, questionnaires about
      activities of daily living, physical activity and diet.

    <description>Nutritional guidance: through at least 2 individual assistance and group sessions, lasting 1 hour, weekly for 4 months, and biweekly for 2 months and monthly thereafter (26-28 meetings/1year).The diet plan will recommend a deficit from 500 to 750 kcal/day in order to promote loss of about 0.5kg/week, containing 1g/kg of protein per day (minimum 1200kcal/day), high in fiber, vegetables and whole foods. The goal of weight loss will be 10% of initial weight. Group activities consist of lectures on nutrition education, food composition and its importance to health, food preparation techniques, self-monitoring weight, eating behavior and count calories.</description>
