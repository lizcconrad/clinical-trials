  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 6-month, parallel, non-interventional trial investigating the level of adherence and the
      impact of dosing in open-angle glaucoma patients who receive either unfixed therapy with
      latanoprost once in the evening and timolol twice daily, or latanoprost/timolol fixed
      combination therapy once in the evening. All patients participating in this observational
      study will be monitored for their adherence with the use of Medication Event Monitoring
      System (MEMS). At the end of treatment periods treatment satisfaction will be assessed with
      selected questions from the Treatment Satisfaction Survey-Intraocular Pressure survey. This
      study will monitor objectively, for the first time, adherence and intraocular pressure
      control with fixed versus unfixed therapy. Finally it will help us to elucidate the impact of
      dosing (once-a-day versus three-times-daily) on the level of adherence in glaucoma.

    <description>To document satisfaction with therapy this study will employ questions selected from a validated treatment satisfaction questionnaire (questions 10-15, Treatment Satisfaction Survey-Intraocular Pressure) as published by Day et al (Eye 2006; 20: 583-590). The survey will assess the level of satisfaction and overall quality-of-life with latanoprost/timolol fixed combination versus unfixed therapy in this study.</description>
