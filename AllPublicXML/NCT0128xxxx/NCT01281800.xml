  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised Phase II clinical trial to assess and compare efficacy and safety
      profile of cisplatin and pemetrexed against cisplatin and low-dose gemcitabine in long
      infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin is now considered the standard systemic treatment for
      mesothelioma. Three arguments against such a position are: 1. Pemetrexed in combination with
      cisplatin was registered for mesothelioma on the basis of superiority over cisplatin alone, a
      clearly suboptimal control arm; 2. Several Phase II trials of gemcitabine in standard doses
      or as low-dose in long infusion in combination with cisplatin have shown at least comparable
      activity; 3. Due to high cost, pemetrexed is not available to many patients in countries with
      limited health care resources. During the past five years, our research team in Ljubljana
      conducted a Phase II trial of low-dose gemcitabine (250 mg/m2) in 6-hours infusion and
      cisplatin for patients with mesothelioma. In an unselected population of patients including
      those in poor performance status, elderly, patients with advanced extrathoracic disease and
      patients in progression after previous chemotherapy, the response rate was 54%, and median
      survival was 16.5 months. On the basis of this favourable experience and in search of
      cost-effective treatment for mesothelioma, we here propose a randomised Phase II clinical
      trial to compare efficacy and safety profile of cisplatin and pemetrexed against cisplatin
      and low-dose gemcitabine in long infusion. The primary endpoints are response rate and time
      to progression; secondary endpoints are survival, toxicity and quality of life.

    <description>TREATMENT A:
Day 1: Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 Cycle every 3 weeks. Supportive treatment: folic acid [Tifol 400 mg tbl (350-1000 mg), beginning 7 days before CT, every day, till 3 week after the KT], vitamin B-12 [OH-B12 i.m., beginning in 7 days before CT, than at 3. + 6. cycles of KT + 9. week after the KT], corticosteroids, hydration, antiemetic, LMW heparin as thromboprophylaxis.
In the absence of progression, 4 cycles of chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin will be given, followed by two additional cycles of pemetrexed as monotherapy.
TREATMENT B:
Days 1 and 8: gemcitabine 250 mg/m2 in 6 hours day 2: cisplatin 75 mg/m2 Cycle every 3 weeks. Supportive treatment: corticosteroids, hydration, antiemetics, LMW heparin as thromboprophylaxis.
In the absence of progression, 4 cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin will be given, followed by two additional cycles of gemcitabine alone as monotherapy.</description>
