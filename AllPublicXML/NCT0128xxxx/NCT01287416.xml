      Primary Hypothesis: Participants in the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST)
      gatekeeper training will be significantly more likely to have increased knowledge and
      preparedness to help people with suicidal ideation than participants who receive the
      resilience retreat.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

        1. Participants in ASIST gatekeeper training will not have higher levels of
           post-intervention distress or suicidal ideation compared to the resilience retreat.

        2. High levels of distress, grief, and alcohol abuse will significantly impact on the
           learning and retention of suicide intervention skills.

      Inclusion criterion: All members of the Swampy Cree Tribal communities who are currently
      residing on the reserves will be eligible to participate in the study.

      Exclusion criterion: Exclusion criteria for the study include being less than 16 years of
      age, prior training in SafeTALK or ASIST, being an elected official in a First Nations
      community, and inability to read or write.

      Primary outcome: Skills in Suicide Intervention: Suicide Intervention Response Inventory.The
      Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI) will be used to detect enhancement of
      intervention skills in participants. The SIRI is a self-administered test that was designed
      to measure competence in choosing appropriate response to a series of clinical scenarios with
      suicidal individuals. Research on the SIRI has shown its good psychometric properties,
      freedom from social desirability effects, and responsiveness to training in suicide
      prevention. It contains 25 items, each of which consists of a &quot;client&quot; remark and two
      &quot;helper&quot; responses. Responses are judged based on response options made by highly expert
      suicidologists. The SIRI has shown good internal consistency with alpha of 0.834, and good
      test-retest reliability.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        -  Knowledge about suicide, attitudes toward suicide, and self-reported preparedness to
           intervene with suicidal behavior will be measured by a series of questions that were
           developed by LivingWorks Inc.

        -  Gatekeeper behaviors will be measured similar to questions utilized by Wyman in the
           school-based study that assess how many people had the person asked others about
           suicide.

    <description>ASIST is a 2-day intensive, interactive and practice-dominated course aimed at enabling people to recognize risk and learn how to intervene immediately to prevent suicide. The training is designed for anyone (especially those in a position of trust), from professionals and volunteers to members of the community. Participants range from those in caring roles to people concerned about family members or friends. The theory is that suicide can be pre¬vented with the help of prepared caregivers. ASIST is designed to help all caregivers become more willing, ready and able to help persons at risk. Just as &quot;CPR&quot; skills make physical first aid possible, training in suicide intervention develops the skills used in suicide first aid.</description>

The RR included four main components: (1) Seven Sacred Teachings; (2) Self-identity—focused on knowing your identity, the past, and celebrating your history. Following the presentation, participants divided into community groups for discussion and then reconvened with all attendees to share discussion points; (3) Healthy communities—explored and discussed questions regarding healthy communities using both verbal and pictorial explanations; (4) Bracelet-making activity. The RR ended with a sharing circle attended by all participants.</description>

      <population>The number of baseline participants reflects the number of participants that showed up on the day of training, as that was our first point of contact and the time point at which the baseline questionnaire was given. This is different than the number of people that we invited to participate in the study.</population>

          <title>Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST)</title>
          <description>Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) is a 2-day, 14 hour suicide intervention skills training workshop. ASIST is an intensive, interactive and practice-dominated course aimed at enabling people to recognize risk and learn how to intervene immediately to prevent suicide. The training is designed for anyone (especially those in a position of trust), from professionals and volunteers to members of the community. Participants range from those in caring roles to people concerned about family members or friends. The theory is that suicide can be pre¬vented with the help of prepared caregivers. ASIST is designed to help all caregivers become more willing, ready and able to help persons at risk. Just as &quot;CPR&quot; skills make physical first aid possible, training in suicide intervention develops the skills used in suicide first aid.</description>

          <title>Resilience Retreat</title>
          <description>The 2-day 14-hour resilience retreat (RR) was divided into cultural teachings and activities, sharing circles, small group discussions, and story telling. The RR included four main components: (1) Seven Sacred Teachings; (2) Self-identity—focused on knowing your identity, the past, and celebrating your history. Following the presentation, participants divided into community groups for discussion and then reconvened with all attendees to share discussion points; (3) Healthy communities—explored and discussed questions regarding healthy communities using both verbal and pictorial explanations; (4) Bracelet-making activity. The RR ended with a sharing circle attended by all participants.</description>

The 25-item SIRI-2 is a self-administered test that was designed to measure competnce in choosing appropriate response to a series of clinical scenarios with suicidal individuals. Research on the SIRI-2 has shown its good psychometric properties, freedom from social desirabiity effects and responsiveness to training in suicide prevention.</description>

            <description>Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) is a 2-day, 14 hour suicide intervention skills training workshop. ASIST is an intensive, interactive and practice-dominated course aimed at enabling people to recognize risk and learn how to intervene immediately to prevent suicide. The training is designed for anyone (especially those in a position of trust), from professionals and volunteers to members of the community. Participants range from those in caring roles to people concerned about family members or friends. The theory is that suicide can be pre¬vented with the help of prepared caregivers. ASIST is designed to help all caregivers become more willing, ready and able to help persons at risk. Just as &quot;CPR&quot; skills make physical first aid possible, training in suicide intervention develops the skills used in suicide first aid.</description>

The RR included four main components: (1) Seven Sacred Teachings; (2) Self-identity—focused on knowing your identity, the past, and celebrating your history. Following the presentation, participants divided into community groups for discussion and then reconvened with all attendees to share discussion points; (3) Healthy communities—explored and discussed questions regarding healthy communities using both verbal and pictorial explanations; (4) Bracelet-making activity.

            <description>Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) is a 2-day, 14 hour suicide intervention skills training workshop. ASIST is an intensive, interactive and practice-dominated course aimed at enabling people to recognize risk and learn how to intervene immediately to prevent suicide. The training is designed for anyone (especially those in a position of trust), from professionals and volunteers to members of the community. Participants range from those in caring roles to people concerned about family members or friends. The theory is that suicide can be pre¬vented with the help of prepared caregivers. ASIST is designed to help all caregivers become more willing, ready and able to help persons at risk. Just as &quot;CPR&quot; skills make physical first aid possible, training in suicide intervention develops the skills used in suicide first aid.</description>

            <description>Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) is a 2-day, 14 hour suicide intervention skills training workshop. ASIST is an intensive, interactive and practice-dominated course aimed at enabling people to recognize risk and learn how to intervene immediately to prevent suicide. The training is designed for anyone (especially those in a position of trust), from professionals and volunteers to members of the community. Participants range from those in caring roles to people concerned about family members or friends. The theory is that suicide can be pre¬vented with the help of prepared caregivers. ASIST is designed to help all caregivers become more willing, ready and able to help persons at risk. Just as &quot;CPR&quot; skills make physical first aid possible, training in suicide intervention develops the skills used in suicide first aid.</description>

Following the presentation, participants divided into community groups for discussion and then reconvened with all attendees to share discussion points; (3) Healthy communities—explored and discussed questions regarding healthy communities using both verbal and pictorial explanations; (4) Bracelet-making activity. The RR ended with a sharing circle attended by all participants.</description>
