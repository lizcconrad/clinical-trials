      Determine the effectiveness of symbiotic LACTOFOS containing FOS and probiotics against
      placebo in patients with a diagnosis of constipation, comparing the average number of weekly
      evacuations in 2 (two) groups for 30 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group. Consist of a period of 30 days of
      treatment with placebo or with LACTOFOS.Will study 120 patients were female with a diagnosis
      of constipation according to Rome III criteria for at least 3 (three) months.

      The experimental group (N = 60)will receive LACTOFOS 12g/day in two doses of 6 g. The control
      group (N = 60)will receive a placebo (maltodextrin) from 12g/day in two shots of 6 g.

      Subsequently, the patients will be classified according to the study of AGACHAN, which
      determined a score based on the main complaints of patients. The symptoms that included
      evaluation for the total score were stool frequency, difficulty / straining, pain at
      defecation, feeling of incomplete evacuation, abdominal pain, time taken to initiate the
      evacuation, type of assistance for evacuation, failed attempts / day and duration of
      constipation. The intensity of each symptom varied within the range of 0 to 4, with the
      exception of the item type of assistance for evacuation, which ranged from 0 to 2.

      Constipation is classified as mild when the total sum of values (scores) vary from 00 to 10,
      as moderate when the sum of the values obtained vary from 11 to 20 and severe when the final
      sum range from 21 to 30.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females aged 18-75 years

          2. A diagnosis of constipation defined by Rome III criteria

          3. Ability to good communication with the investigator and agreeing to requests from the
             entire study

          4. Patients must sign a formal consent to participate

             inflammatory bowel disease, etc.. proven by radiological or endoscopic examination of
             the bowel (five years before and after onset of symptoms). If the investigator has
             doubts should request the necessary procedures, such as sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy or
             edema bariatric to exclude organic disease

          3. History of laxative use which in the opinion of the investigator is consistent with
             severe laxative dependence

          4. Current History recent (12 months) of significant abuse of alcohol or drugs

          5. History of malignancy in 5 (five) previous years (except basal cell carcinoma treated
             well or cervical carcinoma in situ)

             respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological,

             perceived

          9. Lactose malabsorption is not treatable. If clinical suspicion of lactose intolerance,
             the procedure for proper diagnosis should be made to establish or exclude a diagnosis.
             If malabsorption is diagnosed, the patient should receive appropriate conditions of
             treatment
