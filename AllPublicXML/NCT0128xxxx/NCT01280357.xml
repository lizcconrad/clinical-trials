      Clinical Investigation Protocol for a study designed to determine the equivalence of the
      Monica AN24 monitor to Philips 50XM for fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC)
      monitoring during labor. The study will be carried out on subjects in the first and second
      stages of labor.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, single-center observational study designed to compare
      the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) and Uterine Activity (UA) output data obtained by the Monica AN24
      monitor during the first and second stages of labor to those generated by existing
      FDA-approved devices.Patients were enrolled at the facility but the patient details were
      removed from the results in order that the data could be randomized for the statistical
      analysis.

          <population>Of the remaining 34 participants in the clinical trials.The data was collected in the following manner.
31 participants were used in a FDA 6 way trial for Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)and Uterine Activity (UA) 2 participants were uesd in a 3 way trial for FHR
1 participant was used in a 3 way trial for UA Equates to 33 files for FHR &amp; 32 files for UA</population>
