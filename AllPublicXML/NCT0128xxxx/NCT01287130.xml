  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The experimental cancer treatment drug AZD6244 has been shown to block signals that tell
      cancer cells to grow. Cetuximab, a drug approved to treat cancer of the head, neck, colon,
      and rectum, also blocks signals that tell cancer cells to grow. Researchers are investigating
      the highest safe dose of AZD6244 to give with cetuximab, and will also investigate the
      effectiveness of this drug combination in individuals who have colorectal cancer that
      involves a particular protein known as the K-RAS protein. Cetuximab is not used to treat
      colorectal cancer with K-RAS tumors because it has not been shown to be effective, but
      researchers believe that adding AZD6244 to cetuximab may improve how well cetuximab works,
      even in people with K-RAS tumors.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab for
           solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment.

        -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab for
           colorectal cancer that involves the K-RAS protein and has not responded to standard
           treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with solid tumors that have
           not responded to standard treatment.

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with colorectal cancer that
           has not responded to standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  This protocol will involve two separate studies: an initial study to establish the
           highest safe and effective dose of AZD6244 and cetuximab in individuals with solid
           tumors, and an expansion study of AZD6244 and cetuximab in individuals with colorectal
           cancer involving the K-RAS protein.

        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination,
           blood samples, imaging studies, and other tests as required by the researchers.

        -  AZD6244 is a capsule to be swallowed once or twice a day, every day, with water on an
           empty stomach. Cetuximab will be given intravenously once a week, over 2 hours for the
           first dose and over an hour for every following dose. This combination of daily AZD6244
           and weekly cetuximab will be repeated in 28-day cycles of treatment. Participants will
           keep a diary to record the time of taking AZD6244 each day, as well as any side effects.

        -  Participants will have frequent blood tests and other exams during the first cycle of
           treatment, up to five visits to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other visits
           to their local doctor to in the first 28-day cycle.

        -  During subsequent cycles, participants will have four visits to NIH and four visits to
           your local doctor for examinations, blood tests, and imaging studies.

        -  Participants may continue to receive the AZD6244 with cetuximab for up to 6 cycles,
           until the tumor grows, unacceptable side effects development, or the participant or
           participant's doctor decides to stop participation. There will be a final study visit
           that repeats the procedures performed during the screening visit.

      Background:

        -  AZD6244 is an oral highly selective and potent uncompetitive inhibitor of
           mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2).

        -  The presence of KRAS mutations predict resistance to EGFR-directed antibody therapy of
           metastatic colorectal cancer. This appears secondary to KRAS activation of signaling
           cascades downstream of the EGFR receptor, including the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.

        -  Our hypothesis is that EGFR inhibition by cetuximab would be augmented in patients with
           KRAS mutations if activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade were to be inhibited.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the dose limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose of AZD6244 in
           combination with cetuximab in advanced, refractory solid tumors.

        -  To assess for evidence of anti-tumor activity with this combination, per tumor
           measurements using RECIST criteria.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD6244 and cetuximab when administered
           concomitantly.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of AZD6244 and cetuximab in
           patients with K-RAS mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  To assess the inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells secondary to treatment with AZD6244.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab and the
           relation to treatment side effects.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
           unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are
           no longer effective. In the MTD expansion cohort: Patients must have biopsy proven K-RAS
           mutant, metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2

      Study Design:

        -  This is a phase 1 dose escalation study of AZD6244 in combination with fixed-dose
           cetuximab with an expanded cohort in K-RAS mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Patients will be treated with AZD6244 orally twice daily continuously, and cetuximab
           will be administered at standard doses on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Dose escalations are
           outlined per the schema in the parent protocol.

        -  The dose of AZD6244 will be escalated using a 3-patient cohort design based on first
           cycle toxicities until dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
           are defined. Once the MTD/RP2D has been identified, an additional 12 patients with K-RAS
           mutant colorectal cancer will be enrolled at that dose level, in an effort to more fully
           characterize pharmacokinetic characteristics of this combination. If at least an 8%
           response rate is observed in the expanded cohort, the combination will be recommended
           for future analysis.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  In the dose escalation cohorts: Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy
             that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative
             measures do not exist or are no longer effective. Histology can be based on either the
             primary tumor or metastases.

          -  In the MTD expansion cohort: Patients must have biopsy proven K-RAS mutant, metastatic
             colorectal cancer that has progressed on at least 2 prior standard therapies. K-RAS
             mutation status must be verified by a CLIA-certified laboratory. (NOTE: colorectal
             patients enrolled during the dose escalation portion do not need to be K-RAS mutant in
             order to be eligible).

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy, 6 weeks if the last
             regimen included nitrosureas or mitomycin C. Prior radiation is allowed as long as the
             radiation was completed 4 weeks prior to study treatment and no more than 35% of
             marrow irradiated.

          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of AZD6244 in combination with cetuximab in patients
             less than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible
             for future pediatric phase 1 combination trials.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of
                  normal (AST and ALT less than or equal to 5.0 X institutional upper limit of
                  normal will be permitted if liver metastases are present)

               -  creatinine less than or equal to to to1.5X institution upper limit of normal OR
                  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, as calculated by
                  Cockroft-Gault formula, for patients with creatinine levels above institutional
                  normal. May use a 24 hr. urine collection to determine creatinine clearance.

          -  Patients may have received prior cetuximab.

          -  Patients with brain metastases that have been treated and stable for 2 months will be
             eligible for this study.

          -  Subjects undergoing anti-coagulation therapy with LMWH and warfarin are eligible.
             Subjects receiving both warfarin and AZD6244 should have more frequent PT/INR
             monitoring (see section 10.0)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormonal therapy within 4 weeks (6
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have
             not recovered (less than or equal to grade 1) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent other than the investigational
             agent(s) used in this study OR treatment within 4 weeks of study entry with any
             investigational agent(s) or device(s).

          -  Failure to recover fully (as judged by the investigator) from prior surgical
             procedures.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to AZD6244 or other agents used in study.

          -  Patients taking high doses (more than recommended daily dose) of vitamin E will be
             excluded. Patients can discontinue use of high dose vitamin E prior to study entry to
             be considered eligible.

          -  Any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take
             oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their ability to
             swallow and retain AZD6244 capsules.

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel are excluded. Subjects with
             ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel
             obstruction are also excluded.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, prior
             cardiomyopathy, LVEF less than 50%, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia (i.e.
             atrial fibrillation), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD6244 is a small molecule kinase
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with AZD6244, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with AZD6244. These potential risks may also apply to other agents
             used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD6244. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients who are serologically positive for Hepatitis B or C, or have a history of
             liver disease, other forms of hepatitis or cirrhosis are ineligible.

          -  Use of strong CYP1A2 or 3A4 inducers and/or inhibitors (for example, but not limited
             to, ketoconazole, rifampacin, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole,
             nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO),
             voriconazole, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, ifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John's Wort) is not permitted while on study or
             within 7 days prior to study enrollment.
