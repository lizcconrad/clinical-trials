  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a repeat-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, three-way
      crossover study in patients with persistent bronchial asthma to compare the effect of morning
      (AM) and evening (PM) dosing with fluticasone furoate (FF)/Vilanterol (VI) inhalation powder
      on lung function. Following screening there will be a run-in period of 14 days. There will be
      3 treatment periods; drug at AM, drug at PM and placebo, which will last for 14 days each
      with a 14-21 day washout period between starting the next. Key assessments include; forced
      expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), vital signs,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), adverse event (AE) monitoring and laboratory safety tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a repeat-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, three-way crossover
      study in patients with persistent bronchial asthma to compare the effect of AM and PM dosing
      with fluticasone furoate (FF)/Vilanterol (VI) inhalation powder(100/25mcg) on lung function.
      Twenty-four male and female patients will be enrolled in this study to ensure twenty
      evaluable subjects. After the screening there will be a run-in period of 14 days prior to
      first dose. Subjects will be dosed for 14 days (± 2 days) in each of the 3 treatment periods,
      with serial forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurements taken over a 24 hour
      period following the Day 14 PM dose in order to determine FEV1 weighted mean (0-24 hours).
      Peak expiratory flow (PEF) will also be monitored throughout the study, from the start of the
      run-in period until the end of the third treatment period. Between treatment periods there
      will be a washout period of 14-21 days. Safety assessments will include vital signs,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), adverse event (AE) monitoring and laboratory safety tests,
      however, with the exception of AEs these will not constitute study endpoints. The results of
      the study will provide supporting information to understand the implications of time of day
      of dosing on the therapeutic response to the FF/VI Inhalation Powder.

    <time_frame>Pre-dose on Day 14 to 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry at Day 14. Weighted mean FEV1 was calculated using the Day 14 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements taken at the following time points: pre-dose (Day 14 evening dose), and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 hours post-dose (measured in the evening of Day 15). At each time point, the highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. The analysis was performed using a mixed effects analysis of covariance model with fixed effect terms for treatment and period; and participant (par.) baseline, period baseline, gender and age fitted as covariates; and par. as a random effect. Par. 122 received FF/VI 100/25 PM in treatment periods 1 and 3 and contributed twice to the summary of FF/VI 100/25 PM (n=25). Par. 123 received Placebo in treatment periods 2 and 3 and contributed twice to the summary of Placebo (n=20).</description>

    <measure>Pre-treatment PEF (AM and PM) on Days 1-12.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 2 up to Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants daily in the morning and evening just prior to each dose, using an electronic peak flow meter, throughout the 14-day Treatment Period. Only the averaged daily AM and PM PEF over Days 2 to 12 was analyzed. The analysis was performed using a mixed effect analysis of covariance model with fixed effect terms for treatment and period; baseline PEF AM and PM, gender and age fitted as covariates; and participant as a random effect. Participant 122 received FF/VI 100/25 PM in treatment periods 1 and 3 and contributed twice to the summary of FF/VI 100/25 PM (n=26). Participant 123 received Placebo in treatment periods 2 and 3 and contributed twice to the summary of Placebo (n=24).</description>

    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry at Day 14. Trough FEV1 is defined as pre-dose (AM and PM) FEV1 measurement taken on Day 14. The analysis was performed using a mixed effects analysis of covariance model with fixed effect terms for treatment and period; and participant baseline, period baseline, gender and age fitted as covariates; and participant as a random effect. Participant 122 received FF/VI 100/25 PM in treatment periods 1 and 3 and contributed twice to the summary of FF/VI 100/25 PM (n=25).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of the study medication until the Follow-up Visit (up to 18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as alanine aminotransferase &gt;=3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &gt;=2 x ULN or international normalised ratio &gt;1.5. Medical or scientific judgment was exercised in deciding whether reporting was appropriate in other situations. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Over 0–24 Hours Post-dose on Day 14</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry at Day 14. Weighted mean FEV1 was calculated using the Day 14 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements taken at the following time points: pre-dose (Day 14 evening dose), and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 hours post-dose (measured in the evening of Day 15). At each time point, the highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. The analysis was performed using a mixed effects analysis of covariance model with fixed effect terms for treatment and period; and participant (par.) baseline, period baseline, gender and age fitted as covariates; and par. as a random effect. Par. 122 received FF/VI 100/25 PM in treatment periods 1 and 3 and contributed twice to the summary of FF/VI 100/25 PM (n=25). Par. 123 received Placebo in treatment periods 2 and 3 and contributed twice to the summary of Placebo (n=20).</description>

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as alanine aminotransferase &gt;=3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &gt;=2 x ULN or international normalised ratio &gt;1.5.

          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as alanine aminotransferase &gt;=3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &gt;=2 x ULN or international normalised ratio &gt;1.5. Medical or scientific judgment was exercised in deciding whether reporting was appropriate in other situations. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs and SAEs.</description>
