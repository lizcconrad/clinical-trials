  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part 1: Healthy volunteers only

             -- Males ≥ 40 years of age

          -  Part 2: Prostate cancer patients

               -  Males ≥ 18 years of age

               -  Serum PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) value above normal.

               -  Patients had an MRI and/or a positive [11C] - or [18F] -choline PET/CT for
                  primary diagnosis (Note: MRI and [11C]-or [18F]-choline PET/CT are optional for
                  primary prostate cancer patients) or recurrence detection of prostate cancer and
                  the primary cancer disease (adenocarcinoma) is histologically confirmed

               -  Patients with primary prostate cancer have to be scheduled for prostatectomy

               -  In patients with primary prostate cancer, histopathological evaluation has to
                  show an adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 3 + 3 or higher in at least two
                  biopsies at any location in the prostate

               -  Patients with advanced primary or recurrent prostate cancer and a high likelihood
                  to display lymph node metastasis, ideally scheduled for explorative pelvic
                  lymphadenectomy, are to be preferably included

          -  Part 3: Prostate cancer patients -- The criteria for eligibility of part 3 are
             identical to the ones of part 2. Except it is now no longer a preference but mandatory
             to only enrol patients with a presumably high likelihood of metastatic disease,
             especially lymph node metastasis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease other than
             prostate cancer (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction within 12 months prior to planned injection of BAY1075553, unstable and
             uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe pulmonary disease)
             which could compromise participation in the study

          -  Acute renal insufficiency of any intensity, either due to hepato-renal syndrome or
             occurring in the peri-operative liver transplantation period

          -  Active inflammatory bowel disease within the last 6 months

          -  Acute prostatitis requiring medical treatment within the last 6 months

          -  A non-urologic bacterial infection requiring active treatment with antibiotics within
             3 months

          -  Active other malignancy (except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) within the
             last 2 years

          -  Patients with primary prostate cancer only: androgen ablation within 3 months before
             planned treatment

          -  Subject fulfils criteria which in the opinion of the investigator preclude
             participation for scientific reasons, for reasons of compliance, or for reasons of the
             subject's safety
