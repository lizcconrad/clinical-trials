    <textblock>
      EAST prospectively tests the hypothesis that an early, structured rhythm control therapy
      based on antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation can prevent atrial fibrillation (AF)
      related complications in patients with AF when compared to usual care.

      Patients will be randomized to early therapy or usual care. In the early therapy group,
      patients will receive either catheter ablation (usually by pulmonary vein isolation), or
      adequate antiarrhythmic drug therapy at an early time point. The initial therapy will be
      selected by the local investigator. Upon AF recurrence, both modalities will be combined.

      Usual care will be conducted following the 2010European Society of Cardiology ( ESC
      )guidelines for AF treatment. Early rhythm control therapy will be guided by
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.

    <description>Usual care closely follows the suggestions laid out in the current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for AF treatment. In addition to antithrombotic therapy and therapy of underlying heart disease, usual care usually consists of an initial attempt to control symptoms by rate control therapy. Rhythm control interventions are recommended when symptoms can not be controlled by optimal rate control therapy in the usual care group.</description>

    <description>Patients in the early therapy group will be treated following the same therapeutic recommendations of the ESC guidelines as the usual care group. In addition, rhythm control therapy will be initiated early with the aim of preventing recurrence and delaying or preventing progression of AF.
Early-onset rhythm control therapy can consist of:
Optimal antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Dronedarone, Amiodarone, Flecainide, Propafenone),
Catheter ablation with the aim of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI),
Antiarrhythmic drug therapy and catheter ablation may be supplemented by early cardioversion in patients with persistent AF.
All individual treatment decisions will be taken by the treating study physician considering the labelling of the procedures and drugs and patient preferences.</description>
