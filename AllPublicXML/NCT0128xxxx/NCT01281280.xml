    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, open observational long-term effectiveness follow-up study of
      participants with drug-resistant epilepsy with partial-onset seizures previously enrolled in
      a randomized controlled trial (PuLsE) comparing Best Medical Practice with or without
      adjunctive Vagus Nerve Stimulation Therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2005 Cyberonics, Inc. initiated PuLsE: an open, prospective, randomized, parallel group
      study directly comparing Best Medical Practice with and without adjunctive VNS Therapy.

      In July 2008, the decision was made to discontinue this study due to lower than expected
      enrolment, impairing the possibility to meet the primary objective with appropriate
      statistical power. However, the relatively large number of participants (n=121) randomized in
      the original PuLsE study offers the possibility to generate scientifically valuable and
      original findings if additional follow-up data can be gathered. After consultation with the
      PuLsE Investigators, Cyberonics decided to implement an observational long-term follow-up of
      the participants enrolled in the original PuLsE study.

    <description>The objective of this post-market study is to perform exploratory evaluations to identify clinically and statistically significant predictors of response at all follow-up visits in participants with drug-resistant epilepsy with partial-onset seizures treated with Best Medical Practice with or without adjunctive VNS Therapy. This will be accomplished through regression modeling of the response variates (including change in baseline quality of life score and percent reduction in seizure frequency).</description>

        The study population will consist of participants previously enrolled in the original PuLsE
        study diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy with partial-onset seizures. All patients will
        be analyzed according to the treatment that they have actually received and followed in
        this new study regardless of what treatment groups they were randomized in the previous
        study.

        To be eligible for the study, the participant must meet all the following criteria:

          1. Participant must have been randomized in the original PuLsE study.

          2. Participant must have baseline data from the original PuLsE study.

          3. Participant is able to give accurate seizure counts, health outcomes information, and
             complete study instruments with minimal assistance.

          4. Participant or legal guardian understands study procedures and has voluntarily signed
             an informed consent for PuLsE 2 in accordance with institutional and local regulatory
             policies.

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a participant from the study:

          1. Participant has a history of non-compliance with the completion of a seizure diary.

          2. Participant currently uses, or is expected to use during the study, short-wave
             diathermy, microwave diathermy, or therapeutic ultrasound diathermy.

          3. Participant is expected to require full body magnetic resonance imaging during the
             clinical study.
