  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate chewing side preference, and lateral asymmetry of
      occlusal contact area and bite force of individuals with different craniofacial patterns
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dolichofacial subjects presents poorer mechanical advantage, less efficiency in masticatory
      muscles during mastication and in generating bite force, smaller occlusal contact area and
      masticatory capacity when compared to brachyfacial individuals.

      Wide, bilateral chewing cycles were related to better masticatory performance, however,
      unilateral chewing was reported to be very common in population, and it has been associated
      to lateral asymmetry on bite force and occlusal contact area.

      It has been reported that dolichofacial subjects need greater muscular effort during
      mastication when compared to meso and brachyfacial subjects. This may cause functional
      overloading of weaker masticatory muscles, and may lead to functional asymmetries.

    <description>A jaw tracking device was positioned on subjects face, who were asked to chew an artificial material in their habitual way. Tracings of jaw lateral movements during mastication were analyzed to classify in which side each chewing stroke was taken. If 80 percent or more chewing cycles were classified as left or right, the subjects were considered as unilateral chewer.</description>

    <measure>Bite force and occlusal contact area</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A strain gauge was positioned on subject's first molar region unilaterally to measure the symmetry of bite force. The individual was asked to bite as hard as possible. The procedure was repeated to the other side, and the bite symmetry of sides was analyzed.
To evaluate symmetry of occlusal contact area, a registration of posterior teeth was performed with the subjects in maximal intercuspal position. The registration was digitalized, discolored, color inverted and adjusted for size to evaluate thickness of registration material using a software.</description>
