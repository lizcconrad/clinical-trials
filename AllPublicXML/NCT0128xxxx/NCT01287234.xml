    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an external device (SonR sensor) that is capable of
      detecting sounds created by the heart (SonR signal). Based on the sounds created by the heart
      and recorded by the SonR sensor, optimal timing settings for the cardiac resynchronization
      therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device may be determined. The investigators will then compare
      the timing settings suggested by SonR to the settings suggested from the echocardiogram. The
      objective of this study is to determine if differences exist between these different methods
      of timing the contractions of the top and bottom chambers of the heart and if the SonR signal
      is able to produce results similar to those of an echocardiogram.
