      LIFE-IN. Quality of life after operation for hernias are not well investigated and lack a
      good and easy-to-understand-tool to measure it. Carolina Comfort Scale (CCS) is a
      disease-specific quality of life questionnaire, designed by an American group, to monitor
      quality of life in patients undergoing operation for hernias.

      The investigators wish to test this questionnaire against Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores
      for core-hernia symptoms, to see if the CCS is a good way to monitor the changes in quality
      of life and other well-known core-symptoms before and after herniotomies.

      The investigators include consecutively all in all 140 patients. 100 with inguinal hernias;
      50 who is getting a Lichtenstein operation and 50 who is getting a laparoscopic operation.
      Furthermore minimum 20 patients who is getting a laparoscopic operation for incisional hernia
      and minimum 20 who went through umbilical herniotomy. The investigators monitor their pain,
      sensation of mesh, movement limitations, over-all well-being, fatigue and life-quality, with
      both CCS and VAS questionnaires 5 times. One time preoperative and 4 times after operation,
      on the 1sth, 7th, 30th and 90th day after operation.

    <description>pain, sensation of mesh, movement limitations, over-all well-being, fatigue and quality of life. These core symptoms will be measured 5 times with the 2 questionnaires CCS and VAS. One time before and 4 times after the operation with both the CCS and VAS, to see if the is a graphical correlation between the to questionnaires and to find out which of the two questionnaires is best.</description>
