  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the anti-tumour effect of this metronomic combination regimen defined by
      progression-free survival (PFS) after two cycles of treatment (4 months) and 12 months of
      treatment, as well as response rate after any number of cycles of treatment (&quot;best
      response&quot;).

      To define the safety profile of the combination. To characterize pharmacodynamics of the drug
      combination with the use of angiogenic markers (CEP, CEC, microparticles).

      Multi-center, combination phase II study, open-label, non-comparative, non-randomized.

      All progressive or recurrent solid tumours will be included in the Phase II study, provided
      there are no curative options anymore.

      Total expected number of patients (minimum maximum): 54 to 90 (2-stage design)
