  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed to assess the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition on blood
      pressure, cerebral blood flow, ventilation and renal hemodynamics following chronic
      intermittent hypoxia exposure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will specifically evaluate:

        1. Cardiovascular effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on cerebral, vascular, blood pressure
           and homeostatic responses following chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure.

        2. Ventilatory response of cyclooxygenase inhibitors following chronic intermittent hypoxia
           exposure

        3. Evaluate the renal hemodynamic effect of chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure and
           cyclooxygenase inhibition.

    <description>The subjects will receive five days of drug intervention: either non-selective cyclooxygenase (Indomethacin) or selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition (Celecoxib) or placebo. On the testing day, the subjects will undergo an acute intermittent hypoxia testing before and six hours of hypoxic chamber exposure mimicking obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.</description>
