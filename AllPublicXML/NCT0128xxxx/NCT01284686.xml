  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuronal activity in circuits between the basal ganglia (BG) and motor cortical areas is
      abnormally synchronised and rhythmic. The oscillatory activity prevails at 8-30 Hz in
      untreated Parkinson's Disease (PD) and its amplitude at both subthalamic and cortical levels
      inversely correlates with motor impairment. Moreover, these different levels in BG-cortical
      loops are coherent in this frequency band. The 8-30 Hz activity is suppressed by treatment
      following treatment with dopaminergic drugs and is partially suppressed prior to and during
      voluntary movements. An unanswered question is how do BG-cortical loops become so prominently
      engaged in this oscillatory activity? One possible explanation is that the resonance
      frequencies of the loops fall in the 8-30 Hz band in the untreated state, so that
      oscillations in this band are transmitted particularly well. This hypothesis was confirmed in
      a previous series of experiments.The aim is to determine whether the resonance frequency
      within BG-cortical loops is correlated to the BG-cortical coherence frequency (with 20
      subjets during 24 months).

      Methods: Record STN-cortex LFP coherence pattern and then stimulate STN (at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20,
      25, 30 Hz) in newly implanted patients at rest and during simple and complex motor tasks
      while recording the steady state evoked potential over the cortex using EEG. The resonance
      frequency will be calculated as previously (Eusebio et al, Brain 2009). Experiments will be
      carried out both in the OFF medication and ON medication condition.
