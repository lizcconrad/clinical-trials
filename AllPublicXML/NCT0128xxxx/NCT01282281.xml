      Background: Most psychotropic medications that are effective in the treatment of Bipolar
      Disorder (BD) are associated with endocrine-metabolic changes (EMCs). To date, there is no
      long-term study in BD that has examined specifically the association of inflammation with
      EMCs in BD. Specific aims: 1) to identify predictors of EMCs among adolescents and adults
      with BD who are being started on a medication ; 2) to compare change in EMCs in youth and
      adults treated for BD; 3) to measure change in EMCs associated with use of different
      medications for BD. Research Design: Participants: 30 adolescents (14-18 years old) with BD
      and 30 adults (19-65 years old) with BD. Measures: Blood levels of biomarkers that are
      associated with EMCs will be measured.

        Thirty adolescent participants with BD (type I, II, or not otherwise specified), and 30
        adult participants with BD will be enrolled. Participants with BD will be recruited from
        the Youth and Adult Mood Disorder Clinics. Psychiatry Division staff will identify patients
        who meet the study criteria during weekly treatment team meetings. New referrals will also
        be screened to identify potential participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of written informed consent

          2. Diagnosis of BD type I, II, or NOS as determined by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria
             (confirmed using SCID or K-SADS)

          3. Both females and males, age14 to 65 years

          4. Decision by physician and patient to initiate pharmacotherapy with a traditional mood
             stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic

          5. Able to understand and comply with requirements of the study

          6. Proficient in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A primary psychiatric disorder other than bipolar disorder I, II or NOS (comorbid Axis
             I or II disorders are permitted, as long as clinician judges that bipolar disorder is
             the primary condition)

          2. Initiation of an antipsychotic, mood stabilizer or other medication with known
             endocrine-metabolic effects within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit

          3. Patients who, in the investigators opinion, are unlikely to adhere to pharmacotherapy
             for at least 4 weeks after baseline visit

          4. Significant medical condition that would contraindicate the use of mood stabilizers or
             atypical antipsychotics

          5. Patients who are receiving pharmacological treatment for diabetes mellitus (DM),
             hyperlipidemia, or obesity

          6. Acute or chronic medical illness (e.g. urinary tract infection, bronchitis, rheumatoid
             arthritis) that, as judged by the investigator, would significantly alter
             inflammatory, metabolic, or endocrine indices

          7. Screening bloodwork that identifies any other clinically significant deviation from
             the reference range in clinical laboratory test results, as judged by the
             investigator.
