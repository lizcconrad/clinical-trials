    <textblock>
      This is a 1:1 randomised pilot study in 30 patients in 1 site in Helsinki, Finland.

      The investigators hypothesize that function, pain, type and quality of cartilage in adult
      patients with osteochondritis dissecans of the knee will be better in the DBX group compared
      to the mosaicplasty group.
