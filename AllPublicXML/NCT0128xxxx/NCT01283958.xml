  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identification of the pathophysiology associated with Eisenmenger's syndrome has led to the
      evaluation of targeted therapies. Iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue, is one such targeted
      therapy used in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome. The purpose of our study is to assess
      the effects of inhaled iloprost on patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome.
