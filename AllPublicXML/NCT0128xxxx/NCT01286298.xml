  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival enlargement is one of the most common soft tissue problems associated with fixed
      orthodontic treatment. The presence of orthodontic appliances impedes oral hygiene measures
      and alters the oral microbial ecosystem to a more pathogenic oral biofilm. Subsequent
      accumulation of plaque can contribute to development of chronic periodontal inflammation and
      can progress to gingival enlargement. Gingival enlargement inhibits hygiene measures, slows
      down orthodontic tooth movement and cause aesthetic and functional problems. Management of
      gingival enlargement by non-surgical periodontal treatment is considered to be most important
      and effective. Optimal plaque control can be maintained by meticulous brushing, flossing and
      professional scaling. However, motivation of maintaining oral hygiene can be disappointing in
      some patients. In cases that the enlarged gingivae became fibrous, surgical treatment can be
      considered.

      Traditionally, gingivectomy was performed using scalpel under local infiltration. Since the
      first laser designed for dental use was introduced in 1989. Laser technology has continuously
      developed over the years and there are now many different types of dental lasers using a
      variety of wavelengths, e.g. Diode, Er:YAG, CO2 and Er,Cr:YSGG lasers. In orthodontics,
      various intraoral soft tissues surgical procedures may be required frequently, e.g.
      gingivectomy, gingivoplasty, fraenectomy, exposure of unerupted/ impacted/ partially erupted
      teeth. The use of laser has becoming more popular because the advantages of laser therapy are
      good haemostasis, excellent visualization of the operating field, fewer intra- and
      post-operative complications, bactericidal effect, no suture required, less scars, and better
      pain control with effects of reduced use of local anaesthesia and analgesic. Diode laser unit
      has the merits of compact size and relatively low price. Gingivectomy by diode laser may
      become an effective adjunctive treatment in orthodontic practice.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of diode laser in the
      management of gingival enlargement related to orthodontic treatment.
