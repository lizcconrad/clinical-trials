  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raltegravir is the first integrase inhibitor used in humans. It has been shown to be highly
      efficacious and well tolerated in phase III clinical trials in multidrug experienced human
      immunodeficiency virus(HIV)-infected patients, as well as initial therapy in untreated
      patients. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adult subjects indicate that the major mechanism
      of clearance of the drug is glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A1, with a minor contribution of
      renal excretion of unchanged parent compound. Unlike CYP-based metabolism, glucuronidation is
      generally found to be relatively unaffected by hepatic disease. A single dose pharmacokinetic
      study of raltegravir in patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency (Steigbigel et
      al. 2008) found no clinically important effect on the drug pharmacokinetic profile, with no
      dosage adjustment being necessary. The liver safety and tolerability of boosted atazanavir
      (ATV/r) has been evaluated in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus (HIV/HCV)
      coinfected patients with advanced liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis) (Hermida JM et al.
      4th IAS: Sidney, 2007). Similar to Raltegravir, ATV is also mainly metabolized by conjugation
      through UGT1A1. There is an urgent need for potent and efficacious ARV drugs with a clean
      safety liver profile even in patients with severe liver disease. The investigators
      hypothesized that pharmacokinetics will not be altered in HIV/HCV patients with advanced
      (Child-Pugh grade C) cirrhosis or in those with no histologic liver damage.

    <description>On the fifth day of treatment, patient will be hospitalized in the clinical trial unit in order to obtaine plasma concentrations previous to the administration of the corresponding dose (basal) and at the following times post-administration: 30min, 1h, 1h30min, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, and 12h. With these measures, (AUC0-12), Cmax and Cmin will be calculated in order to describe the pharmacokinetic of Raltegravir 400 mgBID in the steady state in both arms</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, clinically stable HIV/HCV coinfected patients on HAART with controlled viremia
             (&lt;50 copies/ml) for at least 6 months. HAART will be based on a boosted protease
             inhibitor (lopinavir, fosamprenavir or darunavir). Hepatic Stability is defined by the
             absence of new events of descompensation (Child-Pugh score) in the previous six weeks
             with no data of progressive hepatic insufficiency.

          -  Liver biopsy performed during the previous year showing no liver damage (F0-F1 in the
             Metavir score) or by elastometry results ≤ 6 Kpa, to classify patients in group B.

          -  Liver cirrhosis guided by biopsy (F4 in the Metavir score) or elastometry: results ≥
             14 Kpa, to classify patients in group A.
