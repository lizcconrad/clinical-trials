  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of two vaginal applicators,
      delivering the candidate microbicide Tenofovir, on symptoms and signs of irritation of the
      external genitalia, cervix and vagina as seen on colposcopy after seven days of twice daily
      use.

      The secondary objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate and compare the dosing accuracy and precision of the user-filled applicator and
           pre-filled applicator with the candidate microbicide, Tenofovir.

        2. Compare the acceptability of the user-filled applicator with the pre-filled applicator.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Filled Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>3 dose delivery measurements during 1 week of product use</time_frame>
    <description>At each dose delivery visit, the applicator was weighed, prior to vaginal insertion. For the user-filled applicator, the participant handed the applicator to the investigator after filling with gel from the multidose tube. The applicator was then weighed and returned to the participant for insertion. For the prefilled applicator, the participant inserted the plunger into the barrel, and then handed the applicator to the investigator for weighing.</description>

          <title>Reasons Given by Participants for Knowing When the Applicator Was Filled Correctly</title>
          <description>Participants were asked how did they know when the applicator was filled correctly (that is, with the right amount of gel). More than one answer was allowed.
Response categories included &quot;plunger automatically stopped&quot;, &quot;the 'FULL' line was reached&quot;, and &quot;other&quot;.
Note: this question does not apply to the prefilled applicator.</description>
          <population>All participants were included in the analysis. Each participant could identify multiple reasons. As a result, the number of units analyzed is greater than the number of participants.</population>
