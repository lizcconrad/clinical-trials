    <textblock>
      Cisplatin is a potent and widely used antineoplastic drug. Ototoxicity is a serious and
      dose-limiting side effect. The ototoxic effect of cisplatin is characterized by irreversible,
      progressive, bilateral, high-frequency, sensorineural hearing loss with tinnitus. 60-80% of
      patients treated show elevations of hearing thresholds and nearly 15% sustain significant
      hearing handicap. There are currently no clinical interventions that have been shown to
      prevent cisplatin ototoxicity in humans. Glucocorticoids have significant potential for
      otoprotection. Glucocorticoids are in use for treatment of a variety of cochlear disorders
      such as autoimmune inner ear disease, Meniere's disease and sudden sensorineural hearing
      loss. Intratympanic administration of drugs is a contemporary, safe method of locally
      treating inner ear disorders, allowing diffusion across the round window into the inner ear.
      This method achieves much higher steroid levels within the inner ear compared to oral or
      parenteral routes. Local administration prevents the common systemic side effects of
      steroids. Previous animal studies have shown protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity
      after intratympanic steroid injection. Asa far as we know, there are yet no studies in humans
      examining the otoprotective effect of intratympanic steroids in patients treated with
      cisplatin. In this study we will aim to determine if cisplatin ototoxicity can be prevented
      by intratympanic administration of corticosteroids.
