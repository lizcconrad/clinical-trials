      Hypothesis: Deep breathing exercises performed during the first two months after cardiac
      surgery, will improve pulmonary function and patient-perceived quality of recovery.

      Specific aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of breathing exercises performed with a
      mechanical device for positive expiratory pressure during the first two months after cardiac
      surgery compared to a control group performing no breathing exercises.

      Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled two-center study.

      Contribution: The study will be taken place at two University hospitals in Sweden.

      Uppsala university hospital (PhD, Registered physical therapist (RPT)) Margareta Emtner and
      RPT Charlotte Urell) and Örebro university hospital; (Elisabeth Westerdahl and RPT Marcus
      Jonsson).

    <measure>Lung function measured as Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry is performed preoperatively and 2 months after surgery at the Departments of Clinical Physiology. A Jaeger MasterScreen Pulmonary functiontest (PFT)/Bodybox will be used at the University hospitals in Uppsala and Örebro. The medical laboratory technologists are blinded to the patient's treatment allocation. Static and dynamic lung volumes will be measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative quality of recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Two months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity, postoperative pain, day of discharge, signs of pneumonia or pulmonary comlications will be noted. Patient-perceived quality of recovery will be assessed using a translated version of a recently validated quality of recovery score (QoR-40) designed to measure the patient`s health status after surgery and anaesthesia. The SF (short form) -36 (first version) will be used for assessment of quality of life aspects.</description>

    <description>On the fourth postoperative day the patients are randomly assigned to a Treatment group continuing to perform deep breathing exercises for 2 months postoperatively and to a Control group who will perform no breathing exercises after the third postoperative day. Patient management is otherwise similar in the groups. The patients in the Deep breathing group will be instructed to perform breathing exercises (3 x 10 deep breaths) 5 times a day (document compliance) during the two postoperative months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A sample of 360 adults (&gt;18 years) patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the two
             University hospitals are invited to participate in the study.

          -  Type of cardiac surgery included will be Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)
             with saphenous vein grafts and/or internal mammary artery graft, valve surgery or
             combinations of CABG and valve surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have an emergency operation, previous cardiac or lung surgery, renal
             dysfunction requiring dialysis or are unable to communicate in Swedish will not be
             included.

          -  Patients who requires more than 24 hours respirator treatment, reintubation,
             reoperation, sternum instability/infection or develop a neurological, mental or
