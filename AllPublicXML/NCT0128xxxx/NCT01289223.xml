          2. CT imaging in screening phase (based on local evaluation) showing 2 or more clearly
             demarcated lesions with a largest diameter ≥ 1.5 cm, or 1 clearly demarcated lesion
             with a largest diameter ≥ 2.0 cm. CT imaging performed at screening will be considered
             the baseline image

          3. Indolent B-cell NHL that remains stable or unresponsive during or within 6 months of
             treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen:

               -  Maintaining stable disease or failure to achieve PR to rituximab-based therapy.
                  (CT imaging will support this finding, and will be performed at least 30 days
                  after the last dose of rituximab-based therapy) or,

               -  Disease progression while on rituximab-based therapy (e.g., includes 4 weekly
                  courses of rituximab given at 6 week intervals) or,

               -  Disease progression in subjects with stable disease or better response to
                  rituximab-based therapy &lt; 6 months of the last dose of rituximab Note: Subjects
                  must have received at least 4 infusions of rituximab (either as monotherapy or in
                  combination with any chemotherapy).

          4. Screening laboratory values:

               -  Platelets ≥ 75,000/µL (7 x 109 cells/L)

               -  ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 ULN and total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 xULN
                  (isolated predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinaemia due to Gilbert's syndrome is
                  acceptable for inclusion)

             aggressive lymphoma as verified by biopsy confirmation [e.g. constitutional symptoms,
             poor performance status, fast growing tumour or increasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
             level]

          2. Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant

          3. Previous external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis. Previous external beam

             subject, or double barrier method: condom and an occlusive cap (diaphragm or
             cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent
