  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of talazoparib in patients with advanced tumors
      with DNA-repair pathway deficiencies. There will be 2 parts to the study: a dose escalation
      phase in which the maximum tolerated dose will be defined, and a dose expansion phase.
