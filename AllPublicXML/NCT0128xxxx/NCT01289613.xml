  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BIS for monitoring depth of anesthesia is usually obtained unilaterally. Obtaining BIS
      bilaterally revealed side differences in previous studies. This study investigates the
      incidence of clinically relevant side differences of BIS during maintenance and emergence
      from anesthesia for ENT surgery in both adults and children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BIS was measured bilaterally in 42 adults and 46 children during ENT surgery under general
      anesthesia using two BIS-Monitors. Side differences of more than 10% were defined as BIS
      asymmetries. An increase of BIS of more than 10% from the value at the time of finishing
      anesthesia administration on only one side followed by movement after stimulation was defined
      as clinically relevant.

    <description>After surgery, administration of propofol and remifentanil was stopped and the measurement of BIS was continued. BIS was noted every minute and on each occasion BIS exceeded 10% of the value at stopping the application of anesthetics on one or both sides. If such a 10% increase was observed, arousal and movement after external stimulation was examined by suction of the mouth.
BIS asymmetry on only one side followed by movement reaction to external stimulation within a 60 seconds period was defined as clinically relevant.</description>
