  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal vaginal flora is currently diagnosed among women (20-40%). It is associated with
      symptoms (bad smell, vaginal discharge) and adverse out-comes in pregnant and not pregnant
      women. The high recurrence rate raises the long-term effectiveness of therapy. The hypothesis
      is the persistence of bacteria associated with vaginal flora imbalance as Atopobium vaginae
      and Gardnerella vaginalis. At the present time there is a lack of an accurate marker for the
      risk of recurrence.

      Women with symptomatic abnormal vaginal flora (a Nugent score of 4-10 or sup or egal 3 Amsel
      criteria) will be enrolled. Abnormal vaginal flora will be treated with 2g of oral
      metronidazole. Follow-up will be performed at 1 week,1 month and 12 months after treatment.
      Vaginal samples will be tested by quantitative real time PCR to determine the vaginal
      concentrations of A. vaginae, G. vaginalis, and Lactobacillus spp.
