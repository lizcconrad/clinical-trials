  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate preoperative evaluation of a potential living renal donor's anatomy, vasculature and
      function is crucial to ensure optimal outcomes for both kidney donor and recipient in
      transplantation.

      Currently abdominal ultrasound and spiral CT angiography are used to evaluate renal anatomy
      and vascular status, and renal scintigraphy to evaluate renal function. This imaging protocol
      exposes this relatively young and healthy population to a high radiation dose and potentially
      nephrotoxic contrast agents.

      The investigators hypothesize that a single MR-based examination in the preoperative
      evaluation of potential kidney donor is a faster, safer, more cost effective and as accurate
      as the current multiple imaging work-up protocol.

      An accurate preoperative assessment of the renal donor is essential to minimize the risks for
      the donor &amp; optimize the results for the recipient.

      The current preoperative assessment includes Ultrasound, CT &amp; Renal Scintigraphy. The latter
      two tests subjects the patient to the risk of a high radiation dose. Moreover, the use of
      iodinated contrast media during CT angiography may increase the risk of renal &amp; systemic
      toxicity.

      MRI can be a &quot;one-stop shop&quot; modality for preoperative assessment of living kidney donors.
      MRI also eliminates radiation exposure and the injection of potentially nephrotoxic iodinated
      contrast material.

      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and evaluate the accuracy of a single
      MR-based examination, allowing for the comprehensive assessment of renal anatomy, function
      and vascular status in potential live kidney donors.
