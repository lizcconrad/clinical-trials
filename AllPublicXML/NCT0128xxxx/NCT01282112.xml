  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective chart review study (700 charts from 2002 to 2010)of children from 0
      to 18 years of age who have undergone Brainstem Evoked Auditory Response (BEAR)testing using
      midazolam and pentobarbital protocol for moderate sedation. The specific aims of this study
      are two-fold:

        1. to determine the efficacy of intravenous pentobarbital during BEAR testing in the
           pediatric population using a standardized protocol; and

        2. to evaluate the incidence of adverse events (major and minor), paradoxical reaction and
           failed sedation and identify predictors for failure and adverse events if any.

      Sedation Protocol:

        -  Versed: 0.1mg/kg IV

        -  Induction: 2mg/kg IV in children &lt;1 year; 3mg/kg IV in children &gt;1year

        -  Maintenance phase: 1mg/kg IV every 3 to 5 minutes with a maximal dose of 8mg/kg or 200
           mg

      Definition of terms:

        -  Failed Sedation: A case in which a patient is inadequately sedated after receiving
           maximum required dosages such that the test cannot be completed.

        -  Paradoxical Reaction: Also known as 'pentobarbital rage' is defined as a patient
           experiencing sustained, inconsolable, and severe irritability or combativeness. This can
           occur anywhere between 30 minutes after administration of pentobarbital to post recovery
           phase.

        -  Prolonged Sedation: A case in which either the patient cannot be discharged 3 hours
           after administration of the last sedating medication. It could also be a case in which
           patient is not back to baseline in 24 hours.

        -  Hypoxia: This is defined as a sustained decrease in oxygen saturation (&gt;30 seconds) of
           more than 10% from baseline.

        -  Time to goal sedation: Time in minutes from initial administration of midazolam to the
           achievement of adequate sedation of the patient/start of procedure.

        -  Time to recovery: time in minutes from the last dose of pentobarbital to recovery of
           baseline status.

        -  Time to discharge: Time in minutes from administration of midazolam to discharge of
           patient from recovery room.
