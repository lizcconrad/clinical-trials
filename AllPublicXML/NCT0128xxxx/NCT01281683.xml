    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide. For patients with
      intermediate-stage disease, i.e., large or multifocal HCC without vascular invasion or
      extrahepatic spread, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended as first line
      therapy with survival advantages. TACE can be performed repeatedly in patients with recurrent
      tumors who have adequate liver function reserves.

      Two clinical issues of TACE remain un-resolved. The first issue is the possibility of
      TACE-induced liver parenchymal damage, which may influence further treatment options and
      outcome of the patients. Conventional ways to evaluate liver functional reserves, including
      Child-Pugh score, biochemistry and metabolic tests, and ultrasound elastography, are
      relatively non-specific. The second issue is the difficulty in evaluating TACE efficacy,
      which cannot be reliably measured by conventional, volumetric response criteria. Both issues
      should be resolved to optimize patient care.

      Recently dynamic contrast-enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is increasingly used
      to analysis perfusion changes of the liver, and can be applied to both liver parenchyma and
      tumors. Previous studies have shown clinical applications of perfusion imaging, such as
      evaluating the severity of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, assessing the effectiveness of
      anti-angiogenic therapy, and evaluating tumor viability after locoregional therapy. DCE-MRI
      can be performed with a hepatobiliary specific contrast agent, Gd-EOB-DTPA (Gadoxetic acid,
      Primovist®, Bayer Schering), with dual benefit of dynamic phase and the delayed hepatobiliary
      phase imaging. The hepatobiliary phase imaging can provide additional information for hepatic
      lesion characterization and the functional status of the hepatocytes. We hypothesize that
      imaging parameters of DCE-MRI with Gd-EOB-DTPA could reflect non-tumorous liver parenchymal
      changes and can be used to predict and monitor treatment response in patients with HCC after
      TACE.

      In this prospective cohort study, we will recruit patients referred for TACE with
      newly-diagnosed unresectable HCC or tumor recurrence after operation. Patients treated with
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) will be recruited as a control group, since RFA is associated
      with minimal damage to the non-tumorous liver parenchyma. Key eligible criteria include
      chronic hepatitis B, histological or clinical diagnosis of HCC, tumors that are not amenable
      to surgical treatment and referred for TACE or RFA, ECOG performance status 0 or 1,
      Child-Pugh class A or B liver function, and measurable tumors (by RECIST 1.1). Eligible
      patients will receive the designated treatment (TACE or RFA) according to the current HCC
      treatment guidelines. DCE-MRI with Gd-EOB-DTPA will be used to analyze the non-tumorous liver
      parenchymal changes and treatment response, and will be performed at baseline, 3 days and 1
      month after treatment, and then every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years. The primary endpoint
      of this study is progression of liver function reserve. The estimated time for patient
      recruitment is about half a year, and 40 patients and 20 patients will be recruited in the
      TACE and the RFA treatment group, respectively. The imaging parameters of the non-tumorous
      parenchyma and the tumors will be analyzed and correlated with clinical liver function
      parameters, and hepatic functional and tumor outcome of the patients.
