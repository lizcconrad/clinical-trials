      The purpose of this study is to collect DNA samples from patients undergoing routine care at
      the University of Chicago. These samples will be tested for differences in genes that may
      suggest greater risk of side effects or chance of increased benefit from certain medications.
      The results will be made available to the patient's treating physician and the researchers
      will track whether or not this information is used in routine health care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving ongoing, out-patient care at the University of Chicago Medical Center under
             the routine care of a physician participating in this trial

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 years

          -  Must be 18 years or older

          -  Must be taking at least 1 (but not more than 6) prescription medications at the time
             of enrollment OR be 65 years or older OR be reasonably expected to require the use of
             a prescription medication within the next 5 years

          -  Patients with certain diseases, or likely to receive or be receiving certain drugs,
             will be targeted particularly for enrollment in order to enrich the study for patients
             likely to have pharmacogenetically relevant interactions, including, but not limited
             to:

               -  Patients requiring specialized cardiology care

               -  Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases

               -  Patients with systemic autoimmune or inflammatory diseases

               -  Patients requiring long-term oral anticoagulation

               -  Patients with hepatitis C

               -  Patients with non-metastatic cancer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with acute or chronic disease which could be reasonably expected to result in
             the patient's death within the next 3 years.

          -  Patients who have undergone, or are being actively considered for, liver or kidney
             transplantation.

          -  Inability to understand and give informed consent to participate.
