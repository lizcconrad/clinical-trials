  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 60 % of women experience hot-flashes during postmenopausal and 20 % have serious
      symptoms. Use of combined estrogen/progesterone therapy reduces hot-flashes effectively. In
      2001, results from the randomized controlled WHI-study (Womens Health Initiative) showed
      increased risk for breast cancer and hearth-disease among users of combined
      estrogen/progesterone therapy. This reduced the use of combined estrogen/progesterone
      therapy. Many women seek alternative treatment for hot-flashes. They are often told that
      physical activity can reduce intensity and frequency of hot-flashes. The evidence for this
      advice is sparse.

      The primary hypothesis tested in the WHAT-study will be: Increased physical activity reduce
      frequency and intensity of hot-flushes among sedentary postmenopausal women with bothersome
      hot-flushes.

      The WHAT-study is designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial. To answer the
      primary hypothesis we will need approximately 500 participants. The logistic in a pragmatic
      trial of a complex intervention are complicated and we decided to first run a pilot study
      with 50 participants as a feasibility study. The pilot gives us opportunity to gain
      experience with possible problems like withdrawals and injuries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHAT study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. The
      intervention is a 16 weeks individually tailored training programme with one hour physical
      activity 2-3 times per week. Women randomized to the control group are asked to keep physical
      activity at the same level as before the study.

      Healthy postmenopausal women from Tromso will be recruited to the study by newspaper
      advertisements and media coverage. Interested women are asked to make a call. A staff member
      will ask about menopausal status, level of physical activity and diseases. Potential
      participants will receive a diary by mail and will be asked to record frequency and severity
      of hot-flashes, and duration of sleep at night for a period of 14 days. Women who return this
      diary will be asked to sign the informed consent and complete a questionnaire, before the
      fitness test. Baseline fitness is an important measure in this study. We will measure VO2-max
      (maximal oxygen consumption) as a proxy for fitness. Whether you are randomized to
      intervention or control group can influence the fitness test. The participants will therefore
      be randomized after the fitness test.

      Randomization: Unit of Applied Clinical Research, Institute of Cancer Research and Molecular
      Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, will develop and
      administrate a web-based randomization system for the WHAT pilot study. The data base will be
      located at a server at the Medical Faculty at Norwegian University of Science and Technology
      in Trondheim. The following staff are authorized to randomize people in WHAT pilot study:
      Sameline Grimsgaard, Merethe Kumle, Sissel Andersen , Jorid Degerstrøm, Svein Arne Pettersen

      In this pilot 50 women will be randomized either to intervention group (25 women) or control
      group (25 women).

      Elements in the intervention: A physiotherapist will based on interview and physical
      examination make a plan for the 16 weeks physical activity programme for each participant.
      The program will start with Pilates classes and low intensity aerobic training (2-4 weeks).
      After this period, classes with moderate to high intensity aerobic training will be
      introduced. The aim of the intervention is to increase aerobic capacity with 10 % from
      baseline.

      Both the intervention group and the control group will receive questionnaires at baseline, 4
      weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after inclusion. We will run the test
      for physical fitness at baseline and 16 weeks.

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996) is a 21-item self-report inventory designed to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms and is rated on a four-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3, reflecting the severity of each item. The BDI-II scores are classified as following: 0-13 minimal; 14-19 mild; 20-28 moderate; and 29-63 severe (Beck et al., 1996). A full description of the inventory including psychometric properties can be found in Steer, Ball, Ranieri, and Beck (1999).</description>
