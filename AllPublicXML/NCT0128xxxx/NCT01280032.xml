  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral column is the most prevalent location of bone metastases. Besides axial pain,
      vertebral metastases cause pathological fracture and neurological dysfunction by spinal cord
      compression. Although the median overall survival of patients with bone metastases is only
      7-9 month, half of them live longer and will require palliative treatment for their symptoms.

      Treatment options are radiotherapy and /or surgical treatment such as laminectomy,
      vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Various studies have shown the superiority of postoperative
      external beam radiotherapy after kyphoplasty in spinal metastases compared to surgery or
      radiotherapy alone. Nevertheless postoperative radiation schedules last 2-4 weeks. Moreover
      many patients present visceral and bone metastases simultaneously and require urgent systemic
      therapy. However, due to potentiated toxicity, concurrent therapy with full dose chemotherapy
      and radiotherapy is rarely possible.

      The investigators have therefore established a novel method for intraoperative radiotherapy
      (IORT) during kyphoplasty which enables immediate stability, sterilization of the metastasis
      and immediate initiation of chemotherapy.

      The kyphoplasty itself is performed according to the standard procedure with some minor
      modifications. In short under general anaesthesia, a bipedicular approach into the affected
      vertebra is chosen with insertion of specially designed metallic sleeves to guide the
      electron drift tube of the miniature X-ray generator (INTRABEAM®). To perform the IORT during
      a kyphoplasty with this device a new applicator was designed. This sterile applicator
      consists of a plastic head, which is needed to attach it to the X-ray source and a stainless
      steel tube. This tube protects the probe from bending. Under fluoroscopic guidance the
      applicator including the drift tube is guided through the metallic sleeves in the vertebral
      body. A dose of 8 Gy in 5 mm distance is delivered. After IORT the INTRABEAM system is
      removed. The kyphoplasty balloon is inflated and PMMA-cement is injected. Afterwards the
      sleeves are removed and the wound is closed as usual.

      Aim of this study is the definition of the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for IORT during a
      kyphoplasty using specific MTD-criteria and evaluating the effectiveness of this combined
      treatment procedure. To determine the MTD 3 levels with increasing doses are planned:

      8 Gy in 5 mm distance, 8 Gy in 8 mm distance and 8 Gy in 10 mm distance.
