      Objective: To compare the occurrence and intensity of pelvic pain as well as patient
      satisfaction and quality of life after total laparoscopic and laparoscopic supracervical
      hysterectomy.

      Design: Prospective randomised trial.

      Null hypothesis 1: There is no significant difference in occurrence and intensity of pelvic
      pain following TLH compared with following LSH.

      Null hypothesis 2: There is no significant difference in patient satisfaction and quality of
      life following TLH compared with following LSH.

      Sample: 62 consecutive premenopausal women referred to the department for hysterectomy on the
      basis of a benign condition. The expected mean pain reduction (m) in the LSH group: 3.32, sd
      (s): 2.71.24 A difference in mean pain reduction (d) equal to 1 sd is considered a clinically
      important improvement (standardised difference d/s=1). Number of women required (power 90 %
      and a level of significance 0.05): 62 patients.

      Methods: The study participants are randomised to total laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 31),
      or laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (n = 31).
