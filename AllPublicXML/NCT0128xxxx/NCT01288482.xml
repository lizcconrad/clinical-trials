  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional, continuous-mode nebulizers such as the English-Wright nebulizer are designed to
      operate continuously with tidal breathing. As inhalation accounts for only about one-third of
      the respiratory cycle, two-thirds of the continuously produced aerosol is lost to the
      environment possibly posing a hazard any fellow-patients, family members, or health-care
      workers in the vicinity. The English-Wright has been the only American Thoracic Society
      (ATS)recommended device available on the market. Recently Roxon Medi-Tech has announced the
      discontinuation of the English-Wright nebulizer. For these reasons it is necessary to review
      the use of other nebulizers such as the AeroEclipse II breath-actuated nebulizer and further
      validate their performance.

      The investigators expect to show equivalence between the AeroEclipse II and the
      English-Wright nebulizers.

      This study would like to determine if the use of the Aeroeclipse II breath actuated nebulizer
      for the delivery of methacholine chloride bronchoprovocation agent to the lungs results in
      the same Provocation Concentration PC20 (provocation concentration, or dose that causes a 20%
      decrease in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 sec or FEV1) as using the English-Wright nebulizer
      for the delivery of methacholine chloride bronchoprovocation agent to the lungs.

    <description>A methacholine inhalation challenges will be performed at each of the first two visits. At the first clinic visit each subject will be randomly assigned to use either the English-Wright continuous-mode nebulizer, or the AeroEclipse II breath actuated nebulizer. The alternate nebulizer will be used during the second clinic visit. The methacholine concentration producing a 20% decrease in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (PC20) will be measured by way of a standard breathing challenge (the tidal breathing Cockcroft technique)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Methacholine challenge - Cumulative Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3 +/- 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>There exists the possibility that as a result of decreased nebulisation time, we may see some cumulative effect from shortening the time between doubling doses of methacholine. If there is a systematic difference between the English-Wright and the AeroEclipse II nebulizers, it will then be impossible to know if we have calculated the wrong dose or we are seeing a cumulative effect. Therefore we are proposing that the first 10 patients participate in a third visit to look for a cumulative effect.</description>

    <description>The AeroEclipse II (Trudell Medicinal International, London, ON, Canada) is a breath-actuated nebulizer that allows for the creation of aerosol only in response to the patient's inspiratory flow, resulting in virtually no drug loss to the environment and providing a safer healthcare and patient environment by significantly reducing second-hand drug exposure and the possibility for transmission of viral airborne pathogens.</description>
