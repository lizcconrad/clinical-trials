  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the drug RAD001 in combination with other chemotherapy
      drugs, Carboplatin and Cetuximab. Because RAD001 has not been used in this combination
      before, it is not clear which dose will be best when used in combination.

      The investigators will test the safety of RAD001 in combination with Carboplatin and
      Cetuximab and see what effects (good and/or bad) it has on your cancer, and find the highest
      dose of RAD001 that can be given without causing bad side effects. The doses of Carboplatin
      and Cetuximab will not be varied as both these drugs are considered to be part of the current
      standard of care for patients with your condition.

    <measure>To Measure the Safety and Clinical Effectiveness of the Combination of Carboplatin, Cetuximab and RAD001 in Patients With Advanced (Recurrent or Metastatic) Head and Neck Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the first 21 days of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>This phase 1 clinical trial used a standard 3 + 3 design. Four dose levels of everolimus were planned to be evaluated, and the standard 3 + 3 design with dose de-escalation was used in the trial. Namely, 3 patients were assigned to starting dose level 1. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed, the trial proceeded to the next dose level, and another cohort of 3 patients was enrolled. If at least 2 of the 3 patients experienced at least 1 DLT, then the dose level decreased; otherwise, if only 1 patient experienced DLT, then 3 more patients were enrolled at the same dose level. If none of the 3 additional patients experienced DLT, the dose was escalated; otherwise, the dose level decreased. Dose reduction continued until a dose level was reached at which 6 patients had been treated and at most 1 DLT was observed.</description>

    <time_frame>The time of PFS was calculated as the time from study enrollment to the disease progression date, death date, or last contact, whichever came first, up to 25 months</time_frame>

        <title>To Measure the Safety and Clinical Effectiveness of the Combination of Carboplatin, Cetuximab and RAD001 in Patients With Advanced (Recurrent or Metastatic) Head and Neck Cancer</title>
        <description>This phase 1 clinical trial used a standard 3 + 3 design. Four dose levels of everolimus were planned to be evaluated, and the standard 3 + 3 design with dose de-escalation was used in the trial. Namely, 3 patients were assigned to starting dose level 1. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed, the trial proceeded to the next dose level, and another cohort of 3 patients was enrolled. If at least 2 of the 3 patients experienced at least 1 DLT, then the dose level decreased; otherwise, if only 1 patient experienced DLT, then 3 more patients were enrolled at the same dose level. If none of the 3 additional patients experienced DLT, the dose was escalated; otherwise, the dose level decreased. Dose reduction continued until a dose level was reached at which 6 patients had been treated and at most 1 DLT was observed.</description>
