    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that computer-assisted decision support will increase the
      percentage of women with a history of gestational diabetes who receive appropriate follow-up
      screening.

      Specific Aim 1: Develop an algorithm to identify cases of gestational diabetes among patients
      in the Partners Health Care system using administrative and laboratory data.

      Specific Aim 2: Assess primary care provider knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and barriers to
      compliance regarding screening guidelines for women with a history of gestational diabetes.

      Specific Aim 3: Test whether a computer-assisted decision support tool to identify patients
      with a GDM history and prompt screening will increase compliance with guidelines. The
      investigators hypothesize that decision support will significantly increase in the percentage
      of women screened.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5 percent of women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) during
      pregnancy. These women face an increased risk of progression to type 2 diabetes1 and may
      benefit from lifestyle interventions and screening to detect early disease. However, studies
      have shown that less than half of women are screened appropriately in the postpartum period.
      This performance gap may reflect both lack of communication between obstetric and primary
      care providers and lack of knowledge of appropriate screening guidelines. The investigators
      plan to assess a quality improvement initiative, using administrative and clinical data, to
      identify women with a history of GDM and implement decision support to enhance quality of
      care.

    <description>The American Diabetes Association recommends that women with a history of GDM undergo glucose screening at 6 weeks post partum. Women with normal postpartum glucose testing should receive follow-up testing every three years, and those with impaired glucose tolerance should receive annual follow-up screening.
Our study will evaluate a quality improvement intervention to increase the number of women who are appropriately identified and undergo screening.</description>

    <description>In intervention clinics, the LMR will use the existing reminder function to alert providers that a patient has a probable history of gestational diabetes. The provider will then have the opportunity to clarify the subject's history and order appropriate screening testing. Providers will also have access to online reference material regarding GDM follow-up screening and lifestyle interventions.</description>
