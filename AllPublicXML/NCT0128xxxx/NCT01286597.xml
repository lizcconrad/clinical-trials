  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactose is a carbohydrate found in milk,and Lactase Deficiency (LD) is a condition in which
      the small intestine cannot digest this carbohydrate due to absent or insufficient amounts of
      lactase.Individuals with LD may be intolerant of lactose in the diet and experience abdominal
      cramps, bloating and diarrhea; however the response is variable.Some tolerate moderate
      amounts of lactose without adverse effect,whereas others experience severe symptoms in
      response to even small doses. These problems may be representative of wider issues regarding
      individual tolerance to diet containing ubiquitous poorly absorbed, fermentable carbohydrates
      (such as: fructose, fructans)and be relevant to symptom generated in patients with diarrhea
      predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS).

      This project will investigate the effects of diet,lifestyle stress and psychiatric dietary on
      the development of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Lactose will be used to assess
      tolerance to dietary challenge, a test that is particularly relevant in a Chinese population
      with a high prevalence of lactase deficiency.

      Study #1: Questionnaire study in general Chinese population (n=2000).

      Study #2: Physiologic study in patients attending gastroenterology clinic (n=600) including
      in subgroups assessment of genetic factors,tolerance to lactose challenge and assessment of
      visceral sensitivity.

      Study #3: Assessment of appropriate dosage of lactose hydrogen breath test in a population
      with high-prevalence of lactase deficiency.

      Study #4: Impact of a determined dietary intervention on abdominal symptoms compatible with
      D-IBS.

      study #5: The association of visceral sensitivity induced by LI with mucosal immune
      activation and psychological factors in D-IBS patients
