  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1 clinical trial is intended to understand the safety and tolerability of a new
      anticancer drug in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The patients who qualify for the
      study will receive a once daily dose of the drug taken by mouth and will undergo several
      tests to measure the drug in the blood and to understand the safety, tolerability and any
      effect of the drug on the tumor. The antitumor effect of the drug is not known in human.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study in which subjects
      in each cohort will be given increasing doses of the study drug until a maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) is determined as the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). The drug will be administered as oral capsules once daily in 21 day cycles, with no
      interruption between cycles if no unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or tumor
      progression are observed.

      After determining the RP2D, Part 2 of the study, which is a dose expansion study will begin
      in which subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who developed acquired resistance
      to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib,
      gefitinib, afatinib (and others) or whose tumors carry an ALK translocation and are resistant
      to ALK inhibitor therapy, will be treated with DS-2248 at RP2D. The drug will be administered
      as oral capsules once daily in 21 day cycles, with no interruption between cycles if no
      unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or tumor progression are observed.
