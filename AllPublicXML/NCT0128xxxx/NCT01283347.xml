      The primary objective of this protocol is to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of
      18F-DTBZ PET to the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and normality.
      Secondary, the investigators will analyze the correlation between the 18F-DTBZ binding and
      the severity of disease of PD and the role of 18F-DTBZ PET in the monitoring disease
      severity.

      25 age-matched healthy volunteers will be enrolled. For assessing the correlation between the
      18F-DTBZ binding and the severity of disease, the patients with PD will be divided into three
      groups according to their motor scores: mild, moderate, and advanced. We will enroll 25
      patients in each group. Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria according the subject grouping, each subject will have 3
      visits in this study, as one screening visit, one imaging visit, and one safety evaluation
      visit.

      Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,
      laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.

    <description>During this study, subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of approximately 10 mCi 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ immediately prior to imaging.
The proposed dose for this study is based on our phase I study. At the proposed human dose of 10 mCi, the whole body effective dose (ED) will be approximately 680 mrem. The estimated human ED is expected to be comparable to or below the range of other approved brain imaging agents, such as 18F-FDG</description>
