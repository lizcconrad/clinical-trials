  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a behavioral intervention for adolescents with type 1
      diabetes will improve adherence to T1D self-management activities and improve diabetes
      outcomes. We expect the intervention to improve diabetes outcomes when compared to usual
      care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FL3X Adaptive Intervention is designed to increase adherence to T1D self-management
      including medical management (blood sugar testing and insulin dosing), diet, and physical
      activity. FL3X relies on MI, and problem-solving skills training (PSST) as the basis for the
      counseling strategy, and creates a coherent integration across three key components of 1)
      behavior family systems therapy focused on family communications and teamwork; 2)
      individualized diabetes education in response to knowledge gaps relevant to behavioral goal
      attainment; and 3) use of currently available communications technology to support behavioral
      goal attainment through participant-defined reminders and motivational boosters, and/or peer
      support.

      All FL3X intervention participants will receive &quot;FL3X-Basic&quot;, which is the initial 3-month
      intervention that includes 4 sessions (40-60 min), supplemented with short additional
      contacts (via text, email, or web-based communication) as needed. Thereafter, applying
      principles of adaptive interventions, based on a decision rule using A1c values measured at
      defined intervals, participants are iteratively assigned to &quot;FL3X-Check-in&quot; or
      &quot;FL3X-Regular&quot;, both of which continue with MI and PSST for the underlying counseling
      strategy. In FL3X-Check-in, participants who are doing well (&quot;responders&quot;) will receive
      minimal ongoing support to reinforce successful strategies through brief monthly &quot;touch-base&quot;
      contacts. In FL3X-Regular, those who are &quot;Regular-responders&quot; will have a minimum of 3-4
      in-person full-length sessions (40-60 min) over each 6-month interval, with additional brief
      contacts as needed (e.g., text, voice, or internet). FL3X participants randomized to the
      control group will receive usual care.
