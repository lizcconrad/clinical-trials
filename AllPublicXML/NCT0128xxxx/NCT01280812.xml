      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the mobile phone-based
      physical activity intervention on increasing physical activity compared to the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is associated with increased risk of co-morbidity and premature
      mortality. Given the rapid growth of mobile phone technology and the increasing number of
      users, the investigators developed an interactive mobile phone-based physical activity
      intervention for sedentary women. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized,
      controlled trial to assess the efficacy of the mobile phone-based physical activity
      intervention on increasing physical activity over a 3-month period. 192 sedentary women will
      be randomized in a 2-to-1 ratio to a 3-month mobile phone-based physical activity
      intervention group or to a control group. To provide insight into how best to maximize the
      potential for sustained physical activity after completion of the 3-month program, women in
      the intervention group who complete the physical activity program will be further randomized
      into a 6-month maintenance intervention-PLUS program (pedometer plus mobile phone diary) or
      to a 6-month maintenance intervention-REGULAR program (pedometer only). Unlike a conventional
      maintenance follow-up in which all subjects continue in their respective randomization arms,
      re-randomizing subjects into either a maintenance intervention-REGULAR group or a maintenance
      intervention-PLUS group will allow us to examine the &quot;dose-response&quot; of the maintenance
      methods if the intervention is effective.
