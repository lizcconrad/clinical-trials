    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The concepts measured by the SF-36 are not specific to any age, disease, or treatment group, allowing comparison of relative burden of different diseases and the relative benefit of different treatments. Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

    <description>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity. The subject's blood is placed in a tall, thin tube, red erythrocytes gradually settle to the bottom. Inflammation can cause the cells to clump together. Because these clumps of cells are denser than individual cells, they settle to the bottom more quickly.
The ESR test measures the distance red blood cells fall in a test tube in one hour. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response.</description>

    <description>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity. The subject's blood is placed in a tall, thin tube, red erythrocytes gradually settle to the bottom. Inflammation can cause the cells to clump together. Because these clumps of cells are denser than individual cells, they settle to the bottom more quickly.
The ESR test measures the distance red blood cells fall in a test tube in one hour. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.
The study was terminated before the 2-year time point was reached due to lack of clinical efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response Criteria Using CRP at Year 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>EULAR response criteria classify each participant as a good, moderate or non-responder to treatment based on the degree of improvement from baseline and the level of disease activity at the endpoint. EULAR response is derived using the individual subject's DAS28 as the measure of severity of disease.
Good or moderate response is defined as follows: Good response: DAS28 at the time point ≤ 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2 Moderate response: DAS28 at the time point &gt; 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2, or DAS28 at the time point ≤ 5.1 and improvement from baseline &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The concepts measured by the SF-36 are not specific to any age, disease, or treatment group, allowing comparison of relative burden of different diseases and the relative benefit of different treatments. Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the:
28 tender joint count (TJC),
28 swollen joint count (SJC),
Subject’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest.
The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI:
Remission: ≤ 2.8; Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10; Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22; High Disease Activity: &gt; 22</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity. The subject’s blood is placed in a tall, thin tube, red erythrocytes gradually settle to the bottom. Inflammation can cause the cells to clump together. Because these clumps of cells are denser than individual cells, they settle to the bottom more quickly.
The ESR test measures the distance red blood cells fall in a test tube in one hour. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve an Improvement of ≥ 0.22 Units From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>EULAR response criteria classify each participant as a good, moderate or non-responder to treatment based on the degree of improvement from baseline and the level of disease activity at the endpoint. EULAR response is derived using the individual subject's DAS28 as the measure of severity of disease.
Good or moderate response is defined as follows: Good response: DAS28 at the time point ≤ 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2 Moderate response: DAS28 at the time point &gt; 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2, or DAS28 at the time point ≤ 5.1 and improvement from baseline &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the:
28 tender joint count (TJC),
28 swollen joint count (SJC),
Subject’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest.
The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity.The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI:
Remission: ≤ 2.8; Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10; Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22; High Disease Activity: &gt; 22</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in the Swollen Joint Count at Week 24</title>
        <description>Joint swelling is soft tissue swelling that is detectable along the joint margins and is assessed by inspection and direct palpation of the joint, by the examiner. The ACR 66 swollen joint count evaluates the following joints: upper-temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal; lower: knee, ankle, midtarsal, metatarsophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set; participants with a baseline value and at least 1 post-baseline value at or prior to Week 24 are included; LOCF imputation was used. The Week 16 value was carried over to Week 24 for participants who escaped early at Week 16.</population>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity. The subject's blood is placed in a tall, thin tube, red erythrocytes gradually settle to the bottom. Inflammation can cause the cells to clump together. Because these clumps of cells are denser than individual cells, they settle to the bottom more quickly.
The ESR test measures the distance red blood cells fall in a test tube in one hour. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve an Improvement of ≥ 0.22 Units From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the:
28 tender joint count (TJC),
28 swollen joint count (SJC),
Subject’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest.
The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI:
Remission: ≤ 2.8; Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10; Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22; High Disease Activity: &gt; 22</description>

        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count (TJC28)
28 swollen joint count (SJC28), which do not include the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee;
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Subject’s global assessment of disease activity (SGA).
DAS28 values range from 2.0 to 10.0 while higher values mean a higher disease activity.

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that can reveal inflammatory activity. The subject's blood is placed in a tall, thin tube, red erythrocytes gradually settle to the bottom. Inflammation can cause the cells to clump together. Because these clumps of cells are denser than individual cells, they settle to the bottom more quickly.
The ESR test measures the distance red blood cells fall in a test tube in one hour. The farther the red blood cells have descended, the greater the inflammatory response.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve an Improvement of ≥ 0.22 Units From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>The EULAR response criteria classify each subject as a good, moderate or non-responder to treatment based on the degree of improvement from baseline and the level of disease activity at the endpoint. EULAR response is derived using the individual subject's DAS28 as the measure of severity of disease.
Good or moderate response is defined as follows: Good response: DAS28 at the time point ≤ 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2 Moderate response: DAS28 at the time point &gt; 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2, or DAS28 at the time point ≤ 5.1 and improvement from baseline &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2</description>

EULAR response is derived using the individual subject's DAS28 as the measure of severity of disease.
Good or moderate response is defined as follows: Good response: DAS28 at the time point ≤ 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2 Moderate response: DAS28 at the time point &gt; 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2, or DAS28 at the time point ≤ 5.1 and improvement from baseline &gt; 0.6 and ≤ 1.2</description>

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.
The study was terminated before the 2–year time point was reached due to lack of clinical efficacy.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) was a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The concepts measured by the SF-36 are not specific to any age, disease, or treatment group, allowing comparison of relative burden of different diseases and the relative benefit of different treatments. Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.
The study was terminated before the 2–year time point was reached due to lack of clinical efficacy.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue scale is a 13-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses both the physical and functional consequences of fatigue. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale, where 0 means “not at all,” and 4 means “very much.” The FACIT-Fatigue scale score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores denoting lower levels of fatigue.
A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) was a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.
