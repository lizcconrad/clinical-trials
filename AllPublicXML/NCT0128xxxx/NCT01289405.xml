      Objective: to evaluate the effects of a speech therapy exercises program in the treatment of
      Obstructive Sleep Apna Syndrome (OSAS) patients based on the clinical and polysomnography
      (PSG) parameters.

      Methods: 80 patients with OSAS will be evaluated: men, 25-65 years old, body mass index &lt; 35
      kg/m2 and scores of Epworth Sleepiness Scale &gt; 9. Patients will be divided into four groups:
      I: 20 patients with OSAS underwent speech therapy; II: 20 patients with OSAS underwent
      placebo therapy of Speech Therapy; III: 20 patients starting treatment with CPAP underwent
      speech therapy; IV: 20 patients starting treatment with CPAP without speech therapy or
      placebo. The speech therapy include isometric and isotonic exercises to improve posture,
      mobility and muscle tone of the soft palate, pharyngeal constrictor muscles, tip and base of
      tongue, cheeks and lips. Placebo therapy includes relaxation exercises and stretching neck,
      without therapeutic purpose. Both therapies are applied for three months, three times a day,
      lasting 20 minutes each session. During the treatment, the subjects will be monitored in
      weekly meetings, for orientation and description of the exercises and return of the fulfilled
      exercises diary. The subjects will also be followed at the CPAP clinic in returns after one
      week, a month and at the end of the study. Conduct assessments before and after treatment and
      after twenty one days washout, including: assessing the upper airway, anthropometric
      investigation of the facial skeleton and speech of Orofacial, questionnaires (Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale, FOSQ, General Segment and use of CPAP, WHOQOL-BREF, snoring), Psychomotor
      Vigilance Test and PSG.
