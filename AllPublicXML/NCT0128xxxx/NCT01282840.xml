  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) affects around 17 % of female population. However, the
      etiology of OAB is complicated and unclear in many aspects. Bladder wall thickness had been
      reported to be strongly associated with OAB, but its use as a screening tool remains
      controversial. Besides, few studies reported patterns of sexual dysfunction in female
      patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Therefore the aims of our study were to
      analyze the bladder wall blood perfusion pattern in female LUTS patients, the association of
      between the bladder wall blood perfusion pattern and the efficacy of anti-muscarinic
      treatment for female OAB, and the patterns of sexual dysfunction in the female LUTS patients.
