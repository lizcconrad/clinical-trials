      Background:

        -  Bone marrow stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow and blood stream, can be
           collected and transplanted to treat a variety of types of cancer in a process known as
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). When stem cells are taken from one
           person, most commonly a sibling or a family member, and then given to another person,
           this is referred to as allogeneic HSCT. Allogeneic HSCT has proven to be an especially
           effective treatment for patients with some types of cancers of the blood (leukemia) and
           certain solid tumors. The transplanted stem cells travel to the patient's bone marrow
           and begin producing normal blood cells, and also attack patient s cancer cells.

        -  Because allogenic HSCT does not always prevent the cancer from returning, researchers
           are interested in determining whether another type of immune cell taken from the stem
           cell donor s white blood cells, called a &quot;natural killer&quot; (NK) cell, can be given in
           addition to the HSCT to help fight the tumor. In the laboratory, NK cells have been
           shown to kill tumor cells, but it is not yet know if this will occur when given to
           patients after HSCT.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety, effectiveness, and immune system response of giving NK white
           blood cells to individuals who have received allogeneic HSCT.

        -  To identify possible side effects from the treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Donors: Stem cell donors whose blood matches one of the recipients on six out of six HLA
           (blood immune marker) types. The donor may not be the identical twin of a recipient.

        -  Recipients: Individuals between 4 and 35 years of age who have been diagnosed with
           pediatric solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment, or individuals
           between 4 and 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with leukemia that has not
           responded to standard treatment.

        -  Other eligibility requirements which include a physical exam and blood laboratory
           evaluation are included to make sure it is safe for both the donor to donate and the
           recipient to undergo the transplant procedure.

      Design:

        -  Donors and recipients will be screened with a full medical history and physical
           examination, and will provide blood and urine samples; recipients will have tumor
           imaging studies and other tests as required by the researchers.

        -  Donors:

        -  Participants will receive filgrastim injections (to stimulate the bone marrow) for 1
           week to make stem cells travel from bone marrow to blood.

        -  Participants will provide stem cells and NK cells through apheresis.

        -  Recipients:

        -  Participants will have three cycles of chemotherapy to treat the underlying cancer and
           weaken the immune system so that it will accept the donor cells.

        -  Participants will then receive preparative chemotherapy for the transplant and two days
           after the last dose of chemotherapy, participants will have allogenic HSCT using the
           donated stem cells.

        -  Participants will receive an infusion of NK cells on days 7 and 35 after the HSCT. -
           Participants will remain in the hospital for monitoring after the HSCT and NK cell
           treatments, and will be followed closely as outpatients for the first 6 months after the
           transplant and then less frequently for at least 5 years.

      Background

        -  Despite progress in pediatric oncology, some patient subsets with hematologic
           malignancies and pediatric solid tumors continue to experience extremely poor overall
           survival. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) is effective in some
           high-risk hematologic malignancies.

        -  Allogeneic HSCT can be performed safely in these patient populations, but disease
           recurrence is common and new approaches to enhance the antitumor effect of this therapy
           are needed. NK mediated killing appears to confer improved outcomes after HSCT for
           patients with AML and ALL, and NK cell infusions have induced complete remissions in
           patients with AML.

        -  Preclinical data demonstrates that activated NK cells readily kill pediatric solid
           tumors and leukemias, that large numbers of activated NK cells can be generated ex vivo
           using artificial APCs and that the post-transplant period may be favorable for expansion
           and survival of adoptively transferred NK cells.

      Objectives

        -  To assess the feasibility and toxicity of infusing escalating doses of donor-derived
           activated NK cell donor lymphocyte infusions (NK-DLI) on Days 7 plus or minus 2 days and
           49 plus or minus 7 days following HLA-matched T cell depleted (TCD) PBSCT in patients
           with metastatic or recurrent pediatric solid tumors and high risk leukemias who have
           unrelated donors or related donors;

        -  To determine if patients treated in this manner experience rapid, sustained donor
           engraftment and acceptable rates of aGVHD (less than 25% incidence of grade III or grade
           IV).

      Eligibility

      -Patients 4-35 years with hematologic malignancies (e.g., ALL, AML, CML, HD, NHL), with a 5/6
      or 6/6 HLA-matched related or 9/10 or 10/10 HLA matched unrelated donor.

      Design

        -  Pre-transplant disease specific immune depleting chemotherapy and the preparative
           regimen will be the same as that used previously on 02-C-0259 and 01-C-0125, for those
           patients undergoing reduced intensity transplant.

        -  For patients with ALL or AML, a myeloblative regimen based on current COG standard-of-
           care preparative regimen will also be included.

        -  Donors will undergo 1-3 apheresis sessions for filgrastim mobilized PBSC. This product
           will be T cell and NK cell depleted prior to cryopreservation. NK cells selected from
           the product will be used for ex vivo activation and expansion using KT64.4-BBL
           artificial antigen presenting cells.

        -  A phase 1 cell dose escalation of donor derived NK-DLI will be performed using 3 dose
           levels (1 x 105, 1 x 106 and 1 x 107 NK cells/kg) infused on days 21 more or less 3
           post-PBSCT and a second infusion on day 49 more or less 7 post-PBSCT.

        -  Three patients will be enrolled at each dose level, with the cohort expanded to 6 if
           dose-limiting toxicity occurs. An expanded group of 12 patients will be treated at the
           highest dose level tolerated.

                  and has been stable or resolving for at least 6 months; and if the patient does
                  not currently require steroids.

               2. Lymphoma: tumor mass on CT scan or leptomeningeal disease

               3. Leukemia: CNS 2 or CNS 3 classification.

                  -Lactating or pregnant females (due to risk to fetus or newborn).

                  -HIV positive (due to unacceptable risk associated with severe immune
                  suppression).

                    -  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis C antibody
                       positive with elevated liver transaminases. All patients with chronic active
                       hepatitis (including those on treatment) are ineligible.

                    -  Patients who require systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive
                       therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy must be stopped at least 28 days prior to
                       protocol C1D1. Topical agents and/or inhaled corticosteroids are permitted.

                    -  High risk of inability to comply with transplant protocol, or inability to
                       give appropriate informed consent in the estimation of the PI, social work,
                       psychiatry, or the stem cell transplant team.

                    -  Fanconi Anemia

                    -  Clinically significant systemic illness (e.g. serious active infections or
                       significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in
                       the judgment of the PI would likely compromise the patient s ability to
                       tolerate protocol therapy or significantly increase the risk of
                       complications.

             INCLUSION CRITERIA:

             Donor:

             -Weight greater than or equal to 15 kilograms and for unrelated donors, greater than
             or equal to 18 years.

             -HLA-matched related or unrelated allogeneic donors. Genotypically identical twins may
             serve as stem cell donors. Related donors must be 5 or 6/6 antigen matched. Unrelated
             donors must be 8/8 allele matched.

             -For donors less than 18 years of age, he/she must be the oldest suitable donor, their
             legal guardian must give informed consent, the donor must give verbal assent, and
             he/she must be cleared by social work and a mental health specialist to participate.

             -For donors greater than or equal to 18 years of age, ability to give informed
             consent.

             -Adequate peripheral venous access for apheresis or consent to use a temporary central
             venous catheter for apheresis.

             -Donor selection will be in accordance with NIH/CC Department of Transfusion Medicine
             (DTM) criteria and, in the case of an unrelated donor, the National Marrow Donor
             Program (NMDP) standards and FDA 21 CFR 1271.

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

             Donor:

               -  History of medical illness that in the estimation of the PI or DTM/NMDP physician
                  poses prohibitive risk to donation including, but not limited to, stroke,
                  hypertension that is not controlled with medication, or heart disease.
                  Individuals with symptomatic angina or a history of coronary bypass grafting or
                  angioplasty will not be eligible.

               -  Anemia (Hb less than 11 gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (less
                  than100,000/microliters).

               -  Identical twins will be excluded; the lack of MHC incompatibility will alter the
                  toxicity profile in such a way as to make the results uninterpretable.

               -  Breast feeding or pregnant females. Donors of childbearing potential must use an
                  effective method of contraception during the time they are receiving filgrastim.
                  The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown and may be
                  potentially harmful. The effects upon breast milk are also unknown and may
                  potentially be harmful to the infant.

               -  High risk of inability to comply with protocol requirements as determined by the
                  principal investigator and donor center team.

               -  Positive screening test for transfusion-transmissible infection in accordance
                  with DTM or NMDP donation standards, including HIV-positive, hepatitis B surface
                  antigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis C antibody positive.
