  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective cohort study aimed at optimizing the duration of anticoagulant treatment in
      patients at their first episode of proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower
      extremities, whose pathogenesis is either unknown (idiopathic DVT) or associated with minimal
      risk factors for thrombosis, with the help of an algorithm which incorporates both
      ultrasonography and D-dimer information. All patients will be followed-up until 1) the
      achievement of a major end-point; 2) the date of lost to to followup; 3) the date of death;
      4) the date of study stop. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of
      withholding anticoagulation from a subgroup of patients with proximal DVT whose veins have
      recanalized and present with a repeatedly negative D-dimer (at baseline, after 1 and 3
      months). The approach will be deemed to be safe if the annual rate of recurrent VTE in
      patients who will have their anticoagulation discontinued is lower than 5%.

      After giving informed consent, patients will receive an ultrasound investigation of the
      proximal-vein system (common femoral vein at groin, popliteal vein up to its trifurcation):

        -  Patients with residual thrombosis (defined as a diameter of at least 4 mm in at least
           one spot) will have their anticoagulation continued. A repeat ultrasound is scheduled
           after 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. In patients with persistently residual thrombosis
           anticoagulation will not be discontinued, while those whose veins have recanalized will
           have a decision making process based on the behaviour of D-dimer (see below).

        -  Patients whose veins have recanalized (either at the recruitment or later on) will
           receive the D-dimer determination before discontinuing anticoagulation. In those with
           negative D-dimer anticoagulation will be discontinued. These patients will have two
           further determinations of D-dimer (after 1 and 3 months, respectively). While patients
           with persistently negative D-dimer will no longer receive anticoagulation, those in whom
           D-dimer becomes positive will have their anticoagulation resumed and no longer
           discontinued.

        -  All patients will be followed up to completion of 4 years since recruitment. For the
           purpose of this study each quantitative D-dimer is allowed. The criterion for D-dimer
           interpretation will rely on the cut-off that is recommended by manufacturers for
           diagnostic purposes.

      Sample size 1000 years of observation without anticoagulation are required to demonstrate
      (power 90%, type I error 0.05, two sided) that with this approach the annual rate of
      recurrent VTE is lower than 5%. Approximately 600 patients with proximal DVT satisfying the
      eligibility criteria are required to obtain 1000 years of observation without
      anticoagulation.

    <description>Patients whose veins have recanalized (either at the recruitment or later on during the follow-up) will receive the D-dimer determination before discontinuing sodium warfarin. Veins are defined as recanalized when the vein diameter under maximum compressibility is lower than 4 mm both at the common femoral and at the popliteal vein. In those with negative D-dimer sodium warfarin will be discontinued. These patients will have two further determinations of D-dimer (after 1 and 3 months, respectively). While patients with persistently negative D-dimer will no longer receive sodium warfarin, those in whom D-dimer is positive or reverts to positive values in the following determinations will have their sodium warfarin resumed and no longer discontinued.</description>
