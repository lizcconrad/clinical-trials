      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving treatment for
      cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying changes in estrogen levels and grip strength in
      postmenopausal women who have received 4 to 6 years of hormone therapy for breast cancer and
      are currently receiving letrozole on clinical trial IBCSG-35-07.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the serum level of estrogens (Estradiol [E2], Estrone [E1], and Estrone
           Sulphate [E1S] and sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG]) in postmenopausal women with
           prior endocrine-responsive, node-positive, resectable breast cancer completing 4 to 6
           years of adjuvant endocrine therapy and enrolled on clinical trial IBCSG-35-07 receiving
           letrozole.

        -  To determine the degree of recovery of E2, E1, and E1S during the 3-month letrozole-off
           gap.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the association between estrogen level changes and the clinical outcomes of
           toxicity and quality of life.

        -  To determine the effect of prior adjuvant endocrine therapy, age, body mass index, and
           type of menopause on estrogen levels.

        -  To determine the variability of estrogen level changes and its association with germline
           single nucleotide polymorphisms.

        -  To examine changes in grip-strength score.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      All patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline for the analysis of single
      nucleotide polymorphisms, after randomization on clinical trial IBCSG-35-07 and prior to the
      beginning treatment on IBCSG-35-07. Patients also undergo serum collection at baseline and at
      9, 10.5, and 12 months for the analysis of estrogen levels and sex hormone binding globulins.
      Patients undergo measurement of grip strength at baseline and at 9 and 12 months. Samples may
      be banked for future research studies.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires (Breast Cancer Prevention Trial [BCPT]
      Symptom Scales on Form 35-PRS and IBCSG Trial 35-07 QL Form) periodically.
