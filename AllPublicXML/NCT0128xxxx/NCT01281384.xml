  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncovering the underlying cause of heart failure can be quite challenging and doctors often
      rely on imaging tests such as echo (heart ultrasound) to provide the answers. Cardiac MRI is
      emerging as another promising test because it gives very precise information on heart
      function and the amount of scarring in the muscle. Heart failure patients are increasingly
      being sent for cardiac MRI but the potential advantage that this test offers over others such
      as echo has not been fully explored.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if cardiac MRI provides more information on the
      cause of heart failure than traditional tests such as echo. In addition, if the information
      provided by this test always leads to an overall improvement in a patient's heart condition
      over time.

      This is a randomized study where subjects referred for clinically indicated heart failure
      workup to determine the best clinical management will undergo standard heart failure testing
      (including echo) OR standard testing PLUS cardiac MRI.

      Primary objective: to compare the effect of routine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) versus
      standard care (i.e. echocardiography with only selective use of CMR) on the etiological
      diagnosis in patients with a non-ischemic heart failure (HF). The proposed categories of HF
      to be considered in this study include: idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, infiltrative
      cardiomyopathy, inflammatory, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure with preserved
      ejection fraction (HFPEF), ischemic cardiomyopathy, mixed etiology and other (eg.
      pericardial, congenital, non-compaction, right ventricular failure).

      Primary hypothesis: Routine use of CMR (vs. selective use) will lead to a more specific
      diagnostic characterization of the underlying etiology of non-ischemic heart failure. This
      will lead to a reduction in the diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and HFPEF.

      Secondary objectives: Determine the effects that routine use of CMR in non-ischemic HF has on
      therapeutic decisions, on the Composite Clinical Endpoint (CCE), cardiac function, symptoms,
      quality of life (QoL), and costs. Ancillary measurements will include the safety of imaging
      tests and adverse reactions to gadolinium contrast agent.

      Secondary hypothesis: Routine use of CMR will have significant impact on treatment decisions,
      (1) lead to more disease specific therapies and/or (2) cause a significant change in the
      number and class of HF meds, during follow-up. The routine CMR group will also have improved
      clinical outcomes (CCE), symptoms and QoL and decreased costs to the standard of care group
      during follow-up.

      Design

      Methods: Randomized controlled trial comparing i) routine CMR vs. ii) echocardiography with
      selective CMR in patient with HF due to NICM and/or HFPEF.

      Among patients enrolled in Level I of IMAGE-HF, it is expected that 504 will have known NICM
      (or strongly suspected based on young age, absent risk factors and presenting history) and/or
      HFPEF.

      Tertiary care sites (in Canada and Finland) with dedicated HF programs will participate in
      the study. Consecutive patients will be enrolled at sites with dedicated CMR programs
      (defined as minimum 200 cases/year and maximum 2 weeks waiting time in the majority of
      patients) and randomized to routine CMR or selective CMR. Non-ischemic HF patients from sites
      without dedicated CMR programs will be included in a registry of patients undergoing routine
      HF care (i.e. selective use of CMR). Participants in the selective CMR arm may ONLY undergo
      CMR for a suspicion of: 1) infiltrative myocardial disease, 2) arrhythmogenic right
      ventricular cardiomyopathy, 3) adult congenital heart disease or 4) pericardial disease
      following standard HF care including echocardiography. Other tertiary sites may be added in
      year 2-3 depending on recruitment needs and registry sites may become randomization sites if
      the experience and wait-time criteria are met.

    <description>Following the completion of all baseline testing (including echo) in the selective arm and baseline testing + CMR in the routine arm, the treating physician will assign a diagnosis on a standardized template using all available information. The diagnosis of non-ischemic cardiomyopathies will be based upon recent Canadian Consensus Statement.
Expected Result - The routine CMR group will have a significantly higher rate of specific diagnoses for (a) heart failure with preserved systolic function (HFPSF) and (b) dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) diagnoses (i.e. fewer idiopathic DCM) than the selective CMR group.</description>

    <description>Telephone follow up will be conducted. The presence of each HF medication class will be re-assessed in addition to the overall number of cardiac medications. The presence of advanced HF therapies will additionally be recorded at each follow-up visit including: implantable device, electrophysiologic study/ablation, cardiac surgery/transplantation, and disease specific therapies (eg. phlebotomy for hemochromatosis; steroids for sarcoidosis). The HF specialist supervising the follow-up visits will also be asked to reassess the HF etiology during each encounter.</description>
