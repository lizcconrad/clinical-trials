      The purpose of this study is to determine whether vitamin D supplements can improve asthma
      control in children with moderate to severe asthma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed interventional study will clarify the role of vitamin D in preventing asthma
      exacerbations and in achieving better chronic asthma control in children with moderate to
      severe asthma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Physician diagnosed asthmatics and they should fulfill at least two of the following
             three criteria:

               -  A minimum of three clinic visits for acute asthma within 1 year

               -  Two or more asthma-related hospital admissions within 1 year, or

               -  Steroid dependency, as defined by either 6 months of oral or 1 year of inhaled
                  corticosteroid use

          -  Age: 6-14 years old. The age group of 6 to 14 years old was chosen for two reasons:

               1. Diagnostic accuracy of asthma is better in this age group as non-specific
                  wheezers less than 6 years of age could be excluded.

               2. Child should be able to use a peak flow meter and perform spirometry tests.

          -  A positive specific IgE or a positive skin prick test for at least one airborne
             allergen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with mild intermittent and mild persistent asthma.

          -  Asthmatic children who are currently on immunotherapy or anti IgE.

          -  Asthmatic children with concomitant other medical problems.

          -  Children who are younger than 6 yrs or older than 14 yrs.

          -  Children with history of early life injury to airways like premature birth (&lt; 36
             weeks) or home use of oxygen.

          -  Children with vitamin D deficiency. Since these children may be randomized to the
             control group, they will be excluded for ethical reasons.
