    <textblock>
      Apatinib is a new kind of Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(VEGFR) tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs). The investigators have finished the preclinical and phase I and phase II
      clinical study for apatinib and found its satisfactory anti-tumor activity and tolerated
      toxicities. A disease-control rate of 75% was found in lung cancer patients. In the present
      phase III trial, the investigators will further evaluate the efficacy and toxicities of
      apatinib in the treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
