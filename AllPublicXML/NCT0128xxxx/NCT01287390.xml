  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute and late dysphagia is now considered as a dose-limiting toxicity of
      radio(chemo)therapy for head and neck cancer that significantly affects patients' quality of
      life. We propose to preserve swallowing function by:

        -  adapting (individualizing) treatment (intensity-modulated radiotherapy: IMRT) to
           per-treatment changes occurring in the tumor and surrounding organs and tissues;

        -  reducing the volumes of elective neck, that may result in significant decrease of severe
           acute and late dysphagia.
