    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and Japan. The aim of this trial is to assess the safety
      and pharmacokinetics (the rate at which the body eliminates the trial drug) of single doses
      of NNC128-0000-2011, when administered i.v. (intravenously) to haemophilia patients.
