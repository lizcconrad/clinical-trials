      Chemoradiation with 5-FU and Mitomycin C is the standard treatment in anal canal SCC.
      Panitumumab has shown efficacy in other tumors and anti-EGFR treatment has shown clinical
      activity in a single report of a refractory anal canal SCC patient. Based on this background,
      we propose to conduct a phase II study to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of
      radiotherapy with the association:

        -  5-FU 1000mg/m2 on days 1-4 and 29-32

        -  Mitomycin C 10mg/m2 on days 1 and 29

        -  Panitumumab 6 mg/kg on day 1, then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks

      In the 1980s, the treatment of choice for anal cancer was abdominal-perineal amputation,
      which included the removal of the anus, rectum and lymphatic drainage areas and a permanent
      colostomy. With this treatment, 5-year survival rates were 40-70%. In the following years,
      however, it was shown that anal cancer was a tumor that was sensitive to chemotherapy and
      radiation, so surgery was not the first choice and was only reserved for resistant cases or
      relapses. Concomitant chemo and radiotherapy based on the Mitomycin C - 5-FU regimen is
      currently the standard treatment for localized (except T1N0) and locally advanced cases. This
      statement is supported by two randomized studies that showed that the administration of
      chemoradiation with Mitomycin C - 5FU was better than radiation in monotherapy. The trial
      conducted by the United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research (UKCCCR) randomized
      585 patients to receive radiotherapy (45 Gy in 4-5 weeks) or the same radiotherapy regimen
      coupled with 5-FU (1000 mg/m2 x 4 days or 750 mg/m2 x 5 days), for the first and last week of
      radiotherapy and Mitomycin C 12 mg/m2 on day 1. The 3-year local failure rate was 39% in the
      combined arm versus 61% with radiotherapy alone. There were no differences in the 3-year
      overall survival rate. On the other hand, in the study conducted by EORTC, 110 patients were
      distributed to receive radiotherapy (45 Gy in 5 weeks, with an overimpression of 15 Gy in the
      patients with CR and 20 Gy if PR) or radiotherapy plus 5-FU (750 mg/m2 days 1-5 and 29-33)
      associated to Mitomycin C (15 mg/m2 on day 1). The CR rate was significantly greater in the
      group treated with chemoradiation (80% vs. 54%). After 5 years of follow-up, there was still
      an 18% increase in the local control rate in favor of the group treated with chemoradiation.

      More recently, the results of a phase II CALGB trial, suggests that the administration of
      induction treatment with two cycles of cisplatin-5FU (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29
      and 5FU 1000 mg/m2 days 1-4 and 29-32) followed by chemoradiotherapy with 5-FU and Mitomycin
      C was very promising, especially in patients with a poor prognosis, with 50% of patients
      remaining colostomy and disease-free at 48 months. However, in a randomized study by the RTOG
      group, which included 682 patients, this strategy was compared with the classic concomitant
      chemoradiation with 5-FU (1000 mg/m2 days 1-4 and 29-32) and Mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 days 1 and
      29). No differences in survival were found, but it was also detected that the colostomy rate
      was greater in the patients treated with the regimen containing Cisplatin (HR, 1.68; 95% CI,
      1.07-2.65; P=.02). The authors concluded that induction with cisplatin was not superior to
      the traditional administration of 5FU-Mitomycin C with RT.

      Epidermoid anal cancer is a tumor that often expresses the EGFR receptor. In an initial study
      with 21 cases, it was reported that there was EGFR expression in all the biopsies. In another
      study with 38 cases, it was found that 55% of the tumors expressed EGFR. No study has been
      published, however, which has investigated the efficacy of Panitumumab in this tumor. There
      is only one report of a refractory case in which cetuximab was administered together with
      CPT-11 with an excellent response.

    <description>Radiation therapy will be administered concurrent with chemotherapy and Panitumumab treatment. It will start the day 1 of the systemic treatment. That is, the first day of radiation therapy will be the day of the administration of the first dose of Panitumumab and Mitomycin C, as well as the first day of the first 96-hours course of 5-FU continuous infusion. On day 1, drugs and radiation will be administered in the following order:
First, Panitumumab. Panitumumab will be administered by IV infusion on day 1, and every 2 weeks during 8 weeks
Then Mitomycin C, 10mg/m2 on days 1 and 29
Then start the 5-FU continuous infusion, 1000mg/m2 on days 1-4 and 29-32
Finally, no less than 2 hours after the start of the 5-FU infusion, first dose of radiation therapy.</description>
