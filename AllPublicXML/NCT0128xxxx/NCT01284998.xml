  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In case of deformities of the forefoot (Hallux-valgus, Hallux-varus), the basal osteotomy may
      be more indicated than the distal osteotomy as it allows to achieve a greater degree of
      correction.

      However, weight bearing forces on the head of the first metatarsal acting at a distance from
      the osteotomy site subject the construct to an important dorsiflexion stress. Fixation
      strength being the important consideration led to design the B-BOP® Lock plate, specifically
      dedicated to basal osteotomy of the first metatarsal, with the following characteristics:

        -  plantar positioning to obtain the best stability and resistance while reducing the
           implant bulkiness;

        -  anatomical shape adapted to the plantar curve of the first metatarsal. Taking advantages
           of the most appropriated anatomical site to implant the B-BOP® Lock plate directly on
           tension, it offers an innovative and unique basal osteotomy fixation solution.

      The B-BOP® Lock osteosynthesis plate benefits now of the Surfix locking screws technology.

      The purpose of this study is to collect and publish data from several centers, several users.
