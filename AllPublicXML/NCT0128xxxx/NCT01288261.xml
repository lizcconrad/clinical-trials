      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bavituximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving paclitaxel together with bavituximab
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of giving paclitaxel and bavituximab
      together in treating patients with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2 )-negative
      metastatic breast cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of combining paclitaxel with weekly
      bavituximab therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe changes in pharmacodynamic markers and coagulation markers in response to
      single agent and combined therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 and bavituximab IV on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (days 15 and 22 only of course 1). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
