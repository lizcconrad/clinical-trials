  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept study to determine the efficacy and safety of a monoclonal
      antibody with three doses versus placebo. Subjects will be randomized to a treatment and the
      dose will be delivered subcutaneously twice, 4 weeks apart. All subjects will have moderate
      to severe refractory Crohn's Disease.

    <measure>The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)-70 Response Rate at Week 8 in Participants Who Received Placebo, PF-04236921 10 mg and PF-04236921 50 mg</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>CDAI-70 response was defined as a decrease in CDAI score of 70 or greater from baseline. The proportions of participants with CDAI-70 response at Week 8 were compared between placebo and PF-04236921 10 mg/50 mg. CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's Disease. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's disease-related variables during a 1-week assessment period, yielding a composite score greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0 and without an upper limit. Many clinical trials use the endpoint for response as a 70 or greater point decrease in CDAI and clinical remission is often defined as a CDAI score below 150. The Outcome included a Generalized linear mixed model analyses which incorporated longitudinal data for each subject, and the same model is used for estimate (least squares mean) and statistical analysis (mean difference).</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study included a 28-day screening period, an induction period (Week 0-12) and a 28-week follow-up period. Participants who completed the induction treatment period could enter the follow-up period or an open-label extension study, NCT01345318. Participants who discontinued treatment during the induction period could enter the follow-up period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 250 participants were randomized via Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS); of which, 247 received investigational product and 3 were randomized inadvertently and not dosed (2 did not meet entrance criteria and 1 did not consent properly and was not included in clinical database because the randomization page was not completed).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)-70 Response Rate at Week 8 in Participants Who Received Placebo, PF-04236921 10 mg and PF-04236921 50 mg</title>
        <description>CDAI-70 response was defined as a decrease in CDAI score of 70 or greater from baseline. The proportions of participants with CDAI-70 response at Week 8 were compared between placebo and PF-04236921 10 mg/50 mg. CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's Disease. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's disease-related variables during a 1-week assessment period, yielding a composite score greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0 and without an upper limit. Many clinical trials use the endpoint for response as a 70 or greater point decrease in CDAI and clinical remission is often defined as a CDAI score below 150. The Outcome included a Generalized linear mixed model analyses which incorporated longitudinal data for each subject, and the same model is used for estimate (least squares mean) and statistical analysis (mean difference).</description>

        <title>The CDAI-70 Response Rate at Week 8 in Participants Who Received Placebo and PF-04236921 200 mg</title>
        <description>CDAI-70 response was defined as a decrease in CDAI score of 70 or greater from baseline. The proportions of participants with CDAI-70 response at Week 8 were compared between placebo and PF-04236921 200 mg. CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's Disease. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's disease-related variables during a 1-week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;=0 and without an upper limit. Many clinical trials use the endpoint for response as a 70 or greater point decrease in CDAI and clinical remission is often defined as a CDAI score below 150. The Outcome included a Generalized linear mixed model analyses which incorporated longitudinal data for each subject, and the same model is used for estimate (least squares mean) and statistical analysis (mean difference). Since the inputs in the model included different Analysis Population than in Outcome Measure 1, that will yield different estimates for placebo for the two different models.</description>

        <title>The CDAI-70 Response Rate Over Time in Participants Who Received Placebo, PF-04236921 10 mg and PF-04236921 50 mg</title>
        <description>CDAI-70 response was defined as a decrease in CDAI score of 70 or greater from baseline. The proportions of participants with CDAI-70 response were compared between placebo and PF-04236921 10 mg/50 mg. CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's Disease. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's disease-related variables during a 1-week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;=0 and without an upper limit. Many clinical trials use the endpoint for response as a 70 or greater point decrease in CDAI and clinical remission is often defined as a CDAI score below 150. The Outcome included a Generalized linear mixed model analyses which incorporated longitudinal data for each subject, and the same model is used for estimate (least squares mean) and statistical analysis (mean difference).</description>

        <title>The CDAI-70 Response Rate Over Time in Participants Who Received Placebo and PF-04236921 200 mg</title>
        <description>CDAI-70 response was defined as a decrease in CDAI score of 70 or greater from baseline. The proportions of participants with CDAI-70 response were compared between placebo and PF-04236921 200 mg. CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's Disease. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's disease-related variables during a 1-week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;=0 and without an upper limit. Many clinical trials use the endpoint for response as a 70 or greater point decrease in CDAI and clinical remission is often defined as a CDAI score below 150. The Outcome included a Generalized linear mixed model analyses which incorporated longitudinal data for each subject, and the same model is used for estimate (least squares mean) and statistical analysis (mean difference). Since the inputs in the model included different Analysis Population than in Outcome Measure 5, that will yield different estimates for placebo for the two different models.</description>

        <title>The CDAI Remission Rate Over Time in Participants Who Received Placebo and PF-04236921 200 mg</title>
        <description>CDAI remission rate was defined as an absolute CDAI score &lt;150. The proportions of participants with CDAI remission were compared between placebo and PF-04236921 200 mg. CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's Disease. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's disease-related variables during a 1-week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;=0 and without an upper limit. Many clinical trials use the endpoint for response as a 70 or greater point decrease in CDAI and clinical remission is often defined as a CDAI score below 150. The Outcome included a Generalized linear mixed model analyses which incorporated longitudinal data for each subject, and the same model is used for estimate (least squares mean) and statistical analysis (mean difference). Since the inputs in the model included different Analysis Population than in Outcome Measure 7, that will yield different estimates for placebo for the two different models.</description>

        <title>The CDAI-100 Response Rate Over Time in Participants Who Received Placebo, PF-04236921 10 mg and PF-04236921 50 mg</title>
        <description>CDAI-100 response was defined as a decrease in CDAI score of 100 or greater from baseline. The proportions of participants with CDAI-100 response at Week 12 were compared between placebo and PF-04236921 10 mg/50 mg. CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's Disease. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's disease-related variables during a 1-week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;=0 and without an upper limit. Many clinical trials use the endpoint for response as a 70 or greater point decrease in CDAI and clinical remission is often defined as a CDAI score below 150. The Outcome included a Generalized linear mixed model analyses which incorporated longitudinal data for each subject, and the same model is used for estimate (least squares mean) and statistical analysis (mean difference).</description>

        <title>The CDAI-100 Response Rate Over Time in Participants Who Received Placebo and PF-04236921 200 mg</title>
        <description>CDAI-100 response was defined as a decrease in CDAI score of 100 or greater from baseline. The proportions of participants with CDAI-100 response at Week 12 were compared between placebo and PF-04236921 200 mg. CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's Disease. CDAI evaluates 8 Crohn's disease-related variables during a 1-week assessment period, yielding a composite score &gt;=0 and without an upper limit. Many clinical trials use the endpoint for response as a 70 or greater point decrease in CDAI and clinical remission is often defined as a CDAI score below 150. The Outcome included a Generalized linear mixed model analyses which incorporated longitudinal data for each subject, and the same model is used for estimate (least squares mean) and statistical analysis (mean difference). Since the inputs in the model included different Analysis Population than in Outcome Measure 9, that will yield different estimates for placebo for the two different models.</description>

        <title>Percentages of Participants With Confirmed Positive Neutralizing Antibodies (NAbs)</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with confirmed positive NAbs was summarized for each treatment arm. Only ADA positive samples were analyzed for Nab. A multi-tiered approach was utilized to detect NAbs. NAb serum samples were screened at tier one, and those found presumptively NAb positive was further tested with the confirmatory assay (tier two). The percentage of subjects with confirmed positive NAbs was summarized for each treatment.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Enrollment into the 200 mg arm was halted on 14 August 2013 before reaching the planned sample size due to safety findings in NCT01405196. Hence the 200 mg vs placebo comparisons were excluded from the primary analyses and reported separately.</limitations_and_caveats>
