  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frozen- thawed embryos obtained by IVF treatments are transferred to the uterus immediately
      following thawing or after incubation for additional 24-72 hours. The two methods are routine
      in IVF laboratories. In this study the investigators would like to compare between these two
      methods in terms of implantation rate, pregnancy rate and delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been common practice to cryopreserve surplus embryos achieved during IVF treatment or
      in other situation that embryos are to be preserved for other situations such as suspected
      ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome, fertility preservation or patient request.

      Embryos are usually frozen on day 2, 3 or day 5-6 at the Blastocyst stage. At the time that
      thawing is planned, patients' cycle is synchronized and prepared either with hormonal
      treatment or at the natural cycle.

      Not all embryos will always survive the thawing and sometimes they will all degenerate.

      Embryos that survive the thawing procedure are assessed and replaced on the day of the thaw
      or left overnight for better selection and will be replaced only if they continue to divide
      in vitro.

      The advantage of embryo transfer on the day of thaw is that embryo exposure in culture is
      shortened and embryo selection will be occurring in the womb. On the other hand, overnight
      incubation may avoid transferring embryos that potentially are not able to divide and are
      biologically not viable.

      Although both attitudes are practiced in different IVF centers, at present there are no
      prospective randomized studies that have been conducted to advise which intervention is
      better in terms of pregnancy rates.

      The purpose of the present study is to assess which technique will result in better pregnancy
      rates.
