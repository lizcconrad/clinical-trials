  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential role of a cardiology clinic-based
      educational intervention for 15 to 17 year olds with congenital heart disease (CHD) and their
      parents, and to determine whether this intervention results in improved self-management
      skills (e.g., renewing medication prescriptions), teens having greater knowledge of their
      heart condition, and more teen and parent satisfaction with services. The results of this
      study will form the basis for a website that in turn may serve as an additional means of
      providing transition interventions. The results of this study may also be applicable to youth
      with other special health care needs.

    <measure>Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TRAQ is the most rigorously evaluated transition readiness questionnaire available and was developed in the USA. It has 29 items with two domains, self-management (16 items) and self-advocacy (13 ). The TRAQ is at a grade 5.7 reading level and uses a Likert scale. Each item is scored 1-5, with 1 being assigned for responses of &quot;No, I do not know how&quot; and a score of 5 assigned for responses of &quot;Yes, I always do this when I need to.&quot; The TRAQ scores produced include an overall score and a subscale score. The overall score and the subscale scores are calculated simply by taking the average score across the items in the questionnaire (or subscale). The higher the score, the greater the perceived self-management or self-advocacy skills of the participant. The lower scores indicate the participant has a lower perceived level of self-management or self-advocacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MyHeart Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in patient knowledge of his/her CHD (MyHeart score), comparing baseline to 1 month and 6 months follow-up. The MyHeart scale was developed for this study and has a grade 4.6 reading level. It consists of seven short answer or multiple-choice questions. Given the heterogeneity of prior medical and surgical interventions and need for medications in adolescents with heart disease, the denominator for some questions varied from one participant to the next. Accordingly, each participant was assigned a percentage correct score (numerator/denominator×100) at each time point. Higher percentage correct score reflects better patient knowledge of his/her CHD</description>

    <description>This will involve a 60 minute interaction between the teen and an advanced practice nurse (APN) in the cardiology clinic. A MyHealth passport will be created covering the name of the teen's cardiac condition, previous cardiac interventions, and name and purpose of the teen's medications. Potential late cardiac complications and contact names and location of local adult CHD cardiologists will also be reviewed. Three scenarios regarding adolescent risk taking behaviors (written in the 3rd person) will be presented to the teen who will be asked what advice he/she would offer to the teen in each of those scenarios. The teen will be given a study email address and encouraged to contact the APN by email or text messaging with follow-up questions. If no contact is initiated after 1 week, the APN will email or text (based on preference) the youth, to discuss additional questions.</description>

          <description>The intervention was conducted by one of three experienced cardiology nurses following intervention-facilitation training and fidelity assurance. The intervention involved a meeting with the nurse and the participant, with the exception of three interventions also attended by a father (n=1), an uncle (n=1) and a participant’s friend (n=1). Interventions were held in a quiet room without other distractions, a short walk from the cardiology clinic. The order of the intervention was consistently followed, and the study nurse completed a log and field notes to document any difficulties that were encountered during the intervention and the participant’s reaction, level of engagement, questions and body language. Interventions were offered on the same day as a routine clinic visit, or at a later date, depending on the participant’s preference.</description>

Each item is scored 1-5, with 1 being assigned for responses of “No, I do not know how” and a score of 5 assigned for responses of “Yes, I always do this when I need to.” The TRAQ scores produced include an overall score and a subscale score. The overall score and the subscale scores are calculated simply by taking the average score across the items in the questionnaire (or subscale). The higher the score, the greater the perceived self-management or self-advocacy skills of the participant. The lower scores indicate the participant has a lower perceived level of self-management or self-advocacy.</description>
          <population>The intervention involve a 60 minute interaction between the teen and an advanced practice nurse (APN) in the cardiology clinic. The youth in the usual care arm see a nurse for vitals. They rely on their cardiologist for information about their heart condition.

        <title>MyHeart Score</title>
        <description>Change in patient knowledge of his/her CHD (MyHeart score), comparing baseline to 1 month and 6 months follow-up. The MyHeart scale was developed for this study and has a grade 4.6 reading level. It consists of seven short answer or multiple-choice questions. Given the heterogeneity of prior medical and surgical interventions and need for medications in adolescents with heart disease, the denominator for some questions varied from one participant to the next. Accordingly, each participant was assigned a percentage correct score (numerator/denominator×100) at each time point. Higher percentage correct score reflects better patient knowledge of his/her CHD</description>

            <description>This involves a 60 minute interaction between the teen and an advanced practice nurse (APN) in the cardiology clinic. A MyHealth passport is created covering the name of the teen's cardiac condition, previous cardiac interventions, and name and purpose of the teen's medications. Potential late cardiac complications and contact names and location of local adult CHD cardiologists are also reviewed. Three scenarios regarding adolescent risk taking behaviors (written in the 3rd person) are presented to the teen who will be asked what advice he/she would offer to the teen in each of those scenarios. The teen will be given a study email address and encouraged to contact the APN by email or text messaging with follow-up questions. If no contact is initiated after 1 week, the APN will email or text (based on preference) the youth, to discuss additional questions.</description>
