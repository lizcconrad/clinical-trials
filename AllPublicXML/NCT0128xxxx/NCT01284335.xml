      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of LY573636-sodium when used in 5
      separate combinations with an approved cancer medication for treating patients with advanced
      cancer. Data from this study will be reviewed for any side effects or anti-tumor activity
      that may be associated with the LY573636-sodium combination treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have histologically confirmed solid malignancy or lymphoma that is
             unresectable and/or metastatic for which monotherapy with gemcitabine HCl, docetaxel,
             temozolomide, cisplatin, or erlotinib would otherwise be appropriate

          -  Must have tumor progression after receiving standard/approved chemotherapy or limited
             treatment options

          -  Must have measurable or nonmeasurable disease

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures

          -  Must have adequate hepatic, hematologic and renal function

          -  Must have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, cancer-related hormonal therapy or other investigational therapy for at
             least 4 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycin-C or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment and
             recovered from the acute effects of therapy. Endocrine therapies for the treatment of
             prostate cancer may be continued, at the discretion of the investigator. Whole brain
             radiation must have been completed 90 days before starting study therapy. Patients
             without evidence of brain metastases who have received prophylactic whole brain
             irradiation as part of standard of care for small cell lung cancer may be included in
             the study with a shorter washout period pending approval by the Lilly physician.

          -  Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved
             contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 6 months following the last dose of
             study drug.

          -  Females with child-bearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Must have a serum albumin level greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL (30 g/L).

          -  Must have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) scale

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 30 days of the initial dose of study drug with a drug
             that has not received regulatory approval for any indication

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator
             would preclude participation in the study

          -  Patients with active central nervous system or brain metastasis at the time of study
             entry. Patients with signs or symptoms of neurological compromise should have
             appropriate radiographic imaging performed before study entry to rule out brain
             metastasis. Patients with stable CNS metastasis not requiring steroids may be
             eligible.

          -  Have a current hematologic malignancy (other than lymphoma)

          -  Patients with serious concomitant disorders, including active bacterial, fungal, or
             viral infection, incompatible with the study)

          -  Patients actively receiving warfarin (Coumadin®) therapy

          -  Patients who have previously completed or withdrawn from any study investigating
             LY573636

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to one of the combination drugs cannot be
             enrolled to the treatment arm which includes that chemotherapeutic combination

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Have known positive test results of HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C

          -  Patients receiving amiodarone, quinidine, propofol, or clozapine.

          -  Patients receiving treatment with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19, including
             proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). Esomeprazole or pantoprazole are allowed if not
             administered 72 hours before or after LY573636 administration.
