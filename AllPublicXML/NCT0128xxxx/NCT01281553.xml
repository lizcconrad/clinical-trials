  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of cisapride with
      placebo in infants and children with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither patient nor study staff will know the identity of the
      assigned treatment) study evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cisapride in patients with
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) (also referred to as gastroesophageal reflux disease
      [GERD[) compared to a placebo (a identical in appearance to cisapride but does not contain
      active drug). Patients will receive placebo or cisapride suspension at 0.2 mg/kg (volumn
      determined by patient weight) four times per day (q.i.d.) (15 minutes before feeding 3 times
      a day and at bedtime) orally (by mouth) for 8 weeks.
