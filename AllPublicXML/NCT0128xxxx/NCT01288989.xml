      A dose escalation study to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMC-3C5
      in subjects with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which
      no standard therapy is available.

      This multicenter study will enroll approximately 40 subjects. The actual sample size will
      vary depending on how many subjects are needed to obtain at least 3 complete subjects per
      cohort.

      IMC-3C5 will initially be administered once every week (Cohorts 1-4) in a dose escalated
      manner. The starting dose will be 5mg/kg weekly (Cohort 1). Dose escalation will proceed to
      10mg/kg (Cohort 2), 20 mg/kg (Cohort 3), and 30mg/kg (Cohort 4). Based on an analysis of the
      safety and pharmacokinetic profile of weekly dosing, subjects may be enrolled sequentially
      into 2 every-other-week dose cohorts (Cohorts 5-6, 20mg/kg and 30mg/kg). Intermediate doses
      may also be used.
