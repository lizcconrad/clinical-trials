    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given
      together with paclitaxel and cisplatin and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with cervical cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured
      or controlled with treatment or that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving chemotherapy together
      with veliparib may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of ABT-888
      (veliparib) when combined with cisplatin and paclitaxel in women with advanced, persistent,
      or recurrent cervical cancer.

      II. To examine the safety of administering ABT-888 when combined with cisplatin and
      paclitaxel.

      III. Once the recommended phase II dose is established, to estimate the efficacy of
      cisplatin, paclitaxel, and ABT-888 with respect to objective tumor response in patients with
      advanced, persistent, or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effects of this regimen on progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent cancer of
      the cervix whose tumors demonstrate loss of the Fanconi anemia group D2 (FancD2) foci
      formation.

      III. To determine the association between loss of FancD2 foci formation and progression-free
      survival, overall survival, and response in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1, cisplatin IV over 1
      hour on day 2, and veliparib orally (PO) on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      Note added May 22, 2017: This trial was intended to be a phase 1/2 trial, but the trial never
      moved forward to phase 2.
