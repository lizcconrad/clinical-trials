  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity remains the most important single factor in perinatal morbidity and mortality.
      Unfortunately, the rate of premature delivery is increasing in Canada and is especially high
      in Alberta with 7.5% of pregnancies ending before 37 weeks gestation. Despite years of
      research into the causes of spontaneous preterm labor, few effective treatments have been
      identified. Progesterone is one candidate treatment. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether progesterone can prolong pregnancy in women who have symptoms of preterm
      labor.

      Pregnant women who have symptoms of premature labor will be invited to take part in the study
      if they are between 22 to 24 weeks pregnant. If they agree to join the study, they will be
      randomly allocated to either take progesterone 200mg each day via the vagina until 36 weeks,
      or to take a placebo preparation. Neither the women nor their clinician will know which group
      they are in.

      Women and their babies will be followed until 28 days after the birth, to find out about the
      length of the pregnancy, any adverse events that might occur (none have been reported in
      previous trials), and to look at whether women have taken the treatment.

      When the study is complete, the results for the progesterone group will be compared to the
      placebo group. If progesterone is found to be useful in helping to prolong pregnancy, then
      this will be a possible treatment to help mothers in the future.
