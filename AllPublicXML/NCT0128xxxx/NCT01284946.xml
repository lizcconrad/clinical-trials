  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While clinical phlebotomy is current standard practice for alleviating non-transfusion iron
      overload in patients with PCT, it may not be suitable for all patients. For example, some
      patients are unwilling to be adequately phlebotomized because of inconvenience, as phlebotomy
      can be cumbersome, especially during the induction treatment phase requiring frequent clinic
      visits (twice a month, for at least 6 months) or because of venous access difficulties. Other
      patients are unable to undergo phlebotomy due to medical reasons such as anemia or
      cardiopulmonary disorders. It is postulated such patients with PCT who have non-transfusion
      iron overload could benefit from treatment with deferasirox (Exjade®), a once daily oral iron
      chelator licensed in several countries, including the EU, for treating transfusion iron
      overload in adult and pediatric patients. Although there is some data on the efficacy and
      safety of deferasirox in patients with HH, who, like those with PCT, have non-transfusional
      iron overload, there is a need to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox treatment
      of non-transfusion iron overload in patients with PCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety of deferasirox in treating non-transfusion iron
      overload in patients with PCT.

      The secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of deferasirox treatment :

      After 3 and 6 months to:

      •Lower serum ferritin from abnormal to normal standard ranges specified for males and females
      in this patient population.

      After 6 months to :

      •Lower liver iron content after 24 weeks of treatment measured by liver MRI T2

      After 3 and 6 months to :

        -  Improve clinical symptoms, i.e. improvement in skin lesions (reduction or no new bullae
           formation), and skin fragility (photographs will be used).

        -  Reduce porphyrin levels.
