      Veno-arteriolar and veno- arteriolar-myogenic reflexes (VAR and VMR, respectively) are of the
      most important contributors to local vasoregulation.

      In a recent research we showed that VAR is affected in the affected lower limbs of CRPS
      (chronic regional pain syndrome) patients. {Dayan, 2008 1 /id} That is, local venous
      congestion (40 mmHg) results in a decreased blood flow in the affected, sick limb compared
      with its contralateral. The myogenic reflex, however, that is induced by lowering the leg 40
      cm below heart level, which causes both venous and arteriolar congestion, was intact in the
      sick leg. We concluded that the pathophysiology of CRPS might involve a defect in the neural
      reflex between venous and arteriolar vessels. Arteriolar smooth muscle action, on the other
      hand, is intact and might compensate for the overwhelmed VAR.

      Trying to explain the fact that VAR, but not VMR, was different between the affected and
      unaffected limbs, we raise the hypothesis that since VMR is a local vasoregulatory reflex
      composed of two components: the venous and myogenic, opposed to the VAR, the myogenoic
      component of the reflex might compensate for the inappropriate VAR. Many mechanisms that
      might affect vascular muscles may occur, one of them is related to adenosine.

      Adenosine is considered a retaliatory autacoid, whose main function is to protect tissues
      against ischemia. It is a very potent vasodilator. Adenosine is also considered an important
      mediator of ischemic preconditioning, a phenomenon by which an initial brief period of
      ischemia protects the tissue from the damage produced by a subsequent more intense ischemic
      episode.

      Adenosine has a pivotal role in local vasoregulation. In many researches it was shown that
      adenosine contributes to exercise hyperaemia in skeletal muscle. The 'adenosine hypothesis'
      states that blood flow is regulated by interstitial adenosine, released from cardiac or
      skeletal muscle fibers when there is a mismatch between O2 supply and O2 demand. When there
      is insufficient O2 to regenerate ATP, ADP and AMP accumulate leading to adenosine generation.
      By causing vasodilatation, adenosine helps to restore the O2 delivery, reversing the mismatch
      and allowing ATP to be regenerated.

      Adenosine is a naturally occurring ligand of 4 subtypes of G-protein-coupled cell membrane
      receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) involved in cellular signaling. Dipyridamole produces
      coronary hyperemia by indirectly activating adenosine A2A receptors by inhibiting tissue
      uptake of adenosine and thereby increasing levels of endogenous adenosine.

      Taking all these considerations into account we hypothesize that local vascular reflexes like
      VAR, and eventually VMR are mediated by adenosine. That is, adenosine produced at a constant
      rate in vascular bed contributing to constant blood flow under a wide range of local
      circumstances. A local increase in venous blood flow (as in lower limbs veins during
      prolonged standing) causes adenosine &quot;wash out&quot;, which leads to local arterial
      vasoconstriction to reduce blood flow to the limb, which is, in fact, the purpose of VAR. if
      our hypothesis turns to be true, then when we will see exaggeration of the reflexes with
      adenosine blockade and vice versa, a decrease its abolishment with adenosine reuptake
      inhibition.

    <description>The venoarteriolar reflex is the arteriolar vascocostriction response to venous congestion in the limb. The congestion is produced by lowering the limb below the heart level or increasing the soft tissue pressure (using a cuff)to above venous and below arteriolar pressure (to 40 mmHg). The vasoconstriction is assessed by comparing blood flow to the limb before and after the congestion. the units used for blood flow measurements are of flow: ml blood/100 ml tissue*sec^-1.</description>

          3. Normal blood count, liver function tests (albumin and coagulation profile, liver
             enzymes).

          4. Normal EKG (will be performed in the beginning of the session and interpreted by a
             senior investigator).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any former medical condition affecting any system in the body (including
             cardiovascular).

          2. History of allergy to any drug.
