      Glucose has analgesic and calming effects in newborns. To date, it is not known whether the
      beneficial effects extend to care giving procedures that are performed after painful
      procedures. The investigators objective is to determine the effect of glucose 25% analgesia
      for procedural pain on infant pain responses during a subsequent care giving procedure.

      Pain in the newborn and young infant is a source of stress for the infant, family and care
      providers.

      During hospitalization, a neonate undergoes a number of necessary procedures that may be
      either painful or cause discomfort to the baby.

      Pain experienced during the neonatal period is known to have long term effects on the baby.

      The red-reflex test is a routine examination performed on a neonate after birth and once
      again before discharge from the hospital. The examination causes discomfort to the infant.

      Glucose has analgesic and calming effects in newborns. To date, it is not known whether the
      beneficial effects extend to care giving procedures that are performed after painful
      procedures. Our objective is to determine the effect of glucose 25% analgesia for procedural
      pain on infant pain responses during a subsequent care giving procedure.

    <description>An observer nurse will focus on the infant's facial expression. A score between 0 and 3 will be assigned for each of the three facial expression indicators.
For physiological data, infants will be monitored for changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation using a transcutaneous pulse oximeter. A score between 0 and 3 will be assigned for each of the physiological indicators</description>

    <description>180 healthy babies born term in the Baruch Padeh Medical Center, Poriya.
There will be three study groups:
Study Group: 60 newborn infants who will receive 1cc 25% Glucose, 2-3 minutes prior red-reflex examination.
Base line (control) Group 1: 60 newborn infants who will receive 1cc Water for Injection (WFI), 2-3 minutes prior red-reflex examination.
Base line (control ) Group 2: 60 newborn infants who will not receive neither glucose nor Water for Injection (WFI), 2-3 minutes prior red-reflex examination</description>
