      The purpose of this study is to asses the link between glycaemic balance (summarised by HBA1C
      LEVEL) and specific causes of death.

      The GERODIAB study is the first prospective, longitudinal follow-up cohort study, the main
      aim of which is to assess the link between glycaemic balance (evaluated on the basis of HbA1c
      levels) and total mortality at 5 years in diabetic patients aged 70 and over, and suffering
      from type 2 diabetes. An extension to 10 years is considered given the innovative features of
      this cohort follow-up procedure.

      The secondary endpoints are as follows:

        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and the mortality rate with specific
           causes.

        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and the onset of or change in
           diabetes-related complications: cardiovascular diseases, change in renal function,
           diabetic retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, perforating ulcer of the foot and acute
           metabolic complications.

        -  To assess the link between glycaemic balance and nutritional status, the onset of or
           changes in cognitive disorders and a loss of autonomy.

        -  To specify the role of other cardiovascular risk factors combined with glycaemic
           balance, in mortality, diabetes-related complications, cognitive disorders and loss of
           autonomy.
