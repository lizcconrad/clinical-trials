      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 in combination
      with peginterferon alfa-2a (PegIFNα-2a) and ribavirin in genotype 1 hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-infected participants who failed to respond to previous interferon (IFN)-based therapy
      in Japan.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 2-arm, open-label study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of TMC435 (also referred to as jnj-38733214-aaa) in combination with the
      standard of care (SoC) therapy consisting of peginterferon alfa-2a (PegIFNα-2a ) and
      ribavirin (RBV) administered according to the manufacturer's prescribing information in
      adult, genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants who failed to respond to
      previous interferon (IFN)-based therapy in Japan. The study objective is to evaluate the
      efficacy of TMC435 by the proportion of participants with undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid
      (RNA). Participants will receive 12 weeks of treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus
      PegIFNα-2a (P) and RBV P) followed by 12 or 36 weeks of treatment with PR OR participants
      will receive 24 weeks of treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus PR followed by 24
      weeks of treatment with PR. TMC435 is a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally (via the
      mouth). Treatment with PR will last 24 or 48 weeks: Pegylated interferon is supplied as a
      vial containing 1.0 mL solution with 180 mcg PegIFNα-2a and will be injected by a syringe
      under the skin once weekly. Ribavirin is given as 200-mg tablets (daily dose: 600-1000 mg
      based on body weight), and taken orally by mouth two times a day after meals. Participants
      will receive oral capsules of TMC435 (100 mg) once daily up to Week 12 or 24.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted between 05-Jan-2011 to 05-Sep-2012 and recruited participants with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection from 23 study centers in Japan. A total of 108 participants were randomized, 106 started treatment, and 101 completed the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with genotype 1 HCV-infection who failed a previous course of interferon (IFN) based therapy received TMC435 100 mg once daily with PegIFNα-2a and ribavirin (PR) until Week 12 (OR Week 24), followed by PR until Week 24/48 based on response-guided treatment (RGT).</pre_assignment_details>

Treatment was stopped at Week 24 if participants achieved plasma hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels &lt;1.2 log10 IU/mL detectable or undetectable at Week 4, and undetectable plasma HCV RNA levels at Week 12. All other participants continued PR until Week 48.</description>
