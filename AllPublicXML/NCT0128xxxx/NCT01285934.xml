  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) results from immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing
      islet cells. The loss of islet cells is traditionally treated with insulin therapy and in
      some cases pancreas or islet cell transplantation. Another approach would be to preserve
      islet cell mass before it is irreversibly lost. Previous trials using immune suppression
      within 6 weeks of T1D onset have demonstrated diminished exogenous insulin requirements
      compared to untreated controls. In our prior phase I non-randomized study, by extending
      immune suppression to the point of immune ablation / immune reset with autologous HSC
      support, several patients with new onset T1D have maintained an insulin-free, drug free
      remissions for more than 4 years. Although these results appear highly promising, it may be
      argued that our results are mitigated by the documented honeymoon effect following T1D, that
      is by a normal transient insulin free interval occurring after disease onset in some
      patients. The goal of this trial is to extend this phase I study of new onset T1D to clarify
      whether our post transplant insulin free interval is due to treatment intervention
      (transplant) or a result of a normally occurring &quot;insulin free honeymoon period&quot;. Both groups
      will receive identical change of life style (i.e. diet, exercise) education.

      Eligible patients will have type 1 diabetes (aged ≥ 18 years old) within five months of
      disease diagnosis, and a positive antibody to an islet cell autoantigen, and fasting
      C-peptide &gt; 0.2 nmol/l. Hematopoietic stem cells will be mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2.0
      g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (10 g/kg/day) collected from peripheral blood
      by leukoapheresis and cryopreserved. HSC will injected IV after conditioning with
      cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) divided 50 mg/kg on day -5, -4, -3, -2, and rabbit antithymocyte
      globulin (4.5 mg/kg) divided 0.5 mg/kg day-5, and 1.0 mg/kg day -4, -3-, -2, -1. Rituxan
      (500mg) IV will be given on days -6 and +1. The control arm will receive either continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or intensive subcutaneous insulin therapy with multiple
      insulin injections (at least 4/day) utilizing a long acting background insulin and pre-meal
      rapid acting insulin. The main outcome measure will be: fasting C-peptide. Other outcome
      measures will include: daily exogenous insulin requirements, serum levels of hemoglobin A1c,
      area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during mixed meal tolerance test, islet cell
      autoantigen antibody titers, and quality of life (QOL) short form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire.
