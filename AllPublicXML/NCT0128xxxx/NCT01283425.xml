  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study. Up to one hundred and
      twenty (120) subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who use the MiniMed paradigm
      insulin pump, who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and who provide written Informed
      Consent will be enrolled in the study. The aim of the study is to examine the safety of the
      InsuPatch device in a home use setting. Mild Hypoglycemia,hyperglycemia and Adverse events
      will be compared between two phases of the study : 3 months with the use of the device and 3
      months without the use of the device.

      The primary objective of this study is to show that safety parameters are similar, when
      delivering insulin subcutaneously in subjects with type I diabetes using the InsuPatch device
      along with the Medtronic Minimed Paradigm insulin infusion pump and the Medtronic Minimed
      Quick-SetÂ® infusion set compared to subcutaneous insulin delivered with the above mentioned
      equipment, without the InsuPatch device.

      The participation of each subject in this study will be up to seven months and will include
      three phases: one week Run in phase , 3 months with device use and 3 months without device
      use. Study will include 4 clinic visits and bi weekly calls. During the entire study the
      subjects will be requested to preform at least 5 blood glucose self measurements and record
      results in a logbook.At each visit blood will be drawn for HBA1C test.
