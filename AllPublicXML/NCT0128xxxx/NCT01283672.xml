  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are the following: 1) to determine the acute effect of whole
      grain barley on risk factors of cardiovascular disease compared to a diet low in whole grain,
      and 2) to compare the effects of whole grain barley to those of whole grain oats to determine
      if the response to these two grains is similar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole grains contain bioactive components that may contribute to reduced risk of
      cardiovascular disease, and there may be significant differences among whole grain sources
      with respect to ability to alter biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. This acute study is
      designed to determine if whole grain barley improves postprandial lipid metabolism and
      improves endothelial function. Further, we will determine if acute consumption of whole grain
      barley versus acute consumption of whole grain oats results in differential response with
      respect to biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk.

    <measure>Lipid Tolerance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>After 3 consecutive days of controlled feeding.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will come in after a 12-hour fast for a lipid tolerance test. Specifically, participants will consume a treatment breakfast meal and blood samples will be collected 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 360, and 420 minutes following ingestion of the treatment meal.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>EndoPAT</measure>
    <time_frame>After 3 consecutive days of controlled feeding</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial function will be assessed by measuring endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilation of the peripheral bed (EndoPAT, Itamar Medical, Israel). Immediately after the test, a blood sample will be collected for measurement of serum triglycerides.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genetic testing</measure>
    <time_frame>After 3 consecutive days of controlled feeding</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be used to test for genetic traits that may influence nutrient metabolism and also traits reflecting the mechanisms that may be influenced by the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Microarray and targeted gene expression testing</measure>
    <time_frame>After 3 consecutive days of controlled feeding</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be used to test how the intervention affects gene expression. Global gene expression will be performed for a complete survey of the RNA response to the intervention, and targeted gene expression will be performed to confirm the findings of the global gene expression analysis.</description>

    <intervention_name>Controlled diet with whole grain barley, whole grain oats, or low grain diet</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will consume a standardized diet for 3 days prior to the treatment intervention meal. Meals will be prepared using traditional American foods with a macronutrient composition representative of a typical American diet. Participants will be instructed to eat all foods and only foods provided to them, with the exception of water, coffee, tea, and diet soda.</description>
