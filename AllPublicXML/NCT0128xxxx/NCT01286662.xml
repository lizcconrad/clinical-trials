      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term outcome in a cohort of Gardner-Syndrome
      patients receiving prophylaxis and treatment for intestinal and non-intestinal tumors.

      Since 1978, we have been following a family of 105 descendants with Gardner Syndrome (GS).
      Mutation carriers were screened by endoscopy, and colorectal resection was performed upon
      pending malignancy. Resectable desmoid tumors were excised, whereas large tumors of the
      abdominal wall were treated by a combination of brachytherapy (BT) and radiotherapy (RT).
      Outcome was analyzed with respect to length of tumor-free survival, and morbidity from
      surgery or radiotherapy. Results: 37 of 105 family members have GS. Preventive colorectal
      resections were performed in 16 patients (15%), with one death due to subsequent gastric
      cancer. In 4 patients who denied screening endoscopy, invasive tumors of the colon (3
      patients) and stomach (one patient each) developed. Of 33 desmoid tumors, 10 (30%) were
      located in the mesentery, 17 (52%) in the abdominal wall, and 6 (18%) in extra-abdominal
      sites. Excision of 12 desmoids was performed in 8 patients (36%), and 4 were treated by a
      combination of BT and RT. Following BT/RT, all patients showed full or partial remission.

        Since 1978, we have been following a family of 105 descendants with Gardner syndrom. APC
        (adenomatous polyposis coli) mutation carriers were screened by endoscopy, and colorectal
        resection was performed upon pending malignancy. Desmoid tumors were treated by excision or
        radiotherapy and brachytherapy.
