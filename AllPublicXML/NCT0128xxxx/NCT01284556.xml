      Primary:

      -to evaluate the efficacy of once daily (OD) administration of 60 mg and 100 mg
      phenobarbital, in reducing seizure frequency in participants with partial onset seizures
      (Type I seizures; complex or simple with motor symptoms only) not fully controlled despite
      treatment with 1 to 3 concomitant anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) or AEDs with Vagus Nerve
      Stimulator (VNS)

      Secondary:

        -  to confirm dose response relationship of 60 and 100 mg phenobarbital doses,

        -  to assess the effects of phenobarbital on Type I seizures,

        -  to assess the safety of phenobarbital

        -  to assess the tolerability of phenobarbital
