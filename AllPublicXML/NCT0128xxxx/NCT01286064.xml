      The aim of the present prospective study was to investigate the fluorescence emission of
      human blood plasma of patients with colorectal cancer.

      For years, serum tumor markers have been studied for the diagnosis and follow-up of
      colorectal cancer, among which carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has achieved promising results.
      However, the sensitivity of CEA for colorectal cancer is less than 25% and elevated CEA
      levels also occur in patients with benign disease, as well as in patients with other
      carcinomas. Nevertheless, surveillance programs are often based on the CEA test and
      combination with other markers is at present a matter of research. Alternative methods based
      on optical fluoroscopy have been introduced in experimental stages for clinical diagnosis of
      cancer. Few studies have been reported on the application of native fluorescence spectroscopy
      of biofluids in the diagnosis of tumoral diseases. The above reported findings prompted us to
      investigate the fluorescence emission of human blood plasma of patients with colorectal
      cancer. For this purpose, the blood of patients was collected and the fluorescence
      Preliminary measurements on plasma of patients bearing colon cancer showed that the
      fluorescence spectra were mainly characterized by the presence of an emission peaking at
      620-630 nm, whose excitation spectrum peaked at 405 nm. Hence, an excitation wavelength of
      405 nm was selected for the study. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in the
      range of 430-700 nm.

      Eligibility criteria: Gastrointestinal disease or clinical symptoms related to colorectal
      cancer risk submitted to endoscopy. Exclusion criteria consisted of age younger than 18
      years, history of psychiatric illness, and preoperative radiotherapy.

      Outcome: investigated the possible role of the native fluorescence of blood plasma in the
      management of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its feasibility as a new tumor marker. Sample of
      blood was collected from asymptomatic blood donors and from CRC patients. The native
      fluorescence of blood plasma was measured using a conventional spectrofluorimeter.

    <description>Lithium-heparin was added to the blood samples to prevent coagulation. The samples were then centrifuged and the plasma was removed without disturbing the buffy coat and the erythrocyte sediments. The separated changes in the enzyme associated with heme biosynthesis have been reported for peripheral mononuclear cells in patients with epithelial tumors and metastatic spread. plasma was stored at -20 °C until assayed. For fluorescence measurements, analytical grade acetone was added to plasma in a 1:1 ratio by volume and the mixture was centrifuged. The clear supernatant was placed in a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length for further analysis. Fluorescence analysis of blood plasma was performed by means of a spectrofluorometer (Model F-3000, Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).</description>
