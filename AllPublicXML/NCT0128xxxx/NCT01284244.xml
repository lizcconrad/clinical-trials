  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined as the involuntary loss of urine with an
      increase in abdominal pressure, caused either by a loss of support under the bladder neck, or
      intrinsic urethral sphincter deficiency. It is a common problem in women that can
      significantly impact quality of life, with up to 30% developing SUI at some point in their
      lifetime.

      The most commonly utilized treatments for SUI include either pelvic floor (Kegel) exercises,
      or surgery. Many women find Kegel exercises unsatisfactory, but are reluctant to undergo a
      surgical procedure. Also, women who are poor candidates for surgery have limited options if
      Kegel exercises are unsuccessful. Over the years, there have been numerous attempts to
      develop effective non-surgical alternatives for treating SUI, but the results have been
      variable and the available data on efficacy limited.

      A new intravaginal incontinence pessary (Uresta) has been developed for treating stress
      incontinence, and is currently available in Canada via a medical distributor. The
      self-positioning device is initially fitted by a healthcare provider, but then can
      subsequently placed by the patient as needed. Uresta is designed to be easily inserted into
      the vagina and spontaneously fall into position, providing support beneath the urethra. A
      single, uncontrolled study of 21 women showed that Uresta significantly reduces urinary
      incontinence measures, with no reported complications. Using questionnaires, a 47% reduction
      in self-reported SUI symptoms was demonstrated. Pad weight following a pad test, an objective
      assessment of urine loss, showed a 50% reduction in leakage.

      This trial is intended to be a short-term assessment of the efficacy of the Uresta device,
      using a placebo arm in order to remove any of the possible sources of patient biases. The
      placebo (&quot;sham&quot;) group will be obtained by placing a flexible silastic ring (inactivated
      Estring) high in the vagina where it will not alter urethral forces. The aim is to
      unequivocally determine whether the Uresta device provides the necessary urethral support to
      stop urine leakage from stress incontinence.

      The hypothesis is that the Uresta device will significantly reduce urinary losses from
      baseline, shown as a significant reduction pad weight following a pad test with the device in
      place.

    <description>A pad test is an objective measure of urine loss. With a full bladder, while wearing a pad, the participant completes five repetitions of the following physical activities: coughing, step climbing, heel bounce, standing from a sitting position and walking 50 yards. The weight of the pad is then determined.
The primary outcome variable will be the achievement of a 50% reduction in the pad weight before and after device placement. This figure is obtained from the study by Farrell et al, where pad weight decreased from 20 grams to 9 grams with the use of the Uresta device.</description>

          <title>Uresta</title>
          <description>Uresta pessary: Participants randomized to the Uresta group will be fitted with device before immediately before performing the pad test. The Uresta pessary is made of medical grade rubber that has been extensively tested for safety. It is bell-shaped, with a narrow tip that allows for easy insertion into the vagina in a similar fashion to a tampon. The device can be easily inserted, and removed by a patient for use when needed. The Uresta comes in 3 sizes. Fitting starts with insertion of the smallest size. If urine leakage continues with valsalva or a cough stress test, it can be replaced by one size larger, until leakage is stopped. If the device prevents the patient from being able to void or is uncomfortable due to its size, the smaller size is replaced. Following the pad test, the participant will be given the opportunity to keep the device for continued use, or remove it if desired.</description>

          <title>Silastic Vaginal Ring</title>
          <description>Silastic ring: The silastic ring is a plastic flexible ring similar to that used to administer vaginal estrogen (Estring). It is well tolerated and would not contain any medications. Immediately before performing the pad test, it would be placed high in the vagina, away from the urethra. It would be removed immediately after the pad test. Draping will conceal from the patient which device was inserted.</description>
