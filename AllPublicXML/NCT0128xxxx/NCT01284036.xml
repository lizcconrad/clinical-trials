    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the safety and side effects of investigational drug in
      healthy volunteers. See how quickly investigational drug enters the bloodstream, is
      distributed in the body, broken down and removed in healthy male and female volunteers. See
      if your body makes antibodies to this investigational drug (how your immune system responds).
