  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel was the first drug that showed survival benefits when added to the CF regimen, but
      it was very toxic. Docetaxel is also has a synergistic anti-cancer effect with S-1, in phase
      I/II studies. The use of a docetaxel plus S-1 combination as first-line chemotherapy for
      advanced gastric cancer achieved response rates of 46~56% and a median survival time of
      14.0~14.3 months.

      Based upon this background, the aim of this study is to detect a significant increase in 3
      year DFS of disease for the test group (DS) relative to the Control group (SP).
