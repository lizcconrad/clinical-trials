      This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence,single
      dose, replicate crossover bioequivalence study in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under
      fasting conditions.48 healthy male adults were enrolled.A washout period of 07 days was
      maintained between the successive dosing days.One tablet containing mycophenolate mofetil 500
      mg was administered orally with 240 mL water in sitting posture, after an overnight fast of
      at least 10 hours in each period. This activity was followed by a mouth check to assess
      compliance to dosing. The subjects were not allowed to lie down for the first three hours
      after dosing.
