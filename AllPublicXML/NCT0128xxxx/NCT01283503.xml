    <textblock>
      In this study, BKM120 will be administered to adult patients with advanced solid tumors whose
      disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. The
      trial will confirm the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of BKM120 in Japanese patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically confirmed, advanced unresectable solid tumors who have
             progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard therapy or for whom no standard
             anticancer therapy exists.

          2. At least one measurable or non-measurable lesion as defined by RECIST guidelines for
             solid tumors.

          3. Age ≥ 20 years

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG P.S.) of ≤ 2

          5. Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks

          6. Patients must have the laboratory values

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of primary central nervous system tumors or brain metastases
             or who have signs/symptoms attribute to brain metastases and have not been assessed
             with radiologic imaging to rule out the presence of brain metastases

          2. Prior treatment with a PI3K inhibitor

          3. Patients with any peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2

          4. Patients with unresolved diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2

          5. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding. Men or women of
             reproductive potential not to sign informed consent for birth control. Barrier
             contraceptives must be used throughout the trial and six months after the end of
             treatment.
