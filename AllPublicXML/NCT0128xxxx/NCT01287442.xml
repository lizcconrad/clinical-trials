  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established to assess the functionality of a filtering bleb by intraocular
      pressure (IOP), either as an absolute value or as a percent reduction, and by the need of
      additional antiglaucoma drugs. It is also possible to evaluate the appearance of a bleb by a
      clinical score, e.g. the &quot;Wuerzburg bleb classification score&quot; (WBCS). The purpose of this
      study was to find out whether there is a correlation between clinical findings, in particular
      IOP and the WBCS.

      100 eyes within two years after trabeculectomy were included into the study. Using colour
      photographs the filtering bleb was evaluated according to the WBCS from two different
      examiners, both on different levels of clinical experience. WBCS = 1 indicates poor bleb
      appearance, WBCS = 15 indicates optimal bleb appearance. At the same time, clinical findings
      like intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy and medical
      history were taken by another examiner.
