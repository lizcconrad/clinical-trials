  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to verify hair count reduction, associated
      comfort/discomfort and treatment time using the LightSheer Duet System with the High Speed
      (HS) handpieces for temporary hair removal and permanent hair reduction. It is anticipated
      that the larger treatment size of the HS handpiece will result in faster treatment of larger
      areas; and that the lower energy levels will result in greater comfort.
