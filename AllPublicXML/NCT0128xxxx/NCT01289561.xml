    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of caffeine on the
      self-administration of alcohol. The study will also examine the combined effects of alcohol
      and caffeine on behavioral performance, participant ratings of behavioral performance, and
      self-reported subjective effects.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of caffeine on alcohol
      self-administration. Volunteers will participate in 7 experimental sessions in which they
      will be given the opportunity to self-administer an alcohol + caffeine or alcohol +
      caffeine-placebo beverage. The first 6 sessions will involve exposure to the two beverage
      conditions in mixed order three times each (e.g., A, B, B, A, A, B). The seventh session will
      be a choice session in which the participant will make a single choice at the beginning of
      the session about which beverage they will consume that day. In addition to the primary
      outcomes of quantity of alcohol self-administered and beverage choice, three additional
      outcomes will be measured including: 1). indirect measures of reinforcing effects (e.g.
      subjective ratings of liking, well-being, take again); 2). an alcohol-sensitive behavioral
      measure; and 3). participant ratings of degree of behavioral impairment.

    <measure>The Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 30 minutes of the 5.5 hour study period</time_frame>
    <description>The Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES: Martin et al., 1993) will be repeatedly administered to assess changes in subjective alcohol effects over time. This measure is a commonly used 14-item scale that assesses stimulant (7 items) and sedative (7 items) subjective effects of drugs on a 10-point likert scale</description>

    <measure>Expired air breath alcohol measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 30 minutes during the 5.5 hour study period</time_frame>
    <description>Breath alcohol measures will be taken repeatedly in order to assess blood alcohol levels, as well as assure safe discharge. In order to prevent mouth alcohol contamination of breath alcohol measurements, participants will be required to abstain from drinking for 5 minutes before each measurement and to rinse their mouth out thoroughly with water immediately before breath alcohol measures.</description>

    <measure>Subjective ratings 9-point likert scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 30 minutes during the 5.5 hour study period</time_frame>
    <description>The following three questions will be asked on a 9-point likert scale:
How much do you like the beverage you have been drinking today?
Rate your sense of &quot;well-being&quot; right now.
How much money would you be willing to pay for a standard mixed drink serving (e.g., 8 oz.) of this beverage at a bar?</description>

    <measure>Subjective ratings visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 30 minutes during the 5.5 hour study period</time_frame>
    <description>The following two questions will be answered on a visual analogue scale:
How much do you want another drinking right now?
How intoxicated do you feel?</description>

    <description>All participants will participate in seven sessions. In three sessions, each participant will consume a beverage containing alcohol and caffeine. In three separate sessions, participants will consume a beverage containing alcohol and caffeine-placebo. In the final session, all participants may choose which beverage they consume. Participants and research assistants will be blinded to inclusion of caffeine/caffeine-placebo in beverage, but each beverage will be labeled for identification (e.g., A or B).</description>
