      Main objective: To improve diabetes outcomes among Mexican-Americans with diabetes through
      church-based, culturally tailored, diabetes self-management interventions linked to the local
      healthcare system.

      Specific Aim: To pilot test a church-based, culturally tailored diabetes self-management
      intervention to improve diabetes outcomes among low-income Mexican-American with diabetes

      H1 A church-based diabetes self-care management curriculum partnered with the local
      healthcare system will improve glycosylated hemoglobin.

      H2 A church-based diabetes self-care management curriculum partnered with the local
      healthcare system will improve systolic blood pressure and low-density lipids.

      H3 A church-based diabetes self-care management curriculum partnered with the local
      healthcare system will improve diabetes related self-efficacy, self-empowerment and self-care
      management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a very prevalent and morbid condition affecting Latinos, especially
      Mexican-Americans in the United States. South Lawndale, a predominately-Mexican neighborhood
      of Chicago, has a disproportionately high diabetes related mortality rate in comparison to
      the rest of Chicago and the U.S. Many church-based interventions have shown promise improving
      health outcomes among minority populations; but data on church-based interventions for Latino
      populations is scarce. Mobilizing community resources to develop church-based, diabetes
      self-management interventions may lead to sustainable, culturally tailored interventions, and
      improve outcomes in Latinos with diabetes. Considering the growth of the Hispanic population
      and their disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, developing programming aimed at
      decreasing the health disparities in this population is crucial. Our study proposes to fill
      this gap.
