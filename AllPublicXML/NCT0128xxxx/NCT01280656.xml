  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study will assess the sustained virologic response and the safety of two
      different interferons (pegylated or conventional) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Data
      will be collected for 24 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at 12 Weeks After End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as virological response at 12 weeks after end of treatment (EOT). Virologic response was either defined as having undetectable (that is, no hepatitis C virus Ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] was detected in the participants' plasma samples) or less than 50 international units/milliliter (IU/mL) HCV RNA (that is, the participants' plasma samples contained traces of HCV RNA at a concentration below the limit of quantification of the viral load assay or no HCV RNA was detected in the samples). EOT= Week 48. Participants who did not have viral load assessment at Week 12 were considered treatment failures, except in the specific case where the lack of assessment was not due to treatment shortening in function of response guided therapy.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at 24 Weeks After End of Treatment</measure>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Were Treated at Interferon Application Centers and at Home and Discontinued Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who were treated at interferon application centers and at home and who discontinued treatment is presented. Participants who did not have viral load assessment at Week 12 were considered treatment failures, except in the specific case where the lack of assessment was not due to treatment shortening in function of response guided therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percentage Reduction of Hemoglobin in Treatment Responders and Treatment Non-Responders</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The average percentage reduction of hemoglobin (Hb) in treatment responders and treatment non-responders between the conventional group, peginterferon alfa-2a plus and peginterferon alfa-2b is presented. Participants with undetectable HCV RNA at specified time points (Weeks 4/12/18/24/48) were considered as treatment responders. Participants with positive viral load (detectable HCV RNA) at end of treatment regardless of the treatment duration were considered as treatment non-responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Rapid Virologic Response at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Rapid virologic response was defined as qualitative or quantitative HCV-RNA (viral load) undetectable (below the lower limit of detection) at Week 4 of treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Virologic Response at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Virologic response at EOT was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at EOT (regardless in which week treatment was concluded). EOT = Week 48.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Virologic Relapse up to Week 72</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Virologic relapse was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at end of treatment and detectable HCV-RNA at the last follow-up assessment available. If the participant was a responder at end of treatment and was not submitted to any viral load assessment during the follow-up period, he was considered a relapser.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Null Response or No Responder at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Null response or no responders were defined as those participants presenting positive viral load at EOT (regardless of the treatment duration). EOT= Week 48.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Discontinued Treatment Due to Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AE) between conventional group, peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Any Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment or requires intervention to prevent one or other of these outcomes.</description>

        <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as virological response at 12 weeks after end of treatment (EOT). Virologic response was either defined as having undetectable (that is, no hepatitis C virus Ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] was detected in the participants’ plasma samples) or less than 50 international units/milliliter (IU/mL) HCV RNA (that is, the participants’ plasma samples contained traces of HCV RNA at a concentration below the limit of quantification of the viral load assay or no HCV RNA was detected in the samples). EOT= Week 48. Participants who did not have viral load assessment at Week 12 were considered treatment failures, except in the specific case where the lack of assessment was not due to treatment shortening in function of response guided therapy.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at 24 Weeks After End of Treatment</title>
          <description>SVR was defined as virological response at 24 weeks after EOT, EOT= Week 48. Virologic response was either defined as having undetectable (that is, no hepatitis C virus Ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] was detected in the participants' plasma samples) or less than 50 IU/mL HCV RNA (that is, the participants' plasma samples contained traces of HCV RNA at a concentration below the limit of quantification of the viral load assay or no HCV RNA was detected in the samples). Participants who did not have viral load assessment at Week 12 were considered treatment failures, except in the specific case where the lack of assessment was not due to treatment shortening in function of response guided therapy.</description>
          <population>The ITT population consisted of participants who fulfilled all inclusion/ exclusion criteria. The analysis was performed in participants with virologic response at EOT in each group (16, 126, and 101 respectively).</population>
