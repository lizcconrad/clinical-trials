      The purpose of this study is to compare the influence of a lung protective ventilation with
      conventional ventilation on postoperative complications following major abdominal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative complications are associated with a significant and quantifiable rate of both
      morbidity and mortality, increased length of hospital stay and cost of care. Intra-abdominal
      surgery, especially upper abdominal surgery, is an important risk factor of both pulmonary
      and extra-pulmonary complications. Up to 15-20% of patients will develop postoperative
      respiratory failure which may require respiratory support.

      Recent data from both experimental and clinical studies suggested that, compared with
      conventional ventilation using high tidal volume (TV) without positive end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEP), intraoperative lung protective ventilation using low tidal volume, PEEP and
      recruitment maneuvers (RM) could reduce postoperative complications. Conventional ventilation
      promotes sustained cytokine production and could therefore contribute to development of lung
      injury with in patients with normal lungs. Conversely, lung protective ventilation was found
      to reduce pulmonary and systemic inflammation.

      The primary objective is to compare a lung protective ventilation with conventional
      ventilation (high tidal volumes without PEEP) during abdominal surgery: 1- Conventional
      ventilation with TV of 10-12 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) without PEEP; 2- Protective
      lung ventilation with TV of 6-8 mL/kg PBW, PEEP of 6-8 cmH2O and RM.

      Our hypothesis is that lung protective ventilation could reduce postoperative pulmonary and
      extra-pulmonary complications compared with conventional ventilation.
