  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a lifestyle program for women
      with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The investigators want to assess the effect of a
      pulse-based diet (i.e. a diet that contains lentils, chick-peas, peas, and beans) and aerobic
      exercise for improving PCOS disease features and risk factors for metabolic syndrome. We
      would like to determine the therapeutic effects of a lifestyle program that combines a
      pulse-based diet and exercise on the multiple disease measures of PCOS and metabolic
      syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, we have developed the pulse-based and meat-based healthy meals following Therapeutic
      Lifestyle Changes (TLC)guidelines recommended by NCEP for the intervention. We have been
      recruiting and enrolling participants into the study with our few set of participants having
      completed the 4 month intervention. Baseline data have been also collected on all
      participants assessed for PCOS. Preliminary measurements on POCS characteristics, baseline
      dietary and exercise habits of women with PCOS will be soon available.

      This study involves an intervention comparing a diet containing pulses (i.e. beans, peas,
      chick peas, lentils) to a diet recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program
      (NCEP) for improving markers of metabolic syndrome and fertility in women with poly cystic
      ovarian syndrome who are also enrolled in an aerobic exercise program. To date, seven women
      in the pulse-diet group have completed the intervention, nine women in the group receiving
      the NCEP diet have completed the intervention, four women are currently enrolled on the pulse
      diet and two women are currently enrolled on the NCEP diet.
