  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been proposed to reduce the incidence of ventilatory
      dysfunction following mechanical ventilation weaning. However, the nasogastric tube reduces
      the airtightness of the facial mask used to perform non-invasive ventilation and induces air
      leaks. The presence of leaks at the patient-mask interface can increase the risk of
      patient-ventilator asynchrony, which in turn leads to increase patient discomfort. Neurally
      adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA)could contribute to decreasing asynchrony. Its principle is
      to record the diaphragmatic electrical activity and to control the ventilator. The
      investigators hypothesized driving the ventilator based on a neural signal (diaphragm
      electrical activity) would reduce patient-ventilator asynchronies in NIV
