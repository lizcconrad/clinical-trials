  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional, randomized controlled study seeks to test the effects of an innovative
      emotional exposure and processing treatment that targets stress resolution, by comparing it
      with cognitive-behavioral therapy and a Fibromyalgia education comparison condition. The
      investigators also will test proposed mediators of the intervention, including improved
      autonomic regulation, and explore which subgroups of patients benefit the most from each
      approach.
