      Part A- The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of LY2801653 to be given to
      participants with advanced cancer and to determine any side effects that may be associated
      with LY2801653 in this participant population. Efficacy measures will be used to assess the
      activity of LY2801653.

      Part B- The dose determined in Part A will be used along with efficacy measures to assess the
      activity of LY2801653 in participants with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), uveal melanoma with liver metastasis, and
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      Part C - the objective of Part C is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that
      may be safely given to participants with HNSCC when taken with standard doses of cetuximab
      Part D - the objective of Part D is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that
      may be safely given to participants with cholangiocarcinoma when taken with a standard dose
      of cisplatin.

      Part E - the objective of Part E is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that
      may be safely given to participants with cholangiocarcinoma when taken with gemcitabine plus
      cisplatin.

      Part F - the objective of Part F is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2801653 that
      may be safely given to participants with gastric cancer when taken with ramucirumab.

Part D consists of dose determination for LY2801653 in combination with cisplatin in participants with cholangiocarcinoma followed by an expansion cohort.
Part E consists of dose determination for LY2801653 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

             greater than 2, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months of
             study enrollment), transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or arterial or venous vascular
             disease

          -  Have a QTc interval greater than 470 msec
