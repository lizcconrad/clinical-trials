  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in people who
      have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with thrombocytopenia who have progressed or are
      resistant to decitabine or azacitidine. (These are the only 2 drugs approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration [FDA] which can improve platelet counts). The investigators (the
      study doctor, study staff, and sponsor) want to find out what effects, good or bad,
      eltrombopag (study drug) may have on people with low platelet counts due to MDS. The
      investigators will also be testing how well eltrombopag may work at different doses in these
      diseases.

      Study drug will be administered on an outpatient basis. The study is divided into two parts:
      in Stage 1 the best dose of eltrombopag will be found to take forward to Stage 2. In Stage 1
      of the study, small groups of participants will be enrolled in steps. The first group will be
      given a dose of 50 mg per day of study drug for 8 weeks. If these participants have few or
      manageable side effects, the next group of participants enrolled will receive a higher dose
      of study drug (100 mg per day for 8 weeks). This increase in doses with groups of
      participants will continue until the study doctor finds the highest dose of study drug that
      can be given without causing severe or unmanageable side effects up to a 300 mg daily dose.
      Stage 2 will include 15 participants at the best dose based on the Stage 1 part of the study.
      The participant's dose may be adjusted to a lower or higher dose based upon their platelet
      count, which will be determined by the study doctor. Eltrombopag will be supplied by a
      company called GlaxoSmithKline as white to off-white, round film coated tablets containing
      eltrombopag equivalent to 12.5mg, 25mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg of eltrombopag.

             a diagnosis of WHO Myelodysplastic/ Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MDS/MPN) or MDS
             refractory anemia with excess blast in transformation (RAEB-t) by French American

             are allowed.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) preceding the first dose of study medication.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding
