    <textblock>
      The object of the study is to investigate whether all included patients receive treatment
      that is effective against all bacteria that are defined as sensitive to meropenem with the
      current treatment regimen. Will the investigators findings motivate routine monitoring of
      plasma concentrations in children receiving meropenem? Up to 50 patients will be included in
      the study, and all participants are children.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged from 3 months to 18 years that receive treatment with meropenem.
             Inclusion is independent of how long the patient has been receiving treatment.
             Children receiving other treatment (except hemodialysis)/other medications can be
             included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children less than three months of age. Patients receiving hemodialysis. Lack of
             consent.
