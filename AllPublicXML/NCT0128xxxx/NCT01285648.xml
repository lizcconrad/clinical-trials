    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the oxygenation index (OI), dyspnea, and pain scale and
      evaluate the duration of thoracic drainage and pleural air leaks after lung resection in two
      groups of patients: chest physiotherapy (CP) patients and combined CP and Continuous Positive
      Airway Pressure (CPAP) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In pulmonary resection surgery complications that lead to significant functional losses of
      the lung parenchyma and alterations in the ventilatory function may trigger retention of
      secretions, atelectasis, pneumonia and respiratory failure, which prolong the duration of
      mechanical ventilation and hospitalisation and contribute to the increase in risk of
      mortality.

      In this study the oxygenation index (OI), Borg Scale, pain scale and the presence and
      duration of thoracic drainage was determined in the immediate postoperative (POi) period and
      in the first and second postoperative (PO1, PO2) days in 40 patients who underwent elective
      lung resection.

      Similar to Chest Physiotherapy, the preventive application of CPAP in the postoperative
      period after lung resection in our study also appeared to be a safe technique, which allowed
      improved oxygenation without increasing air leaks through the thoracic drains.

    <description>From the immediate postoperative day until hospital discharge, the presence of chest tubes and the occurrence of air leaks in them as evidenced by the bubbling of the water seal were recorded. The maintenance and removal of drains or their use with wall suction were determined by applying the medical protocol of the institution through the analysis of X-rays and the amount of drained fluid.</description>

    <measure>Pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Reported pain score after lung resection, along the study, during one year</time_frame>
    <description>Before beginning the chest physiotherapy protocols, the patient was asked to rate their pain from zero to ten according to its intensity (the larger the score, the greater the intensity of pain).</description>
