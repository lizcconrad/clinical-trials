  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the study drug metformin is helpful in
      reducing weight after pregnancy in women with gestational diabetes. This pilot study will
      provide information on how well women are able to take metformin postpartum, whether
      metformin increases weight loss, and whether there are any increased risks of side effects to
      you as a new mother.

      At 24-48 hours after delivery, women who are eligible for participation will be approached
      and consented to the study. Maternal weight will be measured and 20ml of maternal blood will
      be obtained to assess glucose control and lipid profile. Women will be counseled regarding
      diet, exercise and glucose control. Data including maternal demographics, clinical
      characteristics and neonatal outcomes will be collected. At 3 weeks postpartum, a research
      nurse will contact the subject via telephone call to inquire about adverse or side effects,
      ability to take the prescribed medication (metformin or placebo), and to answer questions
      about the study. At 6 weeks postpartum, maternal weight will be measured , blood will be
      obtained and side effects will be evaluated again. Finally, a satisfaction survey will be
      completed.
