      The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of two doses of
      safinamide (50 and 100 mg/day, p.o), compared to placebo, as add-on therapy in patients with
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations, who are currently receiving a stable
      dose of levodopa.
