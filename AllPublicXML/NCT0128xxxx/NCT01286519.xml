  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the level of medicines found in body fluids such as
      blood, urine, spinal fluid of children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy data of therapeutic agents in
      children and infants. Samples used for measurement will be from scavenged samples. i.e. any
      extra blood/body fluid samples from a test done as part of the standard of care.
