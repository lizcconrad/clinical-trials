  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether xenon - as compared to sevoflurane - can be
      applied safely in patients for general anesthesia before and after CABG implantation.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be conducted by two investigator types: The study enrollment and the
      post-anesthesia follow-up will be performed by Investigator I who is blinded to the study
      treatment. Investigator II will only perform general anaesthesia for CABG surgery and will
      therefore necessarily be unblinded to the treatment conditions.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following study groups. Group 1 (Xenon) will
      receive xenon for maintenance of balanced anesthesia for CABG surgery before and after
      extracorporal circulation. Group 2 (Sevoflurane) will receive sevoflurane for maintenance of
      balanced anesthesia for CABG surgery before and after extracorporal circulation. During
      extracorporal circulation, general anesthesia will be maintained intravenously in both
      groups.

    <time_frame>an average of 4 to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of xenon application compared to sevoflurane application will be assessed by:
The depth of anaesthesia level
The peri-anaesthetic respiratory profile
The peri-anaesthetic haemodynamic profile
The following safety parameters will be assessed:
Doses and concentration of study treatments
Trans-esophageal echocardiography
Measures of renal function
Intra-operative blood loss and amount of transfused blood/products
Need for hemodynamic and inotropic support
The patient's regional cerebral tissue oxygenation rSO2
The incidence of AE and SAE</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary efficacy and safety criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>The following secondary efficacy parameters will be assessed:
the patients organ function status
The severity of postoperative critical illness
The incidence of Post-operative Delirium (POD)
The duration of postoperative intensive care unit and in-hospital stay
Secondary safety parameters:
hemodynamic and respiratory profile, including vital signs
incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE)
laboratory parameters -post-operative pain
further AE and SAE</description>
