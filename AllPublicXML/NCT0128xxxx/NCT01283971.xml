  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, parallel-group study will assess the efficacy and safety of
      RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) versus adalimumab, both in combination with methotrexate
      (MTX) in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Patients, already
      treated with MTX at stable doses, will be randomized to receive either RoActemra/Actemra 8
      mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks or adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 2 weeks.
      All patients will receive methotrexate (10-25 mg weekly) and folate (at least 5 mg weekly).
      The anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis, consisting of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. There are 4 possible responses for each question: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do. The score for each of the domains is the highest (worst) score in each domain. A patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains to calculate a valid HAQ-DI score which is the sum of domain scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Activity Score 28 Joints (DAS28) Remission at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 2 to 10. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt;2.6.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>Participants from the Intent-to-treat population, all randomized participants who received study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment, with data available at Baseline and Week 24. Last observation carried forward was used to impute missing tender and swollen joint counts. All other ACR components were used as observed.</population>

The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 mm, and is described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equals 100 mm, as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity). A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis, consisting of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. There are 4 possible responses for each question: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do. The score for each of the domains is the highest (worst) score in each domain. A patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains to calculate a valid HAQ-DI score which is the sum of domain scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>RAPID3 is a patient self reported assessment that combines the HAQ-DI [20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities. Each domain has at least 2 component questions answered on a 4-point scale where 0=without any difficulty to 3=unable to do} converted to a score of 0-10, the Patients Assessment of Pain [Over the previous 24 hours: using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) left end of the line 0=no pain to right end of the line 100=unbearable pain] converted to a score of 0-10 and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity [over the previous 24 hours using a VAS where left end of the line 0=no disease activity to right end of the line 100=maximum disease activity] converted to a score of 0-10. The 3 individual scales are summed for a raw score of 0-30 which is divided by 3 to achieve a total possible adjusted score of 0-10. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
