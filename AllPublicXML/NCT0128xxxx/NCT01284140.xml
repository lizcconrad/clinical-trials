  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine whether the sleep and circadian rhythms of
      critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation can be improved through practical
      strategies that can be employed at the bedside.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 million patients develop respiratory failure annually in the United States; yet, the
      sleep of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation has received little attention. This
      project is designed to characterize sleep and circadian rhythmicity in critically ill
      patients and to explore the efficacy of a non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep
      and normalize circadian phase. The study will examine the effect of a protocol employing
      noise reduction and enforcement of a robust light-dark cycle on sleep quality and circadian
      rhythmicity. A secondary analysis will examine the relationship between delirium and sleep
      disruption and loss of circadian rhythmicity. Circadian rhythmicity will be characterized
      through the measurement of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels at frequent intervals, while
      sleep will be assessed using continuous polysomnography.

    <measure>Circadian Timing</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The magnitude of the phase change in 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion between Day 1 and Day 3 will be compared between the intervention and usual care groups. This is done by comparing, for each group, the timing of the best-fit maximum on Day 1 with the timing of the best-fit maximum on Day 3. The result is expressed in hours. A positive value represents a phase advance from Day 1 to Day 3 (e.g. an earlier occurrence of maximum excretion on Day 3 when compared with Day 1), while a negative value represents a phase delay from Day 1 to Day 3 (e.g. a later occurrence of maximum excretion on Day 3 when compared with Day 1).</description>

    <description>This multifaceted intervention attempts to enhance sleep and circadian rhythmicity through improved scheduling of nursing procedures, enforcement of a day/night routine, increased light exposure during the day, and decreased light and sound exposure during the night. The intervention began the morning after enrollment and enforced a specific period of enhanced light exposure from 9:00 a.m. to noon. The initial target of 5,000 lux administered by light box (Sunsation, SunBox Co.) was reduced to 400-700 lux after the first 10 subjects were enrolled in the study.</description>

        <title>Circadian Timing</title>
        <description>The magnitude of the phase change in 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion between Day 1 and Day 3 will be compared between the intervention and usual care groups. This is done by comparing, for each group, the timing of the best-fit maximum on Day 1 with the timing of the best-fit maximum on Day 3. The result is expressed in hours. A positive value represents a phase advance from Day 1 to Day 3 (e.g. an earlier occurrence of maximum excretion on Day 3 when compared with Day 1), while a negative value represents a phase delay from Day 1 to Day 3 (e.g. a later occurrence of maximum excretion on Day 3 when compared with Day 1).</description>

Sleep and circadian rhythm promotion: This multifaceted intervention attempts to enhance sleep and circadian rhythmicity through improved scheduling of nursing procedures, enforcement of a day/night routine, increased light exposure during the day, and decreased light and sound exposure during the night. The intervention began the morning after enrollment and enforced a specific period of enhanced light exposure from 9:00 a.m. to noon. The initial target of 5,000 lux administered by light box (Sunsation, SunBox Co.) was reduced to 400-700 lux after the first 10 subjects were enrolled in the study.</description>

            <groups_desc>Nonlinear regression using the least-squares approach was used to fit a single 24-hour cosine curve to all normalized data in each group on each day of 24-hour urine collection. This resulted in 4 separate best-fit curves. The model parameter of amplitude was derived from the best-fit curves.</groups_desc>

            <description>Behavioral: 48 hours of sleep and circadian rhythm promotion including timed light exposure.
Sleep and circadian rhythm promotion: This multifaceted intervention attempts to enhance sleep and circadian rhythmicity through improved scheduling of nursing procedures, enforcement of a day/night routine, increased light exposure during the day, and decreased light and sound exposure during the night. The intervention began the morning after enrollment and enforced a specific period of enhanced light exposure from 9:00 a.m. to noon. The initial target of 5,000 lux administered by light box (Sunsation, SunBox Co.) was reduced to 400-700 lux after the first 10 subjects were enrolled in the study.</description>
