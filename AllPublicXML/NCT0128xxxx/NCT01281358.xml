  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants born very premature have biological risk factors for later developmental coordination
      disorder. Parental stereotyping of infants as fragile and other environmental factors, such
      as spending long periods laying on their backs, also contribute to motor delay. This study
      aims to develop and evaluate a computer-based intervention (Helping Our Premature infants ON
      to better motor skills - HOP-ON) for parents of preterm infants. HOP-ON will model evidence
      based strategies to develop infants' fine and gross motor skills, and aims to reduce parental
      stereotyping. It is hypothesised that infants whose parents receive the HOPON CD-ROM/DVD and
      Booklet will have better motor skills at 12 months adjusted age compared to those whose
      parents receive a control CD-ROM/DVD and booklet. Parents of infants born at less than 32
      weeks gestation (target n = 138) will be recruited prior to discharge from the neonatal unit
      and randomised to either HOP-ON or control. The primary outcome is motor score (Bayleys III)
      at 12 months adjusted age. Other outcomes are parental confidence and perceptions of infant
      capability at 3 months and quality of movement, infant growth, fine and gross motor movement
      and parenting stress at 12 months. Data will be analysed blind to study condition and on an
      intention to treat basis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Preterm infants born less than 32 weeks of gestation, and progressing well enough to
             have either been recently discharged from hospital, or being discharged from hospital
             within the next two weeks.

          -  Parent/s aged between 16-60 years of age, who have a preterm infant - born less than
             32 weeks of gestation.

        Both parent and infant inclusion criteria must be met for inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parent/s of infants who are still receiving hospital care at 3 months adjusted age,
             and their premature infants who are still receiving hospital care at 3 months adjusted
             age.

          -  Parent/s of multiple births, where the number of infants is greater than two (three of
             more infants).

          -  To avoid excessive travel costs, infants born outside the defined catchment area will
             be excluded from the study. There are no other exclusion criteria.
