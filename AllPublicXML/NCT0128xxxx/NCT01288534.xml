    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of using radiation
      therapy with 5 fractions of radiation to treat prostate cancer with guidance of radiation
      using the Calypso 4D Treatment System (Calypso).A number of recent studies have used 5
      radiation fraction to treat prostate cancer over 2-3 weeks as compared to the typical
      treatment which would involve 40-42 smaller radiation fractions over 8-9 weeks. This type of
      radiation using a smaller number of treatments has been called hypofractionated radiation
      therapy.

      The Calypso is a new technique which uses beacons implanted into the prostate which using
      radio signals are able to localize and track the position of the prostate continuously during
      radiation therapy. The Calypso system has been approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for guidance of radiation therapy during the treatment of prostate
      cancer and is being utilized all across the United States. However, it has not been tested
      for hypofractionated radiation therapy.

This will be assessed by the percentage of patients with no interventions for any fraction, the percentage of patients with 1-2 fractions interrupted and the percentage of patients with more than two fractions interrupted and the percentage of patients that had an interruption of the beam at least once for all 5 fractions.</description>
