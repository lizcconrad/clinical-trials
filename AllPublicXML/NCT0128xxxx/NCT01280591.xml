  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of
      two dose combinations of naproxen sodium and diphenhydramine (DPH) to demonstrate that
      naproxen sodium/DPH combination provides added clinical benefit to sleep improvement than
      either single ingredient alone in subjects with post-surgical dental pain and phase advanced
      sleep.

    <measure>Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO) Measured by Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>WASO was defined as Total wake time (in minutes) after sleep onset during the 10 hours in-bed period as measured by actigraphy.

             hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic,

             chronic sinusitis or nasal structural abnormalities causing greater than 50 percent
             obstruction (polyposis nasi, marked septal deviation) that can interfere with the
             conduct of the study in the judgment of the investigator

          -  Current or past history of bleeding disorder(s)

          -  Acute illness or local infection prior to surgery that can interfere with the conduct
             of the study in the judgment of the investigator

          -  Chronic use of antihistamines defined as using 5 or more times a week for 2 or more
             consecutive weeks during the past 3 months

          -  Positive alcohol breathalyzer test and positive urine drug test prior to surgery

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Chronic or severe sleep problems that do not respond to / Over the Counter (OTC)

        <description>Total time time was measured as total time spent sleeping (not to exceed 600 minutes) during the in-bed period as measured by actigraphy. Actigraphy is a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual’s movement during sleep. Actigraphy was used to obtain data in discriminating between sleep and wake states in the subjects.</description>
