          4. Findings within the range of clinical acceptability in medical history and physical
             examination, and laboratory results within the laboratory reference ranges for the
             relevant laboratory tests (unless the investigator considers the deviation to be
             irrelevant for the purpose of the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A subject with history of allergies including drug allergies (aspirin, antibiotics,

             drug

          4. A subject whose hemoglobin(Hb) level &lt; 12 g/dL

          5. A subject with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level ≤ 70 mg/dL or ≥ 126 mg/dL

          6. A subject with HbA1c level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L

          7. A subject whose systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 90 mmHg or ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood
             pressure (DBP) ≤ 40 mmHg or ≥ 90 mmHg or pulse rate (PR) ≥ 100 /min after at least 5
             min sitting

          8. A subject with history of drug abuse or positive urine drug screening test

          9. A subject who has taken any prescribed medication or herbal compounds within 14 days
             prior to the study drug administration. In addition, a subject who has taken any
             over-the-counter drug or vitamin supplements within 7 days prior to the study drug
             administration (However, investigators can judge the subject, who has taken the
             medications during those periods above, eligible for the trial if all other conditions
             are satisfied.)

         10. A subject who has participated in any other clinical trial either for investigational
             or marketed drugs within 8 weeks before the study drug administration

         11. A subject who has donated or had loss of ≥ 400 mL of blood within 8 weeks prior to
             start of administration of study drug

         12. A subject who consumes more than 21 units of alcohol per week or unable to stop
             drinking throughout the study period.

         13. A smoker (except for whom quitted smoking prior to the drug administration for at
             least 3 months)

         14. A subject who heavily takes caffeine or caffeine-containing products, grapefruit,
             grapefruit juice, grapefruit-containing products

         15. A subject with unusual dietary habit

         16. A subject who was previously assigned to treatment during this study
