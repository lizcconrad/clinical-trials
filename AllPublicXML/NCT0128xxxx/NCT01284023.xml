  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a complication of lower leg trauma that occurs when the
      pressure inside the leg due to swelling exceeds the body's ability to provide blood to the
      muscle of the leg. This condition cuts off blood flow to the leg. Left untreated, the
      condition can result in devastating consequences including complete loss of function of the
      lower extremity or amputation. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based tissue perfusion
      monitors are a non-invasive means of continuously monitoring the amount of oxygen in the
      tissues of an injured extremity. The device utilizes harmless red light to detect the
      proportion of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen up to 3 cm below the skin surface. The purpose
      of this study will be to launch the first stages of validation of this device as a diagnostic
      tool for compartment syndrome, by observing this device in uninjured subjects.

    <measure>Skin pigmentation</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to monitoring</time_frame>
    <description>due to absorption of hemoglobin and melanin at near infrared wavelengths, skin pigmentation may affect near infrared spectroscopy values. Skin pigmentation values will be recorded on each study participant using the DSM-II (CyberDerm, Broomall, PA) and the IMS SmartProbe (IMS, Portland, ME).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>fat depth</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to monitoring</time_frame>
    <description>because the near infrared spectroscopy device measures tissue oxygenation 2-3 cm below the skin, the device may obtain an altered reading or be unable to obtain a reading on subjects with excessive subcutaneous fat. Data on fat depth will be collected on control subjects using the BX2000 (IntelaMetrix, Livermore, CA)</description>
