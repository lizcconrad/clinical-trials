  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis is used to control the fluid balance and metabolic state of patients with kidney
      disease. Control of the metabolic state, via electrolytes, can be monitored using labs that
      are routinely drawn from patients undergoing continuous hemodialysis. Control of fluid
      removal is much more difficult. This study aims to determine whether changes in the blood
      pressure associated with breathing correlate with or predict intolerance to fluid
      responsiveness with continuous dialysis.

      We hypothesize that a measurement of changes in blood pressure with breathing called arterial
      pulse pressure variation may be able to predict the ability to remove fluid during continuous
      renal replacement therapy.
