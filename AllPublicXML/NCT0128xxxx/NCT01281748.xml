  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) recommend treatment with systemic corticosteroids during acute exacerbations. The
      results of a Cochrane systematic review show that treatment with systemic corticosteroids
      improves lung function over the first 72 hours of an exacerbation of COPD but the effect on
      other outcomes, particularly length of hospital stay, is unclear, so further research should
      be directed at determining the risk-benefit ratio, particularly those at high risk of
      developing adverse drug reactions. In critically ill patients, corticosteroid treatment is a
      risk factor of infections, hyperglucemia and critical-illness neuromuscular abnormalities,
      and these conditions are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. The effect of
      treatment with systemic corticosteroids in COPD patients with acute exacerbation requiring
      mechanical ventilation has not been evaluated investigated so it is unknown if the
      corticosteroids could reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of
      intensive care unit (ICU) stay or if, on the contrary, the development of adverse events
      could lead to a longer time on mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on the duration of mechanical
      ventilation, the length of ICU stay, the need for tracheal intubation in patients treated
      with non-invasive mechanical ventilation. To evaluate the frequency of adverse events:
      secondary infections, pneumonia, arterial hypertension, hyperglucemia, gastrointestinal
      bleeding, and critical-illness neuromuscular abnormalities. DESING: Multicenter, prospective,
      randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.The treatment group will receive
      intravenous methylprednisolone for 10 days and the control group will receive isotonic saline
      solution.
