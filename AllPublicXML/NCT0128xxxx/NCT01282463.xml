  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter trial will enroll participants with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma
      of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis who have had disease progression on
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Participants will be enrolled into 1 of 3
      treatment arms: docetaxel; docetaxel and ramucirumab; or docetaxel and IMC-18F1.
