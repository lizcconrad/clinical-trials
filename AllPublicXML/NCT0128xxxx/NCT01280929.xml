  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate safety and to compare the efficacy of intravitreous
      injection of ranibizumab alone (0.5 mg), versus combination of intravitreous injection of
      ranibizumab (0.5 mg) plus panretinal photocoagulation, versus panretinal photocoagulation
      alone in the regression of retinal neovascularization in eyes with high-risk proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Panretinal photocoagulation can cause regression of retinal neovascularization and reduce the
      risk of severe vision loss in people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, this
      destructive treatment may be associated with side effects (such as: pain, transient blurring,
      loss of peripheral and/or night vision, increased risk of macular edema and central vision
      loss) and it is not always efficient in the regression of the neovascularization.

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to play a role in retinal
      neovascularization and retinal vascular leakage related with proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments
      have been hypothesized as an alternative adjunctive treatment for the management of retinal
      neovascularization and macular edema related with diabetic retinopathy.

      There are a few reports of retinal traction detachment in patients with proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy and fibrovascular proliferation (although it is not frequent). However,
      from our clinical experience, we think that the risk of detachment only exists when there is
      in place a fibrovascular proliferation with retinal traction previous to the injection.

      We injected ranibizumab prior to surgery in patients with severe proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy, that were submitted later to a posterior vitrectomy, to reduce
      neovascularization and minimize the risk of an intraoperatory hemorrhage caused by the
      manipulation of the fibrovascular membranes. In total, we already injected and submitted to
      surgery 15 eyes with the above mentioned condition, with excellent results. The results of
      the first 10 eyes were presented in the congress of the Portuguese Society of Ophthalmology
      (2008).
