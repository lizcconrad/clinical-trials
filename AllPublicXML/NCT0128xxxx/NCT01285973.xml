    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective study is to assess the utility of treatment of leg ulcers using a
      skin substitute, Integra®, assessing the quality of wound skin healing and transcutaneous
      oxygen pressure in the distal region of the wound.

      This is a multi-centre study on 60 patients who have a lower limb ulcer.

        The study population will be patients with &quot;difficult&quot; lower limb ulcers, whose wounds have
        not responded to directed healing for more than 6 months or who have a wound &gt; 10 cm².

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patient with a lower limb ulcer, regardless of origin (arterial, venous or mixed,
             diabetic foot ulcer) present for more than 6 months or large in size (&gt; 10 cm²)

          -  patients in whom the surgeon has recommended that an Integra® matrix be implanted
             (even if the patient is not taking part in the study) before the dermo-epidermal graft
             to obtain a richly vascularised neodermis.

          -  not eligible for skin flap surgery,

          -  the patient or patient's representative has agreed to sign the information letter
             before any investigation required by the research.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  circumferential wound,

          -  wound infection

          -  immunosuppressed patient,

          -  known allergy to bovine collagen, bovine glycosaminoglycans or silicone,

          -  patients under legal guardianship,

          -  pregnant women

          -  patients whose health would compromise follow-up for at least 18 months,

          -  patients whose mental health would compromise completion of the self-evaluation
             questionnaires.

          -  wound located in an area not visible by the patient (as no self-assessment would be
             possible).
