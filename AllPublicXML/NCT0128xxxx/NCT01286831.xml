    <textblock>
      This will be a single-centre, open-label, single-dose study to characterise the metabolic
      disposition of oral [14C]GW642444. Six healthy male subjects will be enrolled to ensure at
      least four fully evaluable subjects. Each subject will receive a single 200μg oral dose of
      GW642444 containing 2 μCi (0.074MBq) of [14C]GW642444. Whilst subjects are inhouse, blood,
      urine and faecal samples will be collected for a minimum of 168 hours after dosing (7 days)
      or for up to 240 hours (10 days) depending on amounts of radioactivity still being excreted
      after Day 5. Faecal sample collection may continue at home for up to 14 days. Bile samples
      will be collected using Entero-Test string sampling of duodenal bile. Plasma will be prepared
      from blood at various sample times after dosing to measure parent drug and total
      radiolabelled drug-related material. Urine and faeces aliquots will be taken to measure total
      radiolabelled drug-related material. Samples of urine, faeces, plasma and bile will be
      transferred into a separate study to characterise and, where feasible, quantify metabolites
      in these matrices. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by blood pressure, heart rate,
      12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory safety tests, and collection of adverse
      events (AEs).
