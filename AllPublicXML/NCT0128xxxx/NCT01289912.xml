  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system disease, usually presenting with seizures,
      mental retardation and autism, and exhibiting a high variability in clinical findings both
      among and within families. Investigators are doing research in order to identify possible
      neurocognitive benefits from treatment with RAD001 or placebo for a six month period. There
      may also be potential for improvements in seizure frequency, sleep and autistic behaviors. We
      hope this trial will lead to a better understanding of TSC and to new forms of treatment, to
      benefit children and adults with TSC in the future.

      Individuals diagnosed with TSC will be asked to participate in this study if they are between
      the ages of 6 and 21 years of age and have an IQ of greater than or equal to 60. Both males
      and females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study
      participation, individuals must have been on the same seizure medication(s), if applicable,
      for at least 6 months. Individuals must also be able to participate in neuropsychological
      testing and meet certain medical criteria. They will need to sign an informed consent. If
      enrolled in the study, participants will have a number of screening tests to help determine
      if they are eligible for participation in the clinical trial. If eligible for the treatment
      phase of the trial, they will be asked to take either the study drug or a placebo (pill with
      no medicine), which is determined by chance.

      The study involves about 9 visits, 3 of which can be done locally, over a six month period,
      as well as follow-up calls with our research nurse. Study visits will vary in length.
      Screening, three month and six month visits may last up to 8 hours, while all other visits
      will be less than 2 hours. The study visits include blood draws, laboratory tests and
      neuropsychological assessments. There is no fee to participate in this study. The study drug
      will be provided at no charge during the study.

      After all study data has been analyzed, families will be informed of the overall results.
      Treatment on this study may or may not improve a child's learning skills (neurocognition).
      Future patients may benefit from what is learned.

      This is a signal-seeking Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trial of RAD001 in children
      and young adults with TSC with neurocognition as the primary outcome and autism spectrum
      disorder as a secondary outcome.

      Specific Aims /Objectives Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of RAD001 on neurocognition in patients with TSC compared to
           placebo as measured by well-validated, standardized, direct and indirect neurocognitive
           tools.

        -  To evaluate the safety of RAD001 compared with placebo in patients with TSC focusing on
           NCI CTCAE Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, and Grade 3 and 4
           laboratory toxicities.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Comparison of absolute change from baseline in frequency of epileptiform events as
           recorded on seizure diaries between patients taking RAD001 vs. placebo

        -  Comparison of sleep disturbances between patients taking RAD001 vs. placebo, measured by
           the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) and sleep logs

        -  Comparison of autism spectrum disorders features between patients taking RAD001 vs.
           placebo, measured by ADOS and SRS

        -  Comparison of academic skills between patients taking RAD001 vs. placebo, measured by
           WRAT4

        -  Comparison of behavioral problems between patients taking RAD001 vs placebo, measured by
           behavioral rating scales (BRIEF, BASC, SDQ, CHQ and SRS)

For all subscales, scores are reported as the mean difference between the study subjects and a normative population matched for age, gender and IQ (e.g., subject subscale score - mean of matched normative group = reported score). Higher scores represent a better outcome.

Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) (Measure of executive functions) T-scores are reported, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The range is 30-100 with higher scores indicating a worse outcome.
Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC) (Measure of emotional and behavioral problems) T-scores are reported (mean of 50, SD of 10). The range is 30-100 with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. Conversely, on the Adaptive Skills subscale of the BASC, lower scores indicate a poorer outcome.
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Includes questions related to emotional symptoms, conduct problems, inattention/hyperactivity, peer relationship problems and prosocial behavior. Responses to these items are summed to comprise a Total Difficulties Score, which ranges from 0-40, with lower scores indicating a better outcome</description>
