  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to test the safety of escalating doses of elesclomol sodium given to
      patients with advanced myeloid leukemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This aim of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of elesclomol sodium at
      escalating doses (ultimately identifying the maximum tolerated dose) when administered to
      patients with advanced myeloid leukemia.
