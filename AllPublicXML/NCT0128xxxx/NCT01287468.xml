    <textblock>
      Over the past five years, a spectrum of studies has shown that the stromal cell populations
      surrounding or embedding cancer cells in a variety of different tumor types are intrinsically
      involved in the mechanisms affecting tumor growth and metastasis. Among these cells,
      fibroblasts and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been shown to play key roles in
      the regulation of tumor cell behaviors, via differential gene expression, regulation and
      secretion of specific chemokines (e.g., RANTES, CXCL12 and CXCL14), cytokines (e.g., TNF-α,
      IL-1β, NF-κB) and control by inflammatory and immunomodulatory cells, molecules or potent
      growth factors. Of particular interest is that the various stromal immune cells (dendritic
      cells and T cells) and inflammatory MDSCs found in primary and metastatic tumors behave very
      differently from those present in normal or non-cancerous counterpart tissues. In light of
      these &quot;new understandings&quot; in cancer biology, the investigators believe that systematic and
      innovative approaches to further research are very much needed in Taiwan and at our Academy.
      Here the investigators propose to investigate the tumor suppressive effect of
      anti-inflammatory phytomedicines on regulation of stromal immune cells and fibroblasts in
      breast cancers. The investigators will employ the TS/A and 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma system
      to conduct an in vivo study of several specific candidate phytomedicines (cytopiloyne,
      Wedelia chinensis, shikonin, emodin and others that the investigators have already identified
      as conferring anti-inflammation related activities) for inhibition of TS/A and 4T1 tumor
      growth and specific effects on inflammation-associated, cellular and molecular functions of
      stromal immune cells, fibroblasts and MDSCs. When potent and specific anti-tumor effects are
      detected, the investigators will extend our study to a three-dimensional collagen/Matrigel
      culture system for ex-vivo study focusing on the stromal cell-mediated or -associated
      anti-tumor effects of TS/A or 4T1 cells, using the &quot;organoid&quot; tissue culture systems the
      investigators have previously developed in our laboratory (JNCI, 1979; Cancer Res., 1981).
      The investigators will establish reconstituted TS/A or 4T1 tumor cells with the stromal
      immune cells in a co-cultivation system. When the investigators have achieved demonstrable
      success, the investigators will extend the mouse system to human breast cancers (including
      primary and metastatic tumors) by a close collaboration (which the investigators have already
      established) with Drs.

      at the National Defense University Hospital. The investigators will then study the molecular
      signaling effect of specific phytocompounds already identified to confer in vivo (mouse),
      anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities, in primary/organoid cultures of human breast
      tumor cells under ex vivo conditions. Finally, the investigators intend to identify the key
      molecular regulators, immune-modulatory effectors of test stromal immune cells that are
      affected by the candidate phytomedicines, using molecular and cell biology assays to
      investigate the interplay between immune cells and tumor cells in the stromal tissues.

      Our study is expected to reveal one or more highly specific, anti-inflammatory phytocompounds
      that mechanistically confer specific effects on stromal fibroblast or immune cell types,
      resulting in potent anti-tumor effects on test mammary carcinoma systems. Five Specific Aims
      are thus designed to investigate the immuno-modulating effects of specific medicinal
      constituents from TCM materials. The experimental findings obtained from this study would
      provide insights in the molecular, cellular and signaling mechanisms/effects of several
      medicinal phytocompounds that may have potential applications in chemoprevention or herbal
      medicine adjuvant treatment of human breast cancers.
