      The purpose of this study is to compare group-administered Cognitive Processing
      Therapy-Cognitive-only version (CPT-C), an evidence based treatment for posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD), to Present Centered Therapy (PCT) in order to determine whether the results
      of CPT exceed those of receiving a therapy that focuses on current problems rather than past
      trauma in a group format.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estimates indicate that between 100,000 and 300,000 Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and
      Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans are at significant risk for chronic post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), which can become a chronic disorder that impacts all areas of a
      person's life. PTSD treatment programs are being developed throughout the Department of
      Defense (DoD) and the Veterans Affairs (VA), but because of the large number of Service
      Members returning from deployment with PTSD, it is often necessary to provide psychotherapy
      in groups. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an evidence-based treatment for PTSD, was
      originally developed as a group-based intervention. However, group-based CPT treatment has
      never been systematically compared to other forms of group treatment. The public policy
      implications of the results of this trial are significant. If group treatment is found to be
      effective, then group treatment would be a more efficient and cost-effective therapy modality
      in most cases. The purpose of this study is to compare group-administered CPT-Cognitive-only
      version (CPT-C) to Present Centered Therapy (PCT) in order to determine whether the results
      of CPT exceed those of receiving a therapy that focuses on current problems rather than past
      trauma in a group format. One hundred (100) adult male and female active-duty OIF/OEF
      military personnel over 18 years of age will be enrolled into this study. Participants will
      be randomized to receive either group PCT or group CPT-C.

    <description>The BDI-II is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. It consists of 21 items that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders. Each item is composed of four statements that reflect symptom severity. The statements are scaled from 0 (no disturbance) to 3 (maximal disturbance). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is an evidence-based form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) used to treat PTSD. CPT is a 12-session manualized program that focuses on challenging beliefs and assumptions related to the trauma, oneself, and the world. Sessions will be conducted twice weekly for six weeks; each session is 90 minutes.</description>

    <description>Present Centered Therapy (PCT) is a supportive group intervention typically used within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare systems to address problems of veterans with PTSD (Rosen, et al., 2004). PCT focuses on problem-solving current difficulties that may be related to past traumatic events, but does not address specific memories or cognitions about the trauma. Sessions will be conducted twice weekly for 6 weeks; sessions are 90 minutes.</description>
