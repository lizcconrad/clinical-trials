          2. Proven undifferentiated spondyloarthritis according to the European Spondylarthropathy
             Study Group (ESSG) criteria who do not have ankylosing spondylitis, reactive
             arthritis, psoriasis and/or inflammatory bowel disease

          3. Acute phase of disease with high disease activity the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
             Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score ≥ 4 or a pain score ≥ 4 on a Numeric Rating
             Scale (NRS) at two occasions in 2 weeks

          4. Understand, sign and date the written informed consent at the screening visit.

          9. History of any viral hepatitis within 1 year prior screening or history of any
             drug-induced liver injury at any time prior to screening

         10. Laboratory exclusions are: hemoglobin level &lt; 8,5 mg/dl white blood cell count &lt; 3.5 x
             10^9/l platelet count &lt; 125 x 10^9 /l creatinine level &gt; 175 mcmol/l, liver enzymes &gt;
             1.5 times the upper limit of normal or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2 times the upper limit

         11. Participation in trials of other investigational medications within 30 days of
             entering the study

         12. Clinical examination showing significant abnormalities of clinical relevance

         13. Concomitant medication with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or
             corticosteroids

         14. History or current evidence of abuse of &quot;hard&quot; drugs (eg., cocaine/heroine) or
