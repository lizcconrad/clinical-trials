      The objective of this pilot-study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of PROMIS
      computerized-adaptive testing in women with urinary incontinence.

      Patient-reported outcomes (PRO's) are important to assess treatment progress in the field of
      pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), including urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and
      fecal incontinence. The NIH has invested in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement System
      (PROMIS) to revolutionize PRO measures. To date, PROMIS instruments and feasibility and
      acceptability of PROMIS and Computerized-Adaptive Testing (CAT) technology has not been well
      explored in women with PFDs and warrant further investigation. In recruiting sixty women, the
      investigators will conduct pilot-testing on the CAT mode of the PROMIS questionnaires, and
      compare participant's attitudes about the paper short-forms versus the CAT modes of
      administration.

      The investigators will recruit 60 women with UI to participate in this study. Participants
      will be asked to complete both paper and CAT versions of PROMIS questionnaires covering the
      physical, social and mental health domains (Appendix 1). The time it takes to complete each
      version will be recorded. After completing the questionnaires, all participants will be
      interviewed, which will include a brief &quot;Usability and Satisfaction Questionnaire&quot;(Appendix
      2), questions about technical problems, preferences, and the acceptability of each mode.

        60 women seeking care for PFDs will be eligible. Women will be excluded if they are unable
        to read English or have cognitive limitations precluding the completion of PROMIS
        questionnaires.
