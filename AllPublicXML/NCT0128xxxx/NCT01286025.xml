  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine how the type of learning case affects the thinking of
      medical students in tutorial
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tutorials at Harvard Medical School use problem-based learning with written cases. Students
      work in groups under the supervision of a tutor who guides their exploration of the material.
      As students progress through the curriculum there is an opportunity to advance the complexity
      of the material they are presented with. Video-based patient case studies have been shown to
      improve critical thinking ratios in paediatric medical student problem-based learning
      exercises, and time spent on data exploration, theory building and theory evaluation in
      postgraduate residency programs. We hypothesize that video provides a stimulus that improves
      cognitive processing and critical thinking among medical students, as compared to working
      from the text-based transcript of the same case.

    <time_frame>Four 90-minute tutorial sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Depth of thinking will be evaluated using the method of Kamin et al. Transcription of each tutorial will be divided into utterances. Each utterance will be coded for depth of thinking (deep vs. superficial). The ratio of deep to superficial thinking by case modality will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Distribution of learning activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Four 90-min tutorial sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Transcription of each tutorial will be divided into utterances. Each utterance will be coded by learning domain (identification, description, exploration, integration, and application. The distribution of domains by case modality will be reported.</description>
