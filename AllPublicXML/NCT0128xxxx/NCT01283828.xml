      This primary goals of this study are to: estimate the prevalence of Clostridium sordellii and
      Clostridium perfringens carriage in the rectum and/or vagina among women of reproductive age;
      estimate duration of carriage of the two clostridium species; and estimate the incidence of
      carriage at 2 weeks after a negative test.

      Since 2000, clostridial pelvic infections have claimed the lives of at least 17 young,
      previously healthy women. The majority of infections detected by molecular methods were among
      women testing positive for Clostridium sordellii only; in 5 cases, deaths were due to
      Clostridium perfringens only; and in 3 cases, the women were positive for both. These deaths
      occurred among both non-pregnant and recently pregnant women. Clostridium has been isolated
      from the vagina in 4-18% of normal, health non-pregnant women, with Clostridium perfringens
      the most common isolate. Most studies do not differentiate the small percentage of other
      clostridia present in the vaginal microenvironment. The vaginal carriage rate for Clostridium
      sordellii remains unknown, but is probably very low, less than 1%.

      The correlates of clostridial carriage are unknown, and data on the etiology and lethality of
      clostridial infection among women of reproductive age are insufficient to guide possible
      courses of safe and effective prevention. In women infected with strains of Clostridium
      perfringens and Clostridium sordellii that produce the lethal toxin, it is not clear whether
      there is an effective treatment.

        Approximately 5,000 women aged 18 to 45 years in the United States will be enrolled in the
        study. Women will be recruited from approximately 25 clinics and solo or group practices
        providing maternity care (pre- and post-natal), abortion, STI prevention &amp; treatment,
        family planning, and student health services. All women will be recruited, excluding women
        seeking emergency or oncological care.
