      Background: Whether Supra-Fiber, a plum-derived fiber supplement is useful in the treatment
      of constipation is not known. Supra Fiber is the first fiber supplement that has a blend of
      whole food fruit as its main ingredient. It contains prunes, pomegranates, blueberries, and
      Acai berries. Unlike psyllium, which is mostly (90%) insoluble fiber, Supra Fiber is a
      balanced (50%) blend of insoluble and soluble fiber. This may provide the beneficial effects
      of fiber, and eliminate potential adverse symptoms of fiber such as bloating, distention,
      hard bulky stools and excess gas. In this study, we expect to not only evaluate the efficacy
      but also the palatability and tolerability of Supra Fiber in the treatment of chronic
      constipation.

      Aims:

        1. To investigate and compare the effects of Supra Fiber (5 grams BID) or psyllium (5 grams
           BID) on the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week, and bowel symptoms.

        2. To examine the effects of fiber supplements on taste and quality of life in adults with
           functional chronic constipation in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group controlled
           trial.

      Methods: We propose to enroll 90 subjects with functional constipation in a single blinded,
      randomized, cross-over study comparing 4 weeks of Supra Fiber with 4 weeks of treatment with
      Psyllium

      Data analysis: The primary outcome measure will be the global relief of constipation symptoms
      as rated by the subject at the end of each phase of the study. Additionally, we will assess
      several secondary outcome measures that will include the number of Complete Spontaneous Bowel
      Movements (CSBM) per week, Quality of Life , psychological profile, patient rating of taste
      on a VAS scale, patient rating of bloating, distension, satiety and fullness and patient
      rating of constipation-related symptoms.

      Expected results: We anticipate that treatment with Supra Fiber will improve symptoms of
      constipation compared to the baseline. This improvement will be comparable or superior to
      that achieved with psyllium treatment. Additionally, Supra Fiber will offer a natural, food
      based, convenient and more tasty alternative to over-the-counter laxatives and fiber
      supplements.

    <description>1. Number of Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movements (CSBM) per week. This will be analyzed from the daily stool diaries (Appendix 1). The CSBM provides a more robust and better assessment of the overall change in bowel function that takes into account not only the stool frequency but also the completeness and satisfaction with bowel function. A CSBM is defined as a bowel movement that is produced without the use of additional laxatives, suppositories or enemas in the previous 24 hours, other than the study medication.</description>
