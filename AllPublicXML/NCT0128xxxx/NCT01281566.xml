      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Cisapride in improving feeding
      problems in premature newborn infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind study where the identity of the treatment assigned (Cisapride or
      placebo) will not be known to the patient's legal guardian or any study staff involved with
      the study. Patients will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive either the drug
      Cisapride or a placebo (a placebo is identical in appearance to Cisapride but does not
      contain Cisapride or any active drug) to see if Cisapride is effective in improving feeding
      problems (referred to as feeding intolerance) in premature newborn infants who cannot
      tolerate oral feeding by mouth or through a tube going directly to the stomach or intestine.
      Patients will be given either cisapride at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg or placebo as a liquid
      suspension through a tube from the nose to the stomach (referred to as a nasogastric tube) 15
      minutes before feeding once every 6 hours (or 4 times a day referred to as a q.i.d.
      schedule).
