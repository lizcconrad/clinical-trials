  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the ALX-0061, a Nanobody targeting the
      receptor for interleukin 6 (IL6R), is safe and effective after single or multiple
      administrations to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients will receive different
      single or multiple doses of either placebo or ALX-0061.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &lt;35.0 kg/m2

          -  Diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to the 2010 European League Against
             Rheumatism (EULAR)/ American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for at least 6
             months prior to randomisation

          -  Treatment with methotrexate (MTX) for at least 12 weeks prior to screening, with at
             least 4 weeks before screening at a stable dose, that will remain stable throughout
             the study period. Inadequate response or or intolerance to disease modifying
             antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (including MTX, where a patient may remain on treatment
             with %TX at a lower dose for improved tolerance, but with reduced effectiveness)

          -  For patients (men and women) of reproductive potential, use of an acceptable method of
             contraception for the duration of the study. Female patients must be willing to use
             appropriate birth control measures that would prevent pregnancy starting from the time
             of signing the informed consent until 90 days after the last dose of study drug is
             administered

          -  For single dose part: Disease Activity Score using 28 joint counts (DAS28) score &gt;=
             2.4

          -  For multiple dose part: DAS28 score &gt;= 3.2

          -  For multiple dose part: swollen joint count &gt;= 3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A documented history of an autoimmune disease other than RA (other than secondary
             Sj√∂gren's syndrome)

          -  Functional class IV by ACR classification

          -  Any new/additional biologic DMARD therapy, cytotoxic drugs and immunosuppressants
             within four weeks prior to screening, and between screening and Day 1 with the
             exception of ALX-0061

          -  Suspicion of active tuberculosis verified by quantiferon test and abnormal chest X-ray

          -  Female patients who are pregnant during the study, or are breastfeeding

          -  History of anaphylactic reactions to protein therapeutics

          -  Participation in an investigational drug study within 60 days prior to drug
             administration except for the patients who participated in the single dose part of
             this study and who are eligible to participate in the multiple dose part

          -  Donation of more than 300 mL of blood within 60 days prior to drug administration

          -  Malignancy, or prior malignancy, with a disease free interval of &lt;5 years after
             diagnosis and intervention except curative treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer or
             resected carcinoma in situ

          -  Any current or recent (within 4 weeks prior to first dose) signs or symptoms of
             infection that requires parenteral antibiotic administration, any known active viral
             infection (hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], human immunodeficiency
             virus [HIV]) that would impair the participation in the study

          -  Major surgery (including joint surgery) within 8 weeks prior to screening and
             hospitalisation for a clinically relevant event within the 4 weeks prior to screening

          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinically
             significant laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
             that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or renders the patient at high risk for treatment
             complications

          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 1 month before dosing with
             ALX-0061, or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during
             the study or within 60 days after the last dose

          -  For multiple dose part: contraindication to MRIs or the use of contrast agents for MRI
             scanning
