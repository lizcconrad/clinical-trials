  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the results from preclinical study, the investigators suggest that the addition of
      simvastatin at a dose of cardiovascular use (40 ~ 80 mg qd daily) may overcome cetuximab
      resistance in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer via B-Raf protein degradation and inducing Bim
      and Bad. Given the result of a phase II FOLFIRI plus cardiovascular dose of simvastatin (80mg
      qd daily) and this study, phase II study of conventional cetuximab treatment with 40 mg
      simvastatin is planned in metastatic colorectal cancer patients with KRAS mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Simvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor leading
      to inhibition of post-translational modification of small G proteins. Mevalonate-derived
      prenyl groups, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP),
      facilitate essential intracellular functions of various proteins such as Ras and Rho. Owing
      to its effect on post-transcriptional modifications of Ras and Rho, the anti-tumor effect of
      statins has been suggested in various cancer cell lines. However, more recent studies
      utilizing cancer gene signatures have systematically screened an array of drugs for potential
      anti-tumor effect and have discovered statins as potential novel targeted agent against
      cancer. Given the cardiovascular therapeutic dose is 1 mg/kg/day which translates into serum
      level of 0.1 uM in patients, the investigators have previously tested and reported that low
      dose lovastatin ranging from nanomolar to 0.3- 1 uM statin induced cell senescence or
      cytostatic effect of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In addition, the investigators
      previously reported on well tolerability and promising anti-tumor effect of combination of
      simvastatin 40 mg daily and standard FOLFIRI (irinotecan, infusional 5-fluorouracil,
      leucovorin) in metastatic colorectal cancer.
