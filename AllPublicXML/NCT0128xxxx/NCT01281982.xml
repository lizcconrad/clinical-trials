  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The blood-brain barrier helps to protect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
      from harmful toxins, but also prevents potentially useful chemotherapy from reaching brain
      tumors. The barrier is formed by tight connections between blood vessel cells and molecules
      found on the surface of brain blood vessels such as Permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp). Pgp may
      influence whether patients with brain tumors known as gliomas respond to chemotherapy and
      what side effects they may experience. The compound (11C)N-desmethyl-loperamide ((11C)dLop)
      reacts to Pgp molecules, and therefore may be used with positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging to study the blood brain barrier.

      Objectives:

      - To study the ability of PET imaging with (11C)dLop to evaluate the blood brain barrier in
      brain tumor patients.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a brain tumor with characteristics that may
      be imaged with techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) andPET.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history,
           blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies (fluorodeoxyglucose PET and MRI scans
           with contrast agent).

        -  The (11C)dLop scan will take 1 hour to perform. Participants will be asked to return for
           blood and urine tests approximately 24 hours after the PET scan.

        -  Participants will have followup visits at least every 4 months by repeating a complete
           history and physical exam and brain MRI. Participants may have repeat scans with
           (11C)dLop at various points in the course of cancer treatment, but will not have these
           scans more than twice in a 12-month period.

        -  Participants will be followed for as long as possible during treatment to see if imaging
           with (11C)dLop correlates with response to the treatments.

      BACKGROUND:

      A potential impedance to successful glioma chemotherapy is sanctuary for tumor behind the
      blood brain barrier. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an efflux transporter encoded by MDR1 that
      contributes to the functional regulation of substrates across the cerebrovasular endothelium.
      Pgp activity in patients with gliomas may influence response to therapy and neurotoxicity.
      (11C) N-desmethyl-loperamide (11C)dLop) is a radioligand substrate for Pgp, and PET imaging
      with this molecular marker may provide a non-invasive, in vivo method of examining Pgp
      function in brain tumor patients.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      -To measure the uptake of (11C)N-desmethyl-loperamide ((11C)dLop) using PET imaging as a
      marker of Pglycoprotein function in patients with intracranial gliomas

      Secondary:

        -  Correlate (11C)dLop PET uptake with perfusion MRI parameters and FDG PET uptake for
           volumes of interest (VOI) determined by the baseline MRI

        -  Develop exploratory data for the correlation of (11C)dLop PET imaging with patient
           outcomes such as response to therapy, survival, and neurotoxicity

        -  Develop exploratory data for the correlation of (11C)dLop PET imaging with
           immunohistochemical and molecular genomic assays of MDR1 and Pgp

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients with predominantly non-enhancing intracranial gliomas will be eligible.

      DESIGN:

      This is a pilot study of (11C)dLop PET imaging in 10 patients with intracranial glioma.
      Standard uptake values (SUVs) corrected for cerebral blood flow determined by (15O)H20 PET
      scans will be correlated to DCE-MRI (obtained within prior 2 weeks) and FDG-PET (obtained
      within prior 4 weeks) to characterize locoregional differences in Pgp function. When
      available, correlative studies performed on archived tumor tissue acquired immediately
      subsequent to (11C)dLop scanning will include immunohistochemical assays of Pgp expression,
      as well as characterization of MDR1 polymorphisms. Patient case histories will be followed
      longitudinally to make observations about how (11C)dLop imaging may correlate with patient
      outcomes such as response to therapy, survival, and neurotoxicity.

             ability of the patient to give informed consent is questionable) must sign an informed
             consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study.

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60.
