  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive children are afflicted with diffuse flat
      warts that have been recalcitrant to multiple treatments.The aim of this prospective study
      was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 15% glycolic acid lotion (NeoStrata)
      for treatment of flat warts in HIV-positive children in Botswana. Additionally, the
      investigators characterized the flat warts in this population, including Human Papillomavirus
      (HPV) type(s) and degree of immunosuppression within the patients.
