    <textblock>
      The MORE Observational Study follows real-world renal transplant patients with the data
      resolution of a monitored, prospective clinical trial for 5 years. In addition to capturing
      detailed clinical data, the study describes recent important changes in surveillance testing
      and drug therapy and relates these changes to short and long-term outcomes. Also, the study
      measures patient compliance over time and details the rationale for modifications of MPA
      dosing in maintenance and regimen changes after episodes of AR. The MORE study will provide
      information on era changes in transplant practices and their impact on clinical outcome, new
      insights on optimizing regimens for discrete patient subsets and new perspectives on the
      optimal use of MPA therapy.

        This study will enroll approximately 1,200 de novo (newly transplanted within 2 weeks)
        renal transplant patients from approximately 30-60 transplant centers across the United
        States. Patients should be consented prior to the first dose of MPA, +/- 14 days from the
        date of the transplant and be enrolled as soon as feasible after transplantation but not
        later than 2 weeks post-transplantation. Enrollment targets will be capped globally at 800
        patients being treated with myfortic速 and 400 patients being treated with CellCept速.
