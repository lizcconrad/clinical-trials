  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine blood and urine concentrations of canagliflozin and
      glucose in healthy adult volunteers after administration of single and multiple doses of
      canagliflozin.

      This is an open-label (volunteers and study staff will know the name and dose of the
      treatment assigned), single-center study of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) in healthy adult
      volunteers. Canagliflozin (a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2-inhibitor) is currently under
      development to lower blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Healthy volunteers will take canagliflozin 50 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg tablets, orally (by
      mouth), once daily on Day 1 and on Days 4 to 9. All study drug administration will occur at
      approximately the same time each morning with 240 mL of noncarbonated water and will be
      followed by a standardized breakfast within 10 minutes.
