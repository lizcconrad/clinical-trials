  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the effectiveness and safety of two treatment algorithms for insulin
      detemir initiation and titration: active titration algorithm (performed by investigator
      weekly) versus usual titration algorithm (performed by study subjects weekly) in patients
      with type 2 diabetes poorly controlled by OADs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week, prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study conducted in
      approximately 200 patients with type 2 diabetes in the Taiwan. The effectiveness of insulin
      detemir will be assessed at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks after initiation of study
      prescription. The safety will be followed during the 24-week study period.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients must meet all of the following criteria:

        1. Men and women with type 2 diabetes.

        2. 20 years of age.

        3. Patients who have received stable doses of any OADs for at least 10 weeks prior to the
           screening visit.

        4. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1C &gt;=7% and &lt; 11%).

        5. Patients who are willing and able to cooperate with study and give signed informed
           consent.

      After enrollment, eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following
      titration algorithms:

        -  Active titration algorithm: contact with investigator by telephone weekly.

        -  Usual titration algorithm: contact with investigator only at routine study visit.
