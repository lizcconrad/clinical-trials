      30 patients acute hospitalized to medical ward and their medication records are examined. It
      is to be recorded how the investigators find information about medicine use by the reception
      when they do not follow the patient. The record of the changes made during hospital stay is
      examined, whether they are justified in the discharge summaries and whether they are
      described in the medical list. After a month is to find out if the GP has recorded or
      possibly rejected changes to medication made in hospital.

      Furthermore is to be recorded how the investigators find information about medicine use by
      the reception when they do not follow the patient and how long it takes to find the right
      medicine list. The record of the changes made during hospital stay is examined, whether they
      are justified in the discharge summaries and whether they are described in the medical list.
      After a month is to find out if the GP has recorded or possibly rejected changes to
      medication made in hospital.

      This shall be recorded in the review of 30 patient with a focus on their medication list and
      follow them from admission to a month after discharge.

      Medicine List in discharge summaries will be compared with medication written in journal
      during hospital stay and changes described in the text summaries and medication lists should
      be checked against the same journal.

      Medicine list in the municipality one month after discharge shall be compared with discharge
      summaries and it will be mapped on the GP register, modified and considered if they are
      valid.

      Hypothesis:

      Medicine list is missing at admission by &gt; 50% of patients admitted acutely into hospital.

      Medicine List at admission, when available, is often incomplete. When the medication list is
      not available at admission, its content is often incomplete even after the staff at reception
      have tried to gather information from different sources.

      Changes of regular medication is not always present in the discharge summaries. The changes
      are not always justified in the discharge summaries. The GP often do not correct the
      medication list in the journal to the discharge summary.

      The GP does not give the patient an updated printout of the list at the first medical
      consultation after admission.
