      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zonisamide in the
      treatment of adult patients with partial, generalized or combined seizures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled non-comparative, multicentric observational post marketing
      surveillance study to comparing the safety and efficacy of zonisamide as adjunctive therapy
      or monotherapy in patients with partial, generalized or combined seizures, in a initiating
      dose of 100mg/day titrated to a maximum of 600mg per day based on the seizure control and
      tolerability over a 24 weeks treatment period. This study will include a total of 900
      patients with partial, generalized or combined seizures across 30 centres in the country. The
      patients will be enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be evaluated
      for safety and efficacy at every 4 weekly interval for 24 weeks. There will be total 7 study
      visits and the patients will be evaluated for clinically reportable adverse events, safety on
      Patients Global Assessment of Tolerability to Therapy (PGATT) on a 4-point scale and for
      efficacy by evaluation of reduction in seizure frequency as the primary objective of the
      study. For secondary objectives the patients data will be evaluated to determine the
      responder rates (&gt; or = to 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline) and seizure
      freedom over the 24 weeks study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, 18 to 75 years of age inclusive

          2. Treated or untreated subjects suffering from any of the following types of seizures:

               1. Partial Seizures: Simple Partial Seizures, Complex Partial Seizures &amp;amp;
                  Secondarily generalized tonic clonic seizures

               2. Generalized Seizures: Tonic-clonic seizures, tonic seizures &amp;amp; Atypical
                  absence seizures

               3. Combined seizures (mixed)

          3. Subjects having had a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             done within the last upto 10 years that ruled a progressive cause of epilepsy.

          4. Female subjects without child bearing potential (2 years postmenopausal, bilateral
             oophorectomy or tubal ligation, complete hysterectomy) are eligible.

          5. Female subjects with childbearing potential must not be pregnant as confirmed by a
             negative pregnancy test at screening and enrollment must not be lactating and must be
