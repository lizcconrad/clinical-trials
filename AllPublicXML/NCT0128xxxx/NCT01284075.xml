  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be a prospective, randomized trial which will take place at the
      University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC). Eligible patients will be identified at the
      time of their first clinic visit. If selected to be involved in the study, the patients will
      be randomized to one of three different groups: a Guided Imagery and Music therapy group
      (GIMT) or one of two control groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GIMT group will undergo a standardized regimen of peri-operative guided imagery and music
      therapy guided by CDs. As there are no studies which discuss whether the act of listening to
      any therapy will affect outcomes, we will also explore whether white noise can affect
      outcomes as well. Therefore, one control group (WN) will abide by the same regimen and will
      listen to a CD with white noise; the other control group (CP) will have no intervention at
      all and will follow our current peri-operative procedures.

    <description>Determined by using a Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS)- A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain is a horizontal line 100 mm in length with the left end labeled 'No pain' and the right end labeled 'Very severe pain'. The subject marks a point on the line that represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring the distance from the left end of the line to the point on the line marked by the subject. The range of possible values for this pain score is 0 to 100 millimetres.</description>

             visit. Patients may be undergoing surgery for either known cancer (ovarian or uterine)
             or high suspicion for malignancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  &lt; 19 years old
