    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which a culturally appropriate,
      self-management intervention that combines patient education with a patient outreach liaison
      strategy improves outcomes associated with type-2 diabetes among low-income diabetic women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the prevalence of diabetes has significantly increased among women and
      because of the expected fast growth rate of minority populations, the number of women in
      these groups who will be diagnosed with diabetes is also expected to increase significantly
      over the coming years. Among women from minority groups diabetes is the fourth leading cause
      of death while it is the seventh among non-Hispanic White females. Non-compliance to diabetes
      self-care is a major concern for type 2 diabetic women of racial/ethnic groups because of the
      existing socio-economic and environmental barriers. Often, these women live in poverty; have
      less than a high school education as well as language barriers and inadequate health
      literacy, which further place them at risk for complications, and the daily activities of
      diabetes self-care are implemented within the context of family responsibilities and
      patient's priorities.

      This study is a 12-month randomized controlled trial designed to compare a lifestyle
      intervention group (combination group) and a control group (education only group).
      Participants assigned to either group will receive three group education sessions (baseline,
      3 and 6 months) with an emphasis on self-management.
