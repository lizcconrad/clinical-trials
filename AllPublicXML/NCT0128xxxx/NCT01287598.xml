          -  ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 2

          -  Histological or cytological documentation of confirmed advanced solid tumors. Subjects
             should have measurable or non-measurable disease according to RECIST

          -  Life Expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal functions as assessed by the following
             laboratory requirements conducted within 14 days prior to the first study treatment:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/mm3

                  liver)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)≥ 30
                  ml/min/1.73 m2, according to the MDRD (Modified Diet in Renal Disease)
                  abbreviated formula

          -  Subjects who are therapeutically treated with warfarin, heparin or other
             anticoagulants are not eligible for study participation in Group A. Subjects who are
             therapeutically treated with warfarin, heparin or other anticoagulants, will be
             allowed to participate in Group B of the study provided they meet all eligibility
             criteria. Close monitoring of at least weekly evaluations will be performed until INR
             or PTT are stable by the local standard of care.

          -  Recovery from previous drug/procedure-related toxicities to CTC Grade 0 or 1 levels
             (except for alopecia), or to baseline preceding the prior treatment. Preexisting

             such as Quinidine, Procainamide, Amiodarone, or Sotalol are not permitted. β-Blockers
             and digoxin are permitted.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% or below the LLN for the institution

             mmHg or systolic blood pressure to fall to or below 140 mmHg with or without the use
             of antihypertensive drugs). At screening, subjects with history of hypertension should
             be on a stable anti-hypertensive treatment for at least 7 days prior to the first dose
             of study drug.

          -  Patients with known allergy to any of the study drug(s) to be administered, including

          -  Subjects with arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events, such as cerebrovascular
