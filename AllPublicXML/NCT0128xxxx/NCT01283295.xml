  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to develop a well-characterized library of blood, biopsy tissue,
      and urine samples from transplant patients. Subjects without transplants will also be
      enrolled for comparison. Samples will be used to study the characteristics of patients
      undergoing transplantation that influence their response to transplant therapies and their
      reactions to drugs used in transplantation. This knowledge is important as it helps
      physicians design new drugs and tailor transplant therapies to the individual thereby
      reducing the side effects. In this study, people will be asked to donate blood, biopsy tissue
      and urine. Donation of these samples will not influence patients' treatments. These samples
      will be tested using a variety of biological tests to better understand how immunosuppressive
      drugs change the various components of the immune system. The tests will be for research
      only; no changes in an individual's treatment will be based on the results of tests performed
      in this study. If there is extra sample, the sample will be stored for use in other testing
      at a later date. The ultimate goal is find the right combination of medications for each
      individual patient while keeping their new organ working well. This study is a first step in
      that direction by perfecting tests used to characterize a patient's immune system

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  recipients of or candidates for organ transplantation or organ donors for recipients
             under evaluation at Emory University or CHOA

          -  normal volunteers, including individuals without any known end-stage organ disease who
             are not on any immunosuppressive medication, and individuals with conditions requiring
             immunosuppression (i.e. dermatological diseases) that do not require transplant
             therapies

          -  ability to understand the purposes and risks of the study and willingly give written
             informed consent, or in the case of minors, ability to give minor assent (children
             older than 5 years of age), in conjunction with written guardian consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who fail to meet the criteria for transplantation or post-transplant
             follow-up by Emory or Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta physicians

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the attending physician, would place the patient
             at undue risk by participating. Specific conditions include but are not limited to:
             anemia prohibitive of phlebotomy, coagulopathy or technical considerations that would
             prevent acquisition of sufficient tissue on biopsy for clinical use, or medical
             urgency preventing timely administration of the consenting process.
