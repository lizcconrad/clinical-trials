      Title: A multicenter observational study of candidemia cases among ICU patients in India

      Objective: Primary objective:

      Determine epidemiological and also clinical parameters of candidemia cases among ICU patients
      in India.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        1. Determine the prevalence of candidemia among ICU patients.

        2. Determine the prevalence of candidemia due to C. albicans and each species of
           non-albicans Candida species.

        3. Determine the demographics and risk factors for candidemia patients and comparison of
           relevant variables between the cases with C. albicans and non-albicans Candida species
           isolation.

        4. Describe physician practice in the management of candidemia cases - clinical and
           outcome.

        5. Determine the in-vitro antifungal susceptibilities of Candida isolates.

      Study description and purpose:

      Short description: Observational multicentre study in ICU patients. Study purpose:
      Epidemiological determinants of candidemia, management and outcome evaluation.

      How the study would help? It would help to evaluate outcomes of current management strategies
      and to develop future better management strategies of candidemia cases.

      Critical issues &amp; risk: Site &amp; center selection would be important No risk for patients
      included in the study as it is only observational study

      Study design:

      Site selection: A questionnaire will be circulated (annexure I) to all major tertiary care
      centers of India. The centers will be selected on the competence of candidemia diagnosis and
      availability ICU facilities. Expected number of centers ~ 20.

      Study period: October 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012 No of patients/sites: Consecutive all patients
      with candidemia detected during ICU stay over the study period will be included in the study
      in each site.

      Patient selection: Inclusion criteria:

        1. Admitted in ICU for &gt; 48 hours (to coincide definitions of nosocomial or ICU-acquired)

        2. All age group patients will be included (pediatric &amp; adult)

        3. Diagnosed as proven candidemia (isolation of Candida species from blood culture on ≥ 1
           occasion during ICU stay)

        4. Blood culture positive for Candida spp. , if sample has been drawn within 48 hrs after
           discharge from the ICU.

      Exclusion criteria:

      1. Patient already diagnosed of candidemia before admission in ICU Variables|: types of ICU,
      demographic data of patients, underlying illness, risk factors, severity scores, diagnostic
      methods, treatment characteristics (Annexure II) and treatment outcomes (Annexure III)

      Diagnosis of candidemia: Isolation of Candida species from blood culture (arterial/venous) by
      any method (conventional/ lysis-centrifugation/ automated system/ any other method). No
      intervention in diagnostic processes at any center. Centers not performing diagnosis of
      candidemia will be excluded from the study

      Data recording: both manual and online. The form of Annexure II will be filled up within 5
      days of diagnosis of candidemia; Annexure III will be filled up within 7 days of discharge
      from hospital or 30 days after starting the antifungal therapy or death of the patient (which
      over period is early).

      Data analysis: appropriate statistical method will be employed for analysis of data.

                non-albicans Candida species.

             3. Determine the demographics and risk factors for candidemia patients, and comparison
                of relevant variables between the cases with C. albicans and non-albicans Candida
                species isolation.

             4. Describe the management of candidemia cases and outcome.

             5. Determine the in-vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of Candida isolates.

        2. Study description and purpose:

           2.1 Observational multicentre study of ICUs in India. Institute having ICUs and facility
           for diagnosis of candidemia will be chosen.

           2.2 Purpose: Determination of epidemiological parameter of candidemia, description of
           current management and outcome of patients with candidemia. This would help in
           formulation of a guideline for management of patients with candidemia especially when
           the patients are critically ill and admitted in ICUs.

           2.3 Critical issues &amp; risk: There is no risk for patient as it only observational study
           and no intervention is intended. The site selection would be important to get useful
           data.

        3. Study design:

           3.1 Site selection: The major tertiary care centers will be evaluated on the basis of
           responses to a set of questionnaire (Annexure I). Only centers having ICU facilities and
           competence to diagnose candidemia will be selected. Expected number centers will be ~20.

           3.2 Study period: October 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012

           3.3 No of patients: Consecutive patients with candidemia diagnosed in ICUs &gt; 48 h after
           admission during the study period will be included in each site. Expected number of
           patients with candidemia would be ~2000

        4. Patient selection:

           4.1 Inclusion criteria:

             1. Admitted in ICUs for &gt; 48 hours

             2. All age group patients will be included (both adult &amp; children)

             3. Diagnosed as proven candidemia with isolation of Candida species ≥1 occasion from
                blood during ICU stay.

             4. Blood culture positive for Candida spp. , if sample has been drawn within 48 hrs
                after discharge from the ICU.

           4.2 Exclusion criteria: a) Patient already diagnosed for candidemia before admission in
           ICUs or in ICU for ≤48h .

        5. Patient management:

           During the study period, all process of patient management including diagnosis and
           treatment will be determined by treating physician. There will be no intervention in
           patient management as a part of study related activities.

        6. Conduct of the study 6.1 Investigators of the study - The ICU specialist in charge and
           microbiologist/mycologist of each center will be the site investigators of the study.
           Prof. Arunaloke Chakrabarti of PGIMER, Chandigarh will be coordinator of the study.
           A/Prof. Sharon Chen, Medical Mycologist, Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Westmead
           Hospital, Australia will be the advisor of the study.

      6.2 Patient enrollment - The investigator should ensure that only the patients with
      candidemia development in the ICU (see inclusion criteria) are included. Consecutively all
      patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be consecutively enrolled. The patients will
      be enrolled prospectively as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. The patients will be
      followed up till discharge from hospital or 30 days after start of antifungal therapy or
      death (whichever is earlier).

      6.3 Data collection - The form (Annexure II) will be filled up within 5 days of diagnosis of
      candidemia. The investigator would make sure that the patient is not identified (No mention
      of patient's name, address, hospital registration no. or any laboratory no. on the survey
      forms). The data collection will be performed both on line and on hard copy. The following
      variable will be noted:

        1. Demographic data

        2. Evaluation of the severity of the patient (severity will be assessed on the basis of
           scoring system available in the hospital (e.g, APACHE, SOFA).

        3. Underlying disease

        4. Risk factors

        5. History of previous antifungal therapy (prophylaxis/empiric/ definitive treatment)

        6. Description of candidemia episode

        7. Laboratory results

        8. Diagnosis of candidemia. 6.4 Laboratory or mycological tests - No laboratory or
           microbiological test is mandatory for the patient as a part of study. Study protocol
           will not intervene anywhere in laboratory investigation of the patient. Data of the
           laboratory tests performed as part of routine will be collected on study cases forms 6.5
           Patient management: The study will not intervene anywhere in patient management. The
           clinician in charge will manage the patient. The data of management practiced will be
           incorporated retrospectively in management form (Annexure III) within 7 days of
           patient's discharge from hospital or 30 days after start antifungal therapy or patient's
           death (whichever is earlier) 6.6 Identification of Candida isolates and antifungal
           susceptibility testing: Candida isolates may be identified and antifungal susceptibility
           testing may be performed at the study centers as part of the center's routine procedure.
           However, all Candida isolates (isolated from blood) will be submitted to the reference
           laboratory at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER),
           Chandigarh after filling the form IV. PGIMER, Chandigarh will confirm the identity of
           all Candida isolates and perform antifungal susceptibility testing according to CLSI
           M27-A3 protocol (broth microdilution method) 6.7. Statistical analysis: Descriptive
           statistical methods will be employed to analyze the data.

      7. Security and Confidentiality Once the patient is deemed eligible to participate and
      consent has been obtained (if any), a unique study number will be assigned. Subject initials
      and institution identification will be entered into a log book that will remain sole property
      of each site. The logbook will be kept secured at each site according to site's policies and
      procedures. The logbook will assist the investigator at the particular Institute to track and
      upload data in the system. Each site will be able to view its own patients entered and
      summary data on the aggregate patients of all centers, but no data from other sites.

      8. Publication : In the event of publication, the Investigators' names that will be cited
      will be those who have attributed the largest number of cases of the study. The coordinator
      and the advisor will also be cited. The order of the authorship would depend upon the number
      of cases per investigator per center, in the decreasing order. The exact number of authors
      remains to be decided upon, but the maximum number may be restricted to 11. The 'SIHAM'
      candidemia network will be mentioned at the end of authors. All other investigators will be
      acknowledged as participants of the network in the appendix. The sponsor of the network will
      be acknowledged in each publication. None of the sites is permitted to make any publication
      on its sites data, based solely on the parameters included in this study for the cases
      included in the present study, during this study period. If there is any breach of this
      understanding, the data from that centre will not be included in the final data analysis.

      9. Ethical Issue: The project should be cleared by the participating centers at their
      respective local Ethics Committee before commencing the project. The Ethics approval
      Certificate should be submitted to the coordinator before commencing the project.
