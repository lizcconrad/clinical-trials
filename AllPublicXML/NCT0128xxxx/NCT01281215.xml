      Currently, the educational interventions regarding the use of medicines need to be expanded
      and more effective, and thus set themselves up in strategies for reorganization of dispensing
      drugs in health services and provide support to the population to obtain greater control over
      their health. The pharmacist, in turn, inserted in the multidisciplinary team has an
      important role in health education with the aim of improving knowledge about the disease and
      the various treatment options, reflecting positively on treatment adherence and clinical
      outcomes as a result and quality of life related to patient health. Thus, health education,
      to share knowledge, represents an important task and involves attentive listening to the
      community to identify their needs and then solve them. From this perspective, therefore, the
      educational means to educate health and an integral formation of individuals as social actors
      critics who understand and question the social relations, transforming subjects into citizens
      participating in the process of health education, helping to raise awareness , knowledge and
      understanding of living conditions and relationships with health, promoting quality of life.
