      Some patients with brain tumors receive standard radiation to help prevent tumor growth.
      Although standard radiation kills tumor cells, it can also damage normal tissue in the
      process and lead to more side effects. This research study is looking at a different form of
      radiation called proton radiotherapy which helps spare normal tissues while delivering
      radiation to the tumor or tumor bed. Proton techniques irradiate 2-3 times less normal tissue
      then standard radiation. This therapy has been used in treatment of other cancers and
      information from those other research studies suggests that this therapy may help better
      target brain tumors then standard radiation.

      - Participants will receive proton radiotherapy at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center
      which is located at the Massachusetts General Hospital. They will receive the proton
      radiotherapy 5 days per week. The number of weeks the participant will be receiving proton
      radiotherapy depends upon the tumor type and location and how well they are tolerating the
      treatment. Participant's will have a physical exam weekly during proton radiotherapy
      treatment.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven low grade glioma or astrocytoma, ependymoma, craniopharyngioma,
             meningioma, neurocytoma, medulloblastoma or gangliogliomas or other rare tumor
             requiring tumor bed or tumor irradiation. Patients with a presumed diagnosis of optic
             glioma or gliomas based on imaging and clinical characteristics will also be allowed
             on this trial.

          -  Patients with biopsy proven high grade glioma (excluding GBM) and a gross total
             resection and patients with non-disseminated atypical teratoid rhabdoid (ATRT) may
             also be included.

          -  Pathologic diagnosis must be based on pathology or pathology review by Department of
             Pathology at MGH or another DF/HCC institution.

          -  Age between 1-25 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 1 year.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0, 1, 2 or 3 or Lansky performance status 30 or greater.

          -  Girls and women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had radiotherapy to the site to be treated.

          -  Participants with known spinal or distant metastases. Patients with ependymoma,
             medulloblastoma or germinoma must have metastatic workup including spine MRI to rule
             out metastases.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Patients who cannot participate in contributing to the neurocognitive outcomes due to
             severe neurologic impairment or language barrier (ie not English or Spanish speaking)
             will be excluded from this study.
