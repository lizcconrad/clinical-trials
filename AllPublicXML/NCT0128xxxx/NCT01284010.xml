      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in blood and bone marrow samples from
      patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To perform high-resolution, genome-wide profiling of DNA copy number alterations and
           loss-of-heterozygosity in samples from adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
           (ALL) obtained at diagnosis.

        -  To perform candidate gene resequencing of diagnostic ALL samples.

        -  To examine correlation of genetic alterations with outcome.

        -  To examine the correlation between microarray multi-gene and multi-exon expression
           signatures with specific alterations and outcome.

        -  To understand genetic events that contribute to the formation, development, and relapse
           of adult ALL by integrating the copy number and sequence alterations with the multi-gene
           signatures, and by comparing these data with data already generated in pediatric ALL.

      OUTLINE: Diagnostic, complete remission, and germ-line specimens are analyzed for DNA
      profiling and gene resequencing by the Affymetrix SNP6.0 microarray platform, PCR, and
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Frequency of genetic alterations are performed by
      the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Results are then compared with the data already generated from
      pediatric patients.
