    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how common oral HPV infections are in college
      women. The investigators also will find out what risk factors are associated with having oral
      HPV infections. The investigators hypothesize that approximately 3% of women will have oral
      HPV, and that HPV will be associated with oral sexual behaviors and with smoking behaviors.
      Finally, for those women with oral HPV- the investigators will determine whether the
      infections are persistent (still present) at 3-, 6-, and 12-months after the initial
      diagnosis.
