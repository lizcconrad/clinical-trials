    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Taiwan. The carcinogen in the
      environment is a key role in the development of lung cancer, and one of its main resource is
      tobacco. Activated carcinogens in the organism lead to mutations of crucial oncogenes
      resulting in tumor development. Genes such as Cytochrome P-450 family, GST (glutathione
      S-transferase) family, UGT (UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase) family, ERCC-1(excision repair
      cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency),ERCC-4 and ERCC-5,are encoding antioxidant
      enzymes or involving in the DNA repair process and the production of some transcription
      factors. In recent years, many studies have shown the correlation between these genes and the
      susceptibility of lung cancer. Each gene has a different role in the tumor development
      pathway. CYP, UGT, GST, NAT2 (N-acetyltransferase 2) and NQO1(NAD(P)H:quinono oxidoreductase
      1) involve in the production of antioxidant enzymes. The antioxidant enzymes can detoxificate
      hydrogen peroxide or defense against oxidative stress. However, the genetic polymorphisms may
      influence the function of detoxification, which cause the increase in the susceptibility of
      lung cancer. P53 and MDM2 genes play important roles in the production of tumor-suppression
      proteins and the regulation of transcription factors, which may regulate the growth and the
      apoptosis of cell cycle and influence the susceptibility of lug cancer. The polymorphisms in
      ERCC genes may cause the damage in the DNA repair process which might also cause increase in
      lung cancer susceptibility. The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor is highly
      correlated with increasing risk of the non-small cell lung cancers. The overexpression may
      induce the proliferation of cancer cells and the inhibition of the apatosis. Therefore, in
      recent years, EGFR has been widely studied as the new target of the drugs and the
      susceptibility of the lung cancer. In addition,the genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism
      channel proteins, like OCT2 (organic cation transporter), ATP7A, ATP7B and ABC (ATP-binding
      cassette) transporter may have influence on the metabolism, the efficacy and the toxicity of
      the drugs.

      The current study is a matched case-control study. The experimental group is the patients
      diagnosed as lung cancer at Taipei Medical University- Wanfang Hospital from January 2010 to
      December 2013, and one healthy patient will be matched to each case as the control group. The
      purpose of the current study is to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms
      and lung cancer in the Taiwanese population and to analyze the correlation.
