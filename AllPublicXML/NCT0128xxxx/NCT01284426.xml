Description in details:
Actually, this study have been started in March 2003 and finally done in March 2009, which would be totally 6 years. We eventually decided to report the rate of CU remissions only at 1, 3 and 5 years after the onset of symptoms because this would be the common interval time of CU symptoms that patients needed to know how long they should have those CU symptoms or how many of them would go away their symptoms within 1, 3 or 5 years. Another reason is that the remission rate of CU between 5 and 6 years was not significantly different, so it might not need to be reported.</description>
