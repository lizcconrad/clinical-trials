    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be documented to have Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) by at least
             two of the following four criteria (a-d):

               1. Failure to increase urine osmolality above 300 mOsm/kg during a period of fluid
                  deprivation sufficient to raise plasma osmolality and sodium above the upper
                  limit of normal level for the reference laboratory (usually 295 mOsm/kg and 148
                  mEq/l, respectively)

               2. Complete and continuous control of the DI by desmopressin therapy without
                  &quot;breakthrough&quot; diuresis, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, or symptoms or signs of
                  water intoxication.

               3. A deficient plasma vasopressin response to osmotic or non-osmotic stimulation.

               4. Absence of the posterior pituitary bright spot on T-1 weighted midsagittal
                  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.

          -  Given written informed consent prior to any trial-related procedure is performed

          -  24 hour urine volume (mL), urine osmolality (mOsm/kg), urine specific gravity, and
             serum sodium (mEq/L) maintained at a normal level by desmopressin nasal administration

          -  Outpatient

          -  The participant is, in the investigator's opinion, otherwise healthy

          -  Be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements including restriction of
             water intake

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence or a history of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or diabetes mellitus

          -  Presence of uncorrected hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism or hypogonadism

          -  Abnormalities or disease of the oral cavity that might affect the release and
             absorption of drug

          -  Unable to be placed on water-intake restriction starting from two hours before bedtime

          -  Presence of a hypothalamus abnormality leading to thirst disorder

          -  Evidence of hepatic, renal, cardiac, or pulmonary dysfunction

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Treatment with another investigational product within the past 3 months

          -  Concurrent treatment with diuretics, chlorpropamide, tricyclic antidepressants,
             indomethacin, carbamazepine

          -  Alcohol dependency or drug abuse

          -  Breastfeeding, pregnant, or likely to become pregnant

          -  A mental condition, the lack of decision-making ability, dementia or a speech handicap

          -  Any other reason that the Investigator believes inappropriate
