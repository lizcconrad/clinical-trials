      Hypotheses:

        1. The bidirectional signaling between the cortex, and the pelvic floor/gut is deranged in
           patients with IC and in IBS. Consequently, they will demonstrate hyperexcitability of
           the pelvic floor/brain axis as evidenced by shorter latencies and increased amplitudes
           for both the afferent anorectal-cortical evoked potentials and efferent
           cortically-induced (magnetic) anorectal motor evoked potentials.

        2. Unlike patients with IC alone, patients with IBS will also demonstrate anorectal
           visceral hypersensitivity and anorectal sensory-motor dysfunction.

        Subjects: Sixty six consecutive adult, out-patients, over 18 years with IC alone and 66
        adult patients with IBS alone and 30 healthy controls will be recruited for this 5 year
        study and to fulfill all 4 aims of this study. All study aims will recruit under a unified
        strategy. For most of the funding cycle, we will recruit simultaneously for several study
        aims. To prevent confusion about concordant studies, similar standardized forms and
        diagnostic tests will be used for each aim, with supplemental tools as needed.

        Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome (IC/PBS) Study Population

        Inclusion Criteria:

        IC/PBS patients who have met all three of the modified NIDDK criteria (84) for IC/PBS as
        described below on a urinary symptom assessment form (Appendix 3):

          1. Participants will report the occurrence of bladder pain with a score of &gt;3 on a Likert
             scale of 1-10.

          2. Participants will report the presence of increased urinary frequency with a score of
             &gt;3 on a Likert scale of 1 -10.

          3. The bladder pain and increased urinary frequency will have been present for at least 6
             weeks.

        We recognize that the NIDDK is currently working on recommending new diagnostic criteria
        for interstitial cystitis. We will adopt any revised criteria commiserate with the new
        recommendations of the NIDDK as our study progresses.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of genitourinary tuberculosis, bladder cancer, high grade dysplasia, carcinoma
             in situ, urethra, vaginal, or cervical cancer.

          2. Previous treatment with cytoxan or cyclophosphamide (as reported by the patient).

          3. Radiation cystitis (as reported by the patient).

          4. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction (e.g.,) due to spinal cord injury, stroke, Parkinson's,
             MS, spina bifida, or diabetic cystopathy (reported by the patient or determined during
             a neurologic exam.

          5. Having had an augmentation cystoplasty (as reported by the patient).

          6. Having undergone a cystectomy, cystolysis, or neuroectomy as reported by the patient.

          7. Having a urethral stricture of less than 12 French (as reported by the patient).

          8. Urinalysis with &gt;10 white blood cells per high-powered field.

          9. A positive urine culture for bacterial cystitis within the past three months (by
             report) or a positive dipstick for leucocyte esterase or nitrates on urinary dipstick
             test at the time of presentation.

         10. Symptoms of vaginitis (as reported by the patient).

         11. Active herpes at presentation or has had active herpes in the last three months (by
             report).

         12. Use of antimicrobials in the past three months for urinary tract infections (by
             report).

         13. Presence of bladder, ureteral, or urethral calculi (as reported by the patient).

         14. Having undergone a cystometrogram, bladder cystoscopy under anesthesia or bladder
             biopsy under anesthesia or urethral dilation within the 6 weeks.

         15. Pregnancy.

        Additional Criteria for recruitment:

        Patients will be assessed no sooner than 6 weeks following a DMSO or other treatment or a
        hydrodistention as these treatments may influence inflammation. Subjects should have had no
        infectious illness within 2 weeks of participation. As estrogen levels are thought to
        contribute to IC symptoms, and symptom exacerbation has been reported perimenstrually (85),
        all menstruating subjects will be tested during the mid-luteal portions of their menstrual
        cycle (approx. days 7-14) to control for hormonal variability.

        We weighed the issue of excluding IC patients taking pain and psychotropic medication vs.
        including these patients. Amitriptyline is commonly used for treatment of pain in both IC
        and IBS; these patients commonly take other psychotropic drugs, systemic antihistamines,
        and drugs for pain. If we were to exclude all patients on any medication, we would be able
        to recruit a small and unrepresentative sample of the healthiest IC patients. If we asked
        patients to refrain from using medication for 2 weeks before the study, we would be
        subjecting them to undue pain and hardship, and might trigger an exacerbation of the
        disease. However, use of antihistamines affect measurements of methylhistamine, and use of
        amitriptyline and other anti- depressants produce a general blunting of the HPA response to
        a stressful stimuli (86, 87) as well as modulate the neurobiologic responses. We will
        exclude all subjects on antidepressants to examine a more homogeneous population. To try to
        obtain as representative a sample as possible without confounding of results we used the
        following strategy in our pilot studies and plan to use the same strategy in the proposed
        study. Subjects taking systemic antihistamines could not be included if they had taken
        antihistamines within a week of the study. Our preliminary data indicated that there was no
        significant difference in the ACTH or cortisol response to the reactivity challenge among
        patients using vs. those not using amitriptyline or other psychotropic medications (p's =
        .45 to .90).

        Healthy Controls study population:

        Additionally, we will recruit 30 healthy controls matched for our patient group with
        regards to age, gender, hormonal status and parity. Controls will be healthy women with no
        history of urological disease or genito-urinary symptoms and no immunomodulatory disease
        such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, MS, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, diabetes, cancer,
        HIV, vestibulitis, allergies, chronic fungal infections, migraines, depression, or chronic
        pain conditions. Healthy controls will be asked to complete the Mayo Health Screening
        survey and this will be used to adjudicate their health status.

        Healthy controls will be on NO meds other than multivitamins, oral contraceptives, and
        possibly low dose aspirin. They can not be taking anti-hypertensives, serotonin reuptake
        inhibitors, thyroid meds or other medications.
