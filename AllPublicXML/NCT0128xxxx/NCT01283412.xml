  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative agitation (hyperactive delirium) is common following major surgery(incidence
      was about 20% in our pilot study). Dexmedetomidine was related to a reduced delirium rate
      when comparing with midazolam in many clinical settings. It is not clear if dexmedetomidine
      is useful on reducing postoperative delirium. The hypothesis of present study: intraoperative
      application of dexmedetomidine (0.2ug/kg/h) is is effective (50% reduce) than placebo for
      reducing of early postoperative delirium and increase postoperative quality of recovery
      within 24 postoperative hours.

      After approval from the Institute's Ethics Committee, this study was conducted at Tongji
      Hospital, a general university teaching hospital with 2500 beds in Wuhan, China.The study
      consisted of adult patients, American Society of Anaesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS)
      I-III, undergoing selective major surgery under general anesthesia. All the patients were
      randomly assigned to receive dexmedetomidine or placebo during the operation. The primary
      outcome measure was postoperative delirium assessed by Nursing Delirium Screening Scale
      (Nu-DESC) every 8 hours within 24 postoperative hours. The secondary outcome was length of
      postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay,postoperative hospital length of stay, hemodynamic
      parameters, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and quality of recovery
      determined by quality of recovery (QOR40; maximum score 200)and Post-operative Quality
      Recovery Scale (PQRS) in the first 24 h after surgery.
