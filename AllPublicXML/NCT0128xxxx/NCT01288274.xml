  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that with appropriate training, the provision of
      injectable contraceptives by community based reproductive health agents (CBRHAs) does not
      significantly differ from low-level clinic-based providers, or health extension workers
      (HEWs).

      The overall goal of this project was to increase contraceptive prevalence and reduce the
      current high unmet need for family planning in rural areas of Ethiopia. In addition, the
      project was intended to provide evidence to policy makers to expand community based
      distribution (CBD) of the injectible contraceptive, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA),
      in both Tigray and other regions of Ethiopia where community based reproductive health agents
      (CBRHAs) or other community health workers (CHWs) are present.

      Following from that, the specific aims of this project were to:

        -  Provide evidence that CBRHAs can safely and effectively distribute and facilitate supply
           of DMPA to rural women

        -  Demonstrate that CBRHAs can deliver DMPA with the same safety, effectiveness, and
           acceptability outcomes as HEWs

        -  Increase access to DMPA by using CBRHAs
