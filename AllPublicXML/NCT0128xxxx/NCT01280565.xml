  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Masitinib is a novel TKI that potently inhibits wild type (WT) c-kit and its activated form,
      mutated in the juxtamembrane region (JM c-kit) PDGFRs, the intracellular kinase Lyn, and to a
      lesser extent fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3).

      Pre-clinical data suggest that masitinib is a strong candidate for the treatment of patients
      with advanced melanoma carrying a c-kit JM mutation.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with histologically or cytologically confirmed non-resectable or metastatic
             stage 3 (non-resectable IIIB or IIIC, AJCC TNM staging system 7th edition) or stage 4
             melanoma

          -  Patient with detectable c-kit JM mutation confirmed by DNA or RNA sequencing, which is
             expected to be mainly found after screening of mucosal or acral melanoma or melanoma
             on skin with chronic sun-induced damages (defined by a microscopically marked
             elastosis involving the skin surrounding their primary melanoma)

          -  Patient with measurable disease according to RECIST

          -  Patient with ECOG ≤ 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with other malignancies from which the patient has been continuously
             disease-free for &lt; 3 years, with the exception of melanoma, cervical carcinoma in
             situ, basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of
             the breast

          -  Patient with active brain metastases are not eligible. Patients with treated brain
             metastases are eligible if :

               -  presence of 3 brain lesions or less

               -  lesion(s) diameter is ≤ 2 cm

               -  radiation therapy (gamma knife) was completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to baseline

               -  surgery was completed ≥4 weeks prior to baseline

               -  lesions assessed by follow-up scan (or MRI if MRI performed before brain therapy)
                  ≥ 1 month after brain therapy are considered under control at baseline

          -  Patient refractory to dacarbazine defined as patient presenting a disease progression
             after 3 months of dacarbazine therapy.

          -  Prior treatment with a tyrosine kinase c-kit inhibitor
