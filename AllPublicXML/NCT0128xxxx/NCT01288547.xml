      Background Previous research has shown that naturally occurring chocolate ingredients
      theobromine and caffeine have positive effects on mood.

      Objectives: To assess mood and cognition in adult subjects after the consumption of capsules
      filled with 1. placebo, 2. theobromine alone, 3. caffeine alone or, 4. theobromine and
      caffeine combined together.

      Study design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over design, with a 1 week
      washout period in between.

      During the 4 weeks intervention period, once a week one of the 4 types of test products were
      consumed with 250ml of water in a randomized order;

        1. placebo capsules

        2. theobromine capsules (700 mg),

        3. caffeine capsules (120 mg),

        4. mix of theobromine (700 mg) and caffeine (120 mg). Twenty-four healthy female subjects
           (and 4 reserve subjects) were recruited for a four week intervention period in total
           with every week a 4 hrs measurement day and one of the interventions.

      Primary parameters: mood (via a Bond-Lader/ caffeine visual analogue questionnaire),
      cognition (Digit Symbol substitution) Secondary parameters: blood pressure
