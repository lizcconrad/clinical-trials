  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will assess the efficacy and safety of combination of rituximab
      (MabThera) and methotrexate in participants with active refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      who have failed to respond to a single course of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in
      routine clinical practice. Data will be collected from participants for 12 months after the
      first dose of rituximab or a minimum of 6 months following a rituximab re-treatment course.
