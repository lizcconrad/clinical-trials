      To compare rheolytic thrombectomy (RT) with manual thrombus aspiration (MTA) in patients with
      acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI.

      Occlusive thrombosis triggered by a disrupted or eroded atherosclerotic plaque is the
      anatomic substrate of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Due to this
      substrate, macro- and microembolization during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in
      AMI is frequent and may result in obstruction of the microvessel network, and decreased
      efficacy of reperfusion and myocardial salvage. Direct stenting without predilation or
      postdilation is the most simplistic approach to the problem of embolization, and may decrease
      embolization and the incidence of the no-reflow phenomenon. Other approaches to the problem
      of microvessel embolization include thrombectomy before stent implantation, and the use of
      antiembolic devices (filters and occlusive devices with retrieval of thromboembolic material
      after stent implantation). Most concluded studies on removing of thrombus before stenting
      used manual aspiration catheters and meta-analyses derived from these studies support the use
      of manual thrombus aspiration (MTA) catheters in the setting of primary PCI. MTA is currently
      recommended in the setting of primary PCI as a Class II b recommendation; level of evidence
      B. Rheolytic thrombectomy (RT) using multiple jets of saline solution and aspiration based on
      the Bernoulli effect has been proven to be effective in decreasing major adverse events
      during PCI in saphenous vein grafts or native coronary arteries with angiographic evidence of
      thrombus, and 2 out of 3 concluded studies have shown a better reperfusion and clinical
      outcome in patients randomized to RT as compared to control.

           symptom onset.

        -  Major surgery within past 6 weeks.

        -  History of stroke within 30 days, or any history of hemorrhagic stroke.

        -  Severe hypertension (systolic BP &gt; 200 mm Hg or diastolic BP &gt; 110 mm Hg) not controlled
           on antihypertensive therapy.

        -  Known neutropenia ( &lt;1000 neutrophils per mm3) or known severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;
           50,000 platelets per mm3).

        -  Patient unwilling to receive blood products.

        -  Previously stented IRA (stent thrombosis).

        -  Inability to identify the IRA.

    <description>The AngioJet Rheolytic Thrombectomy (RT) System consists of a drive unit console, disposable pump set, and disposable catheter. Thrombectomy is accomplished by the introduction of a pressurized high velocity saline stream through directed orifices in the catheter distal tip so that thrombus is entrained (Bernoulli effect), dissociated into small particles, and evacuated from the body through the catheter and associated tubing. The pump set consists of a high pressure pulsatile pump which is used to generate the flow necessary for the dissociation and evacuation of thrombus, an effluent bag for the collection and storage of thrombus debris, and associated tubing.</description>
