  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the SisterTalk Hartford study was to assess whether a theoretically- and
      scientifically-based, culturally acceptable weight loss program could be effectively
      translated into a faith-based program and subsequently delivered in the church to help
      African-American women lose weight.
