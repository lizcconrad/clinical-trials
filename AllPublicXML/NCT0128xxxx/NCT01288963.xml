  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which participants with melanoma have a better
      response to IL-2 and to identify markers that may predict response to IL-2 by collecting
      participant information (for example; cancer diagnosis and history, prior treatments for
      cancer, etc.) blood and tumor samples prior to treatment and tumor measurements after
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Original tumor slides will be collected to identify tumor markers that may predict responses
      to treatment. Blood samples will be obtained prior to treatment with IL-2.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine if DASL subclassification can identify a group of patients with advanced melanoma who are significantly more likely to respond to high dose IL-2 based on therapy than the historical 16% response rate in an unselected patient population</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To validate the usefulness of serum fibronectin and VEGF levels as negative predictors of response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To explore the predictive value of several genetic polymorphisms associated with immune function</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To explore the predictive value of BRAF^V600E mutational status as a predictor of response and benefit to high dose IL-2</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To explore the relationship of serum fibronectin and VEGF levels with the molecular signature of immune responsiveness in patients with advanced melanoma receiving high-dose IL-2 in order to identify specific cohorts with dramatic differences in response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated with high-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapy to those who will benefit the most</measure>
