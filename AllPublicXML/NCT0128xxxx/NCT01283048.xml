  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BKM-120 is a drug that may slow the growth of cancer cells. This drug has been used in
      laboratory experiments and information from those research studies suggests that this drug
      may help to slow the growth of renal cancer cells. In this research study, the investigators
      are testing the safety to BKM-120 at different dose levels. The investigators will also be
      studying how well tolerated BKM-120 is, and how effective BKM-120 can be in the treatment of
      kidney cancer.

      Subjects will receive an intravenous infusion of Avastin on Day 1 and Day 15 of each month
      (cycle). Subjects will take a daily oral dose of BKM-120 at the dose level assigned.

      Subjects will have a clinic visit weekly during Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 and Day 15 of each
      cycle for blood tests and physical exam.
