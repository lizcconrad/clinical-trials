  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of disease management programs on
      mortality, morbidity, quality of life (Qol), and medical cost in patients with heart failure
      (HF), no study has focused on psychological status as an outcome of disease management in
      patients with HF. Disease management could lead to the reduction of psychological distress,
      thus improving the self-care ability and adherence of patients with HF. In addition, very
      little information is available on the effectiveness of disease management programs in areas
      other than the US and Europe.The Japanese Heart Failure Outpatients Disease Management and
      Cardiac Evaluation (J-HOMECARE) has designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of home-based disease management programs compared with usual care in improving
      psychosocial status, mortality, HF hospitalization, and Qol in Japanese HF patients.
