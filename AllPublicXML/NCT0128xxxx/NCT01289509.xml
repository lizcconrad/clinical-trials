      This is a randomized, open label, 4- way crossover, replicate design study to evaluate the
      bioavailability (BA) of E5501 new Phase 3 formulation Lot P97001ZZB 40 mg tablet manufactured
      July, 2009 (Treatment A ,reference drug) relative to Lot P01010ZZA 40 mg tablet manufactured
      January, 2010 (Treatment B, test drug) administered to 42 healthy male and female subjects.
