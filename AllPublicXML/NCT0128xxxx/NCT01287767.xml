  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is one of the most common and devastating diseases in the elderly, it leads to
      helplessness, no cure exists and therefore care is necessary to provide. The care is
      associated with a great burden for the family carers and expensive for the society when
      residential care is required. The purpose of this study is to improve knowledge on how to
      provide better care for both the patients and their family carers, the investigators want to
      carry out a controlled trial using a rather cheap form of intervention, a multidimensional
      support program - an 18 months randomized controlled intervention study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 230 dyads of families, patients and carers, will be recruited from 18 municipalities, 18
      from each municipality with at least 15 000 inhabitants. Only home dwelling patients and
      carers with at least weekly face-to face contact with the patient will be included. The
      patients will be recruited both from memory clinics, outpatients clinics in geriatric
      medicine and old age psychiatry and from home nurse districts. The patients should have a
      diagnosis of dementia according to ICD-10 criteria, have a score on Mini Mental State
      Examination of at least 15 points and have capacity to give informant consent to
      participation in the study. The carers should score at least five on the Relatives' Stress
      Scale.

      115 family, control group, will receive care 'as usual' in the municipalities. The 115 family
      intervention group will have a duration of 18 months consisting individual counselling,
      education about dementia, problem-solving groups and ad-hoc counselling when needed. Effects
      will be measured at three levels, at patient level, at carer level and at societal level.
      Measurements will take place at baseline, after three, six, 12 and 18 months. At patient
      level, the Cornell scale will be used as the primary outcome. At carer's level, the primary
      outcome is the Relatives' Stress Scale. For the outcome on the social level Resource
      Utilisation in Dementia will be used.

      The carers will be contacted every year up till five years after the intervention ended to
      give information about their own physical and psychological health and the patient's use of
      formal help such as day care centre, respite care and permanent nursing home placement.
