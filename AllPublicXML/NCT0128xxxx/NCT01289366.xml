  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Precise activity assessment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is essential to determine the
      extent and severity of the disease for further specific therapy. Nevertheless, despite
      ongoing developments in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, the final diagnosis still
      relies on the interpretation of histopathological features of intestinal biopsies taken
      during the endoscopic examination. Recently, endocytoscopy (EC) was introduced as a new
      endoscopic imaging modality, enabling microscopic imaging within the mucosal layer of the gut
      at a magnification level of up to 1400-fold.

    <description>Patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis who underwent colonoscopy are prospectively included in this study. Methylene blue or toluidine blue is topically applied to enable EC (XEC-120-U, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Data are digitally saved and analyzed independently from each other by two gastroenterologists and one pathologist who are blinded to clinical and endoscopic data.</description>
