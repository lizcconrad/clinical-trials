               -  ochronosis;

               -  acromegaly;

               -  haemochromatosis;

               -  primary osteochondromatosis.

          2. Clinical signs of acute flare (pain, warm, erythema, effusion of signal knee) at
             baseline;

          3. Axial deviation &gt; 15 degrees in valgus or varus on a standing X-ray;

          4. Clinically significant medio-lateral or antero-posterior instability;

          5. Rapid destructive arthritis, evolving arthritis requiring surgery within the coming
             year;

          6. Significant injury to the signal knee within 6 months prior to baseline;

          7. Complete loss of range of motion;

          8. Painful knee conditions other than osteoarthritis (e.g., Sudeck's atrophy,
             intra-articular neoplasm, villonodular synovitis);

          9. Necrosis of one of the femur condyles;

         10. History or evidence of gout, chondrocalcinosis;

         13. Contraindications to intra-articular injection according to investigator's judgement
             (e.g., local infection at injection site, generalised infection with possible
             bacteraemia);

         14. Skin disease in the area of injection;

         15. Severe coagulopathy, ongoing anticoagulation therapy;

         16. Accompanying OA of the hip of sufficient severity to interfere with the assessment of
             the signal knee;

         17. Disease of spine, hip or other lower extremity joints of sufficient degree to affect
             assessment of the signal knee;

         18. Poor general health interfering with compliance or assessment;

         19. Concomitant disease/ailment other than knee OA requiring the regular use of the
             patient's normal analgesic medicine;

         20. Initiation of chronic treatment with antihistaminics, glucocorticoids, antidepressants
             or tranquilisers, within less than 3 months prior to baseline;

         24. Treatment with symptomatic slow acting drug for OA (SYSADOA, i.e., chondroitin
             sulfate, diacerein, glucosamine, piascledine), unless the patient has been on a stable
