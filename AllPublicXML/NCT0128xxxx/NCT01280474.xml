      This study aims at investigating the effects of maternal depressive symptomatology on
      pregnancy outcomes and newborn development. How paternal psychopathology is involved in the
      association will also be explored.

      This is a three-year prospective cohort study. Three versions of questionnaires (the mother,
      the father, and the infant) will be developed first. For parents, data on self-reported
      symptomatology such as depression, anxiety, and stress will be collected, while for infants,
      maternal report on newborn development will be measured. Then, two medical centers and two
      regional hospitals will be selected. All pregnant women who undergo a first-trimester
      prenatal visit, who plan to carry the baby till term, and whose spouse is also willing to
      participate will be invited to join the study. The investigators expect to recruit a total of
      194 pairs of depressive mothers and her spouses and 278 pairs of non-depressive mothers and
      her spouses in the study.

      After the informed consent is obtained, one baseline assessment (i.e., the first trimester)
      and four follow-up assessments (i.e., the second trimester, the third trimester, one month
      postnatal and six months postnatal) will be implemented. Basically, prenatal investigation
      (for both mothers and fathers) will be carried out at the outpatient prenatal visit.
      Postnatal investigation (for the mothers, fathers and infants) will be processed at the
      pediatric outpatient visit when the infants are schedule for an immunization injection. After
      data are collected, descriptive, analytic and longitudinal data analyses will be performed to
      investigate the association between parental psychopathology and pregnancy outcomes and
      newborn development.

      This study will explore the effects of the developmental trajectories of parental
      psychopathology on newborn growth during the critical stage of pregnancy. It is hoped that
      evidence based data could be obtained, examined, and applied in future
      prevention-intervention program to promote parental and newborn health, both physically and
      psychologically.
