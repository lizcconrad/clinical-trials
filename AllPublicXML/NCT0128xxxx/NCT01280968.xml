  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how vaccine-induced antibodies change the way the
      body processes nicotine from cigarettes. These antibodies absorb nicotine and can reduce
      nicotine levels in the brain. In this way, the vaccination may help to quit smoking. The
      central hypothesis is that anti-nicotine antibodies change kinetics of brain nicotine
      accumulation and distribution of nicotine between the brain and other body tissues. This
      vaccine is investigational which means that it is still being tested in research studies and
      is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help people quit smoking.

          <description>One participant reported that she was 54 at the screening, but after she was consented, it was discovered that she was actually 56. However, the subject was discontinued after the first study visit because she could not use the smoking delivery device; therefore, she received no vaccinations. Safety Event #14 was submitted to Duke IRB to account for this Protocol Deviation in which the subject was out of the age range.</description>

      <desc>The number of participants at risk is different from the number of enrolled participants because not all participants who were randomized to a vaccine or placebo received treatment. Of the 52 participants who were assigned to a treatment group, only 41 received at least one vaccination. Therefore, 41 participants were at risk.</desc>
