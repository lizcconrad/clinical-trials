    <textblock>
      The great toe is vital for normal, pain free ambulation. Decreased function associated with
      osteoarthritis of the first matatarsal phalangeal joint (MTP I) often called Hallux Rigidis
      or Hallux Limitus leading to a painful great toe. Patients experience pain during ambulation
      especially during the push-off phase of gait. When surgery is indicated four techniques are
      used for hallux rigidis; cheilectomie, resection arthroplasty, arthrodesis and implant
      surgery (1). Endoprostetic implants are relatively new. Silicone Implants like the
      arthroplasty developed by Swanson (2) resulted in foreign body reactions and periarticular
      bone loss. Subsequent implants, in particular the metallic hemi arthroplasty with or without
      polyethylene articulations, have been more successful (3). Still, implants are prone to wear
      of the material and show higher rates of loosening and infection compared to other techniques
      (4;5). In the last decades several new implants are described using two non cemented pressfit
      components, of titanium alloy or ceramic (6-9). Between 2001 and 2004 the investigators
      developed a new concept with instrumentation for exact alignment to prevent for wear with
      loosening of the implant on the long term. The implant has bone-conserving characteristics to
      enable arthrodesis as a salvage procedure. It is a completely modular two-component press fit
      titanium alloy implant with polyethylene insert that can be used as either for hemi-, total-
      or revision arthroplasty.

      The purpose of this study is to have an overview of clinical status of the patient implanted
      with the METIS® prosthesis at short term (2 years of follow-up). The objective of this study
      is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Metatarso-Phalangeal prosthesis METIS® at short
      term follow up.
