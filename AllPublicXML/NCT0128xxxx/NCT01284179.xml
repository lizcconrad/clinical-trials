  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to develop and test the feasibility of a standardized digital audio
      home-hypnotherapy (HHT) program for patients with refractory functional chest pain (FCP).

      The secondary aims of this study are:

        1. To obtain pilot data to assess the magnitude of the treatment effect of self-hypnosis in
           refractory FCP for an anticipated future, larger treatment trial;

        2. To determine the stability of the treatment effect of HHT in refractory FCP;

        3. To assess the relationship between response to HHT and psychological factors; and

        4. To assess the relationship between response to HHT and symptomatic dimensions of chest
           pain (severity, frequency, and duration).

        5. To assess the difference

      Eligible patients with refractory FCP will be randomized to one of 2 arms: the active
      treatment group, who will receive the HHT program; or a control group. Patients in the active
      treatment group will receive the 12-week digital audio HHT program. This protocol consists of
      7 sessions, each approximately 30-40 minutes, administered every 2 weeks, for a cumulative 12
      weeks of treatment, along with a shorter (approximately 12 minute) session administered
      daily. Patients in the control group will receive a digital audio educational program.
      Subjects in both groups will be assessed at baseline, 4-6 weeks into treatment, at the end of
      the treatment, and 3 months after conclusion of the program. Global change in symptoms will
      be assessed with a 7-point Likert scale. Patients will be considered to respond if they have
      significant improvement on the Likert scale at the post-treatment visit. Patients will
      complete a chest pain symptom diary, the SCL-90 and the Coping Strategies
      Questionnaire-Catastrophizing subscale to assess psychological features, and the SF-36 as a
      measure of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).

    <description>To fulfill Rome III recommendations for the design of treatment trials for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDS),47 we will use a 7-point Likert scale to assess for global change in chest pain. At times V2, V3, and V4, patients will be asked the following question: &quot;Compared to before starting this therapy, how would you rate your chest pain?&quot; The following answers will be given as options: &quot;much better&quot; (+3), &quot;somewhat better&quot; (+2), &quot;minimally better&quot; (+1), &quot;no change&quot; (0), &quot;minimally worse&quot; (-1), &quot;somewhat worse&quot; (-2), &quot;much worse&quot; (-3).</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomized to either the home hypnotherapy or educational group. The HHT protocol will consist of sequences of two different types of sessions, longer biweekly sessions (LS), each approximately 30-40 minutes in length, and shorter daily sessions (SS), approximately 12 minutes in length. On the first day of each sequence, the patient will listen to the appropriate LS. The patients will listen to the SS on a daily basis in between each LS. Every 2 weeks a new sequence will begin, for a total of 12 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomized to receive either home hypnotherapy or an educational program. The control group will receive an educational digital audio program on MP3 players. These digital audio files will contain general information about FCP and FGIDs. These audio files will be similar to the intervention audio files in length. Patients will be instructed to begin listening on the day of randomization. Patients will be instructed to continue their other medical treatment for chest pain during the study. The control group will be assessed at the same times as the HHT group.</description>
