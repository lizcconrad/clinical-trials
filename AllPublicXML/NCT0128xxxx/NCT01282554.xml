  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sport improves quality of life and health, decreasing cardiovascular risks and increasing
      effort tolerance. Chronic renal failure (CRF) induces many clinical and biological
      complications leading to less effort tolerance (strength and endurance). Renal failure
      patients got also many cardiovascular risks : sedentarily lifestyle, hypertension (HTA),
      diabetes, neuropathies, bone disorders, depression and sedentarity due to dialysis sessions.
      Moreover, dialysis sessions three times a week induce the spiral of deconditioning. In order
      to counteract this, sport should be encourage in this specific hemodialysis population.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate electrostimulation program during dialysis sessions for
      3 months. Evaluation will be done using the Test of 6-minute walk (6MWT).

      Secondary aims will be evaluated:

        -  Muscular strength and quadriceps diameter

        -  Equilibrium

        -  Quality of life.

        -  Strength developed during maximal exercise test in a subgroup (patient undergoing
           dialysis in Rennes center, about 40% of the total population)

        -  Nutritional intakes (quantitative and qualitative evaluation)

      The primary outcome is the difference between distances during the 6 minutes walk test before
      and after the 3 month program between the stimulated and the non stimulated group.

      The secondary outcomes will be evaluated by maximum strength developed during the ergometry,
      limited by symptoms; maximal charge during muscular test; quadricipital diameter; time for
      the &quot; Timed up and go &quot; test; quality of life scores. All those scores will be evaluated in
      the control and stimulated groups before and after the 3 month period.

      This is an open randomized controlled study. Tests will be done by an investigator unaware of
      the stimulation group. The study is designed to detect a difference of 61 m (+/- 80 m) (6MWT)
      before and after stimulation in the stimulated group and 0 in the control group. This
      difference has been based on a pilot study with ergocycle in the same population and on
      literature in other populations (chronic respiratory failure or post cardiac surgery). We
      estimated that 70 patients would need to be enrolled in each group to provide 90% statistical
      power with a bilateral test.

    <description>electrostimulation program (Rehab 400) : electrostimulation program during dialysis sessions for 3 months.
Electrostimulation modalities have been chosen to seek both slow and fast muscle fibers : 35 Hz ; impulsion time: 400 µsec ; on/ off : 7'' contraction / 8'' relaxation. Stimulated muscles are quadriceps. Electrostimulation time will be 30 minutes. Each patient will individually regulate work intensity, maximal intensity should be the maximal tolerable intensity.
Electrostimulation will be done 3 times per week. In case of asthenia or medical condition, electrostimulation can be delayed. The program will take place for 3 months.</description>
