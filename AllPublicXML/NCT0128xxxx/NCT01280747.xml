  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that fibromyalgia (FM) and painful diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (pDPN) patients with access restrictions on pregabalin will lead to higher
      healthcare resource use and cost compared to patients without such restrictions on pregabalin
      in a naturalistic setting. The randomization will occur at the physician level and not the
      patient level.

      This trial was terminated prematurely on April 2, 2012, due to the inability to recruit the
      planned number of subjects. The decision to terminate the trial was not based on any safety
      or efficacy concerns.

        There are six practice types that are expected to be able to provide patients to this
        study. Of these, four (internal medicine, family/general practitioners, neurologists, and
        anesthesia/pain physicians) will be expected to enroll patients into both pDPN and FM
        disease groups. The fifth group, rheumatology physicians, will be expected to enroll
        patients into the FM cohort only and the sixth group, endocrinologists, will be expected to
        enroll patients into the pDPN cohort only.
