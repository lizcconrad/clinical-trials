  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal anoxic-ischaemic enkephalopathy is a dramatic perinatal complication due to brain
      asphyxia. Neurological and neurosensory sequelae are frequent in survivors, due to neuronal
      damage and loss.

      For the moment, only total or partial body hypothermia can partially prevent cell loss.
      However, no treatment exists to restore neuronal functions.

      Cord blood stem cells are a promising treatment for the near future. However, before
      conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of autologous cell therapy
      in neonatal asphyxia, in vitro characterization of the cord blood stem cell in situation of
      neonatal asphyxia, compared to normal situation, is needed.

      The primary objective of this study is to characterize cord blood stem cells of neonates with
      neonatal asphyxia and to compare them with those from healthy newborn. The quantitative and
      qualitative, functional characterization will insist on cell populations which could
      potentially participate to neuronal regeneration. Secondary objectives are to assess such
      characteristics in conditions of cryo-preservation, compared to fresh cell preparation

      Methods :

      Descriptive, bi-centre study on 10 cord blood samples from newborn infants with neonatal
      asphyxia (5) according to pre-defined criteria, compared healthy neonates (5). The total
      duration of the study will be 2 years. Parents will be informed and a signed parental consent
      will be asked in the hours following birth before the in vitro study.

      Biological analysis will include elementary analyses for cell quality control, endothelial
      progenitor exploration, and investigation of mesenchymal stem cells function and of their
      neuronal differentiation potential (on fresh and frozen samples).

      Statistical analysis: comparison between the 2 groups (neonatal asphyxia versus control)
      would use non parametric test (Mann-Whitney)

      This study will allow to evaluate the therapeutic potential of cord blood stem cells
      autologous transplantation in neonatal asphyxia. It will contribute to the determination of
      the feasibility of a clinical trail of autologous, cord blood stem cells therapy in such
      disease.
