      The objective of the study is to identify biochemical predictors of morbidity and mortality
      in patients suffering from hip fracture. For this purpose blood samples are collected
      prehospitally or in the emergency department in patients with a suspected hip fracture.
      During the hospital stay medical history, anesthesiological management recorded. In addition,
      american society of anesthesiology physiological score (ASA), revised cardiac risk index
      (RCRI), and POSSUM score is calculated. Morbidity and mortality is recorded &quot; in house&quot;,
      after 30 days, after 4 months and after 1 year. Biochemical predictors of outcome will be
      evaluated with logistic regression analysis. Biochemical predictors include pro-brain
      natriuretic peptide, lactate, pro-calcitonin, adrenomedullin, copeptin, cystatin c. The
      predictive value of the potential markers will be compared to that of ASA, RCRI and POSSUM.
