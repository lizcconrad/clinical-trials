    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Histologic documentation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Surgical castration or ongoing use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists with
             confirmed castrate levels of testosterone

          -  Metastatic progressive CRPC defined as progressive disease despite surgical castration
             or ongoing use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists with confirmed castrate
             levels of testosterone

          -  For patients in the dose-expansion cohort of the study, not more than two prior lines
             of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting

          -  Evaluable or measurable disease

          -  Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anti-tumor therapy, including chemotherapy, biologic, experimental, or hormonal
             therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, with the following exceptions:
             maintenance hormonal therapy for metastatic prostate cancer and palliative radiation
             to bone metastases within 2 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (including
             HIV and atypical mycobacterial disease, but excluding fungal infections of the nail
             beds)

          -  Ongoing corticosteroid use with &gt; 10 mg of daily prednisone or equivalent

          -  Symptomatic hypercalcemia requiring continued use of bisphosphonate therapy. Patients
             who are receiving bisphosphonate therapy specifically to prevent skeletal events and
             who do not have a history of clinically significant hypercalcemia are eligible.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to monoclonal antibody therapy
             (or recombinant antibody-related fusion proteins)

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis

          -  Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with a history
             of treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided that they meet all of the following
             criteria: evaluable or measurable disease outside the CNS, radiographic demonstration
             of improvement upon the completion of CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim
             progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening
             radiographic study, and screening CNS radiographic study is &gt;/= 8 weeks since
             completion of radiotherapy and &gt;/= 4 weeks since the discontinuation of
             corticosteroids and anticonvulsants

          -  Dose expansion cohort (B): no prior chemotherapy is allowed
