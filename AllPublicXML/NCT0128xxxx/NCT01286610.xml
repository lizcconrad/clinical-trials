  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vibration therapy is used for different indications in rehabilitation and sports medicine. So
      far, vibration therapy has not been investigated within the ICU setting. The investigators
      created this setting to show safety and applicability of vibration therapy in ICU patients.
      30 patients will be stimulated by vibration therapy on two separate days during their ICU
      stay. Three collectives of equal size will be observed: One with patients on mechanical
      ventilation without signs of infection or suspected intracranial pressure problems, a second
      one with patients on mechanical ventilation in addition to signs of systemic inflammation but
      absence of suspected intracranial pressure problems, and a third one with patients on
      mechanical ventilation, signs of systemic inflammation in addition to presence of controlled
      intracranial pressure problems. Typical parameters of hemodynamic status, intracranial
      pressure and energy metabolism will be recorded for a defined period of time before, during
      and after vibration therapy itself. Vibration therapy will be combined with protocol based
      physiotherapy.

      Our aim is to show the effects of vibration therapy in ICU patients and its safe
      applicability.

      ADDITION 06th of May 2011: Additionally we will perform euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp
      and intervention on one day of ICU stay in 20 patients. Under clamp conditions we will
      perform a vibration therapy (ProMedVi Vibrosphere™) on patients' legs. On top we will perform
      electrical muscle stimulation (schwa-medico, MUSKELaktiv™) on one ventral upper leg,
      randomized chosen. Measuring the local skeletal muscle metabolism will be done by
      microdialysis in Vastus lateralis on both sides - comparing vibration therapy and vibration
      therapy combined with electrical muscle stimulation.
