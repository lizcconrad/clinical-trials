      TRACE is a Multicentre Retrospective Study planned to gather follow up data for a period of 1
      year in order to understand anti-thrombotic management patterns and outcomes of Acute
      Coronary Syndrome patients in India.

      This retrospective study is designed to provide a rapid and quick analysis of the existing
      database of ACS patients. So as to ensure quality check in the study, a pilot study will be
      conducted with around 500 patients at 10 centres across India and based on the meaningful
      results of the pilot study, full retrospective multi-centric study will be initiated at
      various selected centres across India. This study will use available registry data from a
      defined time period of Jan 2007-Dec 2009.
