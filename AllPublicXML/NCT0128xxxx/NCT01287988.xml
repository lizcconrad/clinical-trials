      The primary objective of this study is to assess visual function in up to 44 patients who
      have previously participated in either of the placebo controlled, ocriplasmin Phase III
      studies (TG-MV-006 or TG-MV-007).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of clinically significant abnormality in visual function, including Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) abnormality, and/or Electroretinography (ERG) abnormality</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1</time_frame>
    <description>Consenting patients will attend one visit, at which an ocular history, visual acuity (ETDRS) and full ophthalmologic assessment, as well as SD-OCT, and ERG assessment will be obtained. All SD-OCTs and ERGs will be centrally read by a masked and independent central reader.</description>
