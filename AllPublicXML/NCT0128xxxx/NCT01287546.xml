    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose range of LY2875358
      that may be safely administered to participants with advanced cancer. In Part A and Part A2
      of this study, escalating doses of LY2875358 as monotherapy and in combination with erlotinib
      will be evaluated for safety and tolerability, respectively. Part B is a dose-confirmation
      segment for LY2875358 therapy in 5 different types of cancer: nonsquamous non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC), castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with bone metastases, renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or uveal melanoma with liver metastases, and
      for LY2875358 in combination with trametinib in participants with uveal melanoma with liver
      metastases.
