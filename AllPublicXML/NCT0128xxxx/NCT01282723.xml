      This multi-reader multi-case study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL® EMG
      Labor Monitor® (SureCALL®)to the predicate Tocodynamometer device (TOCO) using the
      performance of an Intrauterine Pressure Catheter device (IUPC) as the &quot;gold standard&quot;.

      The SureCALL® EMG Labor Monitor® (SureCALL®)is a transabdominal electromyography monitor
      intended to measure intrapartum uterine activity. It is intended for use on term pregnant
      women who are in labor, with singleton pregnancies, using surface electrodes on the maternal
      abdomen. The device is intended for use by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting.

      This multi-reader multi-case study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL® to
      the predicate Tocodynamometer device (TOCO) using the performance of an Intrauterine Pressure
      Catheter device (IUPC) as the &quot;gold standard&quot;.

      This study involved 20 women at term, in labor, at three clinical sites. Each study subject
      was instrumented with three technologies for measuring uterine activity:

        1. a tocodynamometer attached to the maternal abdomen

        2. a set of abdominal surface electrodes for uterine electromyography, and

        3. an intrauterine pressure catheter.

      An assessment was obtained and quantified from masked, qualified clinical obstetrician
      readers for the evaluation of the equivalence of the three independent labor monitor devices
      by identifying in isolation the individual uterine contraction signals and the peak of each
      contraction signal produced by a full-term patient in term labor as independently collected
      by each labor monitor device.

    <description>The presence of contractions measured by the SureCALL®, the presence of contractions measured by the TOCO, and the presence of contractions measured by the IUPC were determined by independent Readers. The Odds Ratio of SureCALL® contractions to IUPC contractions was calculated, and the Odd Ratio of TOCO contractions to IUPC contractions was calculated. Reader Correspondence was determined by a General Linear Mixed Model.</description>
