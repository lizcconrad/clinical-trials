    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the clinical study is to determine the safety of a modified stem cell
      SB623 when administered to chronic, stable ischemic stroke patients. A second purpose is to
      determine whether SB623 might improve stroke symptoms. Chronic, stable ischemic stroke
      patients must be between 6 and 60 months after their stroke, and with only this one prior
      stroke, and and with no further improvement from physical therapy.

    <textblock>
      Chronic, stable stroke patients have no existing alternative treatments after rehabilitation
      therapy. SB623, a modified stem cell preparation, has been shown to improve motor function
      when administered in animal models of stable stroke. Safety studies in animals have shown no
      adverse events attributed to SB623. Patients who meet the entry criteria for this study will
      have regular examinations, radiological evaluations (CT, MRI, PET), and be followed for two
      years. Regular neurological evaluations will also be done using standard questionnaires, with
      occasional video recording if improvements are evident. Key entry criteria for this study, in
      addition to 6-60 months post-ischemic stroke, include moderately severe symptoms--e.g.,
      difficulty standing or walking, and/or difficulty using arms or hands, and/or speech
      impediments.

    <measure>Improvement in stroke symptoms and brain metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Two Years</time_frame>
    <description>Possible improvement in stroke symptoms will be determined by a variety of neurological assessments: European Stroke Scale, NIH Stroke Scale, Modified Rankin Score, and Fugl-Meyer assessment. Possible improvement in brain metabolism will be assessed using FDG-PET scans.</description>

    <description>SB623, a modified stem-cell product, will be administered at 3 dose levels. Each patient in one of three groups will be given a dose of 2.5, 5.0, or 10 million cells once. Each group will be completed before going to the next higher-dose group.</description>
