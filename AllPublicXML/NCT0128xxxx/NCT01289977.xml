    <textblock>
      Sand flies can carry the infection leishmaniasis (a parasite). The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the human immune response to uninfected laboratory raised sand fly bites and
      select from the immune response to sand fly saliva, possible substances to use for a future
      vaccine to protect against the parasite leishmaniasis.

    <textblock>
      Based on travel history and possible exposure, subjects were entered into one of 2 arms, Ph.
      dubosqui or Lu. lutzomyia controlled sand fly repeated feedings. At baseline a pheresis was
      done to collect baseline cells. Subjects received sand fly bites on a q2 week schedule for 2
      months followed by a q2 months schedule for one year. They had an option to extend for a late
      recall feeding at 18 months, when a skin biopsy was performed 48 hours after sand fly bites.
      Currently the study is fully enrolled and all human subject contact is complete. We
      (laboratory at NIAID) are studying the humoral, cellular immune responses using blood
      samples, and cytokine expression in the skin biopsy samples.

    <measure>Human Th1 immune response to specific sand fly salivary proteins</measure>
    <time_frame>6-18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subject blood will be obtained at set points after repeated controlled sand fly feedings, duration for 20 minutes. Sand fly salivary molecules that demonstrate a strong Th1 immune response in these human PBMC, and little Th2 cytokine induction will be considered for development as future leishmania vaccine antigen candidates.</description>
