      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of golimumab in Chinese male
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), open-label (both the physician
      and subject know the assigned study medication) study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      immune response, pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug), of golimumab (Simponi).
      The study population will consist of 24 healthy male participants in China. Subjects will
      receive a single dose of either 50 mg or 100 mg golimumab. Subjects will be in the study for
      up to 14 weeks. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study and include
      obtaining and evaluating laboratory tests, vital signs (eg, blood pressure), and the
      occurrence and severity of adverse events. A single dose of 50 mg or 100 mg golimumab as a
      subcutaneous injection.
