    <textblock>
      The trend is changed by a large number of low-cost computers, large-capacity computing power,
      and the rapid advent of network bandwidth. From the Internet to the WWW to Web2.0, the
      technology in addition brings impact on economic, social, and technological, but also on
      medical education about knowledge delivery globally and learning patterns.

      Currently, many scholars start to take the affection of social network seriously. In the
      medical field, ECGpedia is the typical successful example. There are more than 250,000
      members from 188 different countries in the website. On the other hand, the effect of data
      computing and transition improve the development of Gigapixel image presentation. For
      example, users can zoom in and zoom out on GoogleMap. The research team has being worked on
      this kind of search engine on pathology and anatomy slides in past three years. For education
      purpose, students can observe slides by using a virtual microscope directly.

      This research will target on establishing a Clinical Dermatopathology Online Discourse System
      (iSlide). It will combine a virtual microscope platform and a biopsy diagnosis eLearning
      System. This survey will be focused on evaluating of this platform. The object is all interns
      in dermatopathology department at Wan Fang Hospital this semester. All the new physicians can
      learn from experienced experts. Users who have questions can search for help from others via
      this website. They can get assistance by thinking procedure learning model -scheme inductive
      and pattern recognition. In doing so, clinicians and pathologists can discuss with each other
      through this system. It also can improve the education and research development in this
      field.
