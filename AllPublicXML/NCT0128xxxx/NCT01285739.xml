      The purpose of this study was to determine occurrence of ventilator associated pneumonia
      (VAP) in tracheostomized patients with COPD discharged in invasive mechanical ventilation
      (IMV) compared to patients with CPOPD discharged with tracheostomy but in non invasive
      mechanical ventilation (NIMV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure due to COPD is often treated with invasive mechanical ventilation
      through endotracheal intubation, followed by placement of a endotracheal canula. However,
      invasive ventilation is at risk of infective complications and is difficult to manage at
      home. In particular, invasive mechanical ventilation may be associated with ventilator
      associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is usually suspected when the individual develops a new or
      progressive infiltrate on chest radiograph, leukocytosis, and purulent tracheobronchial
      secretions. When possible, we tried to put these tracheotomized patients in non invasive
      mechanical ventilation (NIMV)to avoid VAP. This population was followed for eight consecutive
      years and compared with patients in invasive home mechanical ventilation (IMV).

    <description>VAP is usually suspected when the individual develops a new or progressive infiltrate on chest radiograph, leukocytosis, and purulent tracheobronchial secretions. Therefore white cell blood (WBC)count, procalcitonine (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and tracheobronchial aspirate (TBA) were collected every 6 months. Chest X ray was performed only when a clinical suspect of VAP was advanced.</description>

        Cohort was selected from patients admitted to Weaning Center. Patients weaned from invasive
        mechanical ventilation but who needed to keep endotracheal canula were enrolled for the
        study. Patients with COPD, tracheostomized and in domiciliary invasive mechanical
        ventilation was the control group.
