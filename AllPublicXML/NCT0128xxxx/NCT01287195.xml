      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of orally delivered short-term OKT3 in
      participants with active ulcerative colitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease of unknown etiology characterized by
      infiltration of inflammatory cells into the intestinal tract. OKT3 is an approved drug for
      intravenous use in the treatment of solid-organ transplantation. However, intravenous dosing
      has been limited by significant toxicities. Data from animal models suggest that antibody
      recognizing the T3 antigen complex Cluster of Differentiation 3 (anti-CD3) administered via
      the oral route is effective at treating a variety of autoimmune diseases. No side effects
      were observed in a recent phase I study of healthy participants receiving oral anti-CD3
      monoclonal antibody (mAb).

      The objectives of the current study are to assess the safety, immunologic effects and
      efficacy of short-term oral administration of OKT3 in participants with active ulcerative
      colitis. OKT3 will be delivered orally as a 1 milligram (mg) or 2 mg dose with Omeprazole 20
      mg daily for 30 consecutive days in an open-label pilot trial. Thirty two participants will
      be screened for a targeted completion of 16 enrolled participants. The participants will be
      evaluated at baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, week 3, as well as after completion of therapy
      at week 5 and 10 after the initiation of treatment. Lab tests will be performed at screening,
      baseline, day 2, week 1, week 3, week 5 and week 10. Clinical data will be collected at all
      study visits and via diary entries throughout the study period. A flexible sigmoidoscopy will
      be done at baseline and at week 5. Stool studies will be performed at screening to rule out
      infection.

      To be eligible for this study, participants must be between the ages of 18 and 65 years and
      have a history of moderately to severely active UC as defined by a Mayo score of 6 to 12.
      They may not be taking concurrent biologic or immunomodulator therapy for UC.

    <time_frame>From baseline to Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Biomarker-positive Immune Cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were (PBMCs) were isolated from blood samples taken from each participant at baseline and Week 5. PBMCs were stained with a panel of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against multiple surface and intracellular biomarkers, including Cluster of Differentiation (CD) 3, CD4, CD8, Forkhead box P3 protein (FOXP3) and latency-associated peptide (LAP). The percentage of T cells positive for each of these biomarkers was determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and the mean percentage of positive T cells for each biomarker for all analyzed participants is reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 3 and 5</time_frame>
    <description>PBMCs isolated from whole blood obtained from participants at baseline, Weeks 1, 3, and 5 were assessed for proliferation in cell culture using a radioactive thymidine incorporation assay. A higher number indicates a higher level of proliferation.</description>

    <measure>Cytokine Production by PBMCs in Cell Culture</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 3 and 5</time_frame>
    <description>Cytokine production was assessed in cell cultures of PBMCs obtained from participants at baseline, Weeks 1, 3 and 5. The following cytokines were detected and are reported here: interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Mayo Score is determined by the investigator by assigning a score to the following four assessments: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician's global assessment and endoscopy. Total range for Mayo score is 0-12 with a higher score indicating a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>SCCAI is a symptom based questionnaire addressing five assessments, including bowel frequency day, bowel frequency night, urgency of defecation, blood in stool and general well-being. Score ranges from 0-15 with one additional point added for each manifestation of extracolonic features. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <description>Cytokine production was assessed in cell cultures of PBMCs obtained from participants at baseline, Weeks 1, 3 and 5. The following cytokines were detected and are reported here: interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-10.</description>
