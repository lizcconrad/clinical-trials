    <textblock>
      Medical management of central hypothyroidism is controversial due to lack of reference for
      evaluation of pituitary negative feedback. Therefore, titration of medical treatment is based
      on T4 levels, measured with variable laboratory methods. Patients who have central
      hypothyroidism usually have concomitant deficiencies in other pituitary hormones for which
      they need replacement therapy such as steroids, testosterone and growth hormone. This
      combined hormone deficiency makes clinical and laboratory evaluation challenging among these
      patients. Symptomatically, central hypothyroidism is relatively mild and lack non-specific
      and it might be overlooked due to other hormonal deficiencies. Replacement therapy for
      central hypothyroidism is titrated by arbitrary target free T4 levels of above 50th
      percentile of normal. The goal of our study is to compare the standard results from well
      known measure methods to a new method for measuring Ft4 using Liquid chromatography - tandem
      mass spectrometry.
