  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, two-arm study conducted in
      subjects receiving chemoradiation therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer to assess
      the efficacy of MuGard. The study will evaluate the ability of MuGard to reduce the symptoms
      of oral mucositis. The study includes a treatment period of approximately 7 weeks depending
      on the subject's prescribed radiation plan.

      MuGard is a liquid that is classified as a medical device. It is a hydrated polymer system
      (oral hydrogel) and is intended for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis. When gently
      distributed within the mouth, the mucoadhesive formulation results in the formation of a
      protective coating over the oral mucosa. Subjects undergoing chemotherapy with radiation for
      the treatment of head and neck cancer are at high risk of developing oral mucositis as an
      adverse side-effect of cancer treatment. MuGard was previously shown to reduce the incidence
      and severity of mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy when
      compared with data from historical control groups. The purpose of this study is to perform a
      direct comparison of the effectiveness of MuGard with a control group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be included in the study if they:

             study approved by the Investigator's local or a central Institutional Review Board
             (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)

          2. Are males or females aged 18 years or older

          3. Have recently-diagnosed, pathologically-confirmed cancer of the head and neck (e.g.,
             oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx; nasopharynx, lips, sinuses, salivary
             glands, or unknown primary)that will be treated with CRT (with or without induction
             therapy prior to CRT)
