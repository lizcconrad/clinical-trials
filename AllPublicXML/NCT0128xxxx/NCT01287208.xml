    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to test an intervention to increase the physical activity
      of medical residents, an employee population with little time for exercise. Specifically, the
      aims of this study are:

        1. To determine if providing medical residents with an activity device that measures steps,
           distance, and calories burned and tracks this information over time on a website
           increases residents' physical activity levels as measured by number of steps per day
           compared to a control group using a blinded activity device (no feedback).

        2. To determine if an unblinded team competition using the activity device directly
           following the randomized phase increases residents' activity level compared to baseline.

        3. To determine if activity level is associated with change in weight during the residency
           year.

        4. To determine if the average hours of sleep per week is associated with changes in weight
           and with activity level.
