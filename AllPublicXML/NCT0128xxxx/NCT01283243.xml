  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort single center study for assessment of normal value of acoustic
      radiation force impulse elastography and fibroscan in HIV patients without abnormal liver
      function and chronic liver disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV positive patients who have liver dysfunction have shown to be correlated with high
      mortality and morbidity. To date, ARFI elastography has been known to correlate with the
      degree of liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease. However, ARFI velocity has not yet been
      reported in HIV patients. The aim of this study was to identify the normal range of ARFI
      velocity and liver stiffness value by recruiting HIV patients without abnormal liver function
      and chronic liver disease.

    <description>Measurement of ARFI velocity is non-invsive ultrasonographic technique. It is performed with a abdominal convex probe which is same probe as conventional ultrasonography. Short-duration acoustic radiation forces result in shear-wave propagation away from the region of excitation and are tracked using ultrasonic correlation-based methods. This results are called ARFI velocity which is expressed as meters per second</description>

    <description>Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging were measured 10 times in each patient.The region of interest was chosen in an area where the normal liver parenchyma was at least 6 cm thick and free of large blood vessels was chosen. A measurement depth of 2 cm below the liver capsule was chosen to standardize the examination.</description>
