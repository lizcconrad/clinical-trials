  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase regular physical activity among students by
      fostering self-management competencies. The intervention was implemented as paper-pencil
      intervention. The aim of this research project is to evaluate a motivational and volitional
      intervention in comparison to a control intervention.

      Study participants will be recruited in lectures at Freie Universitaet Berlin and followed up
      twice (two and ten weeks after baseline).

      The motivational intervention is expected to increase unmotivated participants' intention to
      be physically active. The volitional intervention is expected to promote physical activity
      among motivated but inactive participants. Both interventions are hypothesized to improve
      self-management competencies over time.

      An experimental study is planned over a time period of ten weeks. In the physical activity
      study, participants will randomly be allocated to either one of two intervention groups (IG)
      or to an active control group (ACG), receiving a quiz on physical activity and sports.
      Intervention group 1 receives a paper-pencil intervention which focuses on positive outcome
      expectancies (motivational intervention). Intervention group 2 receives a paper-pencil
      intervention which promotes the formulation of action plans for physical activity (volitional
      intervention).

      Furthermore, all participants will receive two emails as intervention boosters until the end
      of the study.

      Study participants will be invited to take part in the study during lectures of the Freie
      Universitaet Berlin. The students will be followed up twice: two weeks after T1
      (paper-pencil), T2 will take place (paper-pencil). Eight weeks after T2 the T3 assessment
      will be conducted online.

      The hypotheses are:

      Participants of the motivational intervention report a larger increase in motivation to adopt
      physical activity from T1 to T2 and T3, as compared to the participants of the volitional or
      the control intervention. Effects will be larger in unmotivated participants than in already
      motivated participants.

      Participants of the volitional intervention report a larger increase in physical activity
      from T1 to T2 and T3, as compared to the participants of the motivational or the control
      intervention. Effects will be larger in motivated participants than in unmotivated
      participants.
