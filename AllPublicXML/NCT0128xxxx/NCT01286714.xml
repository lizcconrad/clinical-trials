    <textblock>
      Anastomotic fistula following bariatric surgery are lifethreatening complication with a 37.5%
      mortality rate. All the modalities for bariatric surgery are involved in this type of
      complication, but Sleeve gastrectomy is the main surgery responsible for the frequency and
      the severity of the fistula. The management of this complication is still controversial and
      potentially lethal. The average number of endoscopic sessions was 4 (range 2-11). The closure
      could be obtained within a mean time of 88 days (range 6-216 days). Therefore endoscopic
      management has to be improved to reduce the duration of the treatment and the number of
      endoscopic sessions. OTSC clips could help to improve the endoscopic management because of a
      more prehensive, deeper and larger suture area.
