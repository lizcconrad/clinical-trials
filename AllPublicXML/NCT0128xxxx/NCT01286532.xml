        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Child (male or female) aged 5 to 11 years inclusive

          -  The child must be included in an out-patient observation program at a medical
             institution for established bronchial asthma diagnosis for at least 1 year prior to
             enrolment and diagnosed with moderate to severe bronchial asthma at the time of
             enrolment

          -  The child must have at least one documented bronchial asthma exacerbation in previous
             1 year (including hospital admissions for bronchial asthma exacerbations, any cases of
             daytime hospital treatment without overnight stays and any cases of oral
             administration of glucocorticoids on an out-patient basis for &gt; 3 consecutive days)

          -  Out-patient receiving step 3 controller treatments with fixed dose combinations of
             ICSs and LABA or treatment with separate administration of glucocorticoids and LABA in
             stable doses with adequate control of bronchial asthma symptoms

          -  The patient administered with short-acting β2 agonists (inhalational) or rapidly
             released methylxanthines (oral) in the doses approved for the respective age as a
             rescue on-demand therapies during the preceding month

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cystic fibrosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency or congenital abnormalities of lung
             development

          -  Severe comorbidities affecting the patient's overall performance

          -  In the physician's opinion, the patient is not able to comply with the protocol
             requirements

          -  Expected specific hyposensibilization within next 6 months

          -  Expected treatment at health resort facilities within next 6 months

          -  Other reasons that in the physician's opinion will prevent reliable assessments of the
             study treatment efficacy
