      Main objective : This project aims to have a better understanding of the influence of
      representations of patients with mucoviscidosis, their assistants and their medical persons
      in the choice of patients to accept or not lung transplantation.

      Specific objectives :

        1. Identify the knowledge, representations, or feelings of patients which could constitute
           bridles or factors of motivation to use for transplantation.

        2. Identify the knowledge, representations, or feelings of medical persons which could
           constitute bridles or factors of motivation to the &quot;encouraging&quot; proposal to patients of
           lung transplant.

        3. Identify the knowledge, representations, or feelings of assistants which could
           constitute bridles or factors of motivation to the &quot;encouragement&quot; of lung
           transplantation at its close.

        4. Identify the needs of patients, assistants and medical persons to successfully reduce
           these bridles to transplantation and increase the factors of motivation.

        5. Compare the representations of patients, assistants and medical persons

        6. Search representations associated with patients who refuse the transplantation and those
           who accept the transplantation

    <description>A pre-test with 5 medical persons and 5 persons without mucoviscidosis will be realized to adjust the tools and place of the interview.
To collect analyzable data for 30 patients, 40 patients will be included in the study. A conceptual card will be associated to a semi-structured interviews to gather information.Two subgroups will be considered in th a analysis :
1st sub-group : After the announcement of the transplant indication by the doctor and before the consultation in the transplant centre.
2nd subgroup : After the consultation in the transplant centre but before the inscription on the waiting list. The analysis of conceptual cards in these two subgroups will permit to study the differences between the representations of patients before and after the consultation in the transplant centre.
Realize a 2nd interview on the same principle with all patients, 1 year after their lung transplantation.</description>
