  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in Korea. Having achieved excellent
      long-term survival for early gastric cancer patients, there is a growing interest in
      improving the quality of life of these patients without compromising their prognosis.
      Laparoscopic surgery for early gastric cancer have been found to be safe and feasible with
      superior short-term outcomes. Although laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is
      being performed for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer; the completeness of the D2
      lymphadenectomy during laparoscopic surgery has not been evaluate and no standardized
      procedure exists. To conduct a clinical trial comparing laparoscopic D2 lymphadenectomy to
      the open approach, quality control of D2 lymphadenectomy procedure is necessary.

    <description>The commonly practice laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer involves a partial omentectomy+D1+b lymphadenectomy which includes the dissection of Lymph node stations 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8a, 9; however, when performing a D2 lymph node dissection, a total omentectomy plus LN1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8a, 9, 12a retrieval will be completed. The same total omentectomy+D2 lymphadenectomy will also be performed by the open method.</description>
