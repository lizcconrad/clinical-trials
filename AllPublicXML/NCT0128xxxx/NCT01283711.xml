  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive, energy-based, aesthetic treatments are becoming increasingly popular among
      female and male patients of all ages. Different technologies are presently available to
      rejuvenate skin, including therapeutic ultrasound, lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL),
      however radiofrequency has emerged as the most effective and versatile modality for the
      broadest range of body and facial treatments, including non-invasive wrinkle treatment.

      The apollo™ system is an RF system, based on the TriPollar™ technology. The technology is
      based on three or more electrodes designed to deliver RF current focused into the skin, thus
      generating heat in the dermal layer. Selective and focused electro-heating of the skin is
      intended to stimulate collagen remodeling in the dermal layer resulting in non invasive
      wrinkle treatment.

      The apollo™ system is intended for use in dermatologic and general surgical procedures for
      non invasive treatment of facial wrinkles and rhytides. This study was designed in order to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Apollo™ System for facial wrinkles and rhytides
      treatments.
