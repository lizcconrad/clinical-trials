  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section (C/S) is an operation most commonly performed in Obstetrics and Gynecology
      Clinics. Complications related with incomplete healing of Kerr uterine incision after C/S
      (adhesions, separation (dehiscence), endometritis, endometriosis, anomalous placentation in
      subsequent pregnancies, incomplete or complete uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies,
      ...) are very important issues. Classically Kerr incision is repaired with continuous locked
      suturing. Purse string suturing of Kerr incision may reduce the size of the incision and in
      turn may reduce short and long term complications. For this reason, the investigators aimed
      to compare two closure techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the clinic, patients undergoing cesarean section that meet the criteria for inclusion into
      the study and agreed to participate in the study will be randomized into two groups
      (computer-assisted randomization method will be used.) In the first group of patients
      classical closure method of Kerr incision(double layered continuously locked suturing) will
      be used. In the second group of patients double layered purse string closure technique will
      be used.

      Women will be followed for a subsequent pregnancy in the next 4 years. If they become
      pregnant again they will be followed up during pregnancy for comparison of long-term effects
      of the two suture techniques. Patients will be followed especially from the aspects of
      placental anomalies. Presence of intra-abdominal adhesions, uterine dehiscence, placenta
      previa, placental invasion anomalies (eg, placenta accreta and others)and incomplete or
      complete rupture will be compared between two groups.
