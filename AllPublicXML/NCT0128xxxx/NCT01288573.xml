  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site study with plerixafor in pediatric cancer patients. The study will be
      conducted in 2 stages:

        -  Stage 1 is a dose-escalation study.

        -  Stage 2 is an open-label, randomized, comparative study using the appropriate dosing
           regimen identified in the Stage 1 dose-escalation study.

      All participating patients will receive a standard mobilization regimen as per study site
      practice guidelines (either chemotherapy plus once daily granulocyte-colony stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) or once daily G-CSF alone). The only change to the standard mobilization
      regimen is the addition of plerixafor treatment prior to apheresis for all patients in Stage
      1 (dose escalation), and for those patients randomized to the plerixafor plus standard
      mobilization treatment arm in Stage 2 (randomized, comparative).

      Stage 1 will enroll at least 27 patients. Stage 2 will enroll at least 40 patients.

             during the study up until engraftment of the transplant. If patients are on
             investigational drugs as part of their anti-cancer regimen, this should be discussed
             with the Sponsor before screening. Drugs approved for other indications that are being
             used in a manner considered standard of care for this transplant procedure are allowed

          -  The patient (and/or their parent/legal guardian), in the opinion of the Investigator,
