  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum levels of inflammatory mediators increase with age and are strongly associated with the
      most common and the most devastating health conditions found in older adults including
      frailty, chronic disease, disability and increased mortality. Even though the processes that
      contribute to increased inflammatory mediators are likely not completely reversible in older
      adults, the development of a safe and effective intervention that modulates inappropriate
      inflammatory responses could be a very important component of prevention against frailty and
      other adverse health outcomes. As part of an ongoing effort to identify molecular and
      physiologic triggers of inflammation in older adults, the investigators recently identified a
      highly significant inverse relationship between the anti-oxidant micronutrient selenium and
      the inflammatory mediator IL-6, as well as a significant relationship between selenium and
      all cause mortality in a population of community dwelling older women with selenium levels
      well below the mean for the overall American population. Based on our findings in older
      adults and on data from other studies that suggest that selenium interventions are effective
      in targeted populations with inflammatory conditions, the investigators hypothesize that
      selenium supplementation targeted to a population of older adults with increased inflammatory
      markers and low normal selenium levels will in the short term reduce inflammation as measured
      by serum IL-6, and in the long term will reduce the incidence and prevalence of inflammation
      associated poor health outcomes of frailty, disability, and mortality in vulnerable older
      adults.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effects of oral selenium supplementation on the inflammatory response in older adults with an increased IL-6 level and low normal selenium levels over an 8 week intervention period.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serum Interleukin 6 (IL6)will be measured at baseline and every 2 weeks for the 8 weeks of the study using a standard, commercially available ELISA kit. Serum Selenium levels will also be measured at baseline and every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. The investigators hypothesize that as serum selenium levels increase with supplementation there will be a statistically significant decrease in serum IL6. IL6 levels should remain unchanged over 8 weeks in those taking the placebo.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effects of selenium supplementation on the activity of the selenium- dependent antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and on altered protein production in older adults with increased serum IL-6 and low normal levels of selenium.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Glutathione peroxidase will be measured at baseline and at week 8. Glucose, Vitamin B-12, folate, methionine, and albumin will be measured in serum drawn at baseline and every 2 weeks for the 8 weeks of the study. the investigators hypothesize that levels of glutathione peroxidase and proteins may change significantly in participants taking selenium. There should be no significant changes in these parameters in those taking the placebo.</description>
