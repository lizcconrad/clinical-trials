  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subclinical urogenital infections have been implicated in up to 70% of adverse pregnancy
      outcome, especially preterm labor and delivery. The most prevalent microorganisms involved in
      intrauterine infections are urogenital Mycoplasmas. Diagnosis by culturing or PCR merely
      detect the presence of the bacteria, pointing to colonized carriers only. There is no
      efficient and reliable diagnostic test to identify those subjects that have developed an
      infectious disease and are at risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcome.

      In order to identify women at risk for developing pregnancy complications, Promyco
      Diagnostics has developed a proprietary, simple and non-invasive serology diagnostic kit for
      the detection of urogenital Mycoplasma infection.

      Preterm labor and delivery are the major causes of peri-natal mortality and morbidity,
      accounting for 9-13% of all births, and associated with over 75% of infant mortality.

      Subclinical urogenital infections have been implicated in up to 70% of adverse pregnancy
      outcome, especially preterm labor and delivery . The most prevalent microorganisms involved
      in intrauterine infections are urogenital Mycoplasmas. These bacteria are frequently found in
      the lower genital tract of sexually active men and women and are often considered as normal
      flora. However, Mycoplasma can spread and colonize the internal membranes and elicit an
      inflammatory response in the uterus initiating the cascade of events leading to precipitous
      delivery. It may also cause additional pregnancy complications such as chorioamnionitis,
      recurrent spontaneous abortions and postpartum endometritis.

      Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microbial culturing or PCR, merely detect the
      presence of the bacteria, pointing to colonized carriers only. There is no efficient and
      reliable diagnostic test to identify those subjects that have developed an infectious disease
      and are at risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcome.

      Studies show that colonization of the cervix or amniotic fluid alone cannot accurately
      predict pregnancy complications. In contrast, identification of antibodies to Mycoplasma in
      colonized women predicted an outstanding 85-90% of low birth weight or preterm delivery
      respectively.

      In order to identify women at risk for developing pregnancy complications, Promyco
      Diagnostics has developed a proprietary, simple and non-invasive serology diagnostic kit for
      the detection of urogenital Mycoplasma infection.
