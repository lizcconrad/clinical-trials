  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, it has become clear, that also in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a
      group of patients with less than 5 distant metastases may experience long-term survival when
      treated radically to all macroscopic cancer sites. Thus has mostly been established for
      individuals with so-called solitary brain metastases and to a lesser extend in solitary
      adrenal gland metastases, but in other metastatic subgroups, the same may be applicable. In a
      prospective survey in the region of the Integral Cancercentre (IKL), we could identify on a
      yearly base 30 patients with NSCLC who could theoretically be amendable for radical treatment
      of all oligo-metastatic locations. We therefore want to perform a prospective study in which
      patients with less than 4 oligo-metastatic sites from a primary NSCLC will be treated
      radically with the aim to improve long-term survival. As many discussion points remain, even
      after thorough discussions with chest physicians, pulmonary surgeons and colleagues from
      diagnostic disciplines, we decided to go for a pragmatic approach, implying that all
      macroscopic disease sites should be treated radically, being defined as surgery with a R0
      resection or in case of an unforeseen R1 resection, followed by radiotherapy, or radiotherapy
      to a biological equivalent of at least 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions. In the same patient, one
      metastatic site may be treated with surgery and another with radical radiotherapy. Systemic
      treatment was not made mandatory, because it was felt that it's role is unclear in patients
      with early stage local cancer and with oligo-metastatic disease.

      Eligible patients (see below) will receive radical radiotherapy to the primary tumor and the
      initially involved mediastinal lymph nodes to an MLD (Mean Lung Dose) of 20 +/- 1Gy,
      irrespective of lung function and/or to all metastatic sites to a minimal biological
      equivalent of 60Gy in 30 daily fractions. This may be delivered with hypofractionated
      stereotactic techniques or with other more protracted fractionation regimen.

      Both the primary tumor, the regional N1 lymph nodes and the oligo-metastatic site(s) may be
      treated with surgery, as long as an R0 resection is deemed possible. Systemic treatment is
      not required, but should be given according to the local extend of the tumor.

      Local radiotherapy will be delivered according to the protocol of MAASTRO clinic for that
      anatomical site.

      Other dose-constraints: spinal cord max: 54Gy, brachial plexus (Dmax): 66Gy The radiation
      doses will be specified according to ICRU 50. Lung density corrections will be applied, as
      well as all standard QA procedures. Technical requirements are the same as in standard
      practice at MAASTRO clinic.
