    <textblock>
      The study is a global Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab administered
      subcutaneously as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult patients aged
      12-75 who have been diagnosed with refractory CIU and who remain symptomatic despite
      standard-dose H1 antihistamine treatment.

      Type I Error Rate Control Plan

      Primary Outcome Measure

      In order to maintain an overall type I error rate of 0.05 (2-sided) across the 3 omalizumab
      dose levels, the testing of the primary Outcome Measure was conducted in the following
      hierarchical order. A p-value &lt; 0.05 is only considered statistically significant if
      statistical significance was claimed at the previous stage.

        -  Stage 1: Omalizumab 300-mg group vs. placebo

        -  Stage 2: Omalizumab 150-mg group vs. placebo

        -  Stage 3: Omalizumab 75-mg group vs. placebo

      Secondary Outcome Measures

      A hierarchical analysis of the following secondary Outcome Measures was performed for each
      dose found to be significant in the primary Outcome Measure. A p-value &lt; 0.05 is only
      considered statistically significant if statistical significance was claimed at the previous
      stage.

        -  Stage 1: Change from baseline to Week 12 in the urticaria activity score over 7 days
           (UAS7)

        -  Stage 2: Change from Baseline to Week 12 in the weekly number of hives score

        -  Stage 3: Time to minimally important difference (MID) response in the weekly itch
           severity score by Week 12

        -  Stage 4: Percentage of participants with a UAS7 score ≤ 6 at Week 12

        -  Stage 5: Percentage of weekly itch severity score MID responders at Week 12

        -  Stage 6: Change from Baseline to Week 12 in the weekly size of the largest hive score

        -  Stage 7: Change from Baseline in the overall dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score
           at Week 12

        -  Stage 8: Change from Baseline in the overall dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score
           at Week 12

        -  Stage 9: Percentage of complete responders (UAS7 = 0) at Week 12

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Urticaria Activity Score Over 7 Days (UAS7)</title>
        <description>The UAS7 is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 42. The daily urticarial activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticarial activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticarial activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticarial activity score indicates more urticaria activity. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Weekly Number of Hives Score</title>
        <description>The weekly hives score is the sum of the daily hives scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The number of hives is measured twice daily (morning and evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (&gt; 12 hives per 12 hours). The daily hives score is the average of the morning and evening scores. The Baseline score is the sum of the daily hives scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher score indicates more hives. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a UAS7 Score ≤ 6 at Week 12</title>
        <description>The UAS7 is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 42. The daily urticarial activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticarial activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticarial activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticarial activity score indicates more urticaria activity.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a UAS7 Score ≤ 6 at Week 12</title>
          <description>The UAS7 is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 42. The daily urticarial activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticarial activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticarial activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticarial activity score indicates more urticaria activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in the Weekly Size of the Largest Hive Score</title>
        <description>The weekly size of the largest hive score is the sum of the daily size of the largest hive scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily size of the largest hive score is assessed twice daily (morning and evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (&gt; 2.5 cm). The daily size of the largest hive score is the average of the morning and evening scores. The Baseline weekly size of the largest hive score is calculated over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher score indicates larger hives. A negative change score indicates a reduction in hive size.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item dermatology-specific health-related quality of life measure. Patients rated their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Very much). The overall DLQI is the sum of the responses to the 10 items and ranges from 0 to 30. A lower score indicates a better quality of life. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
