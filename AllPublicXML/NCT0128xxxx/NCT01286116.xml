      The primary objective is to assess the safety of the CardioKinetix Parachute Implant and
      Delivery System in the partitioning of the left ventricle in patients with heart failure due
      to ischemic heart disease.

      While current therapies for heart failure (including but not limited to: medical management,
      cardiac resynchronization and ICDs) may represent the best treatment available today for the
      majority of HF patients, the medical community recognizes that pharmacologic therapy has been
      optimized to nearly the extent that is possible, and that any incremental improvements in the
      management of HF patients will now come from device based therapies. With this background,
      CardioKinetix has developed a catheter-based intravascular approach to ventricular
      partitioning using an implantable device. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety
      of using the CardioKinetix Parachute device to isolate the malfunctioning portion of the left
      ventricle in patients with symptoms of HF due to ischemic heart disease.
