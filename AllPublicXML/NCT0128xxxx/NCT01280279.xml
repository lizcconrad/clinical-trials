  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have reported the efficacy of repetitive education for behavioral modification as
      the first-line therapy for patients with nocturnal polyuria (NPU). The aim of this study is
      to investigate the efficacy of repetitive education for behavioral modification as the
      first-line therapy in the patients with NPU and to show whether a single education for
      behavioral modification is sufficient for the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even though behavioral modification therapy seems to be effective, it is not usually
      recommended for patients with nocturia because much patience and understanding is required
      for the patients to follow the therapy. Few studies have reported the efficacy of repetitive
      education for behavioral modification as the first-line therapy for patients with nocturia
      and nocturnal polyuria (NPU). Furthermore, no report demonstrated the evidence about how many
      times or how long the education for behavioral therapy should be performed and how long will
      the education effect would continue. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of
      repetitive education for behavioral modification as the first-line therapy in the patients
      with NPU and to show whether a single education for behavioral modification is sufficient for
      the patients.

    <description>The variables of FVC were prospectively collected at the time of the first visit using frequency-volume chart (FVC) for 2 days. On their second visit two weeks later, if they had nocturnal polyuria, they received the first education for behavioral modification and to fill up FVC again. When they had no improvement of nocturnal polyuria on the third visit one month later, they finally received the second education and they were recommended to fill up the FVC.</description>
