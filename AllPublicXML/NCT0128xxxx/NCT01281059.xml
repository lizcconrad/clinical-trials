  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Exalenz clinical investigation is a multicenter, non-randomized, blinded, study of the
      ¹³C-Octanaote breath test (OBT). The OBT is a non-invasive test for evaluation of disease
      severity in patients with suspected non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) The purpose of
      the study is to demonstrate that the ¹³C-Octanaote Breath Test (OBT) can be used as an aid,
      in conjunction with other clinical information and medical history, for evaluating disease
      severity and detecting non alcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH) with a high probability.

      Retrospective analysis based on multivariable analysis will determined if and which
      demographic, clinical and biochemical or imaging techniques data can assist in addition to
      the data derived from OBT in differentiation of NASH, NAFL and possibly normals.
