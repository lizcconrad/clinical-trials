      In this study the investigators will prospectively analyze the reduction of urinary oxalate
      excretion under the treatment with PLP in dosages of 5mg/kg/day up to 20 mg/kg/day and serum
      level response relationship with PLP as an i.v. solution used orally in 12 patients with
      primary hyperoxaluria type I as an inherited autosomal-recessive-disorder leading to
      increased endogenous oxalate production, urolithiasis and end stage renal disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documentation of diagnosis of PH I by any one of the following:

               -  Liver biopsy confirmation of deficient liver specific peroxisomal
                  alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase, (AGT or mislocalization of AGT from
                  peroxisomes to mitochondria)

               -  Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for a known mutation in the causative
                  gene (AGXT) for PH I

          -  Male or female subjects between 5 years and 60 years of age

          -  Renal function defined as an estimated GFR &gt; 60 ml/min normalized to 1.73 m2 body
             surface area

          -  Subjects receiving pyridoxal-phosphate before the study must be willing to discontinue
             therapy with pyridoxal-phosphate for a wash out phase of at least 4 weeks but always
             until normalization of serum pyridoxal-phosphate levels

          -  Written informed consent from patients and/or legally acceptable representatives

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are not using a highly effective contraception
             method with a pearl-index &lt; 1. Highly effective contraception methods are oral,
             transdermal, injectable, or implanted contraceptives, IUD, abstinence, or sterile
             sexual partner and must agree to continue using such precautions during the
             pyridoxal-phosphate study

          -  Subjects post liver or kidney transplantation or combined transplantation

          -  Chronic diarrhoea with the risk of malabsorption

          -  Any other abnormal finding such as physical examination or laboratory evaluation, in
             the opinion of the investigator, is indicative of a disease that would compromise the
             safety taking pyridoxal-phosphate per os and the absorption

          -  Subjects participating in other clinical trials with investigational products 4 weeks
             prior to trial entry, during the trial and 4 weeks after the trial

          -  Subjects who are unable to take the trial medication

          -  Subjects who are unable to collect 24-hour urine samples or follow other study
             procedures

          -  Subjects who are under treatment with L-Dopa, Isoniazid, D-Penicillamine (interactions
             between these drugs and pyridoxal-phosphate are known and might influence serum
             pyridoxal-phosphate levels)

          -  Subjects with known allergies to substances of contents (e.g. Potassium sorbet,
             raspberry syrup)

          -  Subjects confined to an institution on judicial or official behalf

          -  Subjects who are in dependency to the sponsor or the PI of the trial
