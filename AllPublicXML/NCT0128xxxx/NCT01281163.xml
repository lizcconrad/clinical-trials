      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of lapatinib ditosylate and Akt
      inhibitor MK2206 in treating women with metastatic breast cancer. Lapatinib ditosylate and
      Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of continuous daily administration of lapatinib
      (lapatinib ditosylate) in combination with weekly administration of MK2206 (AKT inhibitor
      MK2206) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced
      breast cancer.

      II. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and identify the maximum-tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for this administration schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK2206 and lapatinib, each given alone and in
      the combination.

      II. To evaluate potential pharmacogenetic influence of the candidate drug metabolizing
      enzymes and transporters on the PK of MK2206 and lapatinib.

      III. To evaluate the change in select breast cancer biomarkers in the phosphatase and tensin
      homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-signaling pathways, (e.g.,
      phosphorylated [p]PTEN, PTEN, pAkt, Akt, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase
      (pGSK)3-beta, GSK3-beta), Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (e.g., activated beta-catenin (ABC),
      beta-catenin), and pHER2.

      IV. To evaluate the change in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) biomarkers, aldehyde
      dehydrogenase (ALDH)1 and cluster of differentiation (CD) 44+/CD24-, before and after 2 weeks
      of treatment with the combination of MK2206 and lapatinib at the MTD. The percent change in
      BCSCs in tumor biopsies will also be evaluated.

      V. To determine tumor response in patients with measurable disease as assessed by the
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and by percent change in BCSCs within
      the tumor before vs after 2 weeks of combination treatment.

      VI. To perform genomic profiling of the tumor cell and BCSC populations before and after 2
      weeks of treatment with the combination of MK2206 and lapatinib at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by an expansion cohort study.

      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 and 15-28 of
      course 1 and on days 1-28 of subsequent courses. Patients also receive AKT inhibitor MK2206
      PO QD on days 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of subsequent courses.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             who received radiation therapy of &gt; 5% of their total marrow volume; 6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study; or those who have not

             study

          -  Patients must not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic,
             radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for
             medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an

             hyperglycemia in all preclinical species tested; patients with diabetes or at risk for
             hyperglycemia are not to be excluded from trials with MK-2206, but the hyperglycemia
             should be well controlled on oral agents before the patient enters the trial

          -  Preclinical studies indicated transient changes in corrected QT (QTc) interval during
             MK-2206 treatment; prolongation of QTc interval is potentially a safety concern while
             on MK-2206 therapy; patients with baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt;470 msec
             (female) will be excluded from entry on study; a list of medications that may cause

             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with MK-2206; these potential risks may also apply to other

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with
             intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets

          -  Patients enrolled on the MTD cohort who do not have accessible tumor or who refuse
             serial biopsies

          -  Due to a high incidence of bradycardia observed in early trials of MK-2206, patients
             with significant bundle branch block, or bradycardia related to cardiac disease,
             should be excluded from the trial
