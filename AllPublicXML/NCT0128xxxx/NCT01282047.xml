      Lenakap : This multicenter, non randomized (single arm), open, phase II study aims to
      evaluated the efficacy of Lenalidomide in HIV-associated kaposi disease. Patients will be
      followed for 48 weeks. Measurement of primary endpoint will be at 24 weeks.

      The observation period is 48 weeks. The main criteria is evaluated at 24 weeks Inclusion
      period: 72 weeks from the setting-up meeting.Lenalidomide will be stopped in the case of
      progression and the patients will be considered as drop-out from the trial, but will be taken
      into account in the final analysis.

      Two-steps procedure: 14 evaluable patients in the first step; if one response to treatment is
      observed, other patients are included up to 25 evaluable patients.
