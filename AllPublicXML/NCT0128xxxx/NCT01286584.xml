    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of varenicline compared to placebo in tobacco
      dependent individuals who are undergoing concurrent treatment for alcohol dependence. As they
      will be inpatients and under 24 hour medical care for the first 21 days of treatment, or
      receiving outpatient treatment through the Alcohol Research and Treatment Clinic, this will
      allow for a comprehensive assessment of the safety of varenicline in this population with
      minimal risk of adverse consequences. The patients will continue their cessation treatment
      for an additional 10 weeks as outpatients through the Nicotine Dependence Clinic at CAMH.
      They will also be contacted at 6 months for follow-up.

      Drinking alcohol and cigarette smoking are closely associated and use of one often leads to
      the use of the other. Also, since tobacco-related illness is the number one cause of death
      among recovered alcoholics it is imperative that we provide strong evidence-based treatment
      options for this population. Since smoking can be a strong trigger to drink in those who are
      dependent on both alcohol and tobacco, treating both at the same time may result in better
      treatment outcomes. This study will examine the efficacy of starting smoking cessation
      treatment while patients are in residential treatment for alcohol dependence, or outpatient
      in the Alcohol Research and Treatment Clinic. It will compare the effectiveness of
      varenicline, the most effective medication for smoking cessation with placebo. Both groups
      will receive weekly cessation counselling and support by a trained research analyst. We will
      measure abstinence from smoking at the end of the 12-week treatment period and again after
      6-months to determine longer-term smoking cessation.
