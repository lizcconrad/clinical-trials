  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of TMC435 compared
      with placebo in participants who are infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus who have
      never received treatment before. Participants will also receive peginterferon alpha-2a and
      ribavirin as part of their treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither physician nor participants know the name of the
      assigned drug), placebo-controlled study of TMC435 in participants who are infected with
      genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV), who have never received treatment for HCV infection
      before. Participants in this study will also receive two other drugs for their HCV infection
      called peginterferon alpha-2a (PegIFN alpha-2a) and ribavirin (RBV). The purpose of the study
      is to investigate if TMC435 is superior to placebo in reducing plasma levels of HCV
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) to an undetectable level 12 weeks after the end of treatment. For the
      first 12 weeks, participants will take either TMC435 or placebo, plus PegIFNα-2a and RBV. For
      the next 12 weeks, participants will take PegIFN alpha-2a and RBV only. After that, some
      participants will continue to take PegIFN alpha-2a and RBV for up to 24 additional weeks and
      some will stop taking PegIFN alpha-2a and RBV depending on response-guided treatment
      criteria. The study doctor will inform each participant about how to take their study
      medication and when they should stop taking it. After a participant stops taking study
      medication, they will continue to come to the doctor's office for study visits until a total
      of 72 weeks after they enroll in the study. The total duration of the study is 78 weeks
      (including screening). Participants will be monitored for safety throughout the study.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) for the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Total Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 60 and Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Study participants completed FSS questionnaires during study visits before treatment began and throughout treatment and follow-up to rate the severity and impact of fatigue they experienced in the preceding 2 weeks on their daily lives. FSS total scores are the average of nine questions with a range from 1 [no fatigue] to 7 [worst possible fatigue]. An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the overall severity of fatigue in each treatment group from baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in the amount of fatigue participants experienced throughout the study resulting in equal AUC from baseline to Week 72 (AUC72) for FSS total scores. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 60 and Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Impairment in overall work productivity was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire completed by participants during study visits throughout the study. WPAI Overall Productivity Scores ranged from 0% to 100% (higher WPAI scores indicated greater impairment in productivity). An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the overall WPAI Overall Work Productivity Scores in each treatment group from Baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in the WPAI Overall Work Productivity Scores from Baseline to Week 72. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) in WPAI Work Productivity Scores and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>

    <description>Impairment in daily activity was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire, Question 6. Scores ranged from 0 (no effect on activities) to 10 (completely prevented me from doing my daily activities). An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the impairment in daily activity scores in each treatment group from Baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in impairment in daily activity scores from Baseline to Week 72. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) in the impairment in daily activity scores and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 60 and Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Time missed from work in hours because of HCV infection or its treatment was assessed by measuring the change from baseline in the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire Absenteeism score (time missed from work, question #2). The number of hours missed from work because of HCV was divided by the total number of hours supposed to work, and expressed as a percentage. An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the WPAI absenteeism scores in each treatment group from Baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms WPAI absenteeism scores from Baseline to Week 72. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) in WPAI absenteeism scores and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) for the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Total Scores</title>
        <description>Study participants completed FSS questionnaires during study visits before treatment began and throughout treatment and follow-up to rate the severity and impact of fatigue they experienced in the preceding 2 weeks on their daily lives. FSS total scores are the average of nine questions with a range from 1 [no fatigue] to 7 [worst possible fatigue]. An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the overall severity of fatigue in each treatment group from baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in the amount of fatigue participants experienced throughout the study resulting in equal AUC from baseline to Week 72 (AUC72) for FSS total scores. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>

          <title>Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) for the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Total Scores</title>
          <description>Study participants completed FSS questionnaires during study visits before treatment began and throughout treatment and follow-up to rate the severity and impact of fatigue they experienced in the preceding 2 weeks on their daily lives. FSS total scores are the average of nine questions with a range from 1 [no fatigue] to 7 [worst possible fatigue]. An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the overall severity of fatigue in each treatment group from baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in the amount of fatigue participants experienced throughout the study resulting in equal AUC from baseline to Week 72 (AUC72) for FSS total scores. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) in Work Productivity and Activity (WPAI) Absenteeism Scores Due to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and Its Treatment</title>
        <description>Time missed from work in hours because of HCV infection or its treatment was assessed by measuring the change from baseline in the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire Absenteeism score (time missed from work, question #2). The number of hours missed from work because of HCV was divided by the total number of hours supposed to work, and expressed as a percentage. An area under the curve (AUC) analysis compared the WPAI absenteeism scores in each treatment group from Baseline to Week 72. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms WPAI absenteeism scores from Baseline to Week 72. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of AUC at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) in WPAI absenteeism scores and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>
