      Justification and aims of the study: The principal aim of use of opiate substitutes such as
      methadone or high-dose buprenorphine (HDB) is to reduce the need or the desire to consume the
      opiate to which the patient is addicted. Adjustment of the initial dose and regular
      re-evaluation of the efficacy of treatment are key elements in the success of such
      management. While too high a dose can be responsible for side effects leading to abandonment
      of treatment, too low a dose can induce the reappearance or even the reinforcing of parallel
      consumption of other psychoactive substances, in particular cocaine, alcohol and cannabis.
      The principal aim of this project is to determine the course of parallel consumption in
      patients who have been receiving a maintenance dose of methadone or HDB for at least two
      months, by analysis of a sample of hair, a biological matrix which is innovative for this
      type of study. Hair testing establishes a retrospective profile of consumption. The secondary
      aims of this project are (i) to validate the French versions of Handelsman's subjective and
      objective opiate withdrawal scales and to seek a possible correlation between high scores on
      these scales and the presence of parallel consumption, and (ii) to seek an association
      between polyconsumption and common functional polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes of methadone
      and HDB.

      Expected results: Hair testing, which has the particular advantage of a long detection window
      so that samples need only be taken at intervals, could improve the biological monitoring of
      patients on substitutive treatment.

      Validation of the French version of Handelsman's scales of objective and subjective signs of
      opiate withdrawal and search for any correlation with parallel consumption will enable these
      scales to be used in daily practice for clinical surveillance of patients on substitutive
      treatment.

      If a polymorphism of a metabolic enzyme of one or other of these molecules is detected, rapid
      genotyping of a simple saliva sample will be valuable in guiding the choice of medication
      when deciding on a treatment strategy

      Methodology: The two populations of patients, one treated with methadone, the other with HDB,
      will be recruited in accordance with the ethical principles of the declaration of Helsinki,
      during consultations at a center for addiction treatment. One hundred and ten patients will
      be included in each of the two populations. Written informed consent will be obtained from
      each patient. Anonymity will be respected at inclusion and throughout. Using a sample of
      hair, testing for and measurement of the principal drugs (opiates, cannabis, cocaine,
      amphetamines) and the specific marker of ethanol consumption, ethyl glucuronide, will be
      performed by chromatographic techniques (high-performance liquid chromatography and gas phase
      chromatography) together with detection by mass or tandem mass spectrometry. This
      non-invasive sampling is more informative than blood tests, as it gives a retrospective
      profile of an individual's consumption over several months. Treatment efficacy will also be
      assessed using Handelsman's subjective and objective opiate withdrawal scales. Lastly,
      polymorphisms of the metabolic enzymes of methadone and HDB will be sought by real-time PCR
      in a saliva sample, a method which gives similar results without the need for venous blood
      sampling.
