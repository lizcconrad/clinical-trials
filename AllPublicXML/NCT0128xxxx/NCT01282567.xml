  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Artificial Pancreas Project developed by SUPELEC and the University Hospital of Rennes is
      focused on the evaluation of an original control algorithm that computes appropriate
      subcutaneous insulin infusion in response to continuous glucose measurements The results
      during a 24-hour closed-loop period will be compared with those of the open-loop. The
      implementation of this algorithm named Error Dynamics Shaping (EDS) requires as a preliminary
      a phase of identification of the parameters of the model (insulin pharmacokinetics and effect
      on glucose metabolism) followed by a phase of optimization i.e. a personalized adjustment of
      the damping parameters of EDS.

      The present study aims to formalize this procedure of identification/optimization of the
      parameters of the model and controller EDS. They will be determined in type -1 diabetic
      patients using insulin therapy and under conditions free from disturbances such as those
      generated by the glucidic meals, i.e. during a period of glucidic fast. Three variables will
      determine this procedure: blood glucose, insulin concentration and insulin doses.

    <description>Identification of the eight parameters of the model including the five parameters of the glucose/insulin metabolism (p1, p2, p3, GB and Ib) and the three parameters of the model of subcutaneous insulin absorption Optimization of the four damping parameters of EDS. These coefficients can be tuned to adjust the damping degree of the error dynamics.
These procedures of identification and optimization will be carried out under Matlab® and Simulink®.</description>

    <description>The study will be proposed to four patients hospitalized in the Diabetes Unit for a glucidic fast test carried out during 24 hours (lunch, dinner and breakfast). Blood samples will be taken every 20 minutes during 6 hours and 40 minutes to measure plasma insulin concentration and blood glucose. T0 will correspond to the first modification of the insulin basal flow (in more or less) or to the first insulin bolus corrector, usually administered if capillary blood glucose reaches 1.8 g/l. The capillary blood glucose monitoring will be performed every two hours by the nurse.</description>
