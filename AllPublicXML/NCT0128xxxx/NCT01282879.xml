  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antifungal prophylaxis should be used in patients being treated with glucocorticoids for
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation
      (HSCT). Although fluconazole has been widely used as an antifungal prophylactic agent after
      allogeneic HSCT, fluconazole prophlaxis only shows a limited protective role against IFIs, is
      not effective against invasive aspergillosis. In addition, NCCN guideline of the prevention
      and treatment of cancer-related infections recommends antifungal prophylaxis in patients with
      significant GVHD until resolution of GVHD using Posaconazole, Voriconazole, Echinocandin, or
      Amphotericin B. However, under the National Health Insurance System, none of the drug can be
      given prophylactically except itraconazole oral solution against IFIs. Itraconazole oral
      solution shows excellent bioavailability and good efficacy against aspergillus and
      fluconazole resistant candida infection.Based on these findings, we will perform prospective
      multicenter study evaluating the efficacy, safety and long-term outcomes of itraconazole oral
      solution prophylaxis against IFIs in patients treated with systemic corticosteroids for GVHD
      after allogeneic HSCT.

      Eligible patients who provided an informed consent form will be administered itraconazole
      oral solution (200mg bid initially, swash and swallow) in either an in patient or outpatient
      setting. Treatment can be initiated at the same time of or within 10 days after starting
      systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

      Itraconazole oral solution dose can be adjusted according to the liver function test: 1) in
      case of - AST/ALT level 5-10 times UNL or bilirubin/ALP level 2-5 times UNL, itraconazole
      dose can be reduced to half (i.e. itraconazole 200mg po once daily or 100mg bid); 2) in case
      of - AST/ALT level &gt; 10 times UNL or bilirubin/ALP level &gt; 5 times UNL, itraconazole can be
      stopped.

      GVHD treatment can be given per center's policy: With respect to acute GVHD, prednisone
      (1-2mg/Kg/day) oral or iv can be given on top of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) GVHD
      prophylaxis. For chronic GVHD, various type of frontline regimen can be permitted including
      CNI+prednisone (PD), PD alone, CNI+PD+mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or MMF+PD. Various dose of
      PD will be accepted if it is at least from 0.5mg/Kg/day. For example, at SMC, in case of mild
      grade cGVHD with high risk feature, or of moderate grade cGVHD, CNI plus PD, 0.5mg/kg/day can
      be given initially. In case of severe grade cGVHD, CNI plus PD, 1.0mg/Kg/day will be given.

      Itraconazole will be maintained until PD is tapered to 10mg/day in case of PD alone therapy
      group, or until PD is stopped in case of CNI+PD or CNI+PD+MMF or MMF+PD group, etc. In
      addition, patients will receive itraconazole oral suspension until: 1) Development of proven
      or probable IFIs, 2) Severe toxicity (such as liver function abnormality - AST/ALT level &gt; 10
      times UNL or bilirubin/ALP level &gt; 5 times UNL, 3) Worsening GVHD that requires second line
      therapy for steroid refractory GVHD (in this situation, investigator could stop itraconazole
      oral solution if there is a potential drug interaction between itraconazole oral solution and
      2nd line GVHD drug or prolonged use of itraconazole oral solution could be hazardous to the
      patient), 4) Need to switch antifungal agent for the treatment of prolonged febrile episode
      related to systemic infection, thus requiring systemic antifungal treatment, 6) Withdrawal
      from study participation (patient's decision), or 7) Death.
