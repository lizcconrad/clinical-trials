  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the influence of 5 dry cupping treatments on chronic non
      specific neck pain. 50 patients with neck pain are randomised into cupping treatment and
      waiting list control group at T0 (Day 0). At T1 (Day 7)the investigators evaluate the neck
      pain (VAS), the neck related disability (NDI), pain related to movement (PRTM) and the
      quality of life (SF36). To investigate neurophysiological effects of cupping we also measure
      mechanical detection threshold (MDT), vibration detection threshold (VDT) and pressure pain
      threshold (PPT) at pain related and control areas. The treatment group then receives 5
      cupping treatments over a period of two weeks. After the cupping series resp. a waiting
      period for the waiting list control group (T2, Day 25) all measurements from T1 are repeated
      (VAS, NDI, PRTM, SF36, MDT, PPT, VDT). At last, a pain and medication diary is filled in by
      the patients from T0(Day 0) until T2 (Day 25). The investigators hypothesize, that cupping
      treatment is effective against neck pain (diary, VAS, NDI, PRTM, SF36) and that it leads to
      changes on perceptual level (MDT, VDT, PPT), when compared to the waiting list control group.
