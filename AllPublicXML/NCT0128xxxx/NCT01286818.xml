    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of the
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (anti-VEGFR-2) monoclonal antibody
      Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) in combination with irinotecan, levofolinate, and 5-fluorouracil
      (FOLFIRI) in Japanese participants with advanced colorectal carcinoma (CRC).

    <measure>Best Overall Response [Anti-Tumor Activity of FOLFIRI Plus Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks until PD (up to 49 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Progressive Disease (PD): an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition, the sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (the appearance of 1 or more new lesions was considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.</description>

Antiemetic premedication recommended according to manufacturer's standards but not required prior to ramucirumab drug product infusion. Participants who did not experience unacceptable toxicities during dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period (Day 1, Cycle 1 through Day 1, Cycle 3) who met criteria for treatment continuation received additional cycles of study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, protocol noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, or Sponsor/investigator decision.</description>

Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Progressive Disease (PD): an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition, the sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (the appearance of 1 or more new lesions was considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.</description>

          <title>Best Overall Response [Anti-Tumor Activity of FOLFIRI Plus Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B)]</title>
          <description>Best overall response evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. Progressive Disease (PD): an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (included baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition, the sum must have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (the appearance of 1 or more new lesions was considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.</description>

          <description>Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B): Intravenous (IV) infusion, 8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) every 2 weeks. Then 1-hour observation followed by chemotherapy with irinotecan, levofolinate, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) according to manufacturer's standards. Irinotecan: IV infusion, 180 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) every 2 weeks. Levofolinate: IV infusion, 200 mg/m^2 every 2 weeks. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): 400 mg/m^2 bolus followed by a 2400 mg/m^2 continuous infusion, every 2 weeks.
Antiemetic premedication recommended according to manufacturer's standards but not required prior to ramucirumab drug product infusion. Participants who did not experience unacceptable toxicities during dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period (Day 1, Cycle 1 through Day 1, Cycle 3) who met criteria for treatment continuation received additional cycles of study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, protocol noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, or Sponsor/investigator decision.</description>
