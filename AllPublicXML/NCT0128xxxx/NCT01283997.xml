  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to see if MinocinÂ® (minocycline) can help to
      control nerve damage that causes numbness and tingling in the hands and feet (neuropathy) in
      patients receiving thalidomide and/or bortezomib.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathy is one of the side effects that occurs in some patients who receive thalidomide
      and/or bortezomib. Usually it is mild and sometimes improves or goes away when the
      thalidomide or bortezomib treatment is stopped. However, in some patients, the numbness and
      tingling remains even after the treatment is stopped. It can make it difficult for patients
      to feel objects with their hands, or to feel the ground under their feet. This can lead to
      difficulty with tasks such as buttoning clothes or writing, as well as difficulty walking.

      Minocycline is designed to help prevent inflammation of the nerves, which can stop the nerve
      cells from dying.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participants in the 2 groups will receive standard
      education from the study staff about the signs and symptoms of neuropathy. If you are
      assigned to Group A, you will take a placebo (pills that look like the study drug but do not
      contain any active ingredients) once on Day 1. Staring on Day 2, you will take the pills 2
      times a day (every 12 hours), for 10 weeks. If you are assigned to Group B you will take a
      larger dose of minocycline 1 time by mouth on the day you start therapy on this study, and
      then a smaller dose of minocycline by mouth every 12 hours for 10 weeks. Minocycline can be
      taken with or without food, but it needs to be taken with liquid. No matter which group you
      are assigned to, you will receive thalidomide and/or bortezomib according to the standard
      schedule. Neither you nor your doctor nor any of the clinic or research staff will know which
      medication (placebo or minocycline) you are receiving. Only the pharmacist who gives you the
      medication will know. If there is any serious concern for your safety because of the
      medication you might be receiving, your doctor will be told which medication you are
      receiving.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) time a week during Weeks 1-9, you will complete the symptom questionnaire. This
      questionnaire may be done in person or by phone.

      Before you begin each new cycle of multiple myeloma therapy for 10 weeks, the following tests
      and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will be asked about any drugs
           you may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for certain cytokines.

        -  You will have a nerve function test.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire that has questions about unusual sensations you may
           experience in your arms, legs, hands, and feet and problems these sensations may cause
           for you.

        -  You will complete the symptom questionnaire that has questions about pain, fatigue,
           nausea, disturbed sleep, difficulty remembering, mood, work, and enjoyment of life.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire that asks about high likely you are to doze off or
           fall asleep while doing certain activities. This should take about 2-3 minutes.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Once you have completed the study medication (minocycline or placebo) after Week 10, you will
      be asked to return for an end-of-study visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will be asked about any drugs
           you may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for certain cytokines.

        -  You will have a nerve function test and a neuro-cognitive test.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire that has questions about unusual sensations you may
           experience in your arms, legs, hands, and feet and problems these sensations may cause
           for you.

        -  You will complete the symptom questionnaire that has questions about pain, fatigue,
           nausea, disturbed sleep, difficulty remembering, mood, work, and enjoyment of life.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire that asks about high likely you are to doze off or
           fall asleep while doing certain activities. This should take about 2-3 minutes.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced.

      If intolerable side effects occur, or if thalidomide and/or bortezomib for the myeloma is
      stopped, you will be taken off study.

      This is an investigational study. Minocycline is commercially available and FDA approved for
      use in other diseases, such as infections caused by bacteria. Minocycline is not FDA approved
      for the treatment of neuropathy. In neuropathy, it is currently being used in research only.
      Up to 142 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
