  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether financial
      incentives and peer networks delivered through a novel computer platform utilizing a digital
      pedometer-internet interface can effectively encourage sustained increases in walking among
      older adults.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial of incentive schemes delivered through a
      novel internet-based platform to promote walking in older adults. The four arms consist of
      the following: financial incentives, peer network, combined arm (financial incentive &amp; peer
      network), and control.

      Participation in the study will last approximately 26 weeks, including the 2-week run-in
      period, 4-month intervention period, and 2-month follow-up period.

      The primary goals of the study are:

        1. To test the effects of financial incentives on older adults uptake and retention of
           increased levels of walking.

           Hypothesis1a: Participants receiving financial incentives will increase their number of
           steps per day more than participants not receiving financial incentives.

        2. To test the effects of connection to a new peer network on older adults uptake and
           retention of increased levels of walking.

           Hypothesis 2a: Participants connected to a new peer network of other participants will
           increase their number of steps per day more than participants not connected to a new
           network.

           Hypothesis 2b: Participants connected to a new peer network of other participants will
           retain increases in their number of steps per day more than participants not connected
           to a new network.

        3. To test the combined effects of financial incentives and peer networks on older adults'
           uptake and retention of increased levels of walking.

           Hypothesis 3a: Participants who receive financial incentives and are connected to a peer
           network will increase their number of steps per day more than participants who are only
           connected to a peer network.

           Hypothesis 3b: Participants who receive financial incentives and are connected to a peer
           network will more effectively maintain increases in number of steps per day as compared
           with participants who only receive financial incentives.

        4. To develop internet, text and email messaging, and pedometer-internet interface
           technologies to build peer networks and provide regular feedback to subjects.

      Hypothesis 4: The study platform will provide an effective mechanism for subject recruitment,
      data collection, communication and regular feedback.

    <description>Daily use of pedometer for 6 months. Walking goal set based on level of walking during 2 week run-in period. Subjects connected with 4 other participants in the same study arm to form a peer network of 5 individuals. Each peer network participant given access to a secure online message board that will allow the 5 participants in each peer network to communicate online. Participants also receive weekly feedback regarding which participants in the peer group achieved their walking goals during the previous week.
Each week, if pedometer is used and walking goal is met for 5 out of 7 days, participant will be entered in lottery with an approximate 3 in 10 chance of winning $50 and an approximate 3 in 100 chance of winning $200.
Financial incentive and peer network terminated after 4 months. Daily use of pedometer continues for an additional 2 months.</description>

    <description>Daily use of pedometer for 6 months. Walking goal set based on level of walking during 2 week run-in period. Weekly feedback provided on meeting walking goal - defined as achieving goal number of steps for 5 of 7 days per week.
Subjects in the Control Group will only receive pedometers and weekly feedback on their performance through the same mechanisms and with the same frequency as participants in the other three study arms. There will be no financial incentives or peer networks in this group.</description>

Subjects will be connected with 4 other participants in the same study arm to form a peer network of 5 individuals. Each peer network participant will be given access to a secure online message board that will allow the 5 participants in each peer network to communicate online. All participants in a peer network will receive a list of ways in which his or her new network could support each individual's walking goals. Participants will also receive weekly feedback regarding which participants in the peer group were successful in achieving their walking goals during the previous week.
Peer network is terminated after 4 months. Daily use of pedometer continues for an additional 2 months.</description>
