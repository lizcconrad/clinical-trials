  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, robotic devices are becoming more and more common in medical practice. Such
      devices provide an effective way to communicate within a clinical setting, but recent studies
      have shown far more diverse uses for these robots, ranging from training future surgeons to
      diagnoses of patients. In the investigators study, the investigators would like to
      investigate whether it is effective to employ robotic devices in the administration of
      neurostimulation treatment. It is the investigators hypothesis that the introduction of
      robotic devices will only yield minimal if any inaccuracies in a standard neuromodulation
      treatment protocol. In addition, the investigators also predict a high satisfaction rating
      from all participants involved in conditions involving the robot.

      Patients with neuromodulation systems implanted for either movement disorders or chronic pain
      and who require programming of their systems will be approached to enter the study. Those who
      consent will be consecutively assigned to either the normal standard of care (i.e.
      programming of their systems with an experienced clinician) or programming of their systems
      with an inexperienced programmer (nurse) who will be directed by the experienced programmer
      via the remote presence robot. Both the nurses and the patients will complete questionnaires
      rating their satisfaction of the programming experience.

      They will each only receive one questionnaire at the end of the programming session. There is
      no other test point.
