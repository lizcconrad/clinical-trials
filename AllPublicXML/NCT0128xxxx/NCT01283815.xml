    <textblock>
      According to retrospective studies the conservative management of periappendicular abscess is
      associated with decreased complication and re-operation rate compared with open appendectomy.
      Large abscesses require percutaneous drainage. Sometimes percutaneous drainage is not
      possible because of anatomical position of the abscess and surgical treatment is needed. The
      purpose of this study is evaluate whether laparoscopic appendectomy is suitable for the
      first-line treatment in patients with periappendicular abscess.

      The hypothesis of the study is that laparoscopic management of periappendicular abscess is
      suitable for the first-line treatment and it does not increase time of hospitalization or
      complication rate compared with conservative management.
