  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart surgery involving valve replacement often involves the use of the heart-lung machine
      for over 90 minutes, and bleeding tendency is frequently seen. Conventionally, platelet
      transfusion has been the primary therapy to treat bleeding after this type of procedure. More
      recently, perioperative supplementation of purified fibrinogen (RiaSTAP, CSL Behring) was
      shown to reduce bleeding and blood product use (plasma or platelets) after heart surgery. The
      objective of this trial is to demonstrate the clinical equivalency and economic utility of
      using fibrinogen concentrate, RiaSTAP for the mitigation of post-operative bleeding in
      patients in lieu of platelet transfusion.

      Purified fibrinogen concentrate has been approved by FDA, and it has been used for the
      treatment of acute bleeding episodes in patients with low fibrinogen due to hereditary causes
      (e.g., afibrinogenemia). Compared to the transfusion of platelets which may be associated
      with volume overload, bacterial/viral infection, immunological effects and excess blood
      clotting, purified fibrinogen has several advantages. First, it contains no liquid plasma
      allowing for low volume infusion. Several viral inactivation/reduction steps are used to
      prepare the fibrinogen concentrate, increasing its viral safety. No antibodies or white blood
      cells are contained in the fibrinogen concentrate; therefore transfusion reactions are rare.
      Although platelet transfusion is widely used after heart surgery, there has been no
      randomized study to endorse this practice. In this study, patients undergoing heart valve
      replacement will be randomized to receive either platelet (1 unit) transfusion or fibrinogen
      concentrate (4g) after heparin anticoagulation is reversed. Subjects will be treated only if
      there is evidence of significant microvascular bleeding. Fifteen minutes after the initial
      treatment, subjects will be reevaluated for bleeding. If bleeding continues, subjects will be
      treated with blood transfusion per institutional standard of care.

      The primary endpoints for this study are the hemostatic condition of the surgical field and
      24-hour total of blood product transfusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet and plasma transfusion remain in the mainstay hemostatic therapy for perioperative
      bleeding. Several studies indicate that acquired fibrinogen deficiency can be the primary
      cause of bleeding after cardiac surgery. The aim of the study is to compare hematologica and
      transfusion profiles between the first-line fibrinogen replacement and platelet transfusion
      in post-cardiac surgical bleeding. In this prospective randomized, open-lable study, 20 adult
      patients undergoing valve replacement or repair, and fulfilling preset visual bleeding scale
      (0=excellent hemostasis; 1=oozing; 2=moderate bleeding; 3=severe bleeding from multiple
      bleeding sites) are randomized to 4 g of fibrinogen or 1 unit of apheresis platelet
      transfusion. After the initial randomized intervention, additional transfusions are given in
      the presence of bleeding (&gt;200 ml/hour) according to the institutional practie as follows; 1
      apheresis platelet unit if platelet count is less than 100 x 10^9 /L, 2 units of plasma if
      international normalized ratio is &gt;1.6, or 10 units of cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen level is
      &lt;200 mg/dL. Primary endpoints include hemostatic condition in the surgical field and 24-hour
      hemostatic product usage. Hematologica data, clinical outcome, and safety date are collected
      up to the 28th day postoperative visit.

    <description>Bleeding scores are scored on a four-point scale. A visual assessment of surgical field was performed by the senior surgical staff as follows: 0 = excellent hemostasis (dry field), 1 = mild bleeding (oozing), 2 = moderate bleeding (controllable with applied pressure), and 3 = severe bleeding (multiple diffuse bleeding sites). If the visual bleeding scale was 2 to 3, the subjects were randomly assigned to a study intervention using a closed envelope method.</description>

        <title>Bleeding Scores</title>
        <description>Bleeding scores are scored on a four-point scale. A visual assessment of surgical field was performed by the senior surgical staff as follows: 0 = excellent hemostasis (dry field), 1 = mild bleeding (oozing), 2 = moderate bleeding (controllable with applied pressure), and 3 = severe bleeding (multiple diffuse bleeding sites). If the visual bleeding scale was 2 to 3, the subjects were randomly assigned to a study intervention using a closed envelope method.</description>
