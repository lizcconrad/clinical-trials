          -  Male subject with female spouses/partners who are of childbearing potential must use

             corneal edema, uveitis, severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca)

          -  History of major ocular infection, inflammation, or herpes simplex keratitis; evidence
             of current clinically significant blepharitis or conjunctivitis

          -  Any history of ocular surgery including refractive surgery such as laser-assisted in
             situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in any eye

          -  Ocular trauma within the past six months

          -  Severe myopia

          -  Diabetes, Type I or Type 2, with or without medical management

          -  History of any type of dysrhythmia

          -  Systemic hypertension requiring pharmacotherapy

          -  Past diagnosis of any connective tissue or autoimmune disease including rheumatoid

             with mirabegron at any time

          -  Ocular medication of any kind within past 30 days
