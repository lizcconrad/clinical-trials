    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this prospective, observational study are to
      describe the different clinical practice and detailed haemostatic management of activated
      recombinant human factor VII (NovoSeven®) in patients with acquired haemophilia in France.
      The secondary aim is to assess the primary haemostasis disorder associated with the
      coagulation disorders, if available.
