    <textblock>
      An observational study designed to evaluate the performance of a new Near Infrared
      Spectroscopy (NIRS) tissue oximeter device in the clinical setting, including a cerebral
      sensor and peripheral sensor. Fifty patients who are undergoing open-heart surgery will be
      enrolled and tissue oximetry measurement will be collected throughout the surgical procedure
      and for up to 24 hours following surgery. Tissue oximeter measurement of the brain and
      skeletal tissue will be added to the standard intra-operative patient monitoring. Measures of
      delirium will be collected using a standardized questionnaire. The relationship between
      cerebral oximetry measures and delirium scores will be explored.
