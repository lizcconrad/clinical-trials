      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of boceprevir (steady state) on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of raltegravir. The effect on the boceprevir
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose raltegravir will also be evaluated (compared to historical
      controls). Furthermore, the safety profile of the combination is studied.

      A considerable percentage of HIV infected patients is also infected with the hepatitis C
      virus (HCV). HIV/HCV co-infected patients are likely to simultaneously use treatment for
      their HIV infection as well as HCV treatment. Therefore, it is important to know if drug-drug
      interactions occur when combining those treatments.

      Raltegravir is an HIV integrase inhibitor and approved by the FDA in 2007. Boceprevir is a
      potent HCV NS3 serine protease inhibitor and is currently in Phase III clinical development.

      Combined use of boceprevir and raltegravir is not expected to give a major drug-drug
      interaction as raltegravir is not a CYP3A substrate and thus will not be affected by the
      strong inhibition of CYP3A by boceprevir. Raltegravir is metabolized by UGT but boceprevir is
      not known to influence UGT. However, recent data indicate that raltegravir is a P-gp
      substrate and boceprevir is a substrate and a moderate inhibitor of P-gp in vitro.

      Even when no drug interaction is expected, it may be recommended to collect sufficient
      evidence that this is the case as in many cases un-expected drug-drug interactions have been
      observed in the past.

      The current study is designed to evaluate the effect of steady state boceprevir on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of raltegravir and the safety profile when used in
      combination. Furthermore the effect of a single dose raltegravir is studied on the
      pharmacokinetics of steady state boceprevir in comparison with historical controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 and not older than 55 years at scree-ning.

          -  Subject does not smoke more than 10 cigarettes, 2 cigars, or 2 pipes per day for at
             least 3 months prior to the first dosing

          -  Subject has a Quetelet Index (Body Mass Index) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, extremes included.

          -  Subject is able and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form prior to screening
             evaluations.
