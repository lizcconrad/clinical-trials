    <description>Based on the BMD values and the weight, the age-normalized percentiles (Z-scores) were determined to allow for comparison with historical control groups. &quot;No difference&quot; in comparison with the historical control groups was defined as a Z-score between '-0.5' and '0.5', a lower value was defined as a value below '-0.5', and a higher value above '0.5'.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Responders at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Responders were defined as subjects with reduction in pain intensity from baseline of at least 30% in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Week 24. VAS consisted of a 100 unit long straight line, with verbal anchors at either end, representing a continuum of pain intensity. One end of the line with 0 score as &quot;absence of pain&quot; while the other end of the line with 100 score as &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. The assessment of pelvic pain on a VAS was done once every 4 weeks till the end of the treatment (Week 52).</description>

    <description>The investigator rating scale used in this study was based on the validated CGI scale, which is widely used as a simple tool to assess the overall effect of treatments. The investigator or a sub-investigator rated the total improvement according to the following scale: Score 1 = very much improved; Score 2 =much improved; Score 3 = minimally improved; Score 4 = no change; Score 5 = minimally worse; Score 6 = much worse; Score 7 = very much worse.

    <description>The subject rating scale used in this study was based on the validated CGI scale, which is widely used as a simple tool to assess the overall effect of treatments.
