  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test whether a culturally-tailored in-office based
      intervention have impact on increasing Chinese physician's recommendation of colorectal
      cancer (CRC) screening to their nonadherent Chinese patients.

      Special aims are to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of a culturally-tailored physician intervention on increasing
           non-adherent Chinese American's patients' CRC screening rate.

        2. Identify factors that mediate or moderate the intervention effects. For example,
           patients who hold an eastern cultural view or are less acculturated will be more likely
           to benefit from the intervention than patients who hold a western view or who are more
           acculturated.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial aiming to test the effect of the
      culturally-tailored in-office based intervention on physicians. A total of 24 Chinese
      physicians in the Washington DC and Philadelphia areas and a total of 24 eligible Chinese
      patients from each physician will be recruited for this study. Physicians and their patients
      are randomized into two groups: A and B. Physician in the intervention group (A) will receive
      mailed printed materials including a CRC physician guide, patient brochure, flip chart and a
      poster and two sessions of in-office training aimed to reinforce learning of the topic
      covered by the mailed materials and provide physicians with hands-on experience in using
      communication skills with standardized patients. Physicians in the control group (B) will
      receive nothing until the end of the study. Patients will be followed 12-month later after
      their completion of the baseline survey and their self-reported CRC screening status will be
      verified by chart audit.
