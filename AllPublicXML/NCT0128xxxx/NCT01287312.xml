    <textblock>
      Today Endoscopic repair of recurrent Tracheesophageal fistula (TEF) is a safe procedure.
      Using Trichlosiacetic acid 50% (TCA) for endoscopic aplication of the fistula was reported
      with a good results ( 4 cases). There were no serious advers effects.

      The investigators want to use also TCA 50% for endoscopic repair in children with recurrent
      TEF.
