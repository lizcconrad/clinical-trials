      The main aim of this study is to compare 2 different measurements of visceral fat that can be
      easily used in clinical practice (waist circumference versus bioelectric impedance) in
      relation to known risk factors of coronary artery disease in a large cohort of patients with
      type 2 diabetes and with a BMI range between 20-45 kg/m2

        The investigators will identify and recruit 500 patients. Participants for this study (men
        and women) will be recruited for the diabetes outpatient clinic of the Joslin Diabetes
        Center. Subjects from minority and various ethnic/racial groups will be invited to
        participate in the study at the same proportional to Massachusetts's population, which is
        86.5% white, 6.9 Black, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska, 4.9 Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian
        and Other Pacific Islander and 8.2% of Hispanic or Latino origin. The investigators will
        monitor our recruitment by gender and race/ethnicity and modify our recruitment procedures
        if necessary to ensure that there is no selection bias due to these factors.
