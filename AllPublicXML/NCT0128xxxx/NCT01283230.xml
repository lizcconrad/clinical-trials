    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort Study for evaluation of liver fibrosis staging with acoustic
      radiation force impulse elastography in patients with chronic liver disease and healthy
      liver/kidney donors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent new method for liver fibrosis assessment based on similar technology to transient
      elastography is acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. ARFI has the advantages
      which can be conducted in parallel ways of measuring points in the patients with chronic
      liver disease when they underwent routine ultrasound examination. Thus, the aim of this study
      was to identify the normal range of ARFI velocity and assess the best cut-off value by
      recruiting healthy living liver and kidney donors.

    <description>Measurement of ARFI velocity is non-invsive ultrasonographic technique. It is performed with a abdominal convex probe which is same probe as conventional ultrasonography. Short-duration acoustic radiation forces result in shear-wave propagation away from the region of excitation and are tracked using ultrasonic correlation-based methods. This results are called ARFI velocity which is expressed as meters per second</description>

    <description>Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging were measured 10 times in each patient.The region of interest was chosen in an area where the normal liver parenchyma was at least 6 cm thick and free of large blood vessels was chosen. A measurement depth of 2 cm below the liver capsule was chosen to standardize the examination.</description>
