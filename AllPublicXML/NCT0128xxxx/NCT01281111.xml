  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of different doses
      and dosing regimens of BG00012 administered with and without ASA compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical safety margins for BG00012 allow for a maximum daily dose of 720 mg daily. The
      study will use a variety of clinical scales, including a flushing scale derived from a
      validated questionnaire [Norquist 2007], to better understand the safety and tolerability of
      several doses and dosing regimens of BG00012 up to a total daily dose of 720 mg. The etiology
      of BG00012-induced flushing will be assessed by collecting relevant biomarker data and the
      impact of ASA on flushing will be evaluated. Assessments relating to GI symptoms will also be
      performed.
