    <textblock>
      The results will allow us to evaluate the role of MP in the thrombo-embolic risk observed in
      thalassemic patients and to underline a possible difference between TM and TI. The in vitro
      and in vivo study of MP in erythrocytes concentrates is a new approach to explore the
      consequence of transfusion in polytransfused patients. Finally, the identification of a
      possible relationship between the oxidative stress and the production of MP may lead to the
      development of specific therapeutical approaches

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microparticles (MP) are intact vesicles derived from cell membranes which arise mainly
      through cell membrane activation processes and from apoptosis. MP originating from platelets,
      endothelial cells and monocytes have been most extensively studied, though similar particles
      can arise from red cells and granulocytes. The ability to form microparticles is an essential
      part of physiological coagulation.However, MP may play an important procoagulant role in
      several diseases including sickle cell disease, and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
      (PNH).

      Several studies reported the presence of MP in TI and their potential role in the
      hypercoagulable state. The investigators propose in this study to investigate the presence
      and origin of MP in TM patients.

    <description>In TM, to quantify the elevation of MP as well as their procoagulant activity, to describe their production kinetic, to determine the transfusional or endogenous origin of erythrocytic MP and finally to compare their characteristics with those found in TI patients.
To study, in TM and TI patients, the relationship between the number, the procoagulant activity of MP and the clinical (thromboembolic episodes,splenectomy, presence of pulmonary hypertension) biological and plasmatic data reflecting the patient's prothrombotic state.</description>

the dosages of MP carried out by the UMR 608 in Marseille,
the evaluation of the oxidative stress markers and of iron performed in the UMR 773 in Paris-Bichat.
In vitro production of MP of transfused red blood cells origin will also be evaluated in erythrocytes concentrates during the storage of the units.</description>
