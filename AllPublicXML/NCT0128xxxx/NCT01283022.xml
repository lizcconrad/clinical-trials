    <measure>Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Misoprostol After Insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>From study drug insertion up to 1 hour post study drug removal.</time_frame>
    <description>The timepoints over which the pharmacokinetic measurements were assessed, and deemed as accurate and appropriate, were as follows: 0 hours (baseline), 0.5,1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 hours after insertion of the study drug, immediately prior to removal of the study drug and 0.5 and 1 hour after removal of the study drug. The 10 hour and 14 hour blood samples were obtained if the subject still had the study drug in place at those timepoints.</description>
