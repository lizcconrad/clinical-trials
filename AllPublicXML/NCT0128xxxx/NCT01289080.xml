    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The value of CL/F was determined as Dose/AUC∞. Clearance of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) was influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population PK modeling. Drug clearance was a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance was removed from the blood.</description>

        <title>Apparent Clearance From Plasma After Extravascular Administration of Brexpiprazole (CL/F).</title>
        <description>The value of CL/F was determined as Dose/AUC∞. Clearance of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug was metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) was influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population PK modeling. Drug clearance was a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance was removed from the blood.</description>
