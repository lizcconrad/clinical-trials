  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of cisapride at improving symptoms
      associated with gastroparesis (a stomach disorder) in patients with diabetes mellitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither the physician nor the patient will know the name of assigned
      treatment) study to determine the effectiveness of cisapride tablets compared to placebo
      tablets (a tablet identical in appearance to cisapride but does not contain active drug) at
      improving symptoms associated with diabetic gastroparesis when administered orally (by mouth)
      to patients with insulin dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Gastroparesis
      is a disorder also called delayed gastric emptying, in which the stomach takes too long to
      empty food into the small intestine for digestion. Symptoms of gastroparesis may include
      vomiting, nausea, early feeling of fullness after only a few bites of food, weight loss due
      to poor absorption of nutrients or low calorie intake, abdominal bloating, poor glycemic
      (blood sugar) control, lack of appetite, and pain in the stomach area. Patients will take
      study drug (one 10-mg tablet of cisapride, or one tablet of placebo), orally, 4 times a day,
      for a period of 8 weeks. Study drug will be taken approximately 15 minutes before each meal
      and, with a beverage, before going to bed.
