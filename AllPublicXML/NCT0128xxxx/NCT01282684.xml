  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the safety and tolerability of a single dose of PLX5622
      in healthy, adult human volunteers. This will be the first time PLX5622 has been taken by
      humans.

    <description>Subjects will take one oral dose of PLX5622 on Day 1. Physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), adverse events, hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be used to assess safety throughout the Days 1-4 of the study and on the follow up study visit on day 7. Adverse events will be monitored and reviewed for safety issues/abnormal changes in the above mentioned tests.</description>
