  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although drug therapies and pulmonary rehabilitation have greatly improved COPD symptoms, as
      many as 50% of patients with severe COPD have inadequately controlled dyspnea. Device-guided
      breathing is a behavioral intervention that guides respiratory rates into a therapeutic
      range; prolongation of the expiratory phase improves hyperinflation, the most significant
      driver of dyspnea in this population. Device-guided breathing, has no known side-effects, and
      may represent a cost effective adjunctive treatment for dyspnea in severe COPD.
