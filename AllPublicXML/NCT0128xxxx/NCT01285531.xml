      Objective: To evaluate pediatric emergency department provider lumbar puncture success with
      and without the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced, a new pressure transducer, in order to
      determine: the proportion of lumbar punctures where a) any cerebrospinal fluid is obtained on
      the first attempt, b) any cerebrospinal fluid is obtained on any attempt, and c) sufficient
      cerebrospinal fluid is obtained for standard tests (culture, chemistries, cell count); the
      time to provider success in obtaining a) a drop of fluid from the needle, and b) opening
      pressure measurement; the proportion of successful lumbar punctures that contain blood; and
      provider satisfaction.

      Background: Lumbar punctures are necessary to diagnose meningitis, neurological diseases and
      some cancers. They are common pediatric emergency department procedures that frequently
      require repeated attempts or are only partially successful, with sufficient blood to limit
      interpretation. Measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure during lumbar punctures is recommended
      but rarely done, due to limitations of current technology. Liquid column manometry is
      cumbersome, time-consuming and frequently impractical. Existing pressure transduction probes
      that connect via tubing to external monitors are not designed or recommended for lumbar
      punctures. The pressure is displayed on a monitor that is difficult to view during the LP
      procedure and they equilibrate too slowly to keep pace of pressure changes during LPs. The
      Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced is a new, inexpensive, disposable, medical device,
      specifically designed for use during LPs, that has the potential to increase lumbar punctures
      success and decrease blood contamination. It attaches to the spinal needle and displays both
      a numeric pressure value and a pressure waveform, allowing physicians to more readily
      identify the cerebrospinal fluid space and measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The device
      is small, easy to use, and readily incorporated into standard practice.

      The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced uniquely provides immediate feedback about pressure that
      may allow physicians to more quickly and confidently identify the CSF space, and instantly
      determine cerebrospinal fluid pressure when the space is reached. The investigators believe
      the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced will increase lumbar punctures success and decrease the
      proportion containing blood. It has the potential to become the standard of care and be used
      in every lumbar puncture procedure. This study is expected to demonstrate the clinical
      utility of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced to the medical community. Increased awareness
      of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced and a positive demonstration of the viability of the
      technology will help attract either the investment capital or the strategic partnership
      necessary to fully develop the market.

      Objective: To evaluate pediatric emergency department (ED) provider lumbar puncture success
      with and without the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced, a new pressure transducer, in order to
      determine: the proportion of lumbar punctures (LPs) where a) any cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is
      obtained on the first attempt, b) any CSF is obtained on any attempt, and c) sufficient CSF
      is obtained for standard tests (culture, chemistries, cell count); the time to provider
      success in obtaining a) a drop of fluid from the needle, and b) opening pressure measurement;
      the proportion of successful lumbar punctures that contain blood; and provider satisfaction.

      Background: Lumbar punctures are necessary to diagnose meningitis, neurological diseases and
      some cancers. They are common pediatric emergency department procedures that frequently
      require repeated attempts or are only partially successful, with sufficient blood to limit
      interpretation. Measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure during a lumbar puncture is
      recommended but rarely done, due to limitations of current technology. Liquid column
      manometry is cumbersome, time-consuming and frequently impractical. Existing pressure
      transduction probes that connect via tubing to external monitors are not designed or
      recommended for LPs. The pressure is displayed on a monitor that is difficult to view during
      the lumbar puncture procedure and they equilibrate too slowly to keep pace of pressure
      changes during lumbar puncture. The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced is a new, inexpensive,
      disposable, medical device, specifically designed for use during lumbar punctures, that has
      the potential to increase lumbar puncture success and decrease blood contamination. It
      attaches to the spinal needle and displays both a numeric pressure value and a pressure
      waveform, allowing physicians to more readily identify the cerebrospinal fluid space and
      measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The device is small, easy to use, and readily
      incorporated into standard practice.

      Methods: This randomized clinical trial will test adding the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced
      vs. standard care in 60 children 0-16 years old who are receiving a lumbar puncture in the
      Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department. We will test the Compass Lumbar Puncture
      Enhanced against standard care in 60 children receiving lumbar puncture, comparing success,
      pressures obtaining, time to success, complications (e.g. &gt;200 red blood cells/mm3) and
      provider satisfaction. Results will be compared with chi-squared tests, regressions,
      Kaplan-Meier and logrank tests. We expect improved success, decreased time to success and
      complications and high provider satisfaction.

      Impact: Currently, one third of lumbar punctures require multiple attempts, 7-20% contain
      blood that limits interpretation, and 6% are unsuccessful. This results in unnecessary
      hospitalizations, increased hospital days, increased antibiotic use and increased numbers of
      repeat procedures. The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced uniquely provides immediate feedback
      about pressure that will allow physicians to more quickly and confidently identify the
      cerebrospinal fluid space, and instantly determine cerebrospinal fluid pressure when the
      space is reached. We believe the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced will increase lumbar
      puncture success and decrease the proportion containing blood. It has the potential to become
      the standard of care and be used in every lumbar puncture procedure. This study is expected
      to demonstrate the clinical utility of the Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced to the medical
      community.
