      To explore what is driving heart-rate increases after dosing with mirabegron. Subjects will
      be given a beta-blocker at the same time as mirabegron.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impedance cardiography parameters will be assessed and compared when mirabegron (or placebo),
      is taken in combination with a selective beta-blocker, a non-selective beta-blocker or
      placebo.

                  practicing two (2) of the following contraceptive methods:

               -  diaphragm with spermicide

               -  intrauterine device

               -  condoms in combination with a spermicidal cream

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to mirabegron, propranolol or bisoprolol, or any
             components of the formulations used

          -  Any of the liver function tests (i.e. ALT, AST) above the upper limit of normal at
             repeated measures

          -  Any clinically significant history of bronchospasm, asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis
             during the pollen season, any other allergic condition or previous severe
             hypersensitivity to any drug (excluding non-active hay fever)
