  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of ASP3026 in patients with
      advanced malignancies (solid tumors and B-cell lymphoma).

      This study will be conducted using a traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design.
      Enrollment of at least 3 subjects is planned for each dosing cohort until the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined. Up to three additional subjects per cohort may be
      enrolled if each additional subject is known to be positive for Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase
      (ALK) or Proto-Oncogene Tyrosine-Protein Kinase ROS (ROS) abnormalities. The decision to
      expand a cohort or dose escalate will be based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) in Cycle 1 that are considered by the Investigator to be related (possibly or
      probably) to ASP3026. Intra-subject dose escalation will be allowed at the discretion of the
      investigators. The Safety Data Review Committee may elect to enroll additional subjects in a
      cohort to further evaluate the dose level. Once the MTD is determined, approximately 20
      additional subjects with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) abnormalities will be enrolled at
      the Recommended Phase 2 Dose. Each cycle will include 28 days of continuous dosing with
      ASP3026. Treatment with ASP3026 may continue until one of the discontinuation criteria is
      met.
