    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether increased pressure in the head is elevated
      in people who suffer from High Altitude Headache. We hypothesise that head pressure will be
      elevated in people with High Altitude Headache.

    <textblock>
      High Altitude Headache is the primary symptom of Acute Mountain Sickness. However, at present
      the reason why some individuals suffer from High Altitude Headache and others do not remains
      unknown. It is widely believed that elevated pressure within the brain leads to stretching of
      pain sensitive fibres and thus headache. However, evidence of raised intracranial pressure
      during High Altitude Headache is currently unavailable. Therefore, this study aims to examine
      a proxy measure of intracranial pressure (Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter) in persons visiting
      High Altitude, half of whom have been given the drug acetazolamide that is known to reduce
      headache symptoms.

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants completed two trials, including a 12 hour sea level exposure followed by a 36 hour high altitude exposure (3777m). Participants were assigned to one of two groups based on High-altitude headache susceptibility determined by visual analogue score obtained after 12 hours at high altitude. No participants were excluded.</pre_assignment_details>
