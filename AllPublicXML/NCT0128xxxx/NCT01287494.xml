  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomized controlled design, the investigators will examine whether the DCM is an
      effective treatment for patients with late life depression in urban China. Our specific aims
      are: (1) to determine whether the DCM intervention results in improved outcomes compared with
      CAU at both the provider (e.g., greater adherence to quality indicators) and patient levels
      (e.g., greater reduction in depressive symptoms); and (2) to compare DCM with CAU with regard
      to a range of outcomes in other pertinent domains, both at the provider (e.g., improvements
      in knowledge/attitudes) and patient (e.g., functioning, satisfaction) levels. The study will
      take place in 16 primary care clinics (PCCs) randomly assigned to deliver either DCM or CAU
      (8 clinics each) to 320 patients (aged≥60 years) with major depression (20/clinic; n=160 in
      each treatment condition). In the DCM arm, PCPs will prescribe 16 weeks of antidepressant
      medication according to the TG protocol. CMs monitor the progress of treatment and side
      effects, educate patients/family, and facilitate communication between providers;
      psychiatrists will provide weekly group psychiatric consultation and CM supervision. Patients
      in both DCM and CAU arms will be assessed by clinical research coordinators at baseline, 4,
      8, 12, 18, and 24 months. HDRS, MMSE, CAS, SF-12, Treatment Stigma and the Client
      Satisfaction Questionnaire will be used to assess patients' outcomes; and clinic practices,
      attitudes/knowledge, and satisfaction will be providers' outcomes.

      -  At the patient level: The investigator will gather information about age, gender,
           education, marital status, living conditions and satisfaction with their economic
           status, as well as systematic information on suicidal ideation,, psychopathology,
           medical health, cognitive function, quality of life and stigma and satisfaction for the
           treatment.

        -  At the provider level: the objective of research measures at the provider level is to
           gather social-demographic data such as age, gender, education, marital status, clinical
           experience among physicians in the participating PCCs as well as systematic information
           on their attitudes/knowledge regarding depression and clinical practices with the
           treatment guidelines.
