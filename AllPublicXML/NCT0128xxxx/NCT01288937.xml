    <textblock>
      Milnacipran helps serotonin and noradrenaline work more effectively on the central nervous
      system. Serotonin and noradrenaline are molecules made by the brain that affect how your body
      responds to pain. Milnacipran, a dual norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor has
      been a safe and beneficial treatment for patients with fibromyalgia and may be useful to
      treat patients with painful peripheral neuropathy. Many clinical trials for neuropathy pain
      are done in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Idiopathic neuropathy however, is a common
      cause of neuropathy and accounts for 25% of all neuropathies, and over 50% of small fiber
      neuropathies. The information in this study will provide information on whether milnacipran
      also provide benefit as a medication for neuropathic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an 11-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Milnacipran 100 mg/d
      in patients with idiopathic neuropathic pain. Milnacipran, a dual norepinephrine and
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor has been a safe and beneficial treatment for patients with
      fibromyalgia and may be useful to treat patients with painful peripheral neuropathy.

      The primary outcome will be assessed by the change in daily averaged weekly 0-10 pain
      intensity score, from baseline to week 9, by intention to treat analysis. The same analysis
      will be used on several secondary measures including daily averaged weekly 0-10 pain
      intensity score the sleep interference scale and the RAND-36 quality of life scale.
