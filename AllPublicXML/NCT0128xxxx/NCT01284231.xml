      To determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or optimum biologic dose of MEDI-565 in adult
      subjects and evaluate the safety profile in adult subjects with advanced gastrointestinal
      adenocarcinomas who have no available standard or curative treatments.

      This is a FTIH, dose-escalation and expansion Phase 1 study. The first part is a multicenter,
      open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of MEDI-565 to determine the MTD or OBD and
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, IM, and antitumor activity of MEDI 565 in adult
      subjects who have GI adenocarcinomas for which no standard or curative treatments are
      available. The second part is a dose-expansion study at the MTD or OBD in subjects with
      selected tumor types.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose (OBD) of MEDI-565 in subjects with gastrointestinal (GI) adenocarcinomas for which no standard or curative treatments are available.</measure>
    <time_frame>MTD/OBD will be evaluated from the time of first administration of MEDI-565 through the first 28-day cycle</time_frame>
    <description>MTD/OBD will be determined based on Dose Limiting Toxicities that will be evaluated from the time of first administration of MEDI-565 through the first 28-day cycle</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the safety profile in adult subjects with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) adenocarcinomas who have no available standard or curative treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs and SAEs will be reported through 30 days after the last dose of MEDI 565</time_frame>
    <description>The number (percentage) of subjects with AEs and SAEs reported through 30 days after the last dose of MEDI 565 will be summarized for all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug (Safety Population).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the safety and antitumor activity of MEDI-565 in the dose-expansion phase.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The antitumor activity of MED-565 will be assessed using objective response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DR), time to progression (TTP), progression‑free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using RECIST guidelines</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of MEDI-565</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Individual MEDI-565 concentrations will be tabulated by dose cohort along with descriptive statistics. Noncompartmental PK data analysis will be performed for data obtained from each dose cohort with scheduled PK sample collection. If the data allow, descriptive statistics of noncompartmental PK parameters (AUC, Cmax, Tmax, CL, Vd, t½) will be provided.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity of MED-565</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The immunogenic potential of MEDI-565 will be assessed by summarizing the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies.</description>
