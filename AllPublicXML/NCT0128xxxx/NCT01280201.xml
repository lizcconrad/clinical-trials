  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of new diagnosed patients with NET of the digestive tract including carcinoid
      and pancreatic islet cells tumors ranges from 2 to 10 per 100,000 in the western Countries
      (Kulke M, Mayer R. N Engl J Med 340:858-868, 1999). Despite of the low incidence, the
      prevalence of these tumors is high because of their relatively long survival estimated in 35%
      at 5 years for those patients with well or moderate differentiated tumors (Yao JC, et al. J
      Clin Oncol. 2008;26:3063-3072). In fact, digestive NETs are the second most prevalent tumors
      derived from the digestive tract after colorectal carcinoma.

      NETs are characterized by abundant vasculature, moreover VEGFR and VEGFR are overexpressed in
      60-84% of the carcinoids and pancreatic islet cells NETs (Zhang et al. Cancer
      2007;109:1478-1486). Other pro-angiogenic factors like the platelet derived growth factor
      (PDGFR) have been also involved in NET progression and development (Chaudhry A, et al.Cancer
      Res 1992;52:1006-12).

      Pazopanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGFR, PDGFR and KIT with a dual
      activity both as an antiangiogenic and also and anti-tumoral agent (Kumar et al. Mol Cancer
      Ther2007;6:2012-2021, Hurwitz et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:4220-4227). Pazopanib seems to
      have a better toxicity profile versus the other antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and
      has already shown activity in several tumor types like renal cell carcinoma (Sternberg et al.
      J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 5021), soft tissue sarcomas (Sleijfer et al. J Clin Oncol
      2009;27:3126-32), hepatocellular carcinoma (Yau et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3561),
      colorectal cancer (Brady et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst.4133), and thyroid cancers (Bible
      et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3521).

      The Spanish Group for Research in Neuroendocrine Tumors (GETNE) group is an active Member
      inside of the GENET group and has a large tradition in clinical trials in NETs. The
      investigators hypothesize that pazopanib may have at least as good activity and better safety
      profile than other VEGFR inhibitors in progressive advanced or metastatic NET tumors derived
      from the digestive tract.

             study-specific procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment
             and follow‑up.

             Procedures conducted as part of the subject's clinical routine (e.g., blood count,
             imaging study) and obtained prior to signing the consent form might be used for
             screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures have been conducted as
             specified in the protocol.

             baseline and within 12 months prior to baseline. The previous scans will be used to
             classify the patient as having progressive disease at baseline according to RECIST
             criteria. Octreoscan results may be used to document progressive disease at baseline,
