      The purpose of this study is to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose and dosing regimen of
      LY2090314 in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with advanced/metastatic
      cancer. Part A of this study will consist of dose escalation of the study regimen, and Part B
      will consist of an expanded cohort to confirm the dose provided from Part A.

    <description>In Part A, intravenous (IV) doses of LY2090314 starting at 10 mg will be given on day 1 of cycle 1 (28 days) followed by 10 mg dose of LY2090314, 500 mg/m^2 IV dose of pemetrexed, and 5 or 6 AUC IV dose of carboplatin on day 8 of cycle 1. In Cycle 2, pemetrexed and carboplatin will be given on day 1 at same dose administered in cycle 1. In Cycle 3 and beyond, LY2090314, pemetrexed and carboplatin will be given on day 1 in the same dose administered in cycle 1. Cycles 2 and beyond are 21 days in length. Doses of LY2090314 will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. In Part B, dose determined by Part A will be administered.
Patients may continue the combination treatment if they are receiving therapeutic benefit until they fulfill one of the criteria for discontinuation.</description>
