  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to identify best practices for improving health outcomes for patients
      with asthma using comparative effectiveness research within an Agency for Healthcare Research
      and Quality (AHRQ) Practice-Based Research Network (PBRN). This goal will be achieved by
      completing the following aims: (1) Create a centralized database for comparative
      effectiveness research on asthma by combining clinical and billing data from one of the
      largest healthcare systems in the country (Carolinas Healthcare System) with data from the
      school system, Medicaid, and patient and community-level datasets; (2) Deploy a fully
      developed integrated approach to asthma management based on the Chronic Care Model; (3)
      Develop and implement a &quot;shared decision making&quot; approach for asthmatic patients from
      disadvantaged backgrounds; (4) Implement an electronic data collection system for an existing
      CDC funded school-based asthma intervention that will allow program evaluation and link
      school nurses with providers; (5) Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these three
      asthma management strategies on: overall healthcare consumption and medical costs; quality of
      life, school absenteeism and performance; asthma clinical measures; and medication
      utilization; and (6) Disseminate findings across the state via the statewide PBRN and other
      network partners. This project has the potential to impact over 30,000 asthma patients across
      the Carolinas including many patients from disadvantaged backgrounds.

    <description>Group A will consist of 20 primary care clinics who are part of the Carolinas Healthcare System network but have not yet adopted the Electronic Medical Record System. These practices do use the same billing databases as the remaining clinics, allowing easy identification of asthma patients and their health services utilization patterns. Data from the billing systems will be used to retrospectively populate a database for these clinics from January 2009 forward.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group B - EMR Control Practices</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>There are currently 65 primary care practices within the Carolinas Healthcare System network that have electronic medical record with decision support (EAP)access at baseline. These practices will serve as a second level of control for comparison with the intervention groups. Each of these practices is currently using Cerner PowerChart and at the start of the study and will have access to the asthma decision support tools; an electronically generated Asthma Action Plan (AAP); and a built-in system of population management reports which will be pushed to the practices on an on-going basis to help in patient recall and management. The EAP approach to care has been developed with input from clinicians, hospital administrators, hospital information services personnel, and Cerner consultants.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>C Integrated Approach to Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>There are 10 practices within the Carolinas Healthcare System (CHS) network that have already received additional training for improving outcomes for patients with chronic diseases termed the Integrated Approach to Care (IAC). This IAC approach developed by CHS is based on the Chronic Care Model (CCM). The IAC approach includes a heavy emphasis on the use of health information technology that practices receive during the initial EAP rollout.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group D - Shared Decision Making (SDM)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This approach has great potential for improved patient outcomes and provides an additional step in the successful implementation of patient self-management. The research team will develop the SDM intervention during the first 6 months of the study. In particular, the Shared decision making (SDM) intervention will be designed to be deployed within the 4 large clinics that care for the majority of the community's underserved and disadvantaged patients. The SDM intervention development will be overseen by the study advisory board and actively recruit providers from within the clinics for feedback about the intervention.</description>

    <description>the research team will start an electronic data capture system linking school data and the clinical EMR (Cerner Power Chart) that will be implemented over the first year. Flow of data between schools and the hospital system will allow the children who have a regular source of care as well as those without a medical home to be treated with a unified asthma program by the school nurse and the hospital system.</description>
