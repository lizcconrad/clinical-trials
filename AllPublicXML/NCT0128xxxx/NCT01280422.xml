      The doctor's overridden rate for Drug-drug interaction (DDI) alert systems was 85-95% in
      foreign and there was more than 90% overridden rate in Taiwan. Why DDI alerts systems which
      spent much time and money to establish could not use medicinal information to increase drug
      safety? One of the reasons which induced to override was that health care thought there were
      too much DDI alerts and high false alerts.

      The difference between DDI alert systems from pharmacists to confirm drug-drug interaction
      was that pharmacists not only confirmed ordering drug at the same time but also checked the
      other drug information such as frequency, rote and refill etc. Therefore, DDI alert systems
      which were established by drug code alone would induce a lot of false alerts.

      In order to study how much false alert rate in drug-drug interactions, this research selected
      most common drug-drug interaction which was antacids and antibiotics. Antacids were most
      self-payment so this research needed to analyze ROCDR (Establishing a Multi-Center,
      Longitudinal, Research-Oriented Clinical Data Repository for Clinical Research). The aim was
      to study how many drug-drug interactions and false alerts from antacids and antibiotics and
      analyze the difference in different department. Finally, proposing advice and assessment for
      building drug-drug interaction alerts system to strength drug information system and increase
      drug safety.

          -  Database: ROCDR (multicenter clinical database)

          -  The pharmacists defined six rules which were based on medical knowledge for true
