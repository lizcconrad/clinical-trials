  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence suggests that bariatric surgery is a relevant treatment for severely obese
      patients, especially those with metabolic complications, as it significantly reduces weight,
      hypertension and ameliorates glycemic control. Its action on adipose tissue distribution and
      in particular on epicardial adipose tissue EAT remains unknown. Whether metabolic improvement
      is associated with EAT reduction is also unknown.

      The researchers thus investigated the effect of bariatric surgery on EAT in severely obese
      patients. The primary endpoint of this study was the change in EAT amount 6 months after
      bariatric surgery.

      The best of our knowledge, no study has really addressed whether this EAT was modulated by
      diet or therapeutics like bariatric surgery. The researchers were particularly interested in
      studying the impact of bariatric surgery and of weight loss on the amount of EAT and whether
      reduction in EAT could have a positive impact on myocardial function.
