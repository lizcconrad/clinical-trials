  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dose-response relationships of azilsartan, once
      daily (QD) in participants with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension.

    <textblock>
      Hypertension is known to cause multiple organ damage by being combined with not only blood
      pressure but also other hemodynamics, endocrinological/metabolic abnormalities and genetic
      factors. This becomes a medically and medical-economically significant problem in Japan The
      significance of early treatment of hypertension and of long-term control of blood pressure
      has been increasing year by year.

      Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited invented TAK-536 (azilsartan), an angiotensin II
      receptor blocker for decreasing blood pressure. This study investigating the efficacy and
      safety of azilsartan using candesartan cilexetil, a widely used antihypertensive drug, as a
      reference control.
