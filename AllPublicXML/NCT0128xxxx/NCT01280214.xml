      Comparing the effectiveness of subconjunctival and peribulbar Triamcinolone injection to
      systemic Steroid therapy for patients with active thyroid orbitopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local Steroid treatment may help in active thyroid orbitopathy. till today, systemic Steroids
      are the treatment for active thyroid orbitopathy which is associated with systemic adverse
      effects.

      In this study the investigators want to compare the effectiveness of local Triamcinolone
      therapy for active thyroid orbitopathy.

    <measure>Comparing the effectiveness of subconjunctival and peribulbar Triamcinolone injection to systemic Steroid therapy for patients with active thyroid orbitopathy .</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Every month, each participant will undergo several tests : blood sugar, full ocular examination, color test, visual field and ultrasound test for measuring the thickness of extraocular muscles.Clinical activity score for thyroid orbitopathy will be assesed too. The results of the clinical and ultrasonogrophic findings will determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
A patient with deterioration of thyroid orbitopathy during the research, will be treated by systemic Steroids in addition to the local injections.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To check if the level of TSH Receptor antibodies are affected by the local injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>A blood test for TSH Receptor antibodies will be taken for every patient at the beginnig of the research and after 4 months.</description>
