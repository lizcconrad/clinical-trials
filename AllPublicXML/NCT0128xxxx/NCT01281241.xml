  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to investigate mechanical alternans and MTWA in patients with heart
      failure caused by coronary artery disease to demonstrate a possible correlation between these
      two phenomena.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with severe heart failure and aortic valve disease mechanical alternans or pulsus
      alternans (a condition in which there is a beat-to-beat oscillation in the strength of
      cardiac muscle at a constant heart rate) is observed.

      The mechanisms linking mechanical to electrophysiological dysfunction in heart failure are
      still under investigation, but impaired calcium cycling is the most striking abnormality of
      failing myocytes, and is most responsible for contractile dysfunction. Yet it remains unclear
      how this influences susceptibility to arrhythmias.

      The MTWA is suggested as a risk marker to identify high risk patients for potential VTEs but
      the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. The aim of this study is to
      investigate this in a clinical setting by measuring LV parameters using a PV loop conductance
      catheter and generate TWA recording simultaneously to demonstrate a possible correlation
      between these two phenomena in patients with ischemic heart failure and find out if MTWA
      could turn into a more valuable risk factor.

      Our hypothesis is that alternating changes in LV filling explains the electrocardiogenesis of
      TWA by changing the position of the heart relative to the body surface electrodes in an
      alternating way.
