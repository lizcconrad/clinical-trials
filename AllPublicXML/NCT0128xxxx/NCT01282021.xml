      Alloimmunization to blood products in transfused patients is a recognized management
      challenge in the clinical setting. In particular the ethnic and racial specificity of RBC
      antigens and the limited availability of matched healthy volunteer blood donors have
      intensified the dilemma. The presence of low prevalence clinically significant RBC antigens
      among minorities account for the higher rate of alloimmunization observed in patients from
      this group. This is partly due to the racial and ethnic differences between the blood donor
      and recipient populations in the US.

      The increasing number of new Ethiopian-American immigrants in the US presenting to the health
      care system with blood transfusion requirements makes understanding the unique transfusion
      needs of this minority population imperative. Although the majority of African Americans
      claim origin to West Africa, Ethiopians, being from East Africa, represent a rapidly growing
      population in the United States. Furthermore, identifying genetic similarities and
      disparities to their West African counterparts will certainly have clinical implications in
      terms of transfusion support and disease modifiers. This additional information would help in
      understanding the natural history and transfusion requirements of certain debilitating
      diseases, such as Sickle Cell Disease, which are known to occur more commonly in African
      Americans. Identifying ethnically and racially similar individuals could assist in recruiting
      healthy volunteer donors with similar RBC antigen profiles potentially supplementing the rare
      donor pool.

      Although extensive archeological and sporadic serologic RBC antigen studies have been
      conducted in Ethiopia there are no population wide RBC antigen molecular studies. Our study
      population is selected by altitude and migration history. Ethiopia being in close proximity
      to Red Sea in the northeast, Indian Ocean in the southeast and the rest of Africa in the
      south/west has diverse population.

      The study is a population based analysis of genetic variation of blood group antigens in
      three distinct and conserved Ethiopian sub-populations. Statistical analysis using Chi-square
      tests will be performed for each blood group antigen to detect differences in the
      distribution between the three sub-populations. The investigators will travel to Ethiopia to
      collect blood samples which will be analyzed in DTM at NIH using the standard serologic
      methods and currently available molecular genotyping systems. Samples will also be stored for
      future high throughput sequencing analysis and other studies.

      The study will be a systematic analysis of the distribution of blood group antigens in
      Ethiopian sub-populations. Furthermore, new variants could be detected allowing insight in
      correlations of particular genotypes and phenotypes.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals &lt; 18 years of age will be excluded from the study. The study is a population
        study and the information obtained from individuals above 18 years is not expected to be
        different from those who are under 18 years old. Also, the need to involve adults to
        consent individuals under 18 years old would be complicated. All donors should be healthy
        volunteer individuals at the time of sample collection. Any potential donor with physical
        and mental disability, individuals with known infectious and/or non-infectious diseases,
        and pregnant women, are excluded from the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy Volunteers greater than or equal to 18 year of age. Volunteer healthy donors above
        the age of 18 years, who have lived in the area since birth, and are at least 6 or 7
        generation from endogenous families in the region, will be recruited. A detailed ancestral
        line of descent (pedigree) is not mandatory to the study and will not be performed.
        Individuals residing in rural regions are mostly conserved and it may be possible that some
        donors could be closely related. However, to identify as diverse a population of potential
        blood donors as possible, and avoid dilution of ancestral genes blood samples will be
        collected from individuals known to reside in the region for generations and not known to
        be closely related. Donors will be recruited through the local schools, churches, and
        community organizations. The oral consent will include a question where each donor will be
        asked if anyone in his/her family is also donating a sample, and, if so, how close the
        relationship is to that individual. Blood collection will be on a firstcome, first serve
        basis; individuals will be made aware that only one person among a group of close relatives
        will be included in the study.

        The study will be conducted in coordination with Addis Ababa University Medical Faculty and
        the regional Health Offices in collaboration with Ethiopian Red Cross. The local PI, Dr.
        Amha Gebgremedhin, is a member of the Addis Ababa University Medical faculty, Department of
        Hematology, residing in Addis Ababa. The local health centers in the three regions listed
        above will be used as centers for sample collection.
