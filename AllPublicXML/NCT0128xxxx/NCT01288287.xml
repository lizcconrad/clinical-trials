  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if early clinical response at 12 weeks to Certolizumab Pegol (CZP, Cimzia ®)
      therapy in adult Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients is a predictor of better long term
      clinical response at 18 months compared with a lack of clinical response at 12 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical response will be assessed by the percentage of patients achieving a reduction from
      Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-joint count (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate)
      [DAS28(ESR)] score of greater than 1.2 points, which is considered the minimum clinically
      important difference.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Disease Activity Score (DAS) Response at 78 Weeks Where DAS Response is Defined as a Reduction From Baseline in DAS 28-joint Count (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) [DAS28(ESR)] Score of Greater Than 1.2 Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28(ESR) is calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC), ESR (mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm). 28 joints are examined using:
DAS28(ESR) = 0.56 * √(TJC) + 0.28* √(SJC) + 0.70* ln(ESR) + 0.014* PtGADA, with TJC=0 to 28, SJC=0 to 28, PtGADA=0 to 100 mm, ESR=0 to infinite mm/hour but ESR values of greater 250 mm/h are typically measurement errors.
DAS28(ESR) ranges from 0 to around 10 with lower scores indicating less disease activity.</description>

    <description>Percentage of patients achieving good, moderate, or no EULAR clinical response, where good response is defined as DAS28(ESR) ≤ 3.2 and decrease from baseline by &gt; 1.2; moderate response is defined as achievement of one of the following:

DAS28(ESR) &gt; 3.2 and ≤ 5.1 and decrease from baseline &gt; 0.6,

        <description>DAS28(ESR) is calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC), ESR (mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm). 28 joints are examined using:
DAS28(ESR) = 0.56 * √(TJC) + 0.28* √(SJC) + 0.70* ln(ESR) + 0.014* PtGADA, with TJC=0 to 28, SJC=0 to 28, PtGADA=0 to 100 mm, ESR=0 to infinite mm/hour but ESR values of greater 250 mm/h are typically measurement errors.
DAS28(ESR) ranges from 0 to around 10 with lower scores indicating less disease activity.</description>
