  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homelessness, also name the fourth world, is a growing public health problem worldwide.
      Previous studies showed that up to 30% of the homeless people reported pruritus that often
      results in itchy lesions, which expose them to bacterial skin infections.

      The investigators therefore conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to
      test the hypothesis that a single oral dose of ivermectin was effective in significantly
      reducing the prevalence of pruritus in a sheltered homeless population.
