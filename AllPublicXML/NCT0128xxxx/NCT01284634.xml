      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of cannabidiol (CBD) on liver triglyceride
      (liver fat) in subjects with fatty liver disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 10 week (2-10 day screening, eight week treatment period and one week follow-up),
      randomized, partially-blind study will assess the effect of CBD in subjects with raised liver
      triglycerides (liver fat ≥ 5%).

      Eligible subjects will enter the study at a Screening Visit (Visit 1, Day -10 to -2) and
      commence a two to ten day screening period, before returning for a baseline visit (Visit 2,
      Day 1).

      During the fasted Screening Visit, study-related observations will include: informed consent,
      demographics, medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs,
      weight, height and concomitant medications.

      Subjects will have the following assessments performed:

        1. Fasting lipid profile blood sample

        2. Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c &amp; fasting serum insulin

        3. Safety blood tests (haematology and biochemistry)

        4. Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen)

        5. CAGE Questionnaire to assess alcohol dependency

        6. Body weight will be measured and BMI calculated

        7. Pregnancy test (if appropriate)

        8. Liver triglyceride content (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)) scan unless there is
           documented history of a liver fat content equal to or above 5% as measured by Magnetic
           Resonance Imaging (MRI)/MRS or a biopsy within the last two months prior to this
           screening visit. Where subjects (and/or carers) feel the scan poses a significant burden
           (in addition to the other visit procedures), the fasted scan may be undertaken
           separately with the remaining visit procedures completed within 72 hours of the visit.
           Suitable subjects will be invited to return fasted for a Baseline Visit (Visit 2, Day
           1). The following measurements will be made at Visit 2, prior to study medication being
           dispensed:

      1) Safety assessments (Adverse Event(s) (AE)) and vital signs and a review of concomitant
      medications) 2) Body weight measurements / adipose tissue distribution. Body fat content and
      visceral adiposity will be assessed by MRI/MRS. Where subjects (and/or carers) feel the scan
      poses a significant burden (in addition to the other visit procedures), the fasted scan may
      be undertaken separately with the remaining visit procedures completed within 72 hours of the
      visit. 3) Fasting lipid blood sample 4) Fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin 5) Safety
      blood sample (haematology and biochemistry) 6) Urinalysis 7) Liver triglyceride content
      (MRI/MRS scan). Where subjects (and/or carers) feel the scan poses a significant burden (in
      addition to the other visit procedures), the fasted scan may be undertaken separately with
      the remaining visit procedures completed within 72 hours of the visit.

      8) Other assessments (blood sample for plasma CBD levels; Physical Activity Questionnaire;
      Food Frequency Questionnaire) Subjects will be issued study medication and advised to take it
      twice daily as instructed.

      There will be a safety follow-up telephone call at Week 1, Day 8 (Visit 3) which will involve
      a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to concomitant medications. Compliance with
      IMP administration will also be discussed.

      There will be a second safety follow-up telephone call at Week 2, Day 15 (Visit 4), which
      will involve a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to concomitant medications.
      Compliance with IMP administration will also be discussed.

      A further visit will take place mid-treatment (Visit 5, Week 4, Day 29) where the following
      assessments will be performed:

        1. Safety assessments (AEs, vital signs, review of concomitant medications and physical
           exam)

        2. Safety blood sample (haematology, biochemistry and non-fasting glucose)

        3. Urinalysis

        4. IMP compliance review There will be a safety follow-up telephone call at Week 6, Day 43
           (Visit 6) which will involve a review of any new or ongoing AEs and changes to
           concomitant medications. Compliance with IMP administration will also be discussed.

      A further fasted visit will take place at the end of treatment (Visit 7, Day 57) where the
      following assessments will be performed:

        1. Safety assessments (AEs, vital signs, review of concomitant medications, physical exam
           (including body weight measurements and BMI calculation), ECG and pregnancy test as
           appropriate)

        2. Body weight measurements / adipose tissue distribution

        3. Fasting lipid blood sample

        4. Fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin

        5. Safety blood sample (haematology and biochemistry)

        6. Urinalysis (including drugs of abuse screen)

        7. Liver triglyceride content (MRI/MRS scan). Where subjects (and/or carers) feel the scan
           poses a significant burden (in addition to the other visit procedures), the fasted scan
           may be undertaken separately with the remaining visit procedures completed within 72
           hours of the visit.

        8. Other assessments (blood sample for plasma CBD levels; Physical Activity Questionnaire;
           Food Frequency Questionnaire)

        9. IMP compliance review There will be a final safety follow-up telephone call at Visit 8
           (seven days after completion or withdrawal), involving a review of any new or ongoing
           AEs and changes to concomitant medications.

If one or more measurements were missing for a site, then the mean was calculated over the available measurement(s) for that site.

          <description>Skin fold thickness measurements were the mean of three measurements per site calculated for each subject. If one or more measurements were missing for a site, then the mean was calculated over the available measurement(s) for that site.
