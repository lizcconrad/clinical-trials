  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a controlled, cross-over, acute flavonoid intervention trial with younger and
      older adults. Subjects consumed a blueberry beverage during one visit and a control beverage
      on another. Cognitive function pre drink was assessed, blood and urine samples were taken as
      well as blood pressure and a measure of vascular reactivity. These outcome measures were
      taken at 2 and 5 hours post drink.

      It was predicted that the flavonoids in the blueberry drink would lead to improved
      performance on the cognitive tests and vascular reactivity measure compared to following the
      control drink. It was thought this could be due to increased vaso-dilation and improving
      blood flow to the brain which was investigated in an extension to the project where a sample
      of individuals underwent brain imaging in an MRI scanner pre and post a blueberry and a
      control drink.

  <detailed_description>

      The control drink was matched to the blueberry drink for other bioactive compounds which may
      have affected cognition, specifically sugars and vitamin C. Volunteers were healthy, not on
      any medication, without high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high BMI, diabetes or other
      medical conditions. Older adults were aged 61-75 years and younger adults 18-26 years.

      Blood and urine samples will be analysed for flavonoid levels and Brain Derived Neurotrophic
      Factor, a biomarker of memory and learning, flavonoids may lead to increased BDNF production
      through the ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway.

      Flavonoids may also increase nitric oxide production and improve the flexibility of the blood
      vessels hence the measure of vascular reactivity using the Digital Volume Pulse machine. This
      can lead to increased vaso-dilation and blood flow to the brain, therefore an fMRI study was
      carried out the investigate this using arterial spin labeling following acute blueberry
      supplementation compared to a control drink.
