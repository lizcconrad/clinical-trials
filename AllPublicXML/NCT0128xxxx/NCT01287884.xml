    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify a correlation between the pH and pCO2 in
      arterial and venous blood. The secondary objectives include a correlation of pulse oximetry
      and arterial pO2 along with subgroup analyses of specific patient populations such as
      congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetic ketoacidosis,
      pneumonia, overdose, and trauma.
