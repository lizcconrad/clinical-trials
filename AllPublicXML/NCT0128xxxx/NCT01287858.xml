    <textblock>
      AC430 will be administered, orally under fasting conditions (fasting 4 hours before and 2
      hours after dosing) with approximately 240 mL of water either once daily or twice daily. It
      is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple
      oral doses of AC430.
