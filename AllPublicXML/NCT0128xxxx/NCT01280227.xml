  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Cancer or congenital heart disease (CHD) experience complex, physical,
      psychosocial and behavioural symptoms and problems due to the illness, treatment, and medical
      procedures. To help children cope with their problems and prevent psychological distress, the
      investigators developed SiSom, a support system to help children with cancer or CHD report
      their symptoms and problems in an age-adjusted manner on a touch-pad, portable computer.

      This quasi-experimental study with 202 children age 7-12 with CHD or cancer will test the
      following hypotheses: When children use SiSom to report their symptoms and problems, and this
      information is provided to their clinicians in their outpatient consultations:

        -  Children and parents will experience less anxiety.

        -  Children and parents will be more satisfied with the outpatient visit.

        -  There will be greater congruence between children's reported symptoms and problems and
           those addressed by their clinicians as evidenced in documented patient care.

      To better understand the mechanisms by which these effects may occur, the investigators will
      also explore:

        -  Differences between control and experimental groups in patient-provider communication in
           terms of instrumental and affective behaviour, participation, initiative and person
           addressed;

        -  The relationships among outcomes of patient-provider communication, congruence between
           patients' reported symptoms and those addressed by their clinicians and children's and
           parents' anxiety and satisfaction; and how these relationships differ between treatment
           and control conditions.

      Finally, the investigators will investigate time requirements, ease of use and usefulness of
      SiSom by children and clinicians.

      For analyses the investigators will use inferential statistics and qualitative analyses of
      the video-taped consultation sessions. This study will contribute to improving
      patient-centred care for a particularly vulnerable population, and to a better understanding
      of the triadic communication and interactions among child-parent and clinician.
