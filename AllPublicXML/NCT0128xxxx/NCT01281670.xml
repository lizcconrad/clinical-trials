  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle force, explosive strength and vertical jump height are important parameters
      determining the performance of athletes. Traditionally, high intensity resistance training,
      explosive strength training and plyometric training are used to improve athletes'
      performance. Recently, whole body vibration training is recommended for increasing muscle
      force and explosive strength, because vibrating platform could provide high gravitational
      acceleration to activate muscle activation and sensory input to spinal reflex. Design:
      Prospective and randomized control study. Subjects: Healthy male subjects with regular
      training or competition at least 6 hours per week. Methods: H-reflex, V-wave, triceps surae
      activation level and rate of force development are measured at pre-training, mid-training
      (5th week) and post-training. Subjects will receive 8 weeks, 3 times/week, training programs
      including plyometric jumping or static squat on whole body vibration platform. Data analysis:
      Data will be analyzed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and two-way ANOVA
      will be used for data analysis.

    <description>In terms of evoked spinal reflexes, modulations of spinal inhibitory inter-neuronal circuits are often assessed by the Ia-afferent-mediated H-reflex. Results of H reflexes in studies with training are tightly coupled with excitability changes of small alpha motor neurons. The first volitional (V) wave, an electrophysiological variant of the H-reflex, is used to indicate the net excitation of the motorneurone pool.</description>
