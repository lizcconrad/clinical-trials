    <textblock>
      This study aims to 1) implement a culturally and contextually rooted innovative multifoci,
      social marketing intervention involving societal focused media campaign elements to break
      down the barriers and facilitate timely and appropriate screening practices for cervical
      cancer; 2) measure cervical cancer stigma from a culturally relevant theoretical and
      conceptual framework; and 3) assess the influence of stigma on hindering seeking the PAP
      test. Further, this is an international study that will bring together a multi-disciplinary
      investigatory team, community advocates and State health agencies to deliver a social
      marketing intervention in Southern California (the Inland Empire region specifically) and
      Trinidad and Tobago.

    <description>To evaluate the ability of the social media intervention &quot;End Stigma End Fear, End Cervical Cancer&quot; to counter stigma of cervical cancer, by determining whether, among disadvantaged women who acknowledge needing a Pap test at pre-intervention baseline, degree of exposure to the intervention is associated with the following endpoints at 3 months after the intervention is implemented:
post-intervention change in stigma score relative to pre-intervention, and
Pap testing (scored as 0=made no attempt, 1=made some attempt but did not get tested, 2=obtained Pap test).</description>
