      The aim of this study is to determine whether a powerful technique of noninvasive brain
      stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), could reduce cigarette smoking
      and constitute a treatment of tobacco addiction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco is estimated to cause more than 5 millions yearly deaths in the developed world.
      Although most smokers would like to quit, relapse rates remain high. It seems that this
      relapse is linked with the process of craving, which is a powerful desire to smoke elicited
      by smoking deprivation or exposure to situations or cues that are associated with smoking.
      Neuroimaging studies have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and
      especially the right part, is critically involved in processing the craving of smoking.
      Increasing the activity of the DLPFC by noninvasive brain stimulation has been demonstrated
      to be effective in decreasing craving symptoms in cigarette smokers.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether a powerful technique of noninvasive brain
      stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), could reduce cigarette smoking.
      tDCS is a painless and safe brain stimulation method capable of modulating cortical
      excitability. The nature of these modulations depends on stimulation polarity: anodal tDCS is
      thought to cause neuronal depolarisation and thus enhancing cortical excitability whereas
      cathodal stimulation is proposed to reduce excitability. The investigators hypothesize that
      anodal tDCS applied repetitively to the right DLPFC could constitute a treatment of tobacco
      addiction. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a sham-tDCS-controlled, randomized,
      double-blind study.
