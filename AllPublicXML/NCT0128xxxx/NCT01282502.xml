      This study combines midostaurin (PKC412) with radiation and a standard chemotherapy drug call
      5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for subjects with advanced rectal cancer. Midostaurin is a type of
      kinase inhibitor which works by blocking proteins associated with cancer cell growth.
      Previous studies also suggest that midostaurin may help increase the effectiveness of
      radiation therapy. In this research we are looking for the highest dose of midostaurin that
      can be given safely in combination with standard chemoradiation.

      Midostaurin capsules will be taken by mouth for 8 weeks. For the first 2 weeks midostaurin
      will be taken alone (no chemoradiation). After 2 weeks standard chemoradiation will be added
      to the midostaurin regimen. Subjects receive midostaurin and chemoradiation for an additional
      6 weeks. Physical exams will be done weekly. Blood samples will be taken and an optional
      tumor biopsy will be performed in week 2.

      4-5 weeks after completing chemoradiation and midostaurin subjects will undergo surgery as
      standard of care. Tumor tissue from the surgery will be used for research purposes. A Ct scan
      of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed.

      After completion of surgery, subjects will have an end of study visit with physical exam,
      blood tests. CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed yearly for 5 years.
