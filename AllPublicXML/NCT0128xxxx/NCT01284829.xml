    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study which aims to validate a new diagnostic approach in the tissue
      characterization of adrenal tumors indeterminate on conventional imaging. For this purpose,
      it is not necessary to have a control group since the diagnostic accuracy in a well defined
      subset of patients.

      Primary objective The primary objective is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET,
      particularly the SUVmax tumor/liver ratio, in the diagnosis of indeterminate adrenal tumors
      on conventional imaging.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the tumor SUVmax, and SUVmax of the tumor/mean SUV
           of the liver.

        -  To evaluate the relationship between SUVmax tumor/liver ratio and Weiss score.

        -  To evaluate the impact of the use of FDG-PET on the treatment options.

        -  To evaluate the economic impact of FDG-PET in the management of indeterminate adrenal
           tumors (ancillary study).
