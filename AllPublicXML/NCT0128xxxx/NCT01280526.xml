      This study is an open label, multicenter study with two phases:

        -  A dose escalation phase of Romidepsin administered IV at day 1 and 8 or at day 1 without
           day 8 in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone
           (CHOP)administered every 3 weeks for 8 cycles in patients with T-cell lymphoma.

        -  An expansion phase in order to assess the safety and the efficacy of the association of
           the recommended dose of Romidepsin associated with CHOP in a population of patients with
           T-cell lymphoma.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of the combination and the
      recommended dose (RD) of Romidepsin when administered in association with CHOP in a
      population of patients with newly diagnosed Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) as measured by
      the toxicities during treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the safety of the association Romidepsin and CHOP,

        -  To assess the efficacy of the association of Romidepsin and CHOP: response rate and
           complete response rate, progression-free survival, response duration and overall
           survival.
