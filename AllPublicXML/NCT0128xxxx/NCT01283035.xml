  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Akt inhibitor MK2206 is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by blocking a protein
      called protein kinase B (AKT) inside the cell. AKT interacts with other proteins in the cell
      that are part of the P13K/AKT pathway, a pathway that is know to play a role in the growth of
      cancer cells. Mutations in P13K or in AKT, or changes in another protein called phosphatase
      and tensin homolog (PTEN) in this pathway can lead it to become more active than is normal.
      This study investigates how effective MK-2206 is in treating ovarian, fallopian tube, or
      primary peritoneal cancer where there are mutations in P13K or AKT or low levels of PTEN.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the activity of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in patients with recurrent grade
      2 or 3 platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, as
      measured by the frequency of patients experiencing an objective tumor response by Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria or who survive progression-free for at
      least 6 months after initiation of therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the duration of progression-free and overall survival following initiation of
      therapy with MK-2206 in the cohort of patients enrolled on this study.

      II. To determine the toxicities of MK-2206, as assessed by the active version of the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 III. To
      explore the association between select biomarkers and response to MK-2206 (as assessed by
      objective tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival) IV. To explore the
      development of feedback loop activation and target inhibition with MK-2206 via analysis of
      pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies in select patients enrolled in the trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Akt inhibitor MK2206 will be taken orally (PO) once a week for four weeks (one cycle).
      Treatment will continue for as long as a subject is benefiting from the study drug.

      During each cycle subjects will have a physical exam, blood samples and an electrocardiogram
      (EKG) (first 2 cycles). Every 2 cycles a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of chest, stomach area, and pelvis will be performed. Optional tumor biopsies
      may be performed.

               -  Patients may not have previously received prior AKT or PI3 kinase pathway
                  inhibitors (including mTOR inhibitors)

             illnesses that would preclude absorption of MK-2206

          -  The effects of MK-2206 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered to grade 1 or less (excepting alopecia) due to agents administered more than
             4 weeks earlier

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MK-2206

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP450 3A4 are ineligible; lists including medications and substances
             known or with the potential to interact with the CYP450 3A4 isoenzymes are provided in
             Appendix C; if the participant is taking any agent known to affect or with the
             potential to affect CYP450 3A4 isoenzymes, this should be discussed with the overall
             PI

          -  Preclinical studies demonstrated the potential of MK-2206 for induction of
             hyperglycemia in all preclinical species tested; patients with diabetes or at risk for
             hyperglycemia are eligible for this study, but the hyperglycemia should be well
             controlled on oral agents before the patient enters the trial; a fasting serum glucose
             of &gt; 130 mg/dL or a HgbA1c &gt; 7.5 mg/dL will exclude patients from entry on study;
             patients requiring insulin for control of their hyperglycemia are excluded from entry
             on this study

          -  Preclinical studies indicated transient changes in QTc interval during MK-2206
             treatment; prolongation of QTc interval is potentially a safety concern while on
             MK-2206 therapy; cardiovascular: baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt; 470 msec
             (female) will exclude patients from entry on study; a list of medications that may
             cause QTc interval prolongation are listed in Appendix D, and should be avoided by
             patients entering on trial

          -  Due to a high incidence of bradycardia by Holter monitor, preexisting significant
             heart block or baseline bradycardia due to cardiac disease will exclude patients from
             treatment with MK-2206

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Current signs and/or symptoms of bowel obstruction

          -  Current dependency on IV hydration or TPN

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-2206 is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but
             potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with MK-2206, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with MK-2206; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances; individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: breast cancer
             in situ, cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             MK-2206; iIn addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients may not use natural herbal products or other &quot;folk remedies&quot; while
             participating in this study
