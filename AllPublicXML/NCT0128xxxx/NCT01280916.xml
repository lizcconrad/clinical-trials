    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this exploratory and developmental study is to evaluate a mind-body
      intervention for relapse prevention for women in addiction treatment. The proposed
      intervention, Mindful Awareness in Body-Oriented Therapy (MABT), is a novel mind-body
      intervention designed to enhance embodiment and to facilitate mindfulness through the
      combination of massage, body awareness exercises and the acquisition of mindfulness skills.
      The treatment goals of MABT include reduction of avoidant coping responses, increase of
      emotional-regulation, and decrease of trauma symptoms through access to and acceptance (vs.
      avoidance) of sensory and emotional experience. These are thought to be important for relapse
      prevention given the positive association between stress, negative affect and relapse; and
      risk of relapse associated with PTSD symptoms. Mind-body interventions in relapse prevention
      are of increased clinical and scientific interest, particularly for the potential to overcome
      automatic response patterns that are associated with lapse and relapse in substance use
      treatment. This proposal falls within the current NIDA research portfolio focus on the
      development of interventions that will help people better cope with stress, negative affect,
      and trauma.

      Specific Aims:

        -  Aim 1: To examine feasibility of recruitment to and retention in MABT as an adjunct to
           substance abuse treatment. Specifically, to describe a) study enrollment and barriers to
           recruitment, b) sample characteristics, c) response to randomization, d) session
           attendance, and e) loss to follow-up.

        -  Aim 2: To describe MABT acceptability to study participants and substance abuse
           treatment staff.

        -  Aim 3: To compare the effect of body-oriented therapy plus treatment-as-usual vs.
           treatment-as-usual only on reported days abstinent for overall substance use and primary
           drug use among women receiving substance abuse treatment, in order to estimate the
           effect size. Secondary analyses will examine for intervention effects on related
           outcomes including days abstinence on biochemical screens for substance use, body
           connection indicators, avoidant coping, stress reactivity, co-morbid psychological
           distress, and physical well-being.
