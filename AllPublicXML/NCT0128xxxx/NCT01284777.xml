    <textblock>
      Accurate characterization of malignant cells obtained via thoracocentesis is of paramount
      importance in the management of cancer patients. The identification of novel biomarkers may
      in that regard considerably improve the diagnostic approach of these pleural effusions, guide
      therapeutic decisions, particularly with respect to targeted therapies, and offer helpful
      prognostic information. Nuclear anomalies represent the cornerstone of the cytologic and/or
      histopathologic diagnosis of malignant cells. The nuclear matrix is a fundamental constituent
      of the nuclear architecture via its interaction with the nuclear membrane, but is also
      directly involved with DNA and RNA processing. Prior studies have suggested that in some
      cancers, the lamins, a major constituent of the nuclear matrix, have different patterns of
      expression or nuclear localization that could potentially have prognostic implications. Our
      project aims at studying the constituents of the nuclear matrix of malignant cells isolated
      for pleural fluid in patients with metastatic disease, both of bronchogenic or
      non-bronchogenic origin, which, to our knowledge, has not yet been done. Both proteomic
      (localization by immunofluorescence and expression by Western-Blot) and genomic (microarray,
      CGH type) analyses will be undertaken to identify microrearrangements in the genes of
      interest. The primary aim is to identify specific biomarkers to more accurately characterize
      malignant cells in metastatic pleural disease.
