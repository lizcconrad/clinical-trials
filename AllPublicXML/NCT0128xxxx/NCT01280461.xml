  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multi-center, open-label, comparative and randomized study in evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of cefoperazone/sulbactam versus cefepime for the treatment of
      hospital-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia. The investigator will
      determine the total duration of study therapy, as clinically indicated. The minimum duration
      of study therapy will be 7 days and the maximum allowable duration of study therapy will be
      21 days.

      Patients fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio)to
      receive intravenous cefoperazone/sulbactam or intravenous cefepime for 7~21days. Vitamin K1
      10mg will be administered to cefoperazone/sulbactam group every 24 hours.

      The assessment of clinical sign and symptoms of pneumonia and microbiological tests will be
      performed at early post-therapy visit and test-of-cure visit.

             or patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia(HCAP*).

          -  Clinical findings

        At least two of the following signs:

          1. Cough

          2. Fever: axillary temperature &gt; 37.5℃ or tympanic temperature &gt; 38.5℃

          3. Hypothermia: axillary temperature &lt; 34℃ or tympanic temperature &lt; 35℃

          4. Purulent sputum production or respiratory secretion

          5. Total peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count &gt; 10,000/mm3; or &gt; 15% band forms,
             regardless of total peripheral white count; or leucopenia with total WBC &lt; 4500/mm3

          6. Auscultatory findings on pulmonary examination of rales and/or evidence of pulmonary
             consolidation (dullness on percussion, bronchial breath sounds, or egophony)

          7. Hypoxemia (defined as a partial O2 pressure &lt;60 mmHg while the patient was breathing
             normal air or a decrease in the partial O2 pressure of ≧25% from an initial value)

               -  Radiographic findings The chest radiograph should show the presence of a new or
                  progressive infiltration on the chest X-ray film

               -  Microbiologic criteria If sputum specimen is available and collected, both tests
                  are mandatory with at least one of the following results is positive:

        (1) Within 24 hours prior to, or at the time of enrollment, all patients should have had a
        culture and susceptibility testing of respiratory secretions or sputum to study drugs
        (2)Gram stain of respiratory secretions or sputum

          -  Patient must be able to sign a written informed consent form prior to the start of the
             study procedures. If any patient is unable to give consent, it must be obtained from
             the patient's legal representative

          -  Subject has not received more than 24 hours of a parenteral antibacterial drug for the
             current pneumonia. If subject has received more than 24 hours of a parenteral

             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≧ 3X ULN (upper limit of normal); or serum creatinine,
             urea nitrogen &gt; 3X ULN
