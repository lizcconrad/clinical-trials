  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a simple, accurate, and a point-of-care, computer-based
      clinical decision support system (CDSS) not only to detect the presence of sleep apnea but
      also to predict its severity. The CDSS is based on deploying an artificial neural network
      (ANN) derived from anthropomorphic and clinical characteristics.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients with severe OSA defined as AHI≥30 can be
      diagnosed with the use of ANN without undergoing a sleep study, and that empiric management
      with auto-CPAP has similar outcomes to those who undergo a formal sleep study.
