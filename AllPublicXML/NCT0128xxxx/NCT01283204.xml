    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the antitumor activity (i.e. progression free survival, overall
      survival, response rate, etc), safety and quality of life in patient with recurrent or
      metastatic gastric cancer during 4-regimen (i.e. SP, FL/Tax, FL/Doc, FOLFOX) based
      chemotherapy. In addition, it is to evaluate efficacy and adverse events of anticancer agents
      according to the results of pharmacogenetic study.
