      This randomized controlled trial is designed to address gaps in couple-based HIV prevention
      research by focusing exclusively on HIV negative concordant couples where one or both
      partners are drug-involved. Building on prior couple-based HIV research that resulted in an
      evidence-based HIV prevention model for couples (Connect), intervention components were
      modified to address dyadic drug risk reduction and drug-related unsafe sex and a couple-based
      HIV risk reduction intervention (Connect II) was designed specifically for drug-involved, HIV
      negative concordant heterosexual couples at risk for HIV/STIs. For this RCT, couples are
      recruited primarily through street outreach in drug using locations and randomized into one
      of three arms: (1) couple-based HIV Risk Reduction condition; (2) individual-based HIV Risk
      Reduction, which delivered the same content as the couple-based condition but was provided to
      either the male or female drug-using partner alone; or (3) couple-based Wellness Promotion,
      which served as an attentional control arm. This RCT tests two major hypotheses: (1) whether
      the HIV risk reduction intervention provided to the couple or an individual partner would be
      more efficacious in decreasing number of unprotected acts of intercourse and having a lower
      cumulative incidence of biologically confirmed STIs over the 12-month follow-up period
      compared to the Wellness promotion control arm and (2) whether the couple-based HIV risk
      reduction intervention would be more likely to decrease the number of unprotected acts and
      have a lower cumulative STI incidence compared to the Individual HIV Risk reduction Arm.
