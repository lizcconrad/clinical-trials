      The aim of the investigation is to evaluate the function of two new device parts to be used
      in a NPWT system; an on-top suction device intended to transport exudate from the wound and a
      silicon cover film intended to fixate the wound filler and seal tight to the skin in order to
      keep a moist environment.
