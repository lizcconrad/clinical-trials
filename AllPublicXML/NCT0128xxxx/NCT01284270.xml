      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether some features of plaques in coronary
      arteries predispose the heart muscle to injuries during angioplasty in patients with a
      narrowing in at least one of the arteries that may need a stent placed during a heart
      catheterization. Participants undergo a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study
      before the heart catheterization to look for scarring in the heart muscle. During the heart
      catheterization, participants undergo an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) exam to look at the
      make-up of the plaques before the stent placement and the investigators will measure the
      pressures in the arteries to look at how severe the blockage is. Within 30 days after the
      heart catheterization, participants will have a second MRI done to look for any new scar in
      the heart muscle.
