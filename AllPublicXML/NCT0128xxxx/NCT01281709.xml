      The population is aging rapidly in Taiwan. It has been estimated that 15 years from now, the
      elderly population will comprise over 20% of the general population. Within an aging
      population, the prevalence of chronic illnesses can be expected to increase, and these
      patients with multiple chronic illnesses will likely need a larger allocation of available
      resources with the national health care system. In contrast to a highly-specialized medical
      environment, integrated health care, with its multitude of health and medical services
      including diagnosis, treatment, convalescence, rehabilitation, and health promotion, can
      provide a more efficient synergism between the necessary aspects of delivery, supply,
      management and organization. Literature has shown that multi-disciplinary, well-managed
      chronic illness management can increase the convenience of patient medical visits and also
      decrease medical costs. To provide patients with multiple chronic illnesses more suitable,
      efficient, and higher quality medical care, and to decrease redundant or ill-advised
      medications or procedures, as well as to encourage medical systems to further incorporate
      integrated services to advance the ideal of holistic care, the Bureau of National Health
      Insurance issued the a decree on September 15th, 2009, named &quot;Integrated care model and
      medical system-based integration plan&quot;. This questionnaire-based study was focused on
      understanding primary care physician's wish toward provision of integrated health care,
      associated knowledge and attitude, and analysis of influencing factors affecting their
      choices.
