      To evaluate the predictive value of clinical, functional (HAQ), laboratory and US variables
      in relation to disease activity and radiographic outcome in patients with RA who start
      treatment with Remicade at 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-lable, single arm study of the ultrasonographic monitoring of response to
      infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Approximately 120 subjects will be
      enrolled. Subjects will receive infliximab 3mg/kg intravenous infusion at 0, 2, 6 week, and
      then repeated every 8 weeks until 24 weeks.

      The efficacy assessment is observed by ACR response, HAQ, DAS28, sharp scores and US
      assessment at 0,2ï¼Œ6,14, 22, and 24weeks and ultrosonographic and radiographic assessments are
      conducted at 0, 6,and 24weeks.

      Subjects will be followed for AEs and SAEs up to 8 weeks following the last study treatment
      administration (see Section 6).

      The end of study is defined as the time the last subject completes the 24 weeks visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age 18-65 years, male or female and who are capable of providing informed consent,
             which must be obtained prior to any study-related procedures.

          2. Those who have a definitive diagnosis of RA based on the criteria of American College
             of Rheumatology in 1987 and have moderate to severe disease (DAS28 more than 3.2).

          3. Patients using oral corticosteroids, must have been on a stable dose of prednisone
             10mg/day or its equivalent for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. If currently not
             using corticosteroids the patient must have not received corticosteroids for at least
             4 weeks prior to screening.

          4. Patients using DMARDs, must have been on a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to
             screening. If currently not using DMARDs the patient must have not received DMARDs for
             at least 12 weeks prior to screening.

          5. If using NSAIDs or other analgesics for RA, must be on a stable dose for at least 2
             weeks prior to the first administration of study agent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient who has a known hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin proteins or other
             components of infliximab.

          2. Patient who suffers from systemic inflammatory disease whose signs and symptoms are
             expected to affect the evaluation of the study drug.

          3. Patient who has a history of receiving infliximab or any other biologics.

          4. Patient who has stage IV RA.

          5. Patient who has had or is on live viral or bacterial vaccinations within 4 weeks to
             study entry.

          6. Patient who ever suffered from chronic or recurrent infection, including but not
             limited to: chronic kidney infection, chronic thoracic cavity infection (eg.
             bronchiectasis), nasosinusitis, recurrent urinary tract infection, open, drain or
             dermal infected wound.
