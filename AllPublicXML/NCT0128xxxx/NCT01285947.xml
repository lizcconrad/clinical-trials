  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pain experience of patients who have not had
      dermatologic procedures (previously &quot;unexposed&quot;) using energy devices (lasers,
      radiofrequency, ultrasound, etc.) with patients who have previously had procedures
      (previously &quot;exposed&quot;) using energy devices. Based on previous clinical encounters,
      individuals with no prior experience with cosmetic procedures appear to experience more pain.
      However, no study to date has thoroughly examined this observation. As a result, this study
      has been designed to find a possible difference in pain perception between previously exposed
      and unexposed patients undergoing cosmetic procedures using energy devices.

      Twenty subjects will be enrolled in the study: 10 subjects who have had cosmetic procedures
      in the past and 10 subjects who have not had such procedures. For each subject, pain
      tolerance in three areas will be assessed: temple, midface/cheek, and abdomen. In two areas
      of the face (temple and midface/cheek), a small sterile needle will be inserted into the skin
      along with three applications of the following devices that are FDA approved for use on the
      face: an ultrasound device (Ulthera), a pulsed dye laser (VBeam), and a radiofrequency
      (Thermage) device. Additionally, the abdomen will receive three of these four devices in a
      randomized order: small sterile needle insertion, a pulsed dye laser (VBeam) pulse, and a
      radiofrequency (Thermage) exposure (the ultrasound device, Ulthera, will not be used on the
      abdomen because it is currently not FDA approved for this indication). Subjects will then be
      asked to rate their pain after each application at each individual site using a pain scale.
      In addition, subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding their pain experiences and
      other possibly related factors before and after the procedures.

    <description>The mean pain scores will be compared between naïve subjects and non-naïve subjects averaged over the anatomical sites: periocular (temple), midface/cheek, and abdomen and over all the different treatments.
Pain scores were recorded along a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with 0 (no pain- better) to 10 (maximal pain-worst). This is a 10 cm long line in which the subject was asked to draw a line on the scale with 0 (no pain- better) at one end to 10 (maximal pain-worst) at the other end. The drawn line was measured on the 10 cm line using a ruler to obtain the score.</description>
