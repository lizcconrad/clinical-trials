      This study is the first step in a clinical research program that aims to study the immune
      response to influenza vaccine in the elderly and then to propose a new method of
      administering the vaccine.

      Influenza can cause severe complications in patients at risk (elderly and subjects vulnerable
      because of a chronic underlying disease). Over 90% of deaths related to influenza occur in
      people aged over 65 years.

      Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. The World Health Organization
      recommends annual immunization for people at risk, including all persons aged over 65 years,
      to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality related to influenza.

      However, the immune response to influenza vaccine appears to be lower in elderly than in
      young people.
