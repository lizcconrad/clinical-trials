      Melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer, with a propensity to metastasize, and is
      resistant to most of the current therapeutic regimens. Incidence rate of melanoma in patients
      with MDM (Mal De Maleda, with SLURP-1 mutation) is much higher than normal counterpart.
      SLURP-1 (lymphocyte antigen 6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor related
      protein-1) is an allosteric agonist to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and it
      regulates epidermal homeostasis and T-cell function. The preliminary results of comparing
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 affected and 15 unaffected members
      from the family with MDM revealed that T-cell activation was impaired in PBMCs with the
      heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation. (2 of affected members developed
      melanoma.) Since there is currently no effective treatment for metastatic melanoma,
      identifying novel molecular mechanisms may lead to development of new treatments for
      metastatic melanomas.

      Previous study showed that melanoma stem cells (MSCs) are crucial in melanoma pathogenesis:
      1.Melanoma contains ABCB5, CD133 and ABCG2 positive cells had enhanced tumorigenic potential.
      2.Higher frequencies of cells capable of initiating melanoma xenografts when using IL2Rγ-/-
      NOD SCID mice. These data confirmed the interaction between T cells and MSCs.

      In this project, we will investigate the roles of SLURP-1 in melanoma and MSCs. Investigating
      and verifying the interaction between T-cells from patients with MDM and melanoma cells to
      confirm the SLURP-1 function of tumorigenesis in xenotransplant mice (IL2Rγ-/- NOD SCID)
      model. To reveal the role of SLURP-1 silencing in melanoma cell lines by using not only A2058
      , A375 and MeWo mwlanima cell lines but also ABCB5+ melanoma cells and ABCB5- melanoma cells
      through the tumorigenesis, apoptosis,angiogenesis, proliferation, melanosphere formation
      assays.

      The aim of this project is to investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of SLURP-1 in
      melanoma carcinogenesis, which may improve the development of novel treatments for melanoma.

      Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive neoplasm refractory to traditional therapies, especially
      at the metastatic stage. Furthermore, its incidence is continuously increasing during the
      last decade (1). Melanomas develop through a multistep process that from normal melanocytes
      proceeds to nevi and to radial and vertical growth phase tumors (2). During this process,
      melanomas are characterized by certain well-defined genetic alterations as well as frequent
      chromosomal aberrations associated with tumor progression (3). However, the molecular
      mechanisms involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of melanoma are complex and not
      entirely clear (4). Because of the intractability of metastatic melanomas with only 14% of
      the patients survive for 5 years and no effective treatments (2), understanding the
      underlying molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma and identifying molecular markers may
      lead to improvements in therapeutic approaches for metastatic melanomas.

      Mal de Meleda (MDM; OMIM 248300) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
      erythema and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles, extending to the dorsal aspects of the
      hands and feet (known as transgrediens), and perioral erythema and psoriasiform plaques on
      the elbows and knees. (5-7) Homozygous mutations of the SLURP1 gene (previously known as ARS
      component B) encoding lymphocyte antigen 6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor
      related protein-1 (SLURP-1) have been identified as the cause of MDM. (8-10) Mutations of the
      SLURP1 gene affect the expression, integrity and stability of SLURP-1 on the upper layer of
      the epidermis and in cultured mature keratinocytes. (11) Other studies also demonstrated that
      SLURP-1 acts as a positive allosteric ligand for 7-nAchR in keratinocytes, eliciting
      proapoptotic activity and differentiation. (12,13) As well as in epidermis and keratinocytes,
      the expression of SLURP-1 has been found in T cells, B cells, dendritic cells and
      macrophages. (14-15) Malignant melanoma (MM) has been reported to be the predominant
      cutaneous malignancy occurring in the hyperkeratotic area in patients with MDM. (16) The
      incidence of MM in MDM is significantly higher than in the general population.(17) At least
      six cases of MM have been reported in patients with MDM;27-29 two of the reported cases were
      siblings. (18) The possible explanations of the higher incidence of MM in patients with MDM
      include: (i) lack of proapoptotic effect of SLURP-1; (ii) defective T-cell activation and
      tumour monitoring; or (iii) prolonged inflammation in hyperkeratotic skin.

      The previous study showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the
      heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation had defective T-cell activation. This was
      restored by the addition of 0•5 μg mL−1 recombinant human SLURP-1 protein. (19) Previous
      study showed that a putative monoclonal antibody that recognized ABCB5 was used to isolate
      melanoma stem cells (MSCs). (20) In this study, the investigators will investigate the roles
      of SLURP-1 in melanoma cells (including MSC) and also its interaction between melanoma cells
      and T-cells.

      Aims：

        1. To evaluate the significance and correlation of SLURP-1 expression in melanoma cells and
           melanoma metastasis in human tissues and mouse metastasis models.

        2. To assess the function of the SLURP-1 protein in melanoma cells and melanoma stem cells.

        3. To investigate the interaction between T-cells with SLURP-1 mutation and melanoma cells
           / MSCs.

        4. Confirm the biological effects of SLURP-1 on melanoma cells / MSCs.

        5. To investigate the relationship between SLURP-1 overexpression and melanoma cancer
           biology.
