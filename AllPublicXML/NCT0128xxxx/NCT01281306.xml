  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate dose response of blood pressure lowering for 4 doses
      of AHU377, given once daily (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg) in combination with a fixed
      dose of valsartan (320 mg).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study consisted of a single-blind run-in period and a double-blind (DB) period. During the 3 to 4 week run-in, participants were assessed for randomization eligibility into the DB period. 910 participants randomized. 3 participants were mis-randomized and did not receive study treatment. Therefore, the participant flow shows 907 participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In the double blind period, participants were randomized in a 2:2:2:2:2:2:1 ratio to AHU377 400 mg + valsartan 320 mg, AHU377 200 mg + valsartan 320 mg, AHU377 100 mg + valsartan 320 mg, AHU377 50 mg + valsartan 320 mg,valsartan 320 mg, LCZ696 400 mg and placebo, respectively.</pre_assignment_details>
