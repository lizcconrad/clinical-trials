  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fiber (commonly called bulk or roughage) is the edible nondigestible component of
      carbohydrate and lignin naturally found in plant food; however, bacteria in the lower gut may
      metabolize part of it. Epidemiological studies have found that fiber intake in the population
      is below the suggested recommendations. The beneficial effects of the fibers in human health
      are recognized. The regular intake of dietary fiber has an important role in the intestinal
      function increasing the intestinal fecal and reducing the transit time along the intestine;
      collaborates with the LDL-cholesterol plasmatic reduction by increasing fecal excretion of
      cholesterol and bile acids, decreases postprandial glucose in healthy, diabetics and insulin
      resistant people, reduces the risk for developing certain cancers, promotes satiety, helps
      with weight loss, and exerts immunomodulatory effect. However, fiber intake may be associated
      with adverse effects such as flatulence, bloating, cramps, and daily consumption of orange
      juice to bring digestive problems associated with acidity and heartburn, epigastric burning.
      Then it becomes of interest to study the tolerance of a new orange juice product fortified
      with mixed fibers (fructooligosaccharides, resistant dextrin, polydextrose and lactulose).

      Monocentric, double blind, randomized, two parallel arms controlled placebo study. 200
      healthy women from 18 to 45 years old, without functional digestive disorders or diagnosed
      digestive disease will take part in the study. The study consists of 21 days consumption of
      Orange juice. The participants will be randomized in two groups: placebo (Orange juice
      without fiber - control) and study group (Orange juice fortified with fiber mix). In both
      groups, the volunteers will be instructed to consume 200ml of juice twice a day (1 pack of
      200ml at lunch and one at dinner).
