  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the efficacy (effectiveness) and the safety of regorafenib when
      given in combination with chemotherapy mFOLFOX6 as first line therapy in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). mFOLFOX6 is an approved chemotherapy. Regorafenib is an
      oral (i.e. taken by mouth) multi-targeted kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor targets
      certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. By specifically
      targeting these proteins, regorafenib may stop cancer growth. The growth of the tumor may be
      decreased by preventing these specific proteins from functioning.

      The primary endpoint (the most meaningful result to be tracked) of this study is based on the
      rate of response, i.e. the disease getting smaller. The aim is to show that the therapy of
      colorectal cancer with mFOLFOX6 in combination with regorafenib improves the response rate
      observed for the standard therapy only.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 30 days after termination of study medication, an average of 47 weeks. Assessed every 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>OR was defined as the best tumor response (confirmed complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) observed by MRI or CT scan assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, version 1.1. CR and PR were confirmed not earlier than 4 weeks following the initial detection of response. CR = Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor (both target and no-target). Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non target) must have a reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum, no unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions and no appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, assessed by every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OS was calculated as the time from first date of receiving study treatment to date of death due to any cause. Participants alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, assessed by every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as time from the date of start of study treatment to the date of first observed disease progression (radiological according to central assessment or clinical), or death due to any cause, if death occurred before progression was documented. PFS for participants without disease progression or death at the date of database cutoff were right-censored at the last date of tumor assessment. Participants who had no tumor evaluation after baseline and no clinical progression post baseline and who did not die were censored at Day 1 in the analysis. PD = At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Unequivocal progression of existing non target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions will also constitute PD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control (DC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, assessed by every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DC was defined as the proportion of participants who had a best response rating of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST criteria that was achieved during treatment or within 30 days after termination of study treatment. CR and PR were confirmed not earlier than 4 weeks following the initial detection of response. A minimum of 8 weeks (allowing a minus 7-day time window) between start of study treatment and the first follow-up tumor assessment with SD as response was required to assign SD as best overall response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, assessed by every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DOR was defined as the time from the date of first documented objective response of PR or CR, whichever was noted earlier, to first subsequent disease progression or death (if death occurred before progression was documented). DOR was defined for responders only (that is, subjects with CR or PR). DOR for subjects without disease progression or death before progression was right censored at the date of their last tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease (DOSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, assessed by every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DOSD was only evaluated in participants failing to achieve a best response of CR or PR, but who achieved SD. DOSR was defined as the time (in days) from date of start of study treatment to the date at which disease progression or death (if death occurred before progression was first documented). The date the tumor scan was performed was used for this calculation. DOSD for participants without disease progression or death before progression at the time of analysis were censored at the date of their last tumor assessment.</description>

          <title>Stage at initial diagnosis</title>
          <description>The TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM) is a cancer staging system that describes the extent of a person's cancer. T describes the size of the original (primary) tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N describes nearby (regional) lymph nodes that are involved, M describes distant metastasis. For colon carcinoma, this is translated into stages I-IV. Stages II-IV can be further subdivided in subgroups (eg, A,B, or C).</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as time from the date of start of study treatment to the date of first observed disease progression (radiological according to central assessment or clinical), or death due to any cause, if death occurred before progression was documented. PFS for participants without disease progression or death at the date of database cutoff were right-censored at the last date of tumor assessment. Participants who had no tumor evaluation after baseline and no clinical progression post baseline and who did not die were censored at Day 1 in the analysis. PD = At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Unequivocal progression of existing non target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions will also constitute PD.</description>

        <description>DC was defined as the proportion of participants who had a best response rating of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST criteria that was achieved during treatment or within 30 days after termination of study treatment. CR and PR were confirmed not earlier than 4 weeks following the initial detection of response. A minimum of 8 weeks (allowing a minus 7-day time window) between start of study treatment and the first follow-up tumor assessment with SD as response was required to assign SD as best overall response.</description>
