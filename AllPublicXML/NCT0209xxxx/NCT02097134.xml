    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies whether unilateral group D retinoblastoma, or
      retinoblastoma affecting one eye that has spread to the inner jelly like part of the eye, can
      be treated with a new technique for delivering chemotherapy directly into the blood vessel
      that supplies the affected eye. This new technique is called intra-arterial injection. This
      may give children with unilateral retinoblastoma a lower chance of needing surgery to remove
      the eye and reduce the amount of treatment side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the feasibility of delivering melphalan directly into the ophthalmic artery in
      children with newly diagnosed unilateral group D retinoblastoma, who would otherwise be
      considered for enucleation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the ocular salvage rate after treatment with intra-arterial melphalan in
      children with newly diagnosed unilateral retinoblastoma with group D disease.

      II. To evaluate the toxicities and adverse events associated with delivering multiple doses
      of intra-arterial chemotherapy.

      III. To evaluate vision outcomes in children treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy.

      IV. To monitor the rate of the development of metastatic disease while on protocol therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of intra-arterial therapy on the histopathology of eyes enucleated
      for progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive melphalan intra-arterially (IA) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then periodically for 2 years.

    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility failure is defined as a) interventional radiologist is unable to access the ophthalmic artery for the 1st chemotherapy administration for any reason; b) patient develops central retinal artery occlusion after the 1st or 2nd course that does not reopen by the time the next injection is due; or c) the patient cannot receive all three treatments because of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) complications grade III or IV that are considered possibly, probably or likely related treatment.</description>

    <measure>Catheter insertion complication rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 hours after catheter insertion procedures</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as (1) thrombosis of the femoral artery; (2) dissection of any artery; (3) hematoma at the site of insertion of 3 centimeters or more in diameter; (4) emboli cerebral; or (5) any embolus in the lower extremity that results in vascular insufficiency.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Histopathology of eyes enucleated for progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of enucleated eyes with various characteristics, such as viable vitreous seeds, invasion into the optic nerve, ischemic atrophy involving the outer retina and choroid, and extensive choroidal and outer retinal atrophy will be calculated, as well as the 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of grade 3 or higher CTCAE adverse events associated with multiple doses of IA chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of each grade 3 or higher CTCAE adverse experience will be recorded in each patient-cycle. The percentage of patients with each toxicity will be tabulated per cycle according to the methodology in place for the study progress report at the time.</description>
