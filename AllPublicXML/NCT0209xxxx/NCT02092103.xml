  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial that will compare the effects of delayed umbilical cord
      clamping to umbilical cord milking in preterm infants (less than 34 weeks gestation). The
      infants' hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) will be
      evaluated, as well as the rates of necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage,
      and blood transfusions. The hypothesis is that milking the umbilical cord prior to clamping
      is superior to simply delayed cord clamping, presumably providing an increased blood volume
      to the preterm neonate improving its outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal timing for clamping the umbilical cord after birth in preterm infants has been a
      subject of controversy and debate for many years. It has been until recently the standard
      practice in ob/gyn to clamp the umbilical cord immediately post delivery to allow for
      immediate transition resuscitation of the neonate, especially in preterm infants. Due to the
      fact that optimal timing for cord clamping has yet to be definitively established in the
      preterm population, more information is needed. Immediate cord clamping, however, could
      preclude the infant from an extra boost in blood volume that may prove beneficial later in
      the newborn life. Directly comparing the recently recommended practice of delayed umbilical
      cord clamping to milking the umbilical cord prior to clamping has the potential to prove
      beneficial for the neonates in question, as well as change daily obstetrical practices. In
      this study all infants below 34 weeks will be randomized into one of two groups: delayed cord
      clamping and milking the umbilical cord prior to clamping. The decision was made not to
      include immediate cord clamping due to a recent American Congress of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation that all preterm infants have their cord clamping be
      delayed. Their outcomes will be measured by serial hemoglobin and hematocrit levels while in
      the NICU, the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, incidence of intraventricular
      hemorrhage, and the need for neonatal blood transfusions.

    <description>The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends delayed cord clamping for preterm infants. Infants randomized to this group will follow the protocol below:
Infant held at or below level of perineum (vaginal delivery) or incision (cesarean delivery)
Once infant is delivered designated RN starts timer
Infant warming bag on delivery table
Infant placed into warming bag then wrapped in a towel
Assistant to deliver preps cord clamps
Registered Nurse (RN) notifies provider at 30 seconds
Cord clamped and cut
Infant handed off to waiting staff
Exceptions: Placental separation, cord stops pulsating, need for immediate resuscitation, all would result in clamping prior to 30 seconds</description>
