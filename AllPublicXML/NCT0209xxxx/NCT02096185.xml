  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer will have surgery to remove the tumour. Where
      this is a local excision not mastectomy, the tissue removed is sent for x-ray imaging to
      assess that the abnormality has been removed and give an estimation of the distance from
      lesion to specimen edge. This allows the surgeon to decide whether to remove more tissue or
      not at the time. This study is designed to compare whether more accurate information about
      lesion to margin measurement can be obtained using 3 dimensional tomosynthesis imaging
      compared to 2 dimensional conventional digital imaging which is the type of imaging currently
      used. This has the potential to prevent some patients requiring a second operation to remove
      more tissue if the margins of the specimen are still involved with tumour.

      The study involves x-raying the specimen under both conditions when it arrives from theatre.
      Only the 2D image will be reviewed at the time as is current practice. The 3D image will be
      reviewed later and the measurements for lesion to specimen margin compared. The lesion to
      margin measurement as recorded by the pathologist will be taken as the 'gold standard' and
      the imaging measurements will also be compared to that.

      In theory, the use of 3D tomosynthesis should allow more accurate lesion to margin
      measurement because 3D can provide better visualisation of the lesion edges by removing the
      effect of superimposed tissue.

      The hypothesis states that the use of 3 dimensional tomosynthesis imaging should provide
      better lesion visualisation compared to 2 dimensional conventional digital imaging thus
      allowing more accurate lesion to margin measurement.
