      US study to estimate the prevalence at birth of major birth defects (ie, those that cause
      significant functional or cosmetic impairment, require surgery, or are life-limiting) in
      children born to mothers who have received Nplate® therapy at any time during the pregnancy.

      The purpose of the NPER is to monitor pregnancies exposed to Nplate® and to detect and record
      serious adverse events in infants up to one year after birth. The lack of adequate human
      fetal safety data for Nplate® makes the NPER an important component of the pharmacovigilance
      program on the safety of this drug. With respect to fetal outcome, it is important to
      evaluate the spectrum of outcomes that may be relevant to a medication exposure during
      pregnancy, and these include both easily recognizable defects that are visible at birth, as
      well as more subtle or delayed defects that may not be readily identifiable without special
      expertise and observation beyond the newborn period.

        The study population consists of two cohorts of women and their offspring who reside in the
        U.S. The exposed cohort is defined as pregnant women who have received at least one dose of
        Nplate® during pregnancy and their offspring up to one year of age. The unexposed cohort is
        defined as women unexposed to Nplate® during pregnancy matched on disease status (cITP) and
        age (childbearing) to the exposed. In order to provide context for any possible Nplate®
        exposed women without cITP, comparators from published literature will be used.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects will be currently pregnant women residing in the US who: Have had
             any exposure to Nplate® at any time during the pregnancy, which is defined as the
             period between first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) (ie, within two weeks of
             conception) up to any date before the date of delivery or end of the pregnancy. The
             date of conception will be defined as fourteen days prior to the next expected
             menstrual period for women who report a regular menstrual cycle. If the date of the
             first day of the LMP is unclear, or if the estimated date of conception as determined
             by a first-trimester ultrasound differs by more than one week from the date as
             determined by the first day of LMP, the first-trimester ultrasound-derived date will
             be used to estimate the timing of exposure to Nplate®, as well as timing of
             enrollment. If neither a clear date of the first day of the LMP nor a first-trimester
             ultrasound is available, the estimated date of conception for purposes of enrollment
             will be determined by best estimate of the woman's prenatal care provider.

          -  Agree to enroll at any time from the estimated date of conception up to any date
             before the date of delivery or end of the pregnancy and who have not already had
             prenatal diagnosis of any major structural birth defect in the current pregnancy prior
             to enrollment.

          -  Agree to provide consent for participation in the registry including follow-up
             interviews.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be ineligible for study participation if any of the following apply:

          -  Exposure to Nplate® did not occur during pregnancy.

          -  Prior knowledge of prenatal diagnosis of a birth defect. Patients who fall under this
             category will be encouraged to call the Amgen PSP toll free number for enrollment and
             follow-up.

          -  Cases reported to the NPER after completion of the exposed pregnancy. Patients who
             fall under this category will be encouraged to call the Amgen PSP toll free number for
             enrollment and follow-up.

      <pre_assignment_details>The Nplate® Pregnancy Exposure Registry (NPER) was to continue the follow-up of enrollees until April 2016; however, the NPER was terminated on 24 January 2014 because of the low number of participants enrolled.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Number of Children Born With Any 3 or More Minor Birth Defects</title>
          <description>An external, independent Congenital Malformation Adjudication Panel (CMAP) comprised of two clinical dysmorphologists and/or teratologists organized malformations based upon organ system and embryology, and determined whether structural defects were major or minor according to a modification of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) birth defect classification system. A minor structural defect is defined as a defect which occurs in less than 4% of the population but which has neither cosmetic nor functional significance to the child (eg, complete 2,3 syndactyly of the toes).</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The number of infants born to participants was too low to draw conclusions or make comparisons to the Systematic Tracking of Real Kids (STORK) analysis or to the background rates of congenital anomalies or preterm infants in the general population.</limitations_and_caveats>
