  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy is frequently proposed to patients presenting early breast cancer, in
      case of high risk of recurrence (large tumors, node involvement, high grade…). Due to its
      toxicity toward veins, chemotherapy must be administered through a central venous device.
      Today, one can use either an implanted port or a PICC line (Peripherally Inserted Central
      Catheter). A PICC line is easier to implant and to explant, but has to be flushed every week
      and may impact daily life (no swimming, some clothes may not fit). On the other hand, a port
      is subcutaneous and lets patients lead a normal life, but its implant and explant require a
      cutaneous incision with possible complications (bleeding, pain, infection). For both venous
      devices, complications such as thrombosis or infection may happen. Published data comparing
      the two devices are heterogeneous and do not often distinguish patients treated for different
      diseases at various stages. Empirically in daily practice, for long term use (&gt;6 months) a
      port is usually preferred, whereas for short-term treatments (&lt;6 weeks) a PICC line is used.
      In the case of Her2 negative early breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy usually lasts 4 to 5
      months. There is no scientific evidence for preferring one device to the other for these
      patients.

      The aim of this study is to prospectively compare the patients' satisfaction and tolerance of
      each of the two devices.

      The intravenous device will be randomly attributed. The adjuvant chemotherapy regimen will be
      selected according the standards of the center ( 6 cycles of FEC100 or 3 cycles of FEC100
      then 3 cycles of Taxotere (docetaxel). The patient will be followed as per center's standards
      and visits (prior, during and after every drug administration, then monthly for six months).
      All Adverse Events will be reported.
