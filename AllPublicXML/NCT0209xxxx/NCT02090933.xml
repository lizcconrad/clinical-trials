    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies celecoxib in decreasing the damaging effects of sunburn in
      healthy volunteers. Celecoxib may reduce skin damage by blocking enzymes associated with
      sunburn in healthy volunteers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantify changes in the erythema response in human subjects exposed to a range of
      erythemic doses of solar-simulated ultraviolet light before and after celecoxib treatment.

      II. Collect blood for genetic analysis of markers likely to modulate erythema response. This
      includes cyclooxygenase (COX), prostaglandin receptor, P53 and excision-repair polymorphisms.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation to the right buttock at baseline, receive
      celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 10 days, and then undergo UV-irradiation to the
      left buttock. Chromameter readings are obtained 24 hours post UV-irradiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has Fitzpatrick skin type I, II, or III

          -  If the subject is female and of childbearing potential (women are considered not of
             childbearing potential if they are at least 2 years post-menopausal and/or surgically
             sterile):

               -  Has been using adequate contraception (e.g., condom, intrauterine device [IUD],
                  diaphragm and spermicide gel combination) since her last menses and will use
                  adequate contraception during the study, and

               -  Is not lactating, and

               -  Will begin taking study drug beginning 2 days after onset of menses

          -  The subject is willing to abstain from the use of other non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the duration of the study

          -  The subject is willing to abstain from the use of all topical agents applied to the
             buttocks for the duration of the study with the exception of lotion

          -  The subject is willing to participate for the duration of the study

          -  The subject has provided written informed consent prior to administration of any study
             related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is currently taking any medication that may alter the sunlight response or
             cause an adverse reaction

          -  The subject has a history of melanoma, lupus, psoriasis, rosacea, porphyria,
             photosensitivity disorder, connective tissue disorder, or any disease that would
             increase the risk associated with study participation

          -  The study has excessive hair, blemishes, nevi, uneven pigmentation, sunburn or suntan
             on the buttocks

          -  The subject has sun bathed or used a tanning bed to expose the buttocks within 12
             months of admission to the study

          -  The subject has inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease or ulcerative
             colitis), a chronic or acute renal or hepatic disorder or a significant coagulation
             defect or any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion might preclude use
             of an NSAID (e.g., congestive heart failure)

          -  The subject has an active malignancy of any type; subjects who have a history of
             nonmelanoma skin cancer and have been treated are acceptable; subjects with a history
             of other malignancies that have been surgically removed and who have no evidence of
             recurrence for at least five years prior to study enrollment are also acceptable

          -  The subject has active or suspected peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding

          -  The subject has received any investigational medication within 30 days prior to the
             first dose of study medication or is scheduled to receive an investigational drug
             other than celecoxib during the course of this study

          -  The subject has a known hypersensitivity to cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sulfonamides,
             or NSAIDs

          -  The subject has significant medical or psychosocial problems that would make the
             subject a poor candidate, in the opinion of the principal investigator

          -  The subject is currently taking celecoxib
