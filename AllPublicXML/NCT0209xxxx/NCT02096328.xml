        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients â‰¥18 years of age diagnosed with VAP , i.e., pneumonia that
             arises more than 96 hours after endotracheal intubation documented or suspected to be
             due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa

          2. Respiratory specimen suitable for culture and Gram stain collected before starting the
             treatment

          3. Written Informed consent from the patient's legally acceptable representative or a
             relative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, cephalosporin,
             penicillin (beta-lactam antibiotics) or aminoglycoside antibiotics (i.e. all available
             SoC antibiotics); patients with a clinically significant history of drug allergies and
             history of anaphylactic reaction and patients with active allergic conditions at the
             time of screening

          2. Known or suspected pulmonary conditions which are likely to interfere with the
             therapeutic response or might have additional impact on pharmacokinetics

          3. Patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score &gt;25

          4. Presence of septic shock at the time of evaluation for study entry

          5. History of lung transplant

          6. Patients with known HIV infection with CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) cell count
             &lt; 200/mm3

          7. Concomitant morbidity of such severity that the patient is likely to die or present
             with serious medical conditions within 7 days of study entry

          8. Patients with impaired renal function

          9. Patients who are currently enrolled in, or have not yet completed at least 30 days
             since ending another investigational device or drug trial or are receiving other
             investigational agent
