  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transition from tacrolimus based triple therapy with Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) and steroids
      in stable renal transplant patients to low intensity tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone
      will be associated with improvement in Glomular Filtration Rate (GFR) and allograft fibrosis.
