  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a web-based game called Quit It that is
      designed to help smokers who have quit smoking cope with any smoking urges they may have. The
      purpose of the game is to help people quit and stop people from smoking again.

We will also biochemically verify 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at the 1 month follow-up assessment.</description>

    <description>usual care, which consists of four (face-to-face or telephone) counseling sessions with a trained nurse who has expertise in helping cancer patients quit smoking. This is the same as the treatment an MSK patient who enrolls in the MSK smoking cessation program would receive.
To collect further data to improve the game intervention, the investigators will conduct semi-structured telephone interviews with patients who were randomized to the treatment arm but did not play the game during the one month intervention period. The purpose of the interviews is to elicit qualitative feedback on any barriers that may have prevented participants from playing. At the completion of the intervention period, patients will be asked if they would like to participate in a telephone interview. Telephone interviews will take about twenty minutes and will be held at a time that is convenient for the patient.</description>

    <description>Smokers randomly assigned to SC+SCCS/Quit IT will receive all the components of Standard Care. The patient will be oriented and trained face-to-face (during their hospitalization) on use of the game by study staff using an iPad. The orientation and training session will comprise: 1) Overview of the game and its objectives; 2) discussion of the rules of the game; 3) watching a 10 minute tutorial given by the game narrator (avatar); 4) answering all patient questions; and 5) evaluation of the patient's comprehension of game play via a 17 question survey. Once patients have access to QuitIT, they will also receive a set of Coping Cards</description>
