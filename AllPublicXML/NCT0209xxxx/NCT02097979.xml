      OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine whether two group educational sessions plus
      one-on-one eye drop instillation training would improve adherence to glaucoma therapy as
      measured by pharmacy claims data in a cohort of newly diagnosed patients. Our hypothesis was
      that adherence would be improved in the intervention group and that patients would better
      understand their disease and how to manage it.

      METHODS Study Design and Population: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in
      newly diagnosed glaucoma patients at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, Canada. Half
      of the participants were randomized to receive the intervention and half were randomized to
      receive a delayed intervention at the conclusion of the study. Inclusion criteria included a
      diagnosis of glaucoma requiring intraocular pressure lowering eye drop therapy and
      prescription drug insurance through the Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ) (the
      Quebec Health Insurance Program) throughout the course of the study. There were three sources
      of data for this study: a questionnaire, the medical record, and RAMQ prescription drug
      claims data. Follow-up was for one year.

      Recruitment and Randomization: From July, 2007 until December, 2011, a researcher approached
      eligible patients to determine their interest in participating in the study. Interested
      participants signed the informed consent form and were randomized. Participants in the
      intervention group were given an appointment to come back to the Hospital for the group
      intervention. Participants in the control group were given an appointment to receive the
      group intervention at the end of the study.

      Intervention: Small groups of about 10 people were gathered for two 60-90 minute educational
      sessions on glaucoma in a classroom at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. During a break, each
      patient received one-on-one teaching on how to properly instill drops without touching the
      eye or using unnecessary drops.

      Questionnaire and Assessment of Eye Drop Technique: A single questionnaire was given at the
      end of the study to all participants. The intervention group completed the questionnaire
      after the intervention while the control group completed the questionnaire before the
      intervention. Questions were included on demographics, systemic comorbidities, ocular
      medications, eye drop practices and difficulties, and glaucoma knowledge.

      The instructor rated the ability of the participant to put eye drops in the eye taking into
      account the number of drops that were used and whether contact with the lid or conjunctiva
      occurred (good, fair, bad).

      We created a composite score on the perception of the importance of glaucoma eye drop therapy
      using the following four questions: 1) do you think glaucoma is a serious disease, 2) do you
      believe that your treatment will be effective, 3) do you think your drops can lower the
      pressure in your eyes, 4) do you think your drops can help to preserve vision. Answers of no
      or do not know were given 0 points and answers of yes were given 1 point. Scores were summed
      and the composite score ranged from 0 to 4.

      Medical Chart Review: At the end of the follow-up period, information was obtained on: the
      prescribed eye drop therapy for each patient per eye, whether the patient had undergone
      glaucoma filtering surgery, whether the patient had died or was no longer being followed, the
      most recent visual field mean deviation in the better eye using the Humphrey Visual Field
      Analyzer 24-2 SITA Standard Program.

      Pharmaceutical Claims and Calculation of Medication Possession Ratio: The Medication
      Possession Ratio (MPR) was calculated as the sum of days of prescription supply divided by
      the number of days in which a prescription was required. Each person gave consent to contact
      the RAMQ to obtain pharmaceutical claims for all glaucoma medications. Data were collected on
      the date of purchase, and the name, dose, and class of the medicine. Data on the number of
      days of medication available per bottle were taken from the Rylander and Friedman studies
      with the minimum value used. For the numerator of the MPR, we calculated how many days of
      medication were available using RAMQ data. For the denominator of the MPR, we calculated the
      number of days that medication was prescribed in the medical chart. We took into account
      whether drops were needed for one or two eyes. If a participant was on multiple medications,
      we calculated a single mean MPR for all medications. We then dichotomized the MPR so that
      those having medication less than 75% of the days were defined as non-adherent, as we did
      previously in Djafari et al.

      SIGNIFICANCE Adherence can be a problem in glaucoma because patients must often take daily
      eye drops despite not noticing any benefit to their vision and despite frequent side effects.
      Low cost interventions that help to improve adherence are needed.
