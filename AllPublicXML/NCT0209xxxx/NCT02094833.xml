  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a novel DTaP-IPV-Hep
      B-PRP~T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine (study vaccine) administered at 2, 4, and 6
      months of age compared to Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV//PRP~T combined vaccine (Pentaxim™) given
      at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and Hep B vaccine (Euvax B®) given at 1 and 6 months of age in
      South Korean infants that received a birth dose of Hep B and born to mothers documented to be
      serum anti-HBs Ag negative.

      Primary Objective

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of seroprotection (Diphtheria, Tetanus,
           poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, PRP-T, Hep B) and vaccine response for pertussis antigens
           (pertussis toxoid [PT] and filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA]) of Group A versus Group B,
           one month after the third dose of combined vaccines.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To further study the immunogenicity of the two vaccination schemes, before the first
           dose and one month after the last dose of vaccines.

        -  To study the safety after each and any dose of vaccines administered in the two
           vaccination schemes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants who received a first dose of recombinant Hep B vaccine at birth will
      receive either DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP~T combined vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age + 3 doses
      of Hep B vaccine or Hep B vaccine (Euvax B®) at 1 and 6 months of age and DTaP IPV//PRP~T
      combined vaccine (Pentaxim™) at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, according to the official
      vaccination schedule for Hep B, DTaP, poliovirus, and Hib vaccinations in South Korea.
