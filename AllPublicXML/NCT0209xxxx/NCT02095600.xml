    <textblock>
      Stereotactic lesioning of thalamus and basal ganglia for treatment of tremor is a well-known
      procedure which, prior to the introduction of deep brain stimulation, or DBS, was usually
      achieved using stereotactic surgical procedures.

      Radiosurgery of invisible targets to treat movement disorders and intractable pain are still
      the domain of frame-based procedures, due to the need of a solid reference system registered
      to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line, which allows the use of
      stereotactic atlases.

      In this study we want to utilize a mathematical method that uses atlas-derived stereotactic
      coordinates to perform frameless images-guided radiosurgery of such functional targets
      Particularly the aim of the present study is to investigate both the efficacy and the safety
      of the methodology to treat upper limb and hand tremor in elderly or in patients which are
      not ot susceptible of surgical procedures. For these reasons a dose escalation prospective
      trial have been designed.
