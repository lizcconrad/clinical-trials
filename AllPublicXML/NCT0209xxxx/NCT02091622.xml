      Introduction: Honest prognostication and information for patients are important parts of
      end-of-life care. This study examined whether an educational intervention could increase the
      proportion of patients who received information about the transition to end-of-life care
      (ITEOL).

      Method: Two municipalities (in charge of nursing homes) and two hospitals were randomized to
      receive an interactive half-day course about ITEOL for physicians and nurses. The proportion
      of patients who received ITEOL was measured with data from the Swedish Register of Palliative
      Care (SRPC). Patients were only included if they died an expected death and maintained their
      ability to express their will until days or hours before their death. Four hospitals and four
      municipalities were assigned controls, matched by hospital size, population, and proportion
      of patients receiving ITEOL at baseline.

    <description>The proportion of patients who received ITEOL was measured with data from the Swedish Register of Palliative Care (SRPC). Six months after the intervention data were collected from the SRPC for all patients who had died at the included hospitals and municipalities. Data were collected from six months before the intervention to six months after the intervention. The outcome was compared before and after the intervention.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitals and municipalities: Participation in the Swedish Register of Palliative
             Care.

          -  Patients: Reported from an included hospital or municipality during six months before
             to six months after intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitals and municipalities: Exclusion criteria were more than 40% patients receiving
             ITEOL at start of study, too large for an intervention due to practical reasons
             (university hospitals or municipalities with over 100 000 inhabitants), and hospitals
             not containing both internal medicine and surgery departments.

          -  Patients were excluded when death was unexpected, when a forensic post mortem
             examination was performed, or when the patients had lost their ability to express
             their will and take part in decisions concerning the content of medical care one week
             or more before death.
