      This multi-center study will consist of two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A only will be
      described in this record. Part A is a randomized, double blind 21-day treatment study period.
      Subjects will be randomized to one of three doses of active or placebo at a 4:1 ratio.

      Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be assigned a
      unique participant number and then begin a 28-day baseline observation period.

      Eligible subjects will then be randomly assigned to receive one of three dose levels of
      GWP42003-P: 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg per day, or matching placebo.

      There will be three groups of 10 subjects. In each group, subjects will be randomly assigned
      so that eight subjects receive active treatment and two subjects receive placebo. Subjects
      will receive GWP42003-P or placebo for a 21-day exposure period, which consists of a
      titration period, followed by a stable dose period.

      A pharmacokinetic assessment will take place after the first single dose of GWP42003-P. There
      will be a second pharmacokinetic assessment after 21 days of consecutive dosing with
      GWP42003-P. Subjects who take clobazam as an adjunctive treatment will be asked to take their
      usual dose two hours prior to attending the clinic. The same recommendation will be made for
      other concomitant antiepileptic drugs, if applicable. This is so that the pre-treatment (with
      GWP42003-P) plasma concentrations of clobazam, its major metabolite N-desmethylclobazam, and
      any other concomitant antiepileptic drugs can be measured, and the impact of GWP42003-P
      treatment on these levels evaluated. Interim clinic visits to (primarily) evaluate safety and
      adherence to the titration regimen will take place at seven and 14 days of treatment.

      After 21 days of treatment, all subjects will commence a 10-day down-titration taper period.
      An independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee will review unblinded safety and
      pharmacokinetic data and recommend the target dose (up to 20 mg/kg/day) for Part B of the
      study and for an open label extension study. Once the safety review of Part A data has taken
      place, subjects will have the option of entering the open label extension study.

      A follow-up telephone call will be made 28 days after the end of dosing for subjects who do
      not enter the open label extension study within this time-frame.

      Throughout the 21-day treatment period and the 10-day taper period, there will be regular
      safety telephone calls (i.e., approximately every two days) to check subject status. Weekly
      safety telephone calls will be made during the 28-day follow-up period.
