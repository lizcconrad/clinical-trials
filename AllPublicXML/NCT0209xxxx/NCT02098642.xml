  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The motor
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the
      substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of this cell death is unknown. Early in
      the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are movement-related; these include
      shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait. A
      multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment (MIRT) is able to improve different
      parameters in PD that are poorly responsive to dopaminergic therapy. In this study, we aim to
      understand whether the passive mobilization of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux
      determines an increase in the joint range in this district, allowing to improve, at least,
      the gait.

      Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The motor
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the
      substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of this cell death is unknown. Early in
      the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are movement-related; these include
      shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait. The main
      families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are levodopa dopamine agonists and
      Monoamine oxidases-B inhibitors.A multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment (MIRT)
      is able to improve different parameters in PD that are poorly responsive to the
      pharmacological therapy. In this study, we aim to understand whether the passive mobilization
      of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux determines an increase in the joint range in
      this district, allowing to improve, at least, the gait in patients with PD. In this course,
      we will evaluate whether passive mobilization of this joint, lead to positive effects on the
      freezing of gait and on the festination.

    <description>A 4-week cycle of physiotherapy that entailed three daily sessions, 5 days a week. The first session comprised cardiovascular warm-up activities, relaxation exercises, muscle-stretching, exercises to improve the range of motion of spinal, pelvic and scapular joints, and exercises to improve the functionality of abdominal muscles and postural changes in the supine position. The second session included exercises to improve balance and gait using a stabilometric platform with a visual cue and treadmill training associated with auditory and visual cues (treadmill plus). The last was an occupational therapy session with the aim of improving autonomy in daily living activities.</description>
