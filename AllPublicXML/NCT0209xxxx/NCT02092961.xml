  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study of the OSKIRA-4 study, (D4300C0004, NCT01264770) to explore alternative
      and more sensitive modalities for measuring the beneficial effects of syk inhibition with
      fostamatinib in patients with active RA. This MRI sub-study was reported later than the main
      study due to recruitment delays at specialist imaging sites and so is registered and
      presented entirely separately to the main study results.

      This study will investigate the impact of treatment on joint activity and damage by assessing
      synovitis, osteitis, bone erosions and joint space narrowing.

      Monotherapy Compared with Placebo or Adalimumab Monotherapy in Patients with Active
      Rheumatoid Arthritis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sub-Study Date: 21 March 2011 Version: 1
      Primary objective: Assess the efficacy of fostamatinib in reducing joint synovial disease
      activity as measured by: - Change from baseline to Week 6 (versus placebo) in OMERACT RAMRIS
      synovitis score.

    <description>OMERACT RAMRIS synovitis score was based on 8 joints, scored from MRI images, and ranged from 0 to 24 with a smaller value indicating a better clinical condition. Median changes from baseline are shown at each visit (defined as post-baseline minus baseline) with negative values indicative of a better clinical condition.

    <description>DAS28-CRP: Disease Activity Score based on a count of swollen and tender joints (out of 28 joints), blood test measures of inflammation (CRP) and the patient's own assessment. Scores can take any positive value with a lower value indicating a better clinical condition. Mean changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP score are shown at each visit and are presented as decreases from baseline (defined as baseline minus post-baseline) with larger changes indicative of a better clinical condition. ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, CRP = C-reactive protein, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, PO = orally, SC = subcutaneous.</description>

        <description>OMERACT RAMRIS synovitis score was based on 8 joints, scored from MRI images, and ranged from 0 to 24 with a smaller value indicating a better clinical condition. Median changes from baseline are shown at each visit (defined as post-baseline minus baseline) with negative values indicative of a better clinical condition. BID = twice daily, CI = confidence interval, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, OMERACT = Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials, PO = orally, RAMRIS = Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring system, SC = subcutaneous.</description>

        <population>The sub-study analysis set includes those patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product in the MRI sub-study. Patients were analysed by randomised treatment, but only those with available images were included in the analysis.</population>

        <title>OMERACT RAMRIS Osteitis Score - Comparison of Change From Baseline Between Fostamatinib and Placebo or Adalimumab (Van Elteren)</title>
        <description>OMERACT RAMRIS osteitis score was based on 25 joints, scored from MRI images, and ranged from 0 to 75 with a smaller value indicating a better clinical condition. Median changes from baseline are shown at each visit (defined as post-baseline minus baseline) with negative values indicative of a better clinical condition. BID = twice daily, CI = confidence interval, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, OMERACT = Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials, PO = orally, RAMRIS = Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring system, SC = subcutaneous.</description>

        <population>The sub-study analysis set includes those patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product in the MRI sub-study. Patients were analysed by randomised treatment, but only those with available images were included in the analysis.</population>

        <description>DAS28-CRP: Disease Activity Score based on a count of swollen and tender joints (out of 28 joints), blood test measures of inflammation (CRP) and the patient's own assessment. Scores can take any positive value with a lower value indicating a better clinical condition. Mean changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP score are shown at each visit and are presented as decreases from baseline (defined as baseline minus post-baseline) with larger changes indicative of a better clinical condition. ANCOVA = analysis of covariance, BID = twice daily, CRP = C-reactive protein, DMARD = disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IR = inadequate response, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, PO = orally, SC = subcutaneous.</description>

        <population>The sub-study analysis set includes those patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product in the MRI sub-study. Patients were analysed by randomised treatment in accordance with the intention to treat principle.</population>
