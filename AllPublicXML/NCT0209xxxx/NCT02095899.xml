  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if rufinamide has an effect on chronic neuropathic pain
      in patients with a post thoracotomy pain syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic neuropathic pain after thoracic surgery will be evaluated and treated
      with oxycodone. Patients with a stable analgesic regimen, not reaching a good pain relief
      will be randomized to receive Rufinamide (Inovelon)vs. Placebo as an ad-on treatment to
      oxycodone. Neurophysiological and clinical data will be monitored.
