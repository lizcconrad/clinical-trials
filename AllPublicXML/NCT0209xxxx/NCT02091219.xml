  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two different forms of vitamin D
      supplements (vitamin D3 and 25-hyrdroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3]) on vitamin D levels in the
      blood, and on markers of skeletal and immune health. This study is designed as a pilot study.
      A multi-ethnic cohort of 48 patients will be included (12 Caucasian, 12 African American, 12
      Hispanic/Latino, 12 Asian/Asian American). Potential study candidates will undergo a
      screening visit during which a medical history will be taken, a physical exam performed, a
      dietary questionnaire administered, and blood collected. The purpose of the screening visit
      is to identify vitamin D-deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;20 ng/ml) individuals who are
      candidates for vitamin D supplementation. Eligible patients will then be randomly assigned to
      receive either vitamin D3 (2400 IU/day) or 25(OH)D3 (20 mcg/day) for 16 weeks. After
      initiating supplementation, study patients will return for follow-up visits at weeks 4, 8,
      and 16. At each visit, blood will be collected to assess vitamin D levels in the blood, as
      well as markers of skeletal and immune function. Participation in this study will therefore
      involve a total of 5 visits (1 screening visit, 1 randomization visit during which
      participants will receive their study supplements, 3 follow-up visits). After all data is
      collected, changes in vitamin D levels in the blood following supplementation with either
      vitamin D3 versus 25(OH)D3 will be determined, and correlated to markers of calcium balance
      and immune function. Knowledge gained from this study may have a significant impact on how
      vitamin D status is defined, and how vitamin D repletion is administered.
