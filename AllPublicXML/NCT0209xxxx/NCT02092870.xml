      Our study aims to explore the effects of Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ASCs) on chronic wounds.

    <textblock>
      In an attempt to explore the contribution of Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ASCs) to chronic
      wound healing, we will investigate the effects of injecting ASCs into the periphery and
      debrided surfaces of chronic wounds. Our goal is to achieve healing in two months, and for
      the wounds to stay healed for the following two weeks.

    <description>Patients will receive a single treatment with ASCs in the form of multiple injections of cells within and immediately surrounding the wound. Cells will be delivered using a 1 cc syringe with an appropriate gauge and length needle. Each injection will have a volume less than 250 micro-liters. The number of injections will be determined by the surgeon as a function of total wound volume.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male patient aged â‰¥ 18

          -  With diagnosis of diabetic or other chronic wound

          -  Grade 1 or 2 wound on the Wagner Scale

          -  Ulcer with a surface area comprised greater than 4 cm2 included (after mechanical
             debridement of the ulcer)

          -  For subjects with more than one wound that meet these criteria, all qualifying wounds
             may be treated

          -  Patient's wound has been refractory to standard of care (no measureable signs of
             healing for at least 30 days)

          -  Patient has adequate (&gt;200cc) abdominal or other subcutaneous adipose tissue
             accessible by syringe-based lipoharvest

          -  Patient has activated platelet thromboplastin time (aPTT) of &lt; 1.6x the mean normal
             reference interval at the time of the lipoharvest procedure and no contraindication to
             lipoharvest

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Typical Charcot's foot

          -  Presence of osteitis (eq Br osteomyelitis) at the inclusion visit (evidenced with a
             radiological lesion facing the wound [bone erosion or disappearance of the cortical
             bone]) as determined by MRI

          -  Clinical evidence of uncontrolled infection at the inclusion visit

          -  Patient not eligible for syringe-based lipoharvest of at least 200cc of subcutaneous
             adipose tissue

          -  Subjects with cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions in the area to be treated

          -  Patient with working activity who cannot be on sick-leave during the study period

          -  Patient suffering from a psychiatric disorder not treated

          -  Clinical evidence of gangrene on any part of the affected foot

          -  Patient receiving corticosteroids, NSAIDs, immunosuppressive or cytotoxic agents, all
             systemic agents that can affect wound repair or any treatment that might interfere
             with the assessment of the study treatment

          -  Pregnant or nursing females

          -  Patient receiving dialysis for renal insufficiency or who have severe renal
             dysfunction

          -  Patient who cannot have an off-loading method

          -  Participation in any other clinical research study that has not reached the primary
             efficacy endpoint or otherwise would interfere with the patient's participation in
             this study

          -  Any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study
