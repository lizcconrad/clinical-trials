  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 (1 µmol/kg)
      compared to the pharmacokinetics of iohexol (5 mL of a 300 mg iodine (I)/mL solution) in
      healthy adult participants. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MP-3180 in healthy adult participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-dose pharmacokinetics were characterized in sixteen (16) healthy, adult male
      participants in this Phase 1, open-label study following the administration of a single,
      intravenous 1 µmol/kg dose over 2 minutes followed by 10 mL saline under fasting conditions.
      Iohexol (Omnipaque-300, 5 mL of a 300 mg I/mL solution) was also administered over 2 minutes
      followed by 10 mL of saline. The pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 and iohexol was assessed by
      statistical comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentration-time
      curves and urine recovery data.

    <time_frame>Pre-dose and the following times after dosing: 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 480 and 720 minutes post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected and analyzed using validated analytical methods. Total plasma clearance (the volume of plasma cleared of the drug over time) was calculated as: Clp = Dose/ AUC∞.</description>

    <measure>Renal clearance of MP-3180 and iohexol</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and each time the participant voided up to 720 minutes post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Urine samples were collected pre-dose (time 0) and 5 mL urine samples were collected each time the subject voided. The total volume of urine excreted was recorded until 12 hours post-dose, and analyzed using validated analytical methods. Renal clearance (the volume of plasma cleared of the drug by the kidneys over time) was calculated as: CLr = Ae/ AUClast, where Ae is the cumulative amount of analyte excreted in urine over the sampling interval.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected and analyzed using validated analytical methods. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (ng*hr/mL) from time 0 to infinity was calculated as: AUC∞ = AUClast + LQC/λz where LQC is the predicted concentration (based on the terminal regression) at the time of the last measurable concentration.</description>
