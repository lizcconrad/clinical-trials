  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF) taken
      over 12 months is effective in reducing Multiple Sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue, as measured
      by mean changes in the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), in
      participants with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The secondary objectives of
      this study are: To investigate changes from Baseline in FSMC and fatigue severity (Fatigue
      Severity Scale [FSS]) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in participants receiving DMF; To assess
      the impact of DMF on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including work productivity (Work
      Productivity and Activity Impairment-Multiple Sclerosis questionnaire [WPAI-MS]),
      health-related quality of life (Short Form Health Survey [SF-12]), depression (Beck
      Depression Inventory-Fast Screen [BDI-FS]), and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS])
      at 6 and 12 months in participants receiving DMF; To examine whether an association exists
      between fatigue and baseline demographics (e.g., age and sex) and disease characteristics
      (e.g., disease duration, baseline disease activity, treatment history, expanded disability
      status scale [EDSS] score, and PROs); To assess any changes in fatigue-related medication
      use.

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in MS-related fatigue as assessed by FSMC at 12 months in participants receiving DMF</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>FSMC is a 20-item questionnaire and produces a score between 1 and 5 for each scored question (ranging from &quot;does not apply at all&quot; to &quot;applies completely&quot;). Items are summed to generate a total score and transformed to a scale with a range of 20 to 100, where higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in fatigue as assessed by FSS in participants receiving DMF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is designed to differentiate fatigue from clinical depression, since both share some of the same symptoms. FSS consists of answering a 9-item questionnaire that requires the participant to rate his or her own level of fatigue. Each question produces a score between 1 to 7. The scoring is done by calculating the average response to the questions. Participants with depression alone score about 4.5. But people with fatigue related to MS average about 6.5</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in work productivity as assessed by WPAI-MS, in participants receiving DMF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in quality of life as assessed by SF-12 in participants receiving DMF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey. The questions were combined, scored, and weighted to create two scales that provide glimpses into mental and physical functioning and overall health-related-quality of life. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health and 100 indicates the highest level of health</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in depression as assessed by BDI-FS in participants receiving DMF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BDI-FS is a self-report inventory for measuring the severity of depression on a 7-item questionnaire. Each question is rated on a 4-point scale (0 - 3) to assess frequency, over the past two weeks, of feelings of sadness, pessimism (hopelessness), sense of failure, loss of a sense of pleasure, loss of self-confidence, self-blame, and suicidal ideation. The total ESS score is the sum of 8 item-scores and can range between 0 and 21, where higher scores indicate higher levels of depression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in sleepiness assessed by ESS in participants receiving DMF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a self-administered 8-item questionnaire with that provides a measure of a person's general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life. Each question is rated on a 4-point scale (0 - 3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in 8 different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily lives, although not necessarily every day. The total ESS score is the sum of 8 item-scores and can range between 0 and 24, where higher scores indicate higher levels of a person's level of daytime sleepiness</description>
