  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at the Biomedical Imaging Research Institute (BIRI) at Cedars-Sinai Medical
      Center have developed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) method for imaging coronary arteries
      using slow-infusion, contrast-enhanced data acquisition. This method allows faster data
      acquisition and better spatial resolution.

      Specific aims of this study are to:

        1. compare coronary artery imaging with and without contrast media on both healthy subjects
           and patients;

        2. assess the accuracy of coronary MRI in detecting coronary artery disease as compared to
           conventional x-ray angiography

      Researchers hypothesize that contrast-enhanced MRI will improve the delineation of coronary
      arteries over non-contrast-enhanced MRI and that optimized, contrast-enhanced coronary MRI
      technique will accurately detect coronary artery disease (CAD) as compared to conventional
      x-ray angiography.

      This is a study to compare image quality between contrast and non-contrast cardiac MR and to
      evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a cardiac MRI procedure in a patient population that
      includes both healthy volunteers and a study group of patients with known CAD who are
      scheduled for clinical coronary angiography within one month of signing informed consent.
      Both groups are eligible for a combination of imaging tests. Subjects may receive either a
      non-contrast MRI or a contrast-enhanced MRI depending upon their kidney function and study
      focus. Also based upon the focus of the study at the time of the scan and to improve image
      quality, a beta-blocker to lessen motion artifact in patients with higher heart rates may be
      administered or patients may be asked to undergo a stress test for comparison.This is a
      one-day research procedure. Studies are acquired from the approved Institutional Review Board
      #25881 Cedars-Sinai Biomedical Imaging Research Registry.

    <description>The following procedures may be conducted as part of this study:
Coronary MRI scan with no contrast
Coronary MRI scan enhanced with a gadolinium-based contrast agent (Optimark, MultiHance, Ablavar) administered intravenously at a total dose of up to 0.2 mmol/kg
MRI scan with an oral beta blocker (metoprolol)
Cardiac Stress Test MRI scan with a pharmacologic stress drug; either adenosine (dosage depends on the subject's weight and is set at 140mcg/kg/min) or regadenoson (0.4mg/5ml bolus)
Determination of study drugs will be made depending upon study focus, subjects' health conditions, blood pressure, heart rate and concomitant medications. Both groups are eligible for all combinations of interventions.</description>

        Inclusion:

          -  All subjects must be enrolled in the IRB approved Cedars-Sinai Biomedical Imaging
             Research Registry where data is collected for this analysis study.

          -  Male or female â‰¥ 18years of age

          -  Healthy Group -No known CAD

          -  CAD Group-Scheduled for clinical invasive coronary artery x-ray angiography within one
             month of study participation

        Exclusion:

          -  MR imaging is contraindicated in persons with mechanically, magnetically, or
             electrically activated implants, such as cardiac pacemakers, neurostimulators, and
             infusion pumps.

          -  Persons with ferromagnetic implants and ferromagnetic foreign bodies, such as
             intracranial, aneurysm clips, shrapnel and intraocular metal chips as these could
             become dislodged.

          -  Patients who are pregnant, nursing are implanted with intrauterine devices (IUD's)

          -  Persons who are in atrial fibrillation at the time of the MR scan as this could result
             in poor image quality due to interference with electrocardiographic gating necessary
             for image acquisition.

          -  Persons unable to tolerate MRI imaging secondary to an inability to lie supine or
             severe claustrophobia.

          -  Patient with renal failure (GFR&lt; 45)

          -  Allergy to animal dander or animal-instigated asthma

          -  Specific to Ablavar: Baseline ECG measurements and concomitant medications will be
             checked on subjects who are chosen to participate in the Ablavar study, based upon
             study needs. If the ECG measurements and/or medications indicate that the subject is
             at high risk for arrhythmia, the subject will be excluded from the Ablavar study, but
             can participate in the OptiMark/MultiHance contrast study or non-contrast study.

          -  Specific to beta-blocker administration: no contraindication to beta blockers. If the
             subject is found to have a contraindication to beta-blockers or declines the
             administration of beta-blockers the subject will be excluded from the beta-blocker
             portion but can still participate in a non-contrast or contrast-enhanced scan without
             beta-blocker administration.

          -  Specific to Regadenoson: no contraindication to regadenoson administration. If the
             subject is found to have a contraindication to regadenoson the subject will be
             excluded from the regadenoson portion but can still participate in a non-contrast or
             contrast-enhanced scan without regadenoson stress testing.

          -  Specific to Adenosine: no contraindication to adenosine administration.If the subject
             is found to have a contraindication to adenosine the subject will be excluded from the
             adenosine portion but can still participate in a non-contrast or contrast-enhanced
             scan without adenosine stress testing.
