      This is an independent optional sub-study parallel to TB-018 (NCT01755598) in which
      biological samples will be collected for future investigations on biological correlates,
      markers or prognostic factors for TB disease. Subjects who consent to enroll in TB-018, &quot;A
      phase IIb, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' candidate tuberculosis (TB) vaccine GSK 692342
      (M72/AS01E) against TB disease, in healthy adults aged 18-50 years, living in a TB endemic
      region&quot;, (see NCT 01755598) will be asked to participate in this sub-study. Subjects enrolled
      in TB-018 who also consent to C-041-972 will be followed according to the TB-018 protocol but
      will have additional blood samples collected for the sub-study.
