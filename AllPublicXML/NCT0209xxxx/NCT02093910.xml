  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib was an important drug in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM),and peripheral
      neuropathy (PN) is a significant dose-limiting toxicity of bortezomib that typically occurs
      within the first courses of bortezomib, reaches a plateau at cycle 5. Up to now, no effective
      prophylaxis have been developed for PN. Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside, a nerve-protecting
      drug,was often used to promote growth of nerve, and function restoration of damaged
      nerve.Thus,the investigators hypothesized that combination of
      Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside and bortezomib can reduce the incidence rate of peripheral
      neuropathy (PN) and promote the relief of peripheral neuropathy (PN) in multiple myeloma (MM)
      patients.
