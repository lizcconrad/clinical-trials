      Children who have parents with bipolar disorder are at risk for developing anxiety disorders.
      Typical treatments for anxiety in children are SSRI antidepressants. However, these
      medications may accelerate the onset of mania or hypomania in children with a family history
      of bipolar disorder or cause suicidal thinking in children. Studies trying alternative
      treatments to anxiety and possible bipolar disorder in children are needed, to establish
      other methods for treating childhood mental health. These studies can also help with early
      intervention and possible future prevention strategies for bipolar disorder. This study
      involves treating anxious children with Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy. They will have
      12 weeks of mindfulness therapy in a group with other children where they will be led by a
      trained group leader, how to pay attention to anxiety cues and react differently.

    <description>A 12 week group therapy program for children with anxiety disorders. This involves teaching the children the pay attention to anxiety related cues with openness and non-judgment. Group leaders begin each session with: sitting meditation, review of the previous session and home practices, teaching a new mindfulness exercise, reading a group poem or story, distributing handouts, etc. There will be a new theme each week.</description>

    <description>Waitlist Control (WC) will be the comparison condition. Some of the children in the study will initially participate in a 12 week WC prior to their participation in the MBCT-C. At each visit during the waitlist control period, participants and their families will receive materials about mood and anxiety disorders in youth, bipolar disorders, familial risk for bipolar disorder and treatment strategies for anxiety and depression in youth.</description>
