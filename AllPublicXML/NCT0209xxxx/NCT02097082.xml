             distal to the femoral bifurcation and &gt; 5 cm above the joint space of the knee.

          3. Patient has symptomatic intermittent claudication affecting at least the target leg
             (Rutherford Class 2-3). Patients should have first received conservative medical
             management of their symptoms prior to study inclusion. The symptoms can be bilateral.

             committee of the respective clinical site.

          5. The study patient agrees to comply with all required post-procedure study
             requirements.

        Baseline Inclusion Criteria

          1. Reference vessel diameter (RVD) 5.0 -6.0 mm measured by an objective measurement such
             as online Quantitative Vessel Analysis (QVA).

          2. Target lesion length ≤ 90 mm; total occlusion length &lt; 40 mm.

          3. Target lesion has a ≥70% diameter stenosis.

          4. Angiographic evidence of at least one runoff vessel to the ankle/foot without
             hemodynamically significant stenosis (&gt;50% diameter stenosis) that does not require
             any treatment within 3 months of the index procedure.

          5. Procedural access can be accomplished via contralateral vascular access or if
             antegrade access no closure device can be utilized and closure has to occur via manual
             pressure.

          6. Patent common and external iliac: TASC A &amp; B iliac lesions may be treated at the time
             of index procedure (before treatment of the target lesion) if residual stenosis is
             ≤30%.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Previous vascular surgery/endovascular treatment of the target lesion.

          2. Re-vascularization of target vessel within 30 days of study procedure.
