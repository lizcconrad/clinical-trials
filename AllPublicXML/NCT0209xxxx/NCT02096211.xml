  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to gather short (Pre-operative to 4-years) and mid-term (5-years)
      information regarding the performance and safety of the commercially available 36mm CERAMAX®
      Ceramic on Ceramic Total Hip System from a cohort of new study subjects that were not
      previously involved in the IDE study for this device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 10 (up to 5 original IDE + 5 new sites)

      A prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized, multicenter study. Subjects will be seen for a
      clinic visit pre-operatively at the time of consent, (-90 days to surgery) and then at
      post-operatively at 6 weeks (1-92 days), 1 year (275-455 days), 2 years (640-820 days) and 3
      years (1005-1185days), 4 years (1370-1550 days), and a minimum of 5 years (1825- 2919 days).

      Data collected will include: Pre-operatively subject history and demographics; Operative and
      device details; and Post-operatively Harris HIp scores, Subject Hip Outcomes, and Adverse
      Events.

      In order to optimize mid-term follow-up compliance, site personnel are permitted to contact
      the study subject in the 3 and 4 year intervals by phone (in place of a clinic visit) to
      assess the current status of the hip.

    <measure>Subject Hip Outcomes (Clinic)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subject Hip Outcomes will be estimated at 6-Wks (1-92 days); 1-year (275-455 days); 2-years (640-820 days); 3-years (1005-1185 days); 4-years (1370-1550 days); Minimum 5-years (1825- 2919 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Subject Hip Outcomes (Clinic) will be estimated at each year post-operatively. Subject Hip Outcomes is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that is designed for completion by the study subject. This hips outcomes self-assessment includes five (5) questions about subject satisfaction and hip function. The 5 questions subject's will answer regard their function, pain, need for pain meds, satisfaction and status (i.e., better, same, worse).
The percent of subjects who answer 'Yes' or 'Better' on each respective question will be reported.</description>

    <description>High quality antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of the operative hip will be obtained during the same intervals as for the clinical evaluations. At the first post-operative visit (6-Weeks), an additional Cross-Table Lateral film will be collected to permit assessment of the cup positioning.
Radiographic views:
AP Pelvis
AP femur (The AP femur view is required only when the distal end of the femur is not visible on the AP-Pelvis view)
Lauenstein Lateral
Cross-Table Lateral (Only at 6-Week post-op)
As a single composite radiographic outcome, the percent of subjects with radiolucencies greater than 2 mm, acetabular cup migration greater than 4 mm, change in cup inclination greater than 4 degrees or osteolysis at the time of last radiographic assessment will be reported.</description>
