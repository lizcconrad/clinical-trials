    <measure>To evaluate the effect of combined whey protein and creatine supplement, as compared with whey protein supplement alone, on change in upper body strength from Baseline to Week 4.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Body strength will be evaluated using Repetition maximum (1-RM) and bench and leg press exercise testing. 1-RM in weight training is the maximum amount of weight one can lift in a single repetition for a given exercise</description>
