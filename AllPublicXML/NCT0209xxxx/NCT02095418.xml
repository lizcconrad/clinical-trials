  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With improvements in patient and graft survival, increasing attention has been placed on
      complications that contribute to long-term patient morbidity and mortality. New-onset
      diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a common complication of solid-organ
      transplantation, and is a strong predictor of graft failure and cardiovascular mortality in
      the transplant population. Risk factors for NODAT in transplant recipients are similar to
      those in non-transplant patients, but transplant-specific risk factors such as hepatitis C
      (HCV) infection, corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors play a dominant role in NODAT
      pathogenesis. The predominant factor for causing NODAT by corticosteroids seems to be the
      aggravation of insulin resistance; however several studies have displayed deleterious effects
      on insulin secretion and β-cells. Thus, adjusting the immunosuppressant regimen to improve
      glucose tolerance must be measured and defined from long term perspective.

      As recipients of organ transplants survive longer, the complications of NODAT have assumed
      greater importance; therefore, we designed a prospective study to compare the safety and
      efficacy of early versus late withdrawal of corticosteroids after liver transplantation.
