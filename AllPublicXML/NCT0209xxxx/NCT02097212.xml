  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that there is a strong correlation between OSA and TBM/HDAC.
      Our hypothesis is based on the similarities in mechanism (airway collapse), symptoms (daytime
      and nocturnal dyspnea) predisposing conditions (obesity and neuromuscular abnormalities of
      the chest wall and the diaphragm), and effect of interventions (CPAP and BIPAP) in these
      diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) and HyperDynamic Airway Collapse (HDAC) are two distinct airway
      diseases that lead to airway collapse which can in turn lead to the symptoms of dyspnea,
      cough, and inability to expectorate sputum effectively. TBM entails flaccid tracheal and
      bronchial cartilages leading to airway collapse, emanating primarily from the anterior wall
      of the lumen. It is seen in conditions such as Relapsing Polychondritis and saber sheath
      tracheal deformity. HDAC on the other hand is the hyper-flaccidity of the membranous portion
      of the tracheobronchial tree leading to airway collapse. This condition is commonly seen with
      obesity and severe emphysema. TBM and HDAC frequently coexist.

      In patients with TBM/HDAC sleep disorders are common. Patients often complain of poor quality
      sleep, snoring, daytime fatigue, and somnolence. These patients are often diagnosed with
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) upon workup.

    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is widely used in the field of sleep medicine as a subjective measure of a patient's sleepiness. The test is a list of eight situations in which you rate your tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0, no chance of dozing, to 3, high chance of dozing.</description>

        In this pilot study we plan to recruit 30 consecutive patients with TBM/HDAC from the
        interventional pulmonology clinic at National Jewish Health (NJH). These patients will
        already have an established diagnosis of TBM and/or HDAC.
