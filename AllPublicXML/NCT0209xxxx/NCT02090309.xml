  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that low (or low relatively to the situation) cortisol levels
      might be a causative factor of whiplash injury or post traumatic stress disorder following
      road accidents. In this study the investigators enroll patients who sustained a road
      accident. From all patients a blood sample will be withdrawn to measure cortisol
      concentrations. Than, the patients will be divided into 2 groups: the study group will
      receive a single injection of intravenous Hydrocortisone 100 milligram (a synthetic steroid
      used routinely for many years). The control group will receive a same volume of normal saline
      which would be used as a placebo treatment. The investigators assume that patients with low
      cortisol levels would tend to have a higher incidence of whiplash injuries and / or post
      traumatic stress disorders, and that a single bolus of hydrocortisone may prevent these
      untoward sequelas of trauma.

      Study protocol Patients arriving during day time (08:00 - 16:00) to the Soroka Hospital
      emergency department following a motor vehicle accident and will be found eligible will be
      asked to participate in the study. Following an informed consent the recruited patients will
      be randomly divided into a study group or a control group. From all the participants a volume
      of 5 milliliter of peripheral blood will be withdrawn for cortisol concentration
      determination prior to the study intervention. After withdrawing the blood sample patients
      will receive a single bolus of intravenous Hydrocortisone 100 milligram (study group) or
      normal saline (0.9%) at a similar volume to that of the study drug, 5 ml (control group).
      Patients will be otherwise receiving the regular management of a trauma patient. The enrolled
      patients will fill simple, short questionnaires including demographic data, neck disability
      index, (NDI), numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), Tampa scale for kinesiophobia (TSK-11), PTSD
      questionnaire (PDA), and will be assessed by the treating physician for the degree of
      whiplash (WAD 0-4).

      The patients will be followed-up by one of the investigators for a period of 6 months. In
      each visit the patient will be assessed again by the above mention tools.

      Sample size: 45 patients in each arm. Blinding and randomization: triple blinding and using a
      randomization software. Statistical assessment will be performed to identify differences of
      developing WAD (whiplash associated disorder) between patients who had an admission low level
      of cortisol compared with those who had a high or normal level, and also between patients who
      received hydrocortisone compared to those who received placebo.
