      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the abuse potential of dronabinol oral
      solution in recreational cannabinoid users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a four-day period for screening and qualification, there are five treatment visits
      with a minimum 8-day washout between treatments. Each participant will receive all treatments
      in a 5-way crossover design.

    <description>Each participant receives all treatments (of placebo, dronabinol 10 mg and dronabinol 30 mg) in a 5-way crossover design. At each treatment visit, participants receive a single dose, contained in two syringes of oral solution and three capsules. When dronabinol is in syringes, placebo is in capsules, and when dronabinol is in capsules, placebo is in syringes. When assigned to take placebo only, placebo is in both the syringes and the capsules.</description>
