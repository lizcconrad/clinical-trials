  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death, hospitalization, and health care costs
      in developed nations. Coronary revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
      surgery improves the long term survival in patients with diabetes and multi-vessel disease.
      Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) reduce
      mortality and subsequent cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing
      CABG surgery when initiated at least 4 weeks pre-operatively. Observational data have
      suggested that pre-operative ACE administration is associated with an increased risk of
      post-operative vasoplegic shock, acute kidney injury, and mortality; however, other studies
      have failed to confirm these findings and further suggested ACE are associated with a reduced
      risk of peri-operative myocardial infarction. A single trial of 40 CABG patients randomized
      to pre-operative ACE withdrawal or continuation reported that the withdrawal group required
      significantly fewer vasopressors during cardiopulmonary bypass but more intravenous
      vasodilators post-operatively to control hypertension. Hence, it remains unclear whether ACEs
      should be held or continued immediately prior to CABG surgery and a survey of cardiac
      surgeons suggests that current clinical practice is divided. This pilot study aims to
      establish the feasibility of the study design and to determine the frequency of clinical
      endpoints among patients who continue and discontinue ACE prior to cardiac surgery.
