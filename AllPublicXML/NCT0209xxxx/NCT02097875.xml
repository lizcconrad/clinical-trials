  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced
      patient survival. In addition, in some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid
      damage to normal tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function.
      We hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize
      the edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in
      real-time, as they operate.
