  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded trial (Chardonnay seed flour vs. placebo - in pill form)
      with the purpose to test the impact of a four-month supplementation with Chardonnay Seed
      Flour (CSF) on endothelial function. Chardonnay flour is made from wine grape skins and
      seeds. We will examine the effect of CSF on parameters such as endothelial function (via
      EndoPAT testing), plasma lipid levels, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, inflammatory
      markers, oxidative stress surrogates, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) as well as the
      makeup of and impact on the gut microbiome (via stool samples).
