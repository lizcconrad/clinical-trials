  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to study whether pomegranate juice benefits cognitive abilities in
      middle-aged and older non-demented volunteers. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment groups: either a placebo or the pomegranate juice. Subjects will drink eight
      ounces of the pomegranate juice or placebo daily for twelve months.

      The investigators expect the people receiving the pomegranate juice to show better cognitive
      performance compared with those receiving a placebo after one, six, and twelve months. The
      investigators believe cognitive decline and treatment response will vary according to a
      genetic risk for Alzheimer's.

      The investigators will study 212 non-demented subjects aged 50-75 years. Initially, subjects
      will undergo a clinical assessment, an MRI and a blood draw to determine genetic risk and to
      rule out other neurodegenerative disorders linked to memory complaints.

      Subsequently, subjects will undergo the first memory (or neuropsychological) assessments.
      Following the first assessment, subjects will begin drinking the juice (either the
      pomegranate juice or the placebo). Subjects will undergo a brief memory test at one-month
      mark. At six months, subjects will have a second, full neuropsychological assessment. The
      final assessment will take place at the end of the study, the 12-month mark. Additional blood
      will be drawn at baseline and at 12 months and frozen to assess inflammatory markers if
      outcomes are positive.

      In total, subjects will be expected to come to the University of California, Los Angeles
      (UCLA) for 5 visits during the course of 12-13 months.

The Placebo is engineered to look and taste the same as the Pomegranate Juice and contains the same vitamins and minerals as the Pomegranate Juice. Because the Placebo juice does not come from actual pomegranates, it does not contain the polyphenols contained in the Pomegranate Juice.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Agreement to participate in the 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
             trial of pomegranate extract.

          -  Nondemented subjects either those with normal cognition or with Mild Cognitive
             Impairment will be included.

          -  Age 50 to 75 years.

          -  No significant cerebrovascular disease: modified Ischemic Score of &lt; 4

          -  Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing.

          -  Screening laboratory tests and EKG without significant abnormalities that might
             interfere with the study. If screening laboratory tests or EKG show abnormalities,
             subject must obtain written clearance from primary care physician before continuing in
             the study.
