  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different dosing
      regimens of brigatinib (AP26113) in participants with ALK-positive locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on therapy with
      crizotinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Brigatinib (AP26113). Brigatinib is being
      tested to treat people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. This study
      will look at the efficacy of Brigatinib.

      The study enrolled 222 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Brigatinib 90 mg

        -  Brigatinib 90 mg -180 mg

      All participants will be asked to take tablet, orally once daily until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicity. Participants in Brigatinib 90 mg - 180 mg received 180 mg with a 7-day
      lead-in at 90 mg.

      This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 3 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and 3 months
      after the End-of-Treatment visit. Follow-up is intended to continue for 2 years after the
      last participants was enrolled into the study.

    <description>ORR assessed by the investigator, is defined as proportion of the participants with confirmed Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (confirmed ≥4 weeks after initial response), after initiation of study treatment. CR for target lesion: disappearance of all extranodal lesions and all pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis. CR for non-target lesion: Disappearance of all extranodal non-target lesions, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis) and norrmalization of tumor marker level. PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. The exact 2-sided 97.5% confidence interval was calculated.

    <description>Patient-reported symptoms global health status/quality of life (QoL) scores were based on questions 29 and 30 of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30). The first 28 questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all,2=a little,3=quite a bit,4=very much) for evaluating 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting); and last 2 questions on global health status/QoL scale are coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). Six single-item scales also are included (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Raw scores for multi-item scales and single-item measures will be linearly transformed to obtain the score ranging from 0 to 100, where higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning.</description>

        <title>Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>ORR assessed by the investigator, is defined as proportion of the participants with confirmed Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 (confirmed ≥4 weeks after initial response), after initiation of study treatment. CR for target lesion: disappearance of all extranodal lesions and all pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis. CR for non-target lesion: Disappearance of all extranodal non-target lesions, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis) and norrmalization of tumor marker level. PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. The exact 2-sided 97.5% confidence interval was calculated. The treatment regimen was considered to have achieved the primary objective when lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for ORR assessed by investigator is greater than 20%.</description>

        <description>Confirmed intracranial CNS ORR is defined as the proportion of the participants with CR or PR in the intracranial CNS per modification of RECIST v1.1 as evaluated by IRC after the initiation of study drug. Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging 4 weeks or more after initial response. CR for target lesion: disappearance of all extranodal non-target lesions, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis). CR for non-target lesion: disappearance of all extranodal non-target lesions, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis) and norrmalization of tumor marker level. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

        <title>Disease Control Rate</title>
        <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of randomized participants who were confirmed to have achieved CR or PR or have a best overall response as stable disease (SD) for 6 weeks or more after initiation of the study drug. CR for target lesion: disappearance of all extranodal lesions and all pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis. CR for non-target lesion: Disappearance of all extranodal non-target lesions, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis) and norrmalization of tumor marker level. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD).</description>

        <title>Patient-reported Symptoms Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) Scores</title>
        <description>Patient-reported symptoms global health status/quality of life (QoL) scores were based on questions 29 and 30 of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30). The first 28 questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all,2=a little,3=quite a bit,4=very much) for evaluating 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting); and last 2 questions on global health status/QoL scale are coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). Six single-item scales also are included (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Raw scores for multi-item scales and single-item measures will be linearly transformed to obtain the score ranging from 0 to 100, where higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning.</description>
