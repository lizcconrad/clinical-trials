      Objective: To analyze different parameters in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) obtained
      through the use of a stabilometric platform and compare them with those of a control
      population. To interpret the data in order to find some postural instability indicators that
      can become useful to build a rehabilitation strategy for balance disorders in PD.

      Background: Posture and balance are the foundation on wich upright stance and walking are
      executed. Postural instability is the impairment in balance that compromises the ability to
      maintain or change posture such as standing and walking. It is considered to be one of the
      cardinal features of PD. In such patients it is present even at diagnosis and worsens with
      disease progression. It correlates with falls representing a major source of disability and
      reduced QoL in PD. In this course, the study of balance is important to identify patients who
      can benefit from specific rehabilitative treatment.

    <description>With respect to the average centre of gravity the Standard Deviation of trunk sway (total, in Antero-Posterior and in Medio-Lateral direction) were calculated. In this way it was possible to obtain a statokinesigram, that is the layout of a line connecting the successive positions of the center of pressure during the recording, and the area of the ellipse containing 90% of the sampled positions of the center of pressure. These measurements were obtained with open eyes (OE), and while the patient performing a cognitive task (counting).</description>
