  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ibuprofen - Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) - Safety trial investigates tolerability and
      feasibility of &quot;small molecule&quot; (Ibuprofen) mediated Rho-inhibition as putative
      neuroprotective, plasticity-enhancing and neurorestaurative intervention. The primary safety
      analysis is based on the incidence of severe gastrointestinal bleedings. In addition, the
      feasibility of recruitment procedure, and oral administration of the compound within the
      multidisciplinary setting of acute intensive medical care will be explored. Furthermore, the
      pharmacokinetics of Ibuprofen under the condition of acute motor complete SCI will be
      investigated. Secondary endpoints will permit preliminary statements about effects on
      neuropathic pain, spasticity, and neurological function.
