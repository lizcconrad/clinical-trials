      Importance: There are no global screening recommendations for esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma (ESCC). Endoscopic screening has been investigated in high incidence areas of China
      since 1970's. But up until now there no apparent evidence that would lead to a reduction in
      disease morbidity and mortality.

      Objective: To evaluate whether endoscopic screening and early intervention program could
      reduce the incidence or mortality of ESCC.

      Design: Community-based, controlled cohort study among 45 386 residents, Endoscopy screening
      was completed from November 1999 to May of 2000. Subjects in intervention group were examined
      once during intervention period. The study follow-up concluded in December 2009.

      Setting: High risk area of ESCC in China

      Participants:Cluster sampling from communities with high rates of esophageal cancer. A set of
      villages with was selected as the study intervention community. Age 40 to 69 years residents
      were selected as an eligible population. Another set of villages was select as the control
      population. Buffer villages were set up between intervention and control group.

      Intervention: Endoscopy with Lugol's iodine staining and early treatment on precancerous
      lesions was undergone for the intervention group.

      Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Incidence and mortality ESCC
