  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether positron emission tomography (PET), using
      the new imaging drug [124 I] PSCA-Minibody can be used for imaging prostate, pancreatic or
      bladder cancer that has spread to the bones and soft tissues (e.g., lymph nodes, lungs,
      etc.). The PET imaging drug tested in this study binds to the cell marker called Prostate
      Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA), which is present on certain prostate, pancreatic and bladder
      cancers.

      The people doing this study want to find out:

        1. Can the [124 I] PSCA-Minibody be used to image prostate, pancreatic and bladder cancer?

        2. How much of the PSCA Minibody needs to be used to see the prostate, pancreatic or
           bladder cancer?

        3. Does the PSCA Minibody see more/same/fewer lesions than are identified on traditional
           scans such as bone scan or CT scan?

      To answer these questions, we want to evaluate how [124 I] PSCA-Minibody is distributed
      throughout the body in 20 patients with prostate, pancreatic or bladder cancer. This is done
      with PET/CT imaging. A PET/CT scan is a non-invasive x-ray test that uses a special camera to
      take pictures of the inside of your body. It can &quot;see&quot; the radiation given off by tiny
      particles called positrons in the radioactive drug injected into you while also taking
      pictures of the organs within the body. For this study the radioactive substance is [124 I]
      PSCA-Minibody.

      The scanning for this study is done with an imaging procedure in the department of Nuclear
      Medicine during which the experimental drug [124 I] PSCA-Minibody will be administered by
      intravenous (i.v.) infusion. An experimental drug is one that is not yet approved by the US
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [124 I] PSCA-Minibody is a combination of a monoclonal
      antibody, and I-124, a radioactive type of iodine. The iodine will make the antibody and the
      cancer cells visible in a PET scan. PET stands for positron emission tomography and uses
      radioactivity to image the inside of the body. A CT scan uses x-rays to look at the internal
      organs in the body. This study will use a combination PET/CT to look at the cancer cells in
      your body that have taken up the study agent as well as to see their location in your body.
