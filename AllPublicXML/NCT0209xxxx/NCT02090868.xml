  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore how the introduction of an oral intake screening tool can benefit
      patients requiring noninvasive ventilation. The Quality Care Commission has identified
      nutritional problems in hospital and there is much literature on the importance of nutrition
      when critically ill. Literature is short however concerning the specialized population of
      those requiring noninvasive ventilation and they are a high risk group of suffering from
      malnutrition.

      This study will potentially benefit patients by improving their nutritional care through
      guided assessment and nurse training.

      The study will use mixed methodology, a prospective cohort study and qualitative interviews.
      The prospective cohort study will collect data from patients prior to the tool introduction,
      the control group, and post the tool introduction, the exposure group. This will enable
      comparisons to be made between the exposure and the control groups.

      Nurses will be interviewed in semi structured focus groups prior to tool introduction and
      post to identify themes and sub themes to give a deeper understanding of nutrition in
      hospital and to examine the use of the tool in practice.

      Patients will be eligible if they are over 18 and requiring noninvasive ventilation and
      nurses will be eligible if they work on the high dependency unit. Patients will be visited
      daily and have four mid arm circumference measurements at day 1, day 3, day 7 and day 14. The
      other daily visits will involve collecting data, which is recorded as part of routine care.

      Nurses will undergo 2 focus group interviews and a teaching session. The study will take
      place at St Mary's hospital funded by Imperial College London. The study will be split into
      two periods with a two week gap in between. Each period will last until 22 patient
      participants have been recruited.

      No patients were recruited to the study due to decreased levels of patients requiring
      non-invasive ventilation during the study period and time constraints owing to an academic
      award submission date. Six nurse participants were recruited to the study and underwent two
      focus group interviews, one prior to tool implementation and one post.
