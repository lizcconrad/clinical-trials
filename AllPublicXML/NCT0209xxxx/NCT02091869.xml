      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of a
      mobile-based Asthma Action Plan that will meet the national guidelines recommendation for
      individualized Asthma Action Plan treatment plans. The mobile app will provide immediate
      instructions and feedback once data is entered by the participants. This is an randomized
      trial which will be compared with an paper asthma action plan. Participants will be
      randomized through a statistical table. The mobile app will be password and Health
      Information Portability and Protection Act protected.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Asthma Control Test Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Control Test™ (ACT) is a 5 question health survey used to measure asthma control in individuals 12 years of age and older. The total sum scores range from 5-25. Higher scores mean that asthma is more controlled. The ACT is an efficient, reliable, and valid method of measuring asthma control, with or without, lung functioning measures such as spirometry. ACT helps identify and detect asthma patients who are not well controlled. ACT scores were examined pre- and post-intervention. A score total of 19 or less means asthma may not be well controlled. The timeframe is during the past 4 weeks. The scale range for Question 1 is &quot;all the time&quot; (1) to &quot;none of the time&quot; (5); Question 2 range: &quot;more than once a day&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 3 range: &quot;4 or more nights a week&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 4 range: &quot;3 or more times per day&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 5 range: &quot;not controlled at all&quot; (1) to &quot;completely controlled&quot; (5).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Asthma Self-Efficacy Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Self-Efficacy instrument is a 14 item validated questionnaire designed to measure the child's self-efficacy with regard to attack prevention and attack management. The child will be required to select one of 5 responses ranging from &quot;not at all sure&quot; (1 point); &quot;a little bit sure&quot; (2 points); &quot;fairly sure&quot; (3 points); &quot;quite sure&quot; (4 points) to &quot;completely sure&quot; (5 points). Total score range from 14-70. The attack prevention scale range from 6-30 and attack management range from 8-40. The higher score represent a greater degree of self-efficacy. The Cronbach's α reliability = 0.75. The child self-efficacy questionnaire will be administered at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the end of the intervention (post-intervention).</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Participant Usage Rates Between Mobile and Paper Asthma Action Plans</measure>

    <description>We measured the participant usage rates by frequency of a mobile asthma action plan compared to usage rates of a paper asthma action plan. No mobile usage data was collected for the paper asthma plan group; and no paper usage data was collected for mobile phone group.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 12 and ≤ 17 years.

          -  Access to Apple or Android based smart phone

          -  Mild to severe persistent asthma or poorly controlled asthma (see definitions below).

             o A different assessment of eligibility will be performed depending on whether or not
             the parent reports use of a preventive asthma medication at baseline. This is
             consistent with 2007 National Asthma Education Prevention Program recommendations that
             make a strong distinction between classifying asthma severity (for children not using
             preventive medications) and assessing control (for children using preventive
             medications). If a child has used a preventive medication in the past, but reports no
             use of the medication in the prior 3 months, we will assess severity.)

          -  Children not using a preventive medication at baseline: Assess for mild persistent to
             severe persistent asthma. Any 1 of the following, during the prior 4 weeks (as defined
             by parent interview in the waiting room) will determine severity:

               -  An average of &gt;2 days per week with asthma symptoms

               -  &gt;2 days per week with rescue medication use

               -  ≥2 nights per month awakened with nighttime symptoms

               -  Minor limitation of activity

               -  ≥2 episodes of asthma during the past year that have required systemic
                  corticosteroids

          -  Children using a preventive medication at baseline: Assess for poorly controlled
             asthma. Any 1 of the following, during the prior 4 weeks (as defined by parent
             interview in the waiting room) will determine control:

               -  An average of &gt;2 days per week with asthma symptoms

               -  &gt;2 days per week with rescue medication use

               -  ≥2 nights per month awakened with nighttime symptoms

               -  Some limitation of activity

               -  ≥2 episodes of asthma during the past year that have required systemic
                  corticosteroids.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant underlying respiratory disease other than asthma (such as cystic fibrosis
             or chronic lung disease) that could potentially interfere with asthma-related outcome
             measures.

          -  Significant co-morbid conditions (such as moderate to severe developmental delay, i.e.
             special education classroom or diagnosis) that could preclude participation in an
             education-based intervention.

          -  Inability to speak or understand English (child or parent).

          -  Children in foster care or other situations in which consent cannot be obtained from a
             guardian.

          -  Prior enrollment in the study.

        <title>Change in Asthma Control Test Scores</title>
        <description>The Asthma Control Test™ (ACT) is a 5 question health survey used to measure asthma control in individuals 12 years of age and older. The total sum scores range from 5-25. Higher scores mean that asthma is more controlled. The ACT is an efficient, reliable, and valid method of measuring asthma control, with or without, lung functioning measures such as spirometry. ACT helps identify and detect asthma patients who are not well controlled. ACT scores were examined pre- and post-intervention. A score total of 19 or less means asthma may not be well controlled. The timeframe is during the past 4 weeks. The scale range for Question 1 is &quot;all the time&quot; (1) to &quot;none of the time&quot; (5); Question 2 range: &quot;more than once a day&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 3 range: &quot;4 or more nights a week&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 4 range: &quot;3 or more times per day&quot; (1) to &quot;not at all&quot; (5); Question 5 range: &quot;not controlled at all&quot; (1) to &quot;completely controlled&quot; (5).</description>

        <description>The Child Self-Efficacy instrument is a 14 item validated questionnaire designed to measure the child's self-efficacy with regard to attack prevention and attack management. The child will be required to select one of 5 responses ranging from “not at all sure” (1 point); &quot;a little bit sure&quot; (2 points); &quot;fairly sure&quot; (3 points); &quot;quite sure&quot; (4 points) to “completely sure” (5 points). Total score range from 14-70. The attack prevention scale range from 6-30 and attack management range from 8-40. The higher score represent a greater degree of self-efficacy. The Cronbach’s α reliability = 0.75. The child self-efficacy questionnaire will be administered at baseline (pre-intervention) and at the end of the intervention (post-intervention).</description>
