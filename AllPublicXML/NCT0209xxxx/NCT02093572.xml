  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the disruption of the &quot;normal&quot;
      (three meals a day) eating pattern and prolonged overnight fasting caused by skipping
      breakfast: i) alters the expression of specific clock genes and clock gene targets involved
      in regulating adipose tissue lipolysis (breakdown or destruction); ii) increases basal
      adipose tissue lipolytic (breakdown) activity and plasma free fatty acid (FFA)
      concentrations; iii) reduces skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity; and iv) increases daylong
      plasma glucose, FFA, and insulin concentrations. The investigator will do this by studying
      healthy, lean persons either randomized to consume either 3 standard meals per day or omit
      breakfast and consume 2 meals per day without changing daily calorie intake (skipping
      breakfast group).

    <description>Serial biopsy samples (every 6 hours) of adipose tissue and muscle will be obtained during the 24-hour feeding study to evaluate diurnal expression patterns of i) clock genes [CLOCK, brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1(BMAL1), period1 (PER1), period2 (PER2), and Dbp D site albumin promoter binding protein (DBP)] in adipose tissue and muscle and ii) putative downstream clock gene targets associated with lypolysis in adipose tissue [hormone-sensitive lipase(HSL) and adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL)], skeletal muscle insulin action [glucose transporter type 4(GLUT4)] and skeletal muscle fatty acid metabolism [cluster of differentiation 36(CD36), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4(PDK4)].</description>
