  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals'
      Infanrix hexa vaccine when administered to healthy infants as primary vaccination at 2, 4 and
      6 months of age, co-administered with Prevnar and Rotarix with a booster dose of GSK
      Biologicals' Infanrix and Hiberix vaccines at 15-18 months of age.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥38.0°C /100.4°F by any route. The preferred
