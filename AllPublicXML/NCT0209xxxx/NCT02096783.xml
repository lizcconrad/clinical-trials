  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of a pre-operative and/or
      post-operative scripted sexual health informational intervention and how well it works in
      improving sexual function in patients with gynecologic cancer. Discussing sexual outcomes and
      counseling options with patients may help improve sexual outcomes and/or anxiety after
      primary gynecologic cancer treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of patient recruitment, including time required to consent,
      enroll and retain the necessary number of participants.

      II. To determine the distribution of candidate primary patient‐reported outcome measures,
      including time to resumption of sexual activity, global satisfaction with sex life, sexual
      function and anxiety in this particular population.

      III. To establish the prevalence of patient recall of the intervention to determine the most
      effective time at which to deliver the intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard counseling at both the pre-operative and 2-4 week
      post-operative visit.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard counseling at the pre-operative visit and the scripted
      sexual health intervention at the 2-4 week post-operative visit.

      ARM III: Patients receive standard counseling and the scripted sexual health intervention at
      the pre-operative visit and standard counseling at the 2-4 week post-operative visit.

      ARM IV: Patients receive standard counseling and the scripted sexual health intervention at
      both the pre-operative and 2-4 week post-operative visit.
