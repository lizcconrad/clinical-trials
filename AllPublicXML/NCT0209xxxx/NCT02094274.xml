    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the the ability of a single dose of LAS40468
      administered via Genuair® and a single dose of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (Seretide®)
      administered via Accuhaler to produce bronchodilation (opening of the airways) and the safety
      and tolerability of the treatments

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, cross-over trial to assess the
      bronchodilation effect of a single dose of LAS40468 and a single dose of
      salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (Seretide®) administered to adult patients with stable
      asthma.

      The study will consist of a screening visit and treatment periods of approximately 13 hours
      separated by washout periods of 7 to 14 days from the time of Investigational Medicinal
      product (IMP) administration.

    <measure>Change from baseline (pre-dose at each period) in normalised forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) area under the curve (AUC) over the 12 hour period after IMP administration (AUC0-12)</measure>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject (regardless of the administration of the IMP and the causal relationship to it). An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended medical occurrence during subject's participation in the trial, including deterioration of a pre-existing medical, an ECG abnormality, a blood pressure abnormal value or an abnormal finding in the physical examination.
A Serious AE is any AE that: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongs existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is any other medically important event that may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other above outcomes. Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious AE.</description>
