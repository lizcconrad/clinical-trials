  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TrkA (coded
      by the gene NTRK1), TrkB (coded by the gene NTRK2), TrkC (coded by the gene NTRK3), ROS1
      (coded by the gene ROS1), and ALK (coded by the gene ALK). Molecular alterations to one or
      more of these targets are present in several different tumor types, including non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), prostate cancer, papillary thyroid cancer,
      pancreatic cancer, and neuroblastoma. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer
      with a detectable molecular alteration in targets of interest may be eligible for enrollment.

      Phase 1 will assess safety and tolerability of entrectinib via standard dose escalation
      scheme and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. Safety and efficacy will be assessed in
      the dose expansion portion of the study.
