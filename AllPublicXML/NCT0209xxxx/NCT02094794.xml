    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the safety and efficacy of total marrow and lymphoid irradiation
      (TMLI) in combination with two chemotherapy drugs, etoposide and cyclophosphamide, as a
      preparative regimen before donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with high-risk
      acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have failed previous
      therapy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses imaging to provide a
      three-dimensional view of the area to be irradiated. Doctors can then shape and direct the
      radiation beams at the area from multiple directions while avoiding, as much as possible,
      nearby organs. TMLI is a method of using IMRT to direct radiation to the bone marrow.
      Radiation therapy is given before transplant to suppress the immune system, prevent rejection
      of the transplanted cells, and wipe out any remaining cancer cells. TMLI may allow a greater
      radiation dose to be delivered to the bone marrow as a preparative regimen before transplant
      while causing fewer side effects than standard radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Following a patient safety lead-in, evaluate the anti-tumor activity
      of the allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) preparative regimen - TMLI,
      cyclophosphamide (Cy) and etoposide (VP-16), as assessed by 2-year progression-free survival
      (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence (CI) of
      relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

      II. Evaluate early and late toxicities/complications by organ and severity, and characterize
      by organ dose/dose volume, including acute/chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD),
      infection, and longer-term complications (via protocol #s 07173 and 00029).

      Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT)/Water Fat Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WFMRI)
      Correlative Objectives (Optional):

      I. Temporal assessment of treatment impact on bone marrow as measured by: change over time in
      cellularity and adiposity (bone marrow trephine hematoxylin and eosin [H&amp;E]) and change over
      time of red marrow (cellularity) and yellow marrow (adipocyte) (water-fat MRI and dual energy
      CT).

      II. Relative assessment of bone marrow status between TMLI and conventional total body
      irradiation (TBI).

      III Correlation of DECT, MRI, imaging with biological samples (bone marrow biopsy) for
      cellularity/adiposity.

      IV. Relative assessment of chimerism engraftment kinetics between TMLI and TBI.

      3'-Deoxy-3'[^18F] Fluorothymidine (FLT)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Correlative
      Objectives (Optional): I. Feasibility of FLT-PET imaging biomarker as a predictor of
      treatment response.

      II. Correlation of FLT-PET imaging with biological correlate for leukemia. III. Characterize
      relative distribution of leukemia in bone marrow (BM) environment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo image guided TMLI on days -9 to -5, receive etoposide intravenously
      (IV) on day -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2, and undergo allogeneic peripheral blood
      stem cell or bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
