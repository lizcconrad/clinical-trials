  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC) is a frequent disease in Brittany (5 to 7‰), responsible
      first for biological disorder in blood iron parameters and minor clinical disorders, before
      evolving to potential life-threatening consequences such as diabetes, liver cirrhosis and
      congestive heart failure.

      The improvement of screening and treatments made those severe affections rare enough not to
      evaluate myocardial iron overload a systematic part of the starting check-up. Nonetheless
      this myocardial iron overload might have severe implications on cardiac function on a long
      term basis.

      A single trial was conducted on limited number of patients with 1.5 Tesla MRI, which showed a
      myocardial iron overload (defined by a myocardium T2* value &lt;20ms) in 19% of the subjects.

      The main objective of this study is to precisely estimate cardiac iron overload in treatment
      naive patients with newly diagnosed HFE hereditary haemochromatosis with a 3 Tesla MRI, more
      sensitive than the 1.5 Tesla one, in order to later appreciate its correlation with cardiac
      morbidity in HHC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the wide use of phlebotomy was implemented the incidence of congestive heart failure in
      HHC became quite low. As such, the interest towards the initial diagnosis and cardiological
      follow-up has been lesser. A subclinical myocardial iron overload can nevertheless exist and
      eventually lead to functional consequences in the medium and long term if neglected, even
      evolve into heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.

      The expected aftermath of this study is :

        -  The estimation of the frequency of myocardial iron overload measured by 3 Tesla MRI in
           patient with HFE hereditary haemochromatosis;

        -  The assessment of its consequences on heart function;

        -  The appreciation of a cardiological assessment strategy in patients with HFE hereditary
           haemochromatosis.
