  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are limited therapeutical options for patients with secondary dystonia due to cerebral
      palsy. Pharmacotherapy is often without effect, or side effects are severe. Meanwhile deep
      brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with
      parkinson´s disease or primary / idiopathic dystonia. Experiences with DBS in patients with
      dyskinetic cerebral palsy are limited with heterogeneous data.

      With STIM-CP we investigate the effect of DBS on quality of life in young patients with a
      dyskinetic movement disorder (dyskinetic cerebral palsy) due to perinatal hypoxic brain
      injury. Additionally, the effect of DBS on motor development, speech, memory, attention,
      cognition and pain perception will be assessed. In total, 20 patients aged 7-18 years
      diagnosed with dyskinetic cerebral palsy, who will receive DBS, should be included. 11 German
      DBS-centres will participate in the trial.

      We assume that DBS reduces the severity of dystonia and improves the quality of life in these
      patients.
