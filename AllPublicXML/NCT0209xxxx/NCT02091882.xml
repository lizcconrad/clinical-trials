      The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 System
      by completing a series of Patch applications and IEM ingestions in the clinic.

      The OSMITTER study protocol is designed as a master protocol governing multiple substudies
      for the rapid assessment of candidate subcomponents for the MIND1 System. This substudy is
      being conducted to determine the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 System by completing
      a series of Patch applications and IEM ingestions in the clinic. Following placement of the
      Patch by clinic staff, subjects will ingest one tablet approximately every 2 hours, for a
      total of 4 ingestions. Aripiprazole-embedded IEM tablets are being tested along with the
      placebo-embedded IEM tablets to assess any difference in accuracy of IEM detection and
      latency. Approximately 32 healthy volunteer subjects will be enrolled in the substudy. The
      duration of this substudy for each subject is estimated to be 1 day of active participation
      plus a 2-week safety follow up (phone call) period.

    <description>Following placement of the Patch by clinic staff, subjects will ingest one IEM tablet approximately every 2 hours, for a total of 4 ingestions. The subject will ingest one 10 mg aripiprazole-embedded IEM tablet without food (Hour 0), one placebo-embedded IEM tablet without food (approximately Hour 2), one placebo-embedded IEM tablet with a high fat meal (approximately Hour 4), and one placebo-embedded IEM tablet without food (approximately Hour 6). Aripiprazole-embedded IEM tablets are being tested along with the placebo-embedded IEM tables to assess any differences in accuracy of IEM detection and latency. The time of ingestion will be recorded by clinic staff, and the time of IEM detection by the MIND1 System phone will be evaluated to determine the period of latency.</description>
