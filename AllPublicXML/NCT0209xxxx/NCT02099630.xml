  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate functional and metabolic changes in the course of antidepressive
      treatments.

      The investigators will apply different imaging methods to investigate the effects of
      antidepressive interventions on resting state neural activity, functional activation during
      cognitive and emotional stimulation, neurotransmitter concentrations as well as
      concentrations of brain- derived neurotrophic factor.

      The study will investigate functional and metabolic changes in the course of antidepressive
      treatments.

      The investigators will apply different imaging methods to investigate the effects of
      antidepressive interventions on resting state neural activity, functional activiation during
      cognitive and emotional stimulation, neurotransmitter concentrations as well as
      concentrations of brain- derived neurotrophic factor.

      The investigators hypothesize that antidepressive interventions modulate the excitatory
      glutamatergic system and thereby increase either the concentration of glutamate or the
      glutamate/ glutamine ratio. These metabolic changes are accompanied by altered functional
      activation in medial and lateral prefrontal areas during emotional and cognitive stimulation,
      respectively. After longterm treatment, excitatory glutamate and inhibitory
      gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations adapt to a new homeostatic level which is reflected in
      antidepressive response or remission of symptoms. The investigators assume that the levels of
      glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid determine the amplitude of BOLD responses during
      emotional and cognitive stimulation. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the
      plasma concentration of brain- derived neurotrophic factor might be a predictor for therapy
      response and changes in the course of treatment.

      With our protocol we adhere to the rules of good scientific practice and observe all relevant
      laws, regulations and guidelines that pertain to the project. The investigators' study is in
      compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee.
      Storage of data is in accordance with german privacy laws.

    <description>Neurotransmitter concentrations will be measured at 3 timepoints (at baseline, after the first antidepressive intervention and after patients show response or remission of symptoms). Measurements will show whether antidepressive interventions modulate the excitatory glutamatergic system and thereby increase either the concentration of glutamate or the glutamate/ glutamine ratio. After longterm treatment, excitatory glutamate and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations are hypothesized to adapt to a new homeostatic level which is reflected in antidepressive response or remission of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Neuronal activation patterns will be measured at 3 timepoints (at baseline, after the first antidepressive intervention and after patients show response or remission of symptoms). Measurements will show whether antidepressive interventions modulate resting state neural activity and functional activiation during cognitive and emotional stimulation. We expect changes in neurotransmitter concentrations to be accompanied by altered functional activation in medial and lateral prefrontal areas during emotional and cognitive stimulation, respectively. Furthermore, levels of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid are hypothesized to determine the amplitude of BOLD responses during emotional and cognitive stimulation.</description>
