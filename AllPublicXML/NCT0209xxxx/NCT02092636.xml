  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An imaging method has been developed that uses near infrared light as an adjunct to
      ultrasound for better diagnosis and for monitoring tumor response. This study will use a new,
      non-invasive way to evaluate breast lumps using a low power light source &amp; ultrasound to see
      if breast lumps are benign or cancerous. This study will also evaluate if this new technique
      might be useful in assessing response to chemotherapy.

      The investigators propose to validate the utility of the investigators novel hybrid imaging
      technique for accurate diagnosis of breast lesions, and for assessing chemotherapy response
      of cancer treatment and predicting treatment efficacy. The investigators unique hybrid
      technique is implemented by simultaneously deploying near infrared (NIR) optical sensors and
      a commercial ultrasound (US) transducer mounted on a hand-held probe, and utilizing
      co-registered lesion structure information provided by ultrasound to improve the inverse
      optical tomography reconstruction. As a result, the optical tomography assisted with US has
      overcome problems associated with intense light scattering and has provided reliable tumor
      angiogenesis distributions. Initial results with a group of 200 biopsied patients have shown
      that early stage invasive cancers present two-fold greater total hemoglobin concentration on
      average than fibroadenomas and other benign lesions. Initial results of advanced cancers have
      shown that the angiogenesis distribution is highly distorted and heterogeneous, and the
      distorted distributions correlate with histological microvessel density counts and can be
      used to assess chemotherapy response.

      Objective of this study is to validate the investigators initial results that NIR light
      guided by ultrasound can improve breast cancer diagnosis and monitor chemotherapy response.

    <description>Patients may have the NIR/US scan performed at the time of their initial ultrasound-guided biopsy. In addition, patients in this group may also have NIR/US performed according the schedule in Table 1. The number of NIR/US study visits for these subjects will vary from 1-11 depending on the subject's treatment regimen. The expected duration of study participation for these patients is approximately 6 months.</description>
