      The main purpose of the trial is to determine the effect of a study drug known as LY2409021
      on blood pressure and pulse rate in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when
      compared to placebo. The study has two periods. Each participant will receive LY2409021 or
      placebo in each period. At least 4 weeks will pass between periods. The study will last about
      23 weeks for each participant. Participants may remain on stable dose metformin, as
      prescribed by their personal physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have type 2 diabetes mellitus (according to the World Health Organization diagnostic
             criteria) and use diet and exercise alone or in combination with a stable dose of
             metformin ( &gt;/=1000 mg/day [or &lt;1000 mg, if documented intolerance to 1000 mg or
             higher dosages] immediate-release metformin or extended-release metformin for at least
             2 months before screening).

          -  Have glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values &gt;/=6.5% and &lt;/=8.5%, as determined by the
             central laboratory at screening.

          -  Have mean blood pressures &gt;90/60 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and &lt;140/90 mm Hg at
             screening.

          -  If being treated for hypertension, are taking 3 or fewer antihypertensive medications
             and have been taking stable doses of the same medications for at least 1 month before

               -  Perform self-monitored blood glucose testing; and

               -  Wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device for at least 24 hours (on
                  multiple occasions).

             doses of study medication. These requirements do not apply if a participant or his
             partner has been surgically sterilized or is not between menarche and 1 year
             postmenopausal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             aminotransferase (ALT) level greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Elevated total bilirubin (greater than 2 times ULN), clinically suspicious signs or
             symptoms of cirrhosis or history of cirrhosis.

          -  Mean resting pulse rate (PR) less than 60 beats per minute (bpm) or greater than 100
             bpm.
