  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is required to confirm the suitability of a candidate FDC of 16mg candesartan
      cilexetil/12.5mg HCTZ (GSK587323) formulation for further development and provide data to
      allow the design of a future pivotal bioequivalence study. This study aims to determine the
      relative bioavailability of a FDC tablet formulation of 16mg candesartan cilexetil/12.5mg
      HCTZ relative to the reference product of same fixed dose combination (16mg candesartan
      cilexetil/12.5mg HCTZ) in healthy adult humans. This will be an open-label, randomised,
      single dose, two-way crossover study. Each subject will participate in two treatment periods
      and will be randomized to one of two sequences and administered one of the two treatments, A
      or B, as per the randomization schedule. The two treatment periods will be separated by a
      washout period of 7 to 14 days to ensure the candesartan and HCTZ have been effectively
      eliminated from the subject between dosing occasions. The study will enroll 16 healthy
      subjects to ensure that 14 subjects complete the study as planned.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with
             the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  Male and females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator in consultation with the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor if
             required agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50kilograms (kg) and Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 19 - 24.9kg
             / meter^2 (m^2) (inclusive).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milli
             international units per millilitre (MlU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per
             millilitre (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomol per litre (pmol/L)) is confirmatory. Females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive
             method.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of child-bearing potential with
             negative pregnancy test as determined by serum or urine Human Chorionic Gonadotropin
             (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing AND agrees to use one of the contraception
             methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
             investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until the
             follow-up contact visit.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she has only same-sex partners, when
             this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first
             dose of study medication until the follow-up contact visit.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 1.5x Upper limit of
             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Based on single or averaged QT duration corrected for heart rate (QTc) of triplicate
             Electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief recording period: QT duration
             corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's Formula (QTcF) &lt; 450 millisecond (msec).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An
             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is
             equivalent to 8 grams (g) of alcohol: a half-pint (approximately 240 mL) of beer, 1
             glass (125 mL) of wine or 1 (25 mL) measure of spirits.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Gastrointestinal disease or with gastrointestinal surgical history which can affect
             the absorption of the investigational drug.

          -  Any subject with a systolic blood pressure (BP)&lt;95 millimetre of Mercury (mmHg) or
             with a recent history of postural symptoms

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or
             prior to dosing.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.
