  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide evidence of safety and effectiveness of the study
      valve. The rationale is to offer a replacement mitral valve for patients with anatomy that is
      too small for the currently commercially available valves ranging in size from 16mm to 37mm.

  <detailed_description>

      The study is a single arm, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical investigation.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 15mm MHV in
      subjects five years or less of age with a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning mitral heart
      valve. The objective will be evaluated by assessing valve-related adverse events, subject
      survival, subject growth, and echocardiogram assessment of hemodynamic function through the
      five year follow-up visit as long as the valve remains implanted.
