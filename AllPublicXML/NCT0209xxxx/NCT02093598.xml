      Type of Application: Clinical trial of new indication.

      Experimental drug: The study dose of temsirolimus will be 25 mg administered intravenously,
      infused over a 30- to 60-minute period once weekly for 28 days (Total doses: 4 doses).
      Temsirolimus is a selective inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin).
      Pharmacotherapeutic group: Protein Kinase Inhibitors; ATC code: L01X E09.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To identify in tumor samples future biomarkers associated with a short term exposure to
           temsirolimus.

        -  This is an exploratory clinical study. No efficacy objectives are included in this
           clinical trial.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate the tolerability for all temsirolimus-treated patients throughout the study
           and up to 28 days after the last dose of temsirolimus.

        -  To correlate observed changes with the different type of endometrial carcinoma (type I
           and type II), with regard to proteins related to mTOR (p4EBP1, pS6K1, c-MYC, cyclin D,
           p27, BAD, p53, Bcl-2 PTEN, pAKT, mTOR),

        -  To estimate the potential predictive value of some biomarkers (immunostaining for PTEN,
           pAKT, mTOR), relevant mutations in PTEN, PI3KCA, k-RAS, CTNNB1, and microsatellite
           instability status.

        -  To estimate the prognostic value of Ki67 expression after short-term presurgical therapy
           exposure

        -  To collect data about the differences in expression profile, assessed by RNA microarrays
