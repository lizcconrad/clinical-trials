  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seldinger technique is a minimally invasive technique in which the practitioner accesses the
      target vessel with a small bore needle, then dilates to the size required for the catheter.
      Contrarily, modified Seldinger technique(guiding sheath-over-the-needle technique) use needle
      that is covered with guiding sheath.

      Both technique is widely used in central venous catheterization, however, few researches have
      been investigated to compare success rate or complications of both methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major complications of central venous catheterization through subclavian vein, are
      unintended arterial puncture, pneumothorax, hemothorax, malposition of catheter etc,. We
      assume that using modified Seldinger technique (MST), guiding sheath is easily slid over the
      needle, providing stable route into the vessel lumen relatively.

      We aimed to compare the Seldinger technique and modified Seldinger technique(MST) on success
      rate and complications during subclavian central venous catheterization in this prospective,
      randomized , controlled trials.

    <description>Group C means Control group which use Seldinger technique for subclavian catheterization. The aimed vessel(subclavian vein) is punctured with a sharp hollow needle, syringe is detached and guidewire is advanced through the lumen of the needle, and the needle is removed. After that catheter is passed over the guidewire into the vessel.</description>
