    <textblock>
      TriVox Health is an online system designed to make it easy for healthcare providers to
      monitor patients' disease symptoms and functioning over time and in between in-person visits
      (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR1vcbx0Ef4). Using combined quality improvement and
      randomized clinical trial methods, we will evaluate the impact of TriVox on the health
      outcomes, patient/family experience of care, and healthcare utilization for children and
      adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), asthma, autism, depression,
      and epilepsy.

      TriVox Health is a web-based patient management and monitoring system designed to track
      patients' disease symptoms and response to therapy over time. TriVox Health enables clinics
      to use electronic surveys to gather data remotely from multiple responders, including
      patients, parents/guardians, school personnel and ancillary providers, and view the responses
      in a timely manner via graphical, tabular, and narrative summary formats.

      This quality improvement (QI) initiative will implement TriVox as the standard of care for
      all patients who receive care for ADHD, asthma, autism, depression, and epilepsy within seven
      ambulatory specialties at Boston Children's Hospital. Patients and families will use TriVox
      to report on patient health status and will complete clinically-reTriVoxlevant questionnaires
      at routine intervals. Providers will use the information collected through TriVox to inform
      their clinical care of the patient/family.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of TriVox, we will conduct a 24-month phased, cluster
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) where we randomize providers to &quot;active&quot; vs.
      &quot;delayed-start&quot; to TriVox use, with patients clustered by provider (within specialties) for
      analytic purposes. Delayed-start providers will crossover to active TriVox use after 12
      months. Patients/families will complete additional surveys in order to assess the system's
      actual or potential effects on patient/family-provider interactions, healthcare utilization
      and costs.
