  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of krill oil supplementation in patients
      with Type 2 diabetes mellitus on heart health and laboratory diabetic measurements.

      Patients who enroll in this study will be asked to visit the Western Connecticut Health
      Network Biomedical Research Institute on 3 separate occasions: for baseline testing, after 4
      weeks of supplementing with krill oil, and after 4 weeks of supplementing with a placebo.
      Patients will be randomized into one of two groups to determine the order in which they
      receive the supplement and placebo. Every patient will receive both the krill oil and the
      placebo, but both the coordinator and the patient are blinded to which is which. At each
      visit, participants will undergo a non-invasive test which measures the function of the inner
      lining of blood vessels and they will also have blood drawn. Fasting is required before each
      appointment. The blood drawn is used to measure their Hemoglobin A1C, Glucose, HDL, LDL,
      total cholesterol, C-peptide and total antioxidant capacity.

      Risks to taking krill oil supplements are likely to include bad breath, heartburn, fishy
      taste, upset stomach, nausea, loose stools, gas, and bloating. Risks of EndoPAT testing are
      not permanent and may include pain, numbness, tingling, redness, and bruising at the site of
      the blood pressure cuff. Risks that are associated with drawing blood may include redness,
      swelling, pain or discomfort, bruising at the site of the needle stick, or in very rare
      cases, infection at the needle site. To minimize these risks, trained technologists and
      phlebotomists will be used for all procedures.

      This is not a treatment option; while involved in this study all participants will continue
      their regular treatment for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (as well as any other applicable
      conditions).

    <description>Group 2 receives supplement B for four weeks, undergoes a two week washout period, and then receives supplement A for another four weeks. Measurements are taken at baseline, after supplement B completion and after supplement A completion. Participants are informed which supplement was krill oil and which was placebo following completion of this phase of the study. Group 2 participants are given an option to also take an additional 17 weeks of Krill Oil and return for a follow up evaluating the long term use of krill oil.</description>
