  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic imaging method with constant progress and
      improvement in the way the MRI images are obtained. Many of these advances involve changes to
      MRI software and hardware. The goal of this study is to find out the possible benefits of new
      MRI techniques. This will allow us to use the new MRI methods in research and patient care.

    <description>This protocol will provide pilot data to determine the feasibility of development and optimization of new MRI acquisition and analysis method.including sequence development, optimization, and workflow and analysis/visualization tools. An investigator will view the conventional images, as well as the additional research sequences. The radiologist will then complete data forms for each image and quantitative values, as listed in the evaluation form will be recorded. After all images have been read, the radiologist will review the clinical images together with the research images, and determine whether the research sequences had any effect on their diagnostic confidence.</description>

    <description>Add-On Research Patients will include patients who are scheduled for a routine clinical MRI who meet the eligibility requirements for this protocol. Protocol participation will consist of an &quot;add-on&quot; research. MRI scan, which will be performed any point during of the routine clinical MRI scan.
Volunteers will be subjects expressing interest in participation and who meet the eligibility requirements for this protocol. No contrast enhanced research MRIs including gadolinium-based or other contrast agents will be performed in volunteers.</description>

    <description>All participants will complete the MR Screening Questionnaire before the MRI exam. During the MRI exam, all participants will be observed through the window from the operator console. Verbal communication will be kept with the participant throughout the exam via a speaker system.</description>

    <description>MRI Studies: The MRI scans will be performed on a 1.5T or 3T MRI scanner. Conventional MRI studies will be performed using the standard clinical sequences. The new research sequences will be performed.at any point during the clinical exam. Total imaging time for volunteers will be 30-45 minutes.</description>

          -  Female patients/ volunteers who are pregnant or nursing

          -  Patients/ volunteers who are unable to comply or complete the MRI exam due to
             claustrophobia or high levels of anxiety

          -  Patients/ volunteers from the vulnerable population, as defined by 45 CFR 46.

          -  Patients at higher risk due to age, frailty, or the emergent nature of their condition
