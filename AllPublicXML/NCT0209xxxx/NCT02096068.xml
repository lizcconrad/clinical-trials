  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug Dexmedetomidine will be investigated in 72 patients (men and women) undergoing
      elective cardiac or abdominal surgery. The study medication will be administered
      perioperatively by intravenous infusion continuously (at the longest 48 h) to prevent/reduce
      the rate of Delirium and the incidence of postoperative cognitive deficit (POCD).

      A non-surgical control group of 15 ASA II/III- patients from Berlin and surrounding area is
      collected for measuring the learning experience during the cognitive testings. The
      participants are matched on age, education, and gender to the study patients.

      Cognitive testings are performed in patients of the study group (n= 72) and the control group
      (n= 15) to evaluate deficits in their cognitive areas (POCD (Postoperative cognitive
      deficit)) at three different time points up to three months.
