  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to create a registry to help us learn more about germ cell tumors
      (GCT) and other testicular tumors. The registry will include people with these tumors and
      also relatives and unrelated people without these tumors. This study will help us learn more
      about the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of these tumors. Studying relatives of
      patients and people unrelated to patients with GCT and other testicular tumors will help us
      understand why some people get these tumors and why some people don't.

        Control Cohort

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age AND

          -  Must be an English-speaker AND

          -  Must not have a personal history of cancer, with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             cancer, AND

          -  Must not have a family history of germ cell tumor or testicular tumor AND

          -  Must not be a blood relative of controls enrolled in this study
