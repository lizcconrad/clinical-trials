    <description>The frequencies of all adverse drug reactions observed during the observation period will be tabulated by type and seriousness. Adverse events are defined as unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with administration of azilsartan whether or not it was considered related to the treatment. Among these, events which are considered to have a causal relationship with azilsartan are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>
