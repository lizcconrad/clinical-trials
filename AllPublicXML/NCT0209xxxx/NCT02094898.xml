  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study was to find out if the medication known as ketamine could
      help the symptoms of depression. This drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) as an anesthetic agent; however, it is not approved for use in
      depression treatment. The FDA allowed the use of this drug in this research study.

      This was a single-arm, open-label trial conducted in two phases. During the acute-phase, i.v.
      ketamine was administered thrice-weekly for up to 2 weeks.Those who achieved depressive
      symptom remission (Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MÅDRS)) total score less than
      or equal to 9 measured 24h after any acute-phase infusion) received continuation-phase
      treatment that consisted of once-weekly i.v. ketamine infusions for 4 additional weeks.
      Remission could occur after any of the 6 acute-phase infusions, at which point the next
      infusion was the first (of four) continuation-phase infusions. Individuals who remitted
      during acute-phase and completed continuation-phase treatment had 4 additional weekly
      post-continuation follow-up visits.Those who responded to i.v. ketamine (less than or equal
      to 50% reduction from baseline in MÅDRS total score) but did not remit during acute-phase
      were not eligible for continuation-phase treatment. Suicidal ideation was assessed clinically
      throughout the trial, supplemented by scores on the MÅDRS suicide item.

        <title>MADRS Factor 2 Score at Baseline and Last Acute Phase Observation</title>
        <description>The MADRS test includes 10 items and uses a 0 to 6 severity scale for each item, with higher scores indicating increasing depressive symptoms. MADRS Factor 2 (Negative Thoughts) consisted of MADRS items 9 (Pessimistic Thoughts) and 10 (Suicidal Thoughts). The MADRS Factor 2 Score is derived by adding all the scores from the 2 items, meaning the lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible is 12.</description>

        <title>MADRS Factor 4 Score at Baseline and Last Acute Phase Observation</title>
        <description>The MADRS test includes 10 items and uses a 0 to 6 severity scale for each item, with higher scores indicating increasing depressive symptoms. MADRS Factor 4 (Neurovegetative Symptoms) consisted of MADRS items 3-5 (Inner Tension, Reduced Sleep, and Reduced Appetite). The MADRS Factor 4 Score is derived by adding all the scores from the 3 items, meaning the lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible is 18.</description>

          <description>This trial was conducted in 2 phases. During the acute-phase, i.v. ketamine was administered thrice-weekly for up to 2 weeks.Those who achieved depressive symptom remission received continuation-phase treatment that consisted of once-weekly i.v. ketamine infusions for 4 additional weeks. Remission could occur after any of the 6 acute-phase infusions, at which point the next infusion was the first (of four) continuation-phase infusions. Individuals who remitted during acute-phase and completed continuation-phase treatment had 4 additional weekly post-continuation follow-up visits.
