    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the overall subjective preference between two Daily
      Disposable hydrogel lenses when refitted into a third hydrogel lens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a two-day, randomized, non-dispensing, double-masked, contralateral study with two
      parallel groups. Participants were recruited into one of two groups - participants who
      habitually wore etafilcon A lens and participants who habitually wore nelfilcon A lens.
