  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the quantitative information of utilizing
      C-arm systems in liver tumor care in hopes this potential clinical combination of imaging
      could aid in diagnosis and evaluation of tumor therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow imaging for liver tumors is normally carried out using clinical Computed
      Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems prior to going to the cath lab.
      This study aims to determine if measuring flow using a C-arm system and/or CT perfusion can
      be used to improve diagnosis and evaluation of liver tumors.

      The major difference between C-arm CT systems and clinical CT systems is the difference in
      imaging speed. We have developed a new approach that should allow us to overcome this speed
      limitation. The major difference between conventional CT versus CT perfusion is the obtaining
      of an extra series of images. CT perfusion results in an increase in the amount of radiation
      exposure during the CT scan that measures the blood flow of the targeted tumor; however, CT
      perfusion is much faster than conventional CT.

      Prospective participants are being invited to the study because part of the treatment towards
      the tumour therapy involves obtaining an angiogram.
