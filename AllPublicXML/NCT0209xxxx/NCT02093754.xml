      This study is a cross-sectional, multicentre study including 7 centres from 3 European
      countries (Belgium, France, Germany).

      The maximum duration of the study for each patient will be 4 months, consisting of:

        -  a screening visit,

        -  an inclusion visit to perform the biologic tests and exams necessary for the study,
           within 1 month after the screening visit,

        -  a result delivery visit within 1 month after inclusion visit, to disclose results of
           previous investigations. Patients with one or two non invasive markers suggesting
           significant fibrosis (≥F2) will be invited for liver biopsy within the next 2 months.

        -  a &quot;liver biopsy&quot; visit, within 2 months after visit 2, liver biopsy in selected and
           consented patients
