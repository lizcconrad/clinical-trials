  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare different treatment schedules using
      the drug SGI-110 alone or in combination with other drugs. Researchers want to learn more
      about how these different treatment schedules may help to control AML. The safety of these
      treatments will also be studied.

      Study Groups and Drug Administration:

      As of February 2017,if you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be
      randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have an equal
      chance of being assigned to each of the groups. Neither you nor the study staff can choose to
      which group you are assigned:

        -  If you are in Group A, you will receive SGI-110 alone for 5 days.

        -  If you are in Group B, you will receive SGI-110 for 5 days and idarubicin for 2 days.

      SGI-110 will be given 1 time each day through a needle under the skin. Idarubicin will be
      given 1 time each day by vein over up to an hour.

      If you respond to the study drug(s) you can continue on the same schedule every 4 to 8 weeks,
      depending on how you react to the study drug(s). These 4-8 week periods will be called study
      cycles. The first few (up to 3) cycles will be called Induction Cycles. All cycles after this
      will be called Maintenance Cycles. The doses of the drugs, or number of times you receive
      them, may be reduced in the Maintenance Cycles.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle (+/- 7 days), you will have a physical exam.

      Every week, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests until any point that
      the disease appears to have gone away. After that, this blood draw will be every 2-8 weeks.
      The study staff will let you know when you will need these blood draws.

      On Day 15 (+/- 2 days) of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the
      status of the disease.

      On Day 28 (+/-7 days) of Cycle 1, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of
      the disease. After that, you will have a bone marrow aspirate every 2 weeks (+/- 7 days)
      until any point that the disease appears to not be responding. If the routine blood tests
      show that there is still leukemia, you may not need to have the bone marrow samples
      collected. If the disease has not appeared to have gone away after Cycle 2, the timing of
      your next bone marrow aspirate will depend on the results of your blood tests.

      Every 3-4 cycles (or whenever the doctor thinks it is needed), you will have either an ECHO
      or a MUGA to check your heart function.

      You will need to stay in Houston when you are receiving the study drug(s). When you have
      study visits in which you are not receiving study drug(s), these tests can be performed by
      your local doctor.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive the study drug(s) for up to 24 months. You will be taken off study if the
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest, if the disease gets worse, if you experience any
      intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-up Visits:

      After your last dose of study drug, you will have follow-up visits. You will only have these
      visits if the disease has responded to the study drug(s).

        -  Every month, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. These tests can
           be performed by your local doctor.

        -  Every 6 months, you will return to Houston for a physical exam and blood (about 1
           tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      This is an investigational study. Idarubicin is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of several types of cancers affecting the blood, including different types of
      leukemia. SGI-110 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used
      for research purposes only.

      Up to 120 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.
