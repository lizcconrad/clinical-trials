    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the current standard method for evaluating the colorectal diseases. Adequate
      bowel preparation is essential for optimal visualization of the colorectal mucosa. However,
      inadequate bowel preparation (IBP) had been unexpectedly reported in up to 30% of patients
      undergoing colonoscopy. Many factors may influence the quality of bowel preparation, which
      can be broadly categorized as patient-related or procedure-related. It has been shown that
      split-dose regimen or some modified educational strategies can improve the quality of bowel
      preparation. For the patients with possible IBP before the performing of colonoscopy, it may
      be better to repeat bowel preparation with modified or enhanced strategies in case of failed
      intubation, missed lesions or unnecessarily increased cost. Thus, it is important to set up a
      model to predict the quality of bowel preparation individually.

    <description>The same-day preparation method was used as previously reported. Briefly, all patients were instructed to have a regular diet for breakfast and lunch, but only clear liquids for dinner on the day before the colonoscopy. They were asked to drink two bags of PEG-ELP (polyethylene glycol electrolyte powder) dissolved in 2 L of water, or 45 mL of sodium phosphate be diluted in 240 mL of cool water follow with at least 1.5 L of water at 05:00-06:00 h within 2 h on the day of colonoscopy. Patients were encouraged to drink more clear liquids after purgatives for adequate hydration before colonoscopy.</description>

        This is a prospective study involving two tertiary centers in China. The patients of the
        training cohort were enrolled from the Endoscopy Center of Xijing Hospital of Digestive
        Diseases in China. The patients of the validation cohort were enrolled from the Shaanxi
        Second People's Hospital in China.
