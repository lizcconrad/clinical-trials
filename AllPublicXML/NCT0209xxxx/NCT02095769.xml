    <textblock>
      The goal of the POETRY Registry is to determine whether data from Pharmacogenomic (PGx)
      Testing for elderly and disabled patients can help physicians manage patient medication
      regimens and assess if the testing has an effect on reducing adverse drug events,
      hospitalizations, and emergency department visits.

      The way an individual processes or metabolizes a drug is in part determined by their genes,
      and there is known to be genetic variation from one human to another. The study of the way in
      which genes affect an individual's response to drugs is known as &quot;Pharmacogenomics.&quot;

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject underwent PGx testing for the alleles appropriate to the target drugs within
             the prior 90 days ('index PGx test')

          -  Males and females aged ≥65 years or male and females aged ≥18 years who have a
             disability

          -  Subject is able and willing to provide written informed consent

          -  Subject was receiving at least one medication known to be associated with allelic
             variation at the time of the index PGx test, including over-the-counter medications

          -  Subject has a history of at least one target drug-related adverse event (TDAE) over
             the 12-month period preceding receipt of PGx test results, or has experienced
             inadequate efficacy from a target drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is currently hospitalized

          -  Subject's medical and medication history is unavailable over the 90-day period
             preceding the receipt of PGx test results

          -  Subject is unable to provide an accurate history due to mental incapacity

          -  Subject is known to have undergone prior PGx testing for genes specific to the target
             drug(s), exclusive of the PGx test relating to this Registry
