    <textblock>
      Up to ten retired NFL players will receive a comprehensive and monitored weight loss program
      using a protocol that has been established at the TGH+USF Bariatric Center. A low calorie
      diet with meal replacements will be used and over the course of the study the participants
      will be taught to eat low calorie nutritious foods. The sessions will teach proper eating
      habits, stress control, and skills to maintain a healthy weight.

      The length of the study is 6 months. Treatment will last 24 weeks, the participants will
      attend group sessions (60-90 mins.) on a weekly basis for weeks 1-12 and then every other
      week for weeks 14-24, for a total of 18 treatments. Treatment will include meal replacement,
      education on nutrition and proper eating habits as well as behavior modification and skills
      which is known to be effective.

      Participants will be scheduled to come to the Bariatric Center for the first
      assessment/screening and for the consenting process. TGH+USF Bariatric Center has dedicated
      clinical space in their suite with private exam rooms, an education classroom, and private
      testing room.
