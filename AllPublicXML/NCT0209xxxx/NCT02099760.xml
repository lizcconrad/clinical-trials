      The purpose of this study is to validate Xpert CT/NG for the detection of CT and GC in rectal
      samples as part of the PA DOH and CLIA requirements. The evaluation of samples obtained from
      the pharynx is exploratory and will provide new information on the frequency of pharyngeal
      infection due to CT and GC.

      A secondary objective will be to evaluate the prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis in vaginal
      and rectal samples using both the Xpert system and AC2 to assess whether women positive for
      this pathogen rectally usually or always have vaginal infection due to this pathogen.

      The investigators hypothesis is that real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification
      testing with the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG will have greater sensitivity than culture in detecting
      Neisseria gonorrhoeae in rectal samples. The investigators also hypothesize that Xpert CT/NG
      will be equivalent to the Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo2 (AC2) in detecting Chlamydia trachomatis
      and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in rectal samples.

    <textblock>
      Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, NAAT testing has largely replaced bacterial
      culture for the diagnosis of genital CT and GC in both males and females. NAAT assays have
      the greatest potential for detecting CT and GC in the rectum; however, no NAAT is currently
      cleared for use with extragenital specimens by the US Food and Drug Administration.

      In order to comply with CLIA regulations, laboratories must perform in-house validations to
      use NAATs with rectal and pharyngeal specimens. There are multiple studies in the literature
      evaluating NAAT assays in diagnosing CT and GC in rectal and pharyngeal specimens using
      expanded reference standards, which includes positive culture result and secondary
      confirmatory NAAT assays. The proposed validation study is intended to provide data to
      support the use of NAAT for rectal and pharyngeal specimens.
