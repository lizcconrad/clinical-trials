  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the tolerance and utilization of polydextrose and
      soluble corn fiber through analyses of fecal samples of fermentative end-products
      (short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, phenol, and indole) and shifts in microbial populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soluble fibers have been shown to have many positive effects in humans, including laxation
      and maintaining gastrointestinal health. It is expected that feeding soluble fibers will
      decrease protein fermentative end=products while increasing carbohydrate fermenative
      end-products, and lead to a more beneficial microbial profile. Determination of the effects
      of nutriose and polydextrose when included as supplemental fiber in a human diet will give
      insights to its potential to maintain or improve gut health and highlight its use in the food
      industry.

      The object of this study are first to determine the tolerance of soluble fibers polydextrose,
      inulin and nutriose when provided as supplemental fiber to an existing diet. The second
      objective is to determine the utilization of polydextrose and nutriose through analyses of
      fecal samples of fermentative end-products and shifts in microbial populations.

    <measure>Fecal bacteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 16-21 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal samples will be collected on days 16-21 of each treatment period. Participants were provided fecal collection materials (fecal hats, packs, and Ziploc bags). Within 15 minutes of defecation, participants will bring their fecal sample to the designated collection site then be processed by a team. Fecal specimens will be aliquoted into containers for analysis of bacterial species present.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily during each 21 day treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Gastrointestinal tolerance was scored using the following scale: 1=absent, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe. All study participants booklets with daily tolerance questionnaires in them. The participants will complete the questionnaires on their own each day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Stool Characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily during each 21 day treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are provided a journal to complete on their own each day, a questionnaire about their stool characteristics. Participants were score the ease of stool passage using the following scale: 1=very easy, 2=easy, 3=neither easy nor difficult, 4=difficult, 5=very difficult.
Stool consistency was scored using the Bristol stool scale: 1=separate hard lumps, like nuts; 2=sausage-shaped but lumpy; 3=like a sausage cracks on surface; 4=Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; 5=soft blobs with clear-cut edges; 6=fluffy pieces with ragged edges, 7=watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid.</description>

    <description>Participants were provided a journal to record their daily food and beverage intake. Each week the participants met with a study personnel minutes to review the journal and turn it in.</description>
