    <textblock>
      Worldwide, liver related morbidity and mortality continue to rise. It is the 5th commonest
      cause of death in the UK. Liver damage consists of two main components - a) damage to the
      cells of the liver, called hepatocytes, meaning the liver cannot function properly leading to
      jaundice (yellow appearance of the skin and/or eyes) and liver failure and b) scarring of the
      liver, called Cirrhosis, leading to impaired function and inadequate blood flow through the
      liver with potential to develop into cancer. Manifestations of this state include ascites
      (fluid in the tummy) and varices (swollen blood vessels in the food pipe). Liver transplant
      is currently the only curative treatment for end stage chronic liver disease. Unfortunately
      its high demand has not been matched by an equivalent rise in liver donations and even when a
      transplant has occurred there are numerous lifestyle effects such as immunosuppression and
      kidney impairment thus outcome remains poor for many patients. Coffee has been shown to have
      mortality benefit in humans and drinking two to three cups a day was associated with a 40%
      reduced risk of developing cirrhosis, particularly alcohol related; and higher the more cups
      consumed. Previous work has demonstrated coffee reduces the level of fibrosis in the liver by
      interrupting signalling pathways, blocking the effects of special products, called cytokines,
      and reducing accumulation of iron. The investigators' hypothesis is that given the potential
      for caffeine to be used as a treatment in SSAO activity associated diseases it is important
      to see if the activity of SSAO can be blocked in healthy humans too. The Investigators' aim
      to examine the effect of caffeine on circulating VAP-1 levels in large numbers of healthy
      volunteers to assess its potential as an attractive therapeutic target in view of its low
      toxicity and widespread availability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One such enzyme known as VAP-1 (vascular adhesion protein-1) is expressed at high levels in
      liver endothelial cells and studies involving blockage of VAP-1 activity have demonstrated it
      is involved in a reaction where break down products such as hydrogen peroxide and ammonia
      active signalling pathways to assist in the movement of cells from blood vessels to the
      liver. VAP-1 levels become elevated during chronic inflammation in blood vessels of the gut,
      tonsils, skin and synovium albeit most selectively in liver. Recently, circulating VAP-1 has
      been demonstrated to be elevated in certain liver diseases particularly alcoholic liver
      disease. Initial animal studies have shown that activity of the enzyme SSAO
      (Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase) can be effectively blocked by caffeine administration
      and that caffeine also blocks the activity of fat cells, known as adipose cells, thus
      protective against obesity too. SSAO arises from the same family of enzymes as VAP-1 thus
      importantly shares transferable properties. This information led to small, experimental
      studies in human liver that corroborate these findings but did not show how caffeine was
      affecting VAP-1 in the blood.
