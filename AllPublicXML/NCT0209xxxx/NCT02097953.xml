  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how an antibiotic, rifampin, may change the blood
      levels of another antibiotic, daptomycin, in the body. In addition, the effect of
      polymorphisms in P-glycoprotein (a protein involved in the removal of daptomycin from the
      body) on the blood levels of daptomycin will be evaluated. The hypotheses are that rifampin
      will decrease the blood levels of daptomycin and that the effect will be greater for certain
      P-glycoprotein polymorphisms.

      This will be an open-label, sequential pharmacokinetic study in 12 healthy volunteers. After
      providing informed consent, participants meeting inclusion criteria will be administered
      daptomycin 6 mg/kg over 2 minutes and blood and urine samples will be collected over a 24
      hour period after infusion. Following this, participants will be given a 13 day supply of
      rifampin 600 mg/day to be taken at home. After completion of the rifampin course, a second
      pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed (day 15 overall). Participants will be
      administered a dose of rifampin 600 mg then once again be administered daptomycin 6 mg/kg
      over 2 minutes and blood and urine samples will be collected over a second 24 hour period. A
      blood sample will be obtained at the first study visit for determination of each
      participant's P-glycoprotein genotype.
