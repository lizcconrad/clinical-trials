  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is defined as limb pain that occurs at rest, or impending limb
      loss that is caused by severe compromise of blood flow to the affected extremity. CLI is a
      major cause of death and disability (secondary to myocardial infarction, stroke and
      amputation). The mortality in patients with CLI approaches 25% and 50% at one and five years
      respectively. High on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) in patients treated with aspirin
      and clopidogrel (previously referred to as &quot;resistance&quot;) is associated with an increased risk
      of recurrent cardiovascular events after percutaneous coronary interventions and acute
      coronary syndromes. The prevalence and significance of HPR in patients with critical limb
      ischemia treated with aspirin and/or clopidogrel is not known.

      The investigators project aims to investigate the prevalence of HPR (to aspirin and
      clopidogrel) in one hundred patients with diagnosis of critical limb ischemia encountered at
      University of Southern California affiliated hospitals (Los Angeles County Hospital and Keck
      Hospital of USC).

        The patient population will include one-hundred patients with a diagnosis of CLI. We will
        only include in the study CLI patients who as part of their medical treatment are receiving
        dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

             aspirin and/or clopidogrel for at least one week before testing.

          -  CONTROL GROUP: 10 normal volunteers without any known co-morbidities

        Exclusion Criteria:
