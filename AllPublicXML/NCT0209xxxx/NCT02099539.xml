  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose escalation
      study of ALT-803 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) or the Minimum Efficacious Dose (MED) and characterize the immunogenicity and
      pharmacokinetic profile of ALT-803 in treated patients. The effect of ALT-803 on the
      peripheral absolute lymphocyte counts and white blood cell counts, the number and phenotype
      of peripheral blood T (total and subsets) and NK cells will be evaluated. The anti-tumor
      responses of ALT-803 will also be assessed in this trial.
