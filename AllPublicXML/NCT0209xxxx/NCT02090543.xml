    <textblock>
      According to recent guidelines, long-term anticoagulation is recommended for patients with
      atrial fibrillation (AF) and a risk profile with CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 or more. Vitamin K
      antagonists(VAK) and novel oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban are current treatment
      options for AF patients with additional risk factors for stroke. Currently there are only
      limited information to what extend AF patients prefer one or the other treatment option based
      on patient relevant characteristics of novel oral anticoagulants vs. VKAs. It is also unknown
      which of the characteristics influences patient preference most and how this relates to a
      neutral comparator. Furthermore, an additional unknown factor is also how patient evaluate
      their current treatment and if this leads to differences among treatment with VKAs and
      rivaroxaban.
