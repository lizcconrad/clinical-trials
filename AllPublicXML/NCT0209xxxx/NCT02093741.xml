    <textblock>
      This is a Post-Authorization Safety Surveillance (PASS) study designed to collect data on the
      safety and effectiveness of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 mL Sterile water for injection (SWFI)
      during routine clinical practice in children until 12 years of age. This surveillance study
      is a post-licensure commitment for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 mL SWFI.
