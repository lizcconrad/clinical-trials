  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was performed to evaluate the nano-filled resin modified glass ionomer
      (RMGI) -with a brand name of &quot;Ketac Nano&quot;- as a filling material for the treatment of caries
      in primary teeth. Children aged 5-8 years were selected and treated with either Ketac Nano or
      another conventional RMGI called Vitremer. Then, the treated children were evaluated at
      baseline, after one yeat and after two years. The hypothesis to be tested in the present
      study was: The clinical performance of nano-filled RMGI (Ketac Nano) in class I primary
      molars will differ from that of its preceding conventional RMGI (Vitremer).

      First, shear bond strength of each material to primary molars dentin specimens were measured
      (n=10) using a notched-edge crosshead. Independent sample t-test was used for statistical
      analysis. Then, a split mouth designed clinical trial was performed in which nano-filled
      RMGI; Ketac Nano (KN) and conventional RMGI; Vitremer (VR) were used to restore class I
      cavities of primary molars. Each material group (n=30) was evaluated according to the
      modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) regarding marginal discoloration,
      marginal adaptation, color match, anatomic form and recurrent caries, at baseline, after one
      year and after two years. Wilcoxon signed- rank test and Chi-square test were used for
      statistical analysis.

    <description>The filling materials were blindly evaluated by two trained investigators at specific characters or parameters according to the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS). Each parameter has three grades of evaluation; Alfa (A), Bravo (B) and Charlie (C) that represent the degree of deterioration of the filling materials.</description>

    <description>Dental caries was removed from primary molars and was filled with the conventional filling material;Vitremer (n = 30). The right molars was always filled by Vitremer. A split-mouth design was used in the present clinical trial. Twenty nine children were involved in the present study and every one had one bilateral identical pair of carious molars except one child that had two identical pairs. This design was performed to enhance the accuracy of the present study.</description>
