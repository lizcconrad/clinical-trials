  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional bed bathing have been related to cross-infection. In order to avoid this
      complication, single-use products such as wipes impregnated with chlorhexidine use is
      increasing. Nevertheless among nursery staff concern about its side effects prevents its
      widespread use. The investigators want to know if there are any differences between the use
      of 2% chlorhexidine wipes and a placebo concerning side effects.

      Hygiene is part of health recovery in patients, nevertheless in unconscious or sedated
      patients this procedure becomes a task for the nursing staff. Traditional soap and water bed
      bath is becoming obsolete as soap could induce skin injuries due to changes in the pH of the
      skin and furthermore, almost every items used for this procedure could be a reservoir for
      pathogens, and therefore could lead to infection. Nowadays single-use products are a new
      option for prevent cross-infections. Nevertheless, traditional bed bathing is a tightly
      established practice among nursing staff. New evidence about side effects and comfort by wipe
      bed bathing is needed.

      Chlorhexidine impregnated wipes have been used to perform the bed bathing in severe ill
      patients, as it can protect them from infections. The aim of this study is to determinate if
      bed bathing with 2% chlorhexidine impregnated wipes has a similar effect that a placebo.
