  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop and test an emergency department (ED)-based
      intervention which uses text messages to facilitate contraception initiation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that adolescent females at high pregnancy risk who receive text message
      reminders and motivational messages that promote contraception and referral to the Family
      Planning Clinic are more likely to start effective contraception than those who receive
      standard paper-based referral to the Family Planning Clinic alone.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Initiation of highly effective contraception, as defined by the World Health Organization.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after initial enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We will be assessing contraception initiation rates based on electronic medical record review and telephone call follow up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient visits to Family Planning Clinic</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after initial enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We assess Family Planning Clinic visits using our electronic medical records.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Follow up for contraceptive counseling to a doctor or nurse</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after initial enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We will be asking patients during our phone call follow if they have had contraceptive counseling with any healthcare professional. We will also be looking through electronic medical records for documentation of contraceptive counseling such as by ICD-9 coding or a physician's/nurse's note.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pregnancy intentions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after initial enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare pregnancy intentions elicited from the answers provided in the baseline questionnaire to those reported on the telephone follow up for both study arms.</description>

    <measure>Text messaging intervention safety</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after initial enrollment</time_frame>
