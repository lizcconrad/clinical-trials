      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral treatment with glyburide and
      metformin controlling excessive fetal growth in women with gestational diabetes, using
      insulin as a ransom on no response to oral treatment .

      It is randomized with women who seek care at the Outpatient Diabetes in Pregnancy in our
      hospital trial Eligible women between 18 - 45anos diagnosed with gestational diabetes ,
      according to the WHO criteria , ratified the public network for prenatal care at the Clinic
      for Diabetes and Pregnancy HCPA .

      Women with singleton pregnancy and gestational age not exceeding 30 weeks at the time of
      enrollment.

      Pregnant women with indication for pharmacological treatment will be invited to randomization
      to use of oral , glyburide or metformin antidiabetic .

      At regular intervals of 2 - 3 weeks fetal growth will be measured with obstetric
      ultrasonography , until birth.

      The primary outcomes will be :

      ( 1 ) weight and gestational age at birth and the index of large for gestational age fetuses
      ( ≥ 90th percentile for gestational age ) ( 2 ) the use of insulin to achieve glycemic
      targets according to fetal growth , as an indirect measure of the inefficiency of oral
      medications .

      The procedures for monitoring metabolic and obstetrical control , assessments of fetal well
      -being and indications for interruption are usually adopted in the Outpatient Diabetes and
      Pregnancy of the institution.

      - Patients will be followed since their first appointment in our hospital, around the 20th
      week of pregnancy- until 8 weeks after labor and delivery. That being said, patients will be
      followed by an average of 28 weeks.
