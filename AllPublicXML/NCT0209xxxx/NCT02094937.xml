  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to clarify the position of FF and FF/Vilanterol (VI) 100/25
      micrograms (mcg) compared with existing therapies by assessing FF dosage equivalent to low to
      middle-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The study is divided into Run-in period, Period 1
      (open-label treatment), Period 2 (double blind treatment) and Follow-up. Subjects with well
      controlled asthma after completing a run-in period of 4 weeks will be switched from
      middle-dose ICS/long acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) equivalent dose to once-daily FF/VI 100/25
      mcg for an 8 weeks treatment period (Period 1). After this, subjects will be randomized in a
      1:1:1 ratio to receive either FP 250 mcg twice daily, FP 100 mcg twice daily or FF 100 mcg
      once daily in a 12 week double blind treatment period (Period 2). There will be a 1 week
      Follow-up Period following completion of the double-blind treatment period, or early
      withdrawal from the study. Overall , the total duration of subject's participation in the
      study will be for 25 weeks. RELVAR is a registered trademark of the GSK group of companies.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants (Par) Withdrawn From the Study Due to &quot;Poorly-controlled Asthma&quot; During Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 9 to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptom scores (SS) were recorded by par using ratings 0 (no symptoms) to 5-symptoms so severe that par could not perform normal activity [morning] or to 4-symptoms so severe that par could not sleep at all [nightly]. Withdrawal due to poorly-controlled(WPC) (required step-up therapy) asthma was defined as asthma worsening/exacerbation or ≧3 per week of : day symptoms on ≧ 2 days, rescue use on ≧2 days, morning PEF &lt;80 % of best effort on ≧ 1 day, night symptoms on ≧1 or more day, a best pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) &lt; 80% at clinic . Percentage of par WPC asthma at visit 6, 7, 9 and 11 (Week 10, 12, 16 and 20 respectively) were reported. Cox Proportional Hazards Model was used with covariates of Baseline FEV1, gender, age and treatment group. Analysis was descriptive only, no p -values calculated, treatment differences and associated 95% CI were produced.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 'Well-controlled Asthma' at the End of Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptom scores(SS) were recorded by par using ratings 0 (no symptoms) to 5-symptoms so severe that par could not perform normal activity[morning] or to 4-symptoms so severe that par could not sleep at all[nightly]. &quot;Well-controlled asthma&quot; was defined as having no exacerbation/asthma worsening, no night-time symptoms, a best pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second ≥80% at clinic, and ≥2 per week of: daytime symptoms on ≤1 day, rescue use on ≤1 day, or morning peak expiratory flow ≥80% of the best effort value. &quot;Well-controlled asthma&quot; at the end of period 2 was assessed in the week prior to Visit 11 (Week 20). Percentage of participants were calculated as the number of participants with &quot;well-controlled asthma&quot; divided by total number participants excluding withdrawals prior to visit 11 (end of period 2) other than asthma worsening/exacerbation. A Logistic Regression Model was used with covariates of Baseline FEV1, gender, age and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough FEV1 at the End of Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>FEV measures amount of air a person can exhale during a forced breath. The amount of air exhaled in one second of the forced breath is FEV1. Trough FEV1 was measured between 3pm and 11pm excluding Visit 1. Highest value from the three acceptable measurements were recorded. Change from Baseline was calculated as adjusted mean FEV1 value during Period 2 minus Baseline. The Baseline value was the predose value at the randomization (Visit 5: Week 8). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) Model was used with covariates of baseline FEV1, gender, age and treatment group. The adjusted mean from this model is presented [least square mean (LSM)].</description>

    <measure>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Morning (AM) and Evening (PM) PEF Averaged During Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 9 to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Peak expiratory flow is a person's maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter which determines person's ability to breathe out air. PEF was measured each morning and evening prior to study medication or any rescue salbutamol inhalation aerosol use, using an electronic peak flow meter. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as PEF value averaged during Period 2 (Week 9 to Week 20) minus Baseline. Data is presented separately for morning(AM) and evening(PM) assessments. The Baseline value was the mean of the daily values in one week prior to randomization (Visit 5: Week 8) separately for morning and evening. Adjusted mean change from baseline is presented [least square mean (LSM)].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom Free 24 Hour Periods During Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 9 to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who were symptom free for 24-hours were assessed with the help of a daily Dairy. It included the details on daily asthma symptom scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5-symptoms so severe that participant could not perform normal activity [morning] or to 4-symptoms so severe that participants could not sleep at all [nightly]. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as percentage of symptom free 24 hours during Period 2 (Week 9 to Week 20) minus Baseline. The Baseline value was the mean of the daily values in one week prior to randomization (Visit 5: Week 8). Adjusted mean change from baseline is presented [least square mean (LSM)].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue Free 24 Hour (hr) Periods During Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 9 to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The time during which the participants did not have to take any rescue medication (medication intended to relieve symptoms immediately) was considered as a rescue free period. Participants who did not require inhalation of salbutamol (rescue medication) for 24-hours were captured with the help of a daily dairy, all participants were required to record use of rescue medication daily for day and night time separately on e-diary. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as percentage of rescue free 24 hour period during Period 2 (Week 9 to Week 20) minus Baseline value. The Baseline value was the mean of the daily values in one week prior to randomization (Visit 5: Week 8). Adjusted mean change from baseline is presented [least square mean (LSM)].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score at the End of Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The total ACT score is the sum of the scores attributed to the five questions, ranging from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control. An ACT score &gt;=20 indicates well-controlled asthma. The questions were designed to be self-completed by the participant. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as ACT score at the end of Period 2 (Week 20) minus Baseline value. The Baseline value was the predose value at randomization (Visit 5: Week 8). Adjusted mean change from baseline is presented [least square mean(LSM)].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With ACT Score &gt;= 20 at Visit 11 (Week 20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma control test is a five item questionnaire with each response rating from 1 to 5 (1 is severe and 5 is no event) of asthma events over previous 4-weeks. The questions were designed to be self-completed by the participant. The percentage of participants with ACT score &gt;=20 at the end of the Period 2 were analyzed using a logistic regression model including covariates for baseline ACT score, gender, age and treatment group.</description>

             commit to complete abstinence from intercourse throughout the clinical trial and for a
             period after the trial to account for elimination of the drug (minimum of six days);
             Female subjects should not be enrolled if they are pregnant, lactating or plan to
             become pregnant during the time of study participation. A serum pregnancy test is
             required for females of childbearing potential at the initial screening visit (Visit
             1) and Visit 11 or Early Withdrawal. In addition a urine pregnancy test will be
             performed on all females of childbearing potential at Visit 2, Visit 5 and Visit 12.

          -  Severity of Disease: A best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=80% of the predicted normal
             value at the screening visit (Visit 1). Predicted values will be based upon National

          -  Short-Acting Beta2-Agonists (SABA): All subjects must be able to use salbutamol
             aerosol inhaler which will be provided as a rescue medication at Visit 1 during the
             study as needed. Subjects must be able to avoid using salbutamol for at least 6 hours
             prior to study visits.

          -  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG): Evidence of significant normality in the 12-lead ECG
             performed at Visit 1, as judged by the investigator Selected specific ECG findings
             that are not considered to be significant and will not exclude the subject from study
             participation include, but are not limited to, the following: T interval corrected for
             heart rate (QTc) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for patients with bundle
             branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to
             Fridericia's formula (QTcF), machine overread. The QTc should be based on single or
             averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief
             recording period. If there are any clinically significant abnormalities including but
             not limited to a T interval for heart rate (QT) prolonged, confirm with two additional
             ECGs taken.

          -  Tobacco Use: Current smoker or a smoking history of 10 pack years (e.g., 20
             cigarettes/day for 10 years). A subject may not have used inhaled tobacco products
             within the past 3 months (i.e., cigarettes, cigars or pipe tobacco).

          -  Affiliation with Investigator's Site: A subject will not be eligible for this study if
             he/she is an immediate family member of the participating Investigator,
             sub-Investigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating Investigator.

        Other exclusion criteria at Visit 2 and Visit 5:

          -  Evidence of clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests during Visit 1which are
             still abnormal upon repeat analysis and are not believed to be due to disease(s)
             present. Each Investigator will use his/her own discretion in determining the clinical
             significance of the abnormality.

          -  Changes in asthma medication (excluding salbutamol inhalation aerosol provided at
             Visit 1).

          -  Occurrence of a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the
             upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear during the run-in and the
             open-label treatment period that led to a change in asthma management or, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the
             subject's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Any asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids or injection or that
             resulted in overnight hospitalization requiring additional treatment for asthma.
             Clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at Visit 2 and Visit 5.

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test for all females of childbearing potential at Visit 2 and
             Visit 5

          -  Subjects that the investigator decides that it is impossible for subject to do &quot;switch
             (Visit 2)&quot; and &quot;step-down (Visit 5)&quot;.

        <description>Asthma symptom scores (SS) were recorded by par using ratings 0 (no symptoms) to 5-symptoms so severe that par could not perform normal activity [morning] or to 4-symptoms so severe that par could not sleep at all [nightly]. Withdrawal due to poorly-controlled(WPC) (required step-up therapy) asthma was defined as asthma worsening/exacerbation or ≧3 per week of : day symptoms on ≧ 2 days, rescue use on ≧2 days, morning PEF &lt;80 % of best effort on ≧ 1 day, night symptoms on ≧1 or more day, a best pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) &lt; 80% at clinic . Percentage of par WPC asthma at visit 6, 7, 9 and 11 (Week 10, 12, 16 and 20 respectively) were reported. Cox Proportional Hazards Model was used with covariates of Baseline FEV1, gender, age and treatment group. Analysis was descriptive only, no p -values calculated, treatment differences and associated 95% CI were produced.</description>

        <description>Asthma symptom scores(SS) were recorded by par using ratings 0 (no symptoms) to 5-symptoms so severe that par could not perform normal activity[morning] or to 4-symptoms so severe that par could not sleep at all[nightly]. “Well-controlled asthma” was defined as having no exacerbation/asthma worsening, no night-time symptoms, a best pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second ≥80% at clinic, and ≥2 per week of: daytime symptoms on ≤1 day, rescue use on ≤1 day, or morning peak expiratory flow ≥80% of the best effort value. “Well-controlled asthma” at the end of period 2 was assessed in the week prior to Visit 11 (Week 20). Percentage of participants were calculated as the number of participants with “well-controlled asthma” divided by total number participants excluding withdrawals prior to visit 11 (end of period 2) other than asthma worsening/exacerbation. A Logistic Regression Model was used with covariates of Baseline FEV1, gender, age and treatment group.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With 'Well-controlled Asthma' at the End of Period 2</title>
          <description>Asthma symptom scores(SS) were recorded by par using ratings 0 (no symptoms) to 5-symptoms so severe that par could not perform normal activity[morning] or to 4-symptoms so severe that par could not sleep at all[nightly]. “Well-controlled asthma” was defined as having no exacerbation/asthma worsening, no night-time symptoms, a best pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second ≥80% at clinic, and ≥2 per week of: daytime symptoms on ≤1 day, rescue use on ≤1 day, or morning peak expiratory flow ≥80% of the best effort value. “Well-controlled asthma” at the end of period 2 was assessed in the week prior to Visit 11 (Week 20). Percentage of participants were calculated as the number of participants with “well-controlled asthma” divided by total number participants excluding withdrawals prior to visit 11 (end of period 2) other than asthma worsening/exacerbation. A Logistic Regression Model was used with covariates of Baseline FEV1, gender, age and treatment group.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough FEV1 at the End of Period 2</title>
        <description>FEV measures amount of air a person can exhale during a forced breath. The amount of air exhaled in one second of the forced breath is FEV1. Trough FEV1 was measured between 3pm and 11pm excluding Visit 1. Highest value from the three acceptable measurements were recorded. Change from Baseline was calculated as adjusted mean FEV1 value during Period 2 minus Baseline. The Baseline value was the predose value at the randomization (Visit 5: Week 8). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) Model was used with covariates of baseline FEV1, gender, age and treatment group. The adjusted mean from this model is presented [least square mean (LSM)].</description>

The Baseline value was the mean of the daily values in one week prior to randomization (Visit 5: Week 8). Adjusted mean change from baseline is presented [least square mean (LSM)].</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score at the End of Period 2</title>
        <description>The total ACT score is the sum of the scores attributed to the five questions, ranging from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control. An ACT score &gt;=20 indicates well-controlled asthma. The questions were designed to be self-completed by the participant. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as ACT score at the end of Period 2 (Week 20) minus Baseline value. The Baseline value was the predose value at randomization (Visit 5: Week 8). Adjusted mean change from baseline is presented [least square mean(LSM)].</description>
