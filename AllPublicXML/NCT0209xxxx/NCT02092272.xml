    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups using a random number generator.
      Group 1 will be provided with in-office instruction of standard of care eccentric exercises
      for rotator cuff tendinopathy. Group 2 will be provided with in-office instruction as well as
      a instructional exercise video source (DVD) to take home as a reminder on how to perform two
      specific standard of care eccentric exercises for rotator cuff tendinopathy. Each group will
      be given a card to track adherence to the standard of care eccentric exercise routine as
      measured only by the days that they accomplish their exercises. Study exercise diary will be
      collected after 12 weeks of treatment. Eccentric exercises are taught as part of standard of
      care for rotator cuff tendinopathy.

      DoD beneficiaries age 18 or older will be recruited from the clinics at the Mike O'Callaghan
      Federal Medical Center (MOFMC). Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      offered an opportunity to participate:

      Screening Visit:

        -  Obtain signed Informed Consent Document and HIPAA Authorization.

        -  Verify inclusion/exclusion criteria

      Visit 1 (may occur same day as Screening Visit):

        -  Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups by the Research Coordinator
           using a random number generator, thus the Investigators will be blinded to the group
           assignments:

             -  Group 1: in-office instruction of the standard of care eccentric exercise regimen
                for rotator cuff tendinopathy.

             -  Group 2: in-office instruction of the standard of care eccentric exercise regimen
                for rotator cuff tendinopathy and an instructional exercise video source (DVD).

        -  Subjects will be given a study exercise diary to track adherence to the standard of care
           eccentric exercise routine.

      Visit 2 (12 weeks post Visit 1):

      â€¢ Study exercise diary will be collected to assess adherence. If the subject is unable to
      come in, they can return the study exercise diary via mail, or electronic mail.
