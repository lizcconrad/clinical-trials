      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take LCL161 by mouth on
      Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, +/- 3 days. You will fast for 2 hours before and 2 hours
      after taking LCL161. This means you will have no food during this time. You will be able to
      have about 8 ounces of fluids such as water, milk, or non-citrus juices.

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      If you vomit a dose of LCL161, do not make up the dose.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will take your first dose of study drug at the clinic. You will stay
      at the clinic for 4 hours after your first dose of study drug.

      After your first dose, you will take the study drug at home. You should bring any unused
      study drug with you to each study visit. It is very important that you take the study drug
      just as the doctor tells you to. Do not miss any tablets.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk
      of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given
      and their risks.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam, if you have not had a screening physical
      exam within 3 days of Day 1 of Cycle 1.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10, and then every 6 cycles (Cycle 16, 22 etc.) thereafter
      while participating in the study:

        -  You will have a physical exam

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete the symptom questionnaires.

      If your doctor agrees, you may have your blood drawn at your local doctor's office or
      laboratory. You will not have to fill out the questionnaires at your local doctor's office.
      The study staff will also call you every 4-6 weeks. You will be asked how you are feeling and
      about any side effects you may be having. This phone call and/or email should take about
      10-15 minutes. You will return to MD Anderson at the start of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10,
      and every 6 months thereafter while participating in the study.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 4 and then every 6 cycles (Cycles 10, 16, and so on), you will have a bone
      marrow biopsy and/or aspirate to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may be asked to return to the clinic more often.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up call.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 7 days after you are finished taking the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will complete the symptom questionnaires.

      Follow-up Call:

      About 30 days after the end-of-treatment visit, the study staff will call you to ask how you
      are feeling and about any side effects you may be having. This phone call and/or email should
      take about 10-15 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. LCL161 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study
      drug is designed to work.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

          2. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of
             the following: History or presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia; Presence of
             unstable atrial fibrillation (ventricular response &gt; 100 bpm). Patients with stable

          7. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 90 days after study treatment. Highly effective contraception
             methods include: Total abstinence or Male partner or female sterilization or
             Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c): a. Use of oral, injected

          8. Continued from #7 above: Note: Postmenopausal women are allowed to participate in this
             study. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
             have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
             profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six
             weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, a woman is considered to be of not child
             bearing potential only when her reproductive status has been confirmed by follow-up
             hormone level assessment.

          9. Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and
             for 3 months after stopping study drug and should not father a child in this period. A
             condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of
             the drug via seminal fluid.
