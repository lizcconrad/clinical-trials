  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      diagnosed degenerative disc disease.

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study of ASC implantation performed
      intra-discally. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction
      using local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue
      specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells.

      The adipose tissue specimen will be collected from the patient's abdomen using a liposuction
      cannula. In addition, a sample of peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of
      platelet rich plasma. The adipose tissue is processed for separation of the adipose
      tissue-derived stem cells, which are then resuspended in platelet rich plasma and transferred
      for intra-discal administration. The number of cells injected will vary depending on the
      amount of tissue processed and the number of cells obtained from the process. Following the
      injections follow-up data will be collected 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment.

      Total study time frame is anticipated to be approximately 6 months. This study will enroll
      approximately 100 patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Degenerative disease of one, two, or three lumbar discs with predominant back pain
             after conservative treatment (physical and medical) for over 6 months.

          -  Fibrous ring capable of holding the cell implantation, demonstrated by RMI image

          -  Absence of spinal infection.

          -  Haematological and biochemical analysis with no significant alterations that
             contraindicates intervention.

          -  The patient is able to understand the nature of the study.

          -  Informed written consent of the patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Congenital or acquired diseases leading to spine deformations that may upset cell
             application.

          -  Spinal segmental instability, spinal canal stenosis, isthmus pathology and other
             conditions that may compromise the study

          -  Modic III changes on MRI images (31).

          -  More than 50% loss of height

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing or females of childbearing potential who are

             HCV, CMV (IgM &gt; IgG) and/or syphilis will have an expert consultation as to patient
             eligibility based on the patient's infectious status

          -  Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy

             study conduct or interpretation of the results or who in the opinion of the
             investigator are not suitable to participate.

          -  History of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or in-situ cervical cancer) in
             the last five years.
