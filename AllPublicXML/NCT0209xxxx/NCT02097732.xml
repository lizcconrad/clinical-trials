  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to test the efficacy of using standard immune therapy for melanoma prior to
      stereotactic radiosurgery (ipilimumab induction), as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery
      followed by immune therapy. The study's hypothesis is that ipilimumab induction is as good as
      or better than controlling brain metastases as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery followed
      by immune therapy.

      This is a randomized Phase II selection study investigating the use of ipilimumab induction
      prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), versus no induction, for melanoma brain metastases.
      Participants will be randomized to Arm A &quot;Induction&quot; (two doses of ipilimumab prior to SRS,
      two doses of ipilimumab after SRS) versus Arm B &quot;No induction&quot; (SRS first, followed by 4
      doses of ipilimumab). Participants will undergo multiple dynamic contrast-enhanced MRIs of
      the brain and submit blood samples for immune testing.

             (Prior craniotomy and surgical resection is allowed, as long as there is at least one
             remaining measurable lesion in the brain)
