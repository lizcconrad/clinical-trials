  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of auricular autonomous nervous
      system stimulation on vital parameters of wound healing in diabetics. It is investigated if
      auricular vagal nerve stimulation has an effect on heart rate variability as well as
      peripheral local blood perfusion, and if this effect depends on the health status of the
      study participants (diseased/healthy).

    <description>Study participants (healthy and diabetics) are treated with auricular vagal nerve stimulation using four needle electrodes connected to an electrical stimulation device (PrimeStim). After an acclimatization phase the stimulation is turned on for 20 minutes followed by 20 minutes of paused stimulation, 20 minutes of stimulation, and another 10 minutes paused stimulation. This intervention is repeated on four consecutive days. Needle electrodes stay fixed over the whole study period.
Two different stimulation schemes are tested, each being assessed twice in random order. Stimulation amplitudes are adjusted with respect to a distinct but comfortable sensation at the auricle.
During the described protocol various biosignals are continuously recorded, including ECG, respiration, blood perfusion, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous oxygen tension, blood pressure and skin temperature.</description>
