  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US. Statistics show that
      approximately 91% of individuals with CVD have vascular dysfunction. Hypertension is a major
      modifiable risk factor for CVD and approximately 60% of adults in the US are pre-hypertensive
      and hypertensive. In addition, the prevalence of hypertension is associated with aging in
      both genders; however, the increase in blood pressure (BP) in women after menopause exceeds
      that of men.

      The development of effective and safe strategies to improve vascular function is of
      significance as it can have a great impact on quality of life, productivity and economic
      burden for the affected populations. One such alternative would be to introduce into the diet
      food sources that are rich in naturally occurring bioactive compounds. Thus, the long-term
      goal of the investigators is to provide feasible and effective dietary ways for
      postmenopausal women to improve their vascular function and quality of life.

      Strawberries are a rich source of bioactive compounds and its total antioxidant content ranks
      third among all fruits and vegetables. Hence, the purpose of this study is to bring forth
      evidence that incorporation of strawberries into the diet will reduce blood pressure and
      improve cardiovascular function in pre- and stage 1-hypertensive postmenopausal women.

      Sixty eligible postmenopausal women between the ages of 45 and 65 and a seated BP of ≥ 130/85
      mm Hg but ≤ 160/100 mmHg at the screening visit will be randomly assigned to one of three
      groups:

        1. 25 g freeze-dried strawberry powder;

        2. 50 g freeze-dried strawberry powder; or

        3. placebo powder. Participants will be asked to consume the supplements for 8-weeks.
           Medical history, medication use, dietary intake, and physical activity will be assessed
           at 0-, 4-, and 8-weeks followed by blood draw. Serum levels of markers of cardiovascular
           function as well as oxidative stress and inflammation will be measured.

      The investigators hypothesize that regular consumption of strawberry will improve
      cardiovascular function, decrease BP and blood markers of oxidative stress as well as
      inflammation. Investigators also expect the findings of this study to provide a foundation
      for further studies to examine the effects of long-term incorporation of strawberry into the
      diet and the integrity of cardiovascular system.
