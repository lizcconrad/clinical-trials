  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will test the equivalence of a repeat bolus protocol of magnesium sulfate
      administered by the Springfusor® controlled pump to a continuous intravenous regimen. The
      goal of this pharmacokinetic study is to assess the pharmacological equivalence of the serum
      magnesium sulfate concentrations obtained in the treatment of severe preeclampsia with the
      continuous intravenous and Springfusor repeat bolus regimens. The study will also document
      the clinical outcomes, efficacy and acceptability of each treatment for patients and staff.

    <description>Blood draw times will be structured so as to perform a robust population PK analysis. Time zero is the end of the bolus administration. In the Springfusor arm, samples will be collected at the following times: 00:00, 00:20; 00:40; 1:20; 2:00; 2:20; 3:00; 4:40; 5:20; 6:00; 6:20; 7:00; 8:00; 9:40; 10:00; 10:40; 12:00. In the IV arm, samples will be collected at the following times: 0:00; 00:20; 00:40;1:00; 1:20; 1:40; 2:20; 3:00; 3:40; 4:20; 5:20; 6:40; 8:00; 9:20; 10:40 and 12:00.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Exhibit systolic blood pressure &gt; 160mm Hg OR a diastolic pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg (at two
        times over 30 minutes) (A single higher pressure could be accepted if the clinical team
        felt that magnesium sulfate therapy should be initiated without waiting 30 minutes).

        Exhibit proteinuria &gt; 1+; Have not given birth, or be &lt;24h postpartum Be assessed by
        enrolling physician to benefit from magnesium sulfate therapy Agree to comply with study
        procedures Be &gt; 18 years of age Give informed consent for study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Eclamptic or seizing at the time of enrollment Received magnesium sulfate therapy 24h prior
        to study enrollment Known serum creatinine &gt;1.2 mg/dL. (Subject may be enrolled prior to
        knowledge of serum creatinine but would be withdrawn if &gt;1.2 mg/dL in order to have a
        proper dose adjustment.
