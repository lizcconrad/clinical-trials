    <textblock>
      The TriCinch System™ is intended for percutaneous treatment of tricuspid regurgitation.

      It is a percutaneous catheter-based device designed for tricuspid valve repair in order to
      decrease effective cross-sectional area and relieve symptoms in patients with tricuspid valve
      regurgitation.

      Implantation Procedure: Unlike the standard open chest, arrested heart approach, the 4TECH
      TriCinch System™ provides a percutaneous solution for tricuspid valve regurgitation
      treatment: this procedure is performed through deep sedation, while the heart is beating,
      without the need for respiratory assistance.

      The TriCinch System™ consists of a Delivery System that enables transcatheter placement of an
      implant that can be adjusted to correct Tricuspid valve regurgitation. The TriCinch Delivery
      System is inserted from the femoral vein to access the right atrium of the heart. At the end
      of the correction process, the TriCinch Delivery System and the venous introducer are removed
      and the procedure is concluded.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Functional symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) 2+ to 4+ on a scale of 4+
             (moderate to severe), with annular dilatation greater than 40mm.

          -  Signed informed consent form prior to any study-related procedure.

          -  Available and able to return to the study site for post-procedural follow-up

          -  Eighteen (18) years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             correction surgery, closure of PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale) or ASD (Atrial Septal
             Defect), or PTCA (percutaneous treatment of coronary artery) or CAD (coronary artery
             bypass surgery) from 1 to 3 months after or before other procedure.

          -  Severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg, measurement done by
             sphygmomanometer with stethoscope, allow the patient to sit for at least 5 minutes
             before beginning BP measurements).

          -  Female patient is pregnant (urine HCG test result positive) or lactating.
