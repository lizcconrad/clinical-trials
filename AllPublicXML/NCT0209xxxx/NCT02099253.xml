  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine(DEX) is a novel , highly selective α2 adrenergic receptor agonists , and its
      selectivity for α2 receptor is 1600 times higher than α1.It also could provide dose-dependent
      sedation , analgesia , anti-anxiety and inhibition of sympathetic nerves and other effects
      .At earlier time It was approved by the FDA only for short-time sedation during mechanical
      ventilation of adult patients (&lt;24h) in ICU. Because of its minimal impact on the respiratory
      , currently it was more and more widely used to sedate patients undergoing regional
      anesthesia.Many anesthetic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are often affected by age
      and gender,such as the drug sensitivity of propofol and remifentanil is increased with
      age,while the current study also demonstrated that gender may influence the sedate efficacy
      of propofol and the sensitivity of muscle loose of rocuronium. Current studies with regard to
      the effects of age and gender on dexmedetomidine pharmacodynamic are rare. The study is aim
      to explore the right DEX dose of different Age of patients to produce suitable
      sedation.Dexmedetomidine be used in patients with combined spinal and epidural anesthesia for
      sedation,which is monitored by the BIS,during the operation.The relation between BIS values
      and the depth of sedation for patients is also investigated.

      120 patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity surgery were included in one of three
      groups. Determination of median effective (ED50) doses was performed by the Dixon and Mood
      up-and-down method. Initial doses was 1μg/kg, with dose adjustment intervals of 0.05μg/kg, in
      the youth,and middle-aged group. The initial doses of DEX was 0.7 μg/kg,also with dose
      adjustment intervals of 0.05μg/kg.Sedative efficacy was defined as an OAA/S of ≤2, or an
      OAA/S of 3 but with an BIS value of ≤46, 26 min after the beginning of drug administration.
