  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most important considerations for the general anesthesia in diagnostic panendoscopy of
      the upper airway is the maintenance of a patient's airway for optimal surgical exposure,
      adequate ventilation and sufficient depth of anesthesia. Tubeless anesthestic techniques with
      preserved spontaneous ventilation and total intravenous administration of anesthetic drugs
      are widely use. Due to its pharmacological profile, propofol anesthesia is often considered
      as the gold standard for the anesthesia in the diagnostic panendoscopy. Previous studies
      suggested that adding remifentanil to propofol could improve the conditions for laryngoscopy
      and tracheal intubation.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of propofol remifentanil general anesthesia
      compared to propofol general anesthesia on the conditions of the diagnostic panendoscopy of
      the upper airway.

    <description>The assessment of the conditions for the diagnotic panendoscopy of the upper airway will be based on: (1) the conditions for the laryngoscopy (&quot;excellent&quot;=easy; &quot;good&quot;=fair; &quot;poor&quot;=difficult), (2) the position of the vocal cords (&quot;excellent&quot;=abducted; &quot;good&quot;=intermediate; &quot;poor&quot;=closed), (3) the movements of the vocal cords (&quot;excellent&quot;=none; &quot;good&quot;=moving; &quot;poor&quot;=closing), (4) the movement of the limbs (&quot;excellent&quot;=none; &quot;good&quot;=sight; &quot;poor&quot;=vigorous), (5) the cough (&quot;excellent&quot;=none; &quot;good&quot;=diaphragm; &quot;poor&quot;=sustained (&gt;10 s)). The conditions for the diagnostic panendoscopy will be considered as &quot;excellent&quot; when all variables will be excellent, as &quot;good&quot; when all variables will be either good or excellent and as &quot;poor&quot; when one or more variables will be graded as poor. Clinically acceptable conditions are defined as either good or excellent conditions.</description>
