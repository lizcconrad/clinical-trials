  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed anaemia has been reported in European travellers with malaria cured by artesunate.
      Although no deaths related to this delayed anaemia have been reported so far, blood
      transfusion has been necessary in some affected patients. Recent observations suggest that
      this episodes of anaemia also occurs in endemic countries. The aim of this trial is to assess
      the incidence of late onset anaemia after treatment with intravenous artesunate compared to
      intravenous quinine, to identify patients at risk and to clarify the causes of this delayed
      anaemia.

          -  Parents/guardians agree to hospitalize the child for the length of treatment (3 days)
             and bring the patient for planned follow-up visits at day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42
