      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of a single low-dose Primaquine
      added to standard artemether/lumefantrine treatment for the clearance of Plasmodium
      falciparum gametocytes among patients with uncomplicated malaria aged 1 year and above
      regardless of their G6PD status.

    <textblock>
      The current gained successes in malaria control are accredited partly to the availability of
      efficacious and fast acting artemisinins which are also potent against P. falciparum young
      gametocytes. Nonetheless, mature gametocytes may persist after treatment, contributing to
      malaria transmission. Conversely, artemisinin resistance is confirmed in South-east Asia, and
      it may spread to Africa. New control tools have to be integrated to sustain the gained
      successes, further reduce transmission and curb the spread of resistance.

      Primaquine has strong gametocytocidal effect against mature gametocytes and when added to
      schizonticidal drugs such as artemether-lumefantrine (AL), it rapidly shorten gametocytes
      carriage duration, halting disease transmission. Nonetheless, its wide scale use has been
      hampered by a dose-dependent acute hemolytic anemia it causes in glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient individuals. Conversely, Artemisinins potentiate primaquine
      activities, thus a low dose of primaquine would be able to clear falciparum gametocytes.

      The World Health Organization recommends addition of 0.25 mg/kg single-dose primaquine to
      Artemisinin based combination therapies in malaria endemic areas including Africa without
      testing for G6PD status. Nonetheless, the recommendation, relies on historical data from
      South-East Asia and among African Americans in the United States. Therefore, this study plans
      to assess safety and efficacy of 0.25 mg/kg single-dose primaquine added to a standard AL
      treatment against P. falciparum gametocytes clearance among patients with uncomplicated
      malaria aged 1 year and above regardless of their G6PD status..
