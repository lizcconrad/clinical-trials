      To assess the ability of a new 4% Hydroquinone formulation (Melanoderm 4% Crema) to reduce
      melasma on the face, using a split-face randomization design, evaluating the MASI Score from
      baseline to week 4 and week 8, in both half-faces receiving active treatment vs. placebo.

      To assess the tolerance of a new 4% Hydroquinone formulation (Melanoderm 4% Crema) on the
      face.

      To assess patients' satisfaction regarding Melanoderm 4% Crema after 8 weeks.
