    <textblock>
      Treatment of primary hyperhidrosis through a comparative study between oxybutynin
      hydrochloride and placebo.

      Hydrochloride may decrease the symptoms of hyperhidrosis improving the subject's quality of
      life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical Trial phase III, randomized, national, prospective, double-blind, multicenter,
      comparative between oxybutynin hydrochloride and placebo, to be held in participants aged
      over 18 years to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of oxybutynin chloride to
      systemic treatment of primary hyperhidrosis.

      Primary hyperhidrosis is a relatively common disorder, affecting approximately 3% of the
      population. It affects both sexes similarly and in all age groups, varying only the starting
      age of symptoms according to the most affected part of the body:

      childhood - plantar and palmar hyperhidrosis adolescence - axillary hyperhidrosis adult -
      craniofacial hyperhidrosis

      There is a family history associated with between 12.5% and 56.5% of the participants,
      according to epidemiological studies.

      Initially the subjects will be evaluated on the inclusion and exclusion criteria through
      screening and safety tests such as blood tests , ECG and tonometry, to confirm enrollment.

      When included will be randomized into the corresponding study arm to start study treatment.

      During the period of the study it will evaluate the efficacy parameters of the drug.

      The treatment for each subject will be about 8 weeks. The inclusion period is foreseen for 6
      months and may be extended or decreased according to the pace of inclusion.

      The data are summarized according to the study group (per dose and per visit, if applicable)
      through appropriate descriptive statistics to the variable type. Frequency and percentage
      will be used for the variables.

      The Adverse Events (AE) will be analyzed based on questioning by the investigators in
      relation to the AE experienced by the subjects. The orientation will be to the subject to
      note the symptom, the date and time that the event appeared.
