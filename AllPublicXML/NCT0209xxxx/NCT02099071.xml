  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending
      single oral dose and food interaction Phase 1 study. It will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending single oral doses of
      ACT-389949 in healthy male subjects. It will also investigate the effect of food on the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of ACT-389949.
