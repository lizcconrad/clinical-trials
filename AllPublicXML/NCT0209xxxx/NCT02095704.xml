      Drug dissolution in vivo play a crucial role for the bioavailability and therapeutic of an
      orally administered solid dosage form. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of a standard paracetamol tablet in comparison with oral solution in Chinese
      healthy volunteers. Based on the Noyes-Whitney equation and pharmacokinetics parameters,
      investigators trend to propose a method to estimate in vivo dissolution time and dissolution
      kinetics of solid dosage form.
