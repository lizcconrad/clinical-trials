  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma who are CD30+ will receive a standard
      of care reduced intensity regimen and an allogeneic stem cell transplant (from another
      person, related or unrelated). Following recovery, patients will receive a medication called
      Brentuximab Vendotin which is targeted against CD30+ cells. The study hypothesis is that this
      treatment will be safe and well tolerated in children and young adults.

    <description>A bank of from identified EBV positive donors will be established for potential use in current and future clinical trials in LMP-positive lymphomas. Annual review will occur to assess the feasibility of recruiting healthy donors to help build this cell line bank. If there are no cell lines developed within the first year, an alternative design may be considered.</description>
