  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical radicular pain is a common, disabling problem, occurs in 83:100,000 individuals per
      year. Symptoms are most often caused by intervertebral disc herniation (21.9%) or central or
      foraminal stenosis from spondylosis (68.4%). Patients complain of pain in the head, neck,
      scapula or arm. The diagnosis of radicular pain is made clinically by history and physical
      examination, supported by imaging studies and electrodiagnostic tests. No study has compared
      the differences in pain, medication utilization, functional outcomes, or patient satisfaction
      between interlaminar and targeted epidural injections in the cervical spine. In theory, the
      technique of targeted epidural steroid delivery with a catheter has a lower risk of
      accidental vascular trespass or disc penetration during the procedure, and far less risk of
      dural penetration or spinal cord injury at rostral levels of the cervical spinal cord as
      compared with the interlaminar technique. The investigators hypothesize that this technique
      results in superior pain control, decreased medication use, improved function and fewer
      repeat injections. This data could improve patient safety and affect the evolving treatment
      guidelines for cervical epidural injections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical radicular pain is a common, painful, disabling problem, often treated by epidural
      steroid injection (ESI). Two techniques of steroid delivery into the cervical epidural space
      include the transforaminal and interlaminar approaches. We aimed to determine if the CIESI
      with versus without a catheter is associated with superior clinical outcomes at follow-up. We
      hypothesized that the use of a targeted epidural catheter technique would result in superior
      pain control, function, decreased analgesic use, and lower surgical incidence as compared to
      standard CIESI at C7-T1.

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who reported ≥50% pain reduction on the numeric rating score for pain at the 1 month follow-up assessment period.
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain consists of a range where 0 (is no pain) and 10 (is extreme pain).
Percentage of participants with pain reduction = 100% (number of participants with pain reduction/all participants)</description>

    <measure>Decrease of &gt; 6.8 Point Reduction in Medication Quntification Scale (MQS-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Medication Quantification Scale was designed as a method of quantifying different drug regimens (Harden et al, Journal of Pain, 2005). The detriment weights derived from the healthcare survey for each of the 22 medication classes are the critical values that when multiplied by a dosage score it gives a patient MQS score. It computes a single numeric value for a patient's pain medication profile. We recorded the names and doses of each medication being used then quantified the total burden of each subject's medication using the MQS-III. which assigns a measurement to each drug based on both the dose taken and its burdensomeness (derived from expert consensus).</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change Score (PGIC) Less Than 3</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement. Patients rate their change as:
1=Very Much Improved, 2=Much Improved, 3=Minimally Improved, 4=No Change, 5=Minimally Worse, 6=Much Worse, 7=Very Much Worse.
A PGIC score less than 3 means the patient reported &quot;much improved&quot; to &quot;very much improved.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Greater Than or Equal to a 30% Reduction in Oswestry Neck Disability Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire has been designed to give us information to how neck pain has affected the ability to manage in everyday life. There are ten sections, 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. All the points can be summed to a total score. The maximum points scored is 50. The reported score divided by 50 is then transformed to a percentage score by multiplying by 100. The Minimum dectectable change (90 % confidence) is 5 points or 10 percent.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants who reported ≥50% pain reduction on the numeric rating score for pain at the 1 month follow-up assessment period.
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain consists of a range where 0 (is no pain) and 10 (is extreme pain).
Percentage of participants with pain reduction = 100% (number of participants with pain reduction/all participants)</description>

        <title>Decrease of &gt; 6.8 Point Reduction in Medication Quntification Scale (MQS-III)</title>
        <description>The Medication Quantification Scale was designed as a method of quantifying different drug regimens (Harden et al, Journal of Pain, 2005). The detriment weights derived from the healthcare survey for each of the 22 medication classes are the critical values that when multiplied by a dosage score it gives a patient MQS score. It computes a single numeric value for a patient's pain medication profile. We recorded the names and doses of each medication being used then quantified the total burden of each subject’s medication using the MQS-III. which assigns a measurement to each drug based on both the dose taken and its burdensomeness (derived from expert consensus).</description>

        <title>Greater Than or Equal to a 30% Reduction in Oswestry Neck Disability Index Score</title>
        <description>This questionnaire has been designed to give us information to how neck pain has affected the ability to manage in everyday life. There are ten sections, 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. All the points can be summed to a total score. The maximum points scored is 50. The reported score divided by 50 is then transformed to a percentage score by multiplying by 100. The Minimum dectectable change (90 % confidence) is 5 points or 10 percent.</description>
