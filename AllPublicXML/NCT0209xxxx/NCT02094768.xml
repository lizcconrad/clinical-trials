  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Much attention has been directed at the unhealthy effects of sugar-sweetened beverages
      (SSBs), as an increase in their consumption has paralleled the rise obesity rates. In adults,
      SSBs have been shown to promote ectopic fat storage and raise plasma triglycerides compared
      to equivalent amounts of semi-skim (1.5%) milk, water, or diet beverages. Replacement of soda
      with milk had the added benefit of also reducing systolic blood pressure. While several
      studies have investigated the effects of SSBs on weight gain in children, no published
      studies have investigated their effects on lipid and lipoprotein risk factors under
      isocaloric conditions in metabolically at-risk adolescents, who are among the greatest
      consumers of SSBs. The main objective of this study is to test whether isocaloric replacement
      of soda with reduced fat milk will significantly improve atherogenic dyslipidemia, blood
      pressure, insulin sensitivity, and liver function in overweight and obese adolescents who are
      habitual soda consumers. The investigators will test this in a 8 week randomized two period
      crossover trial in 30 overweight and obese adolescent males who are self-reported habitual
      consumers of SSBs. Participants will consume energy equivalent amounts of SSB (24oz soda
      containing high fructose corn syrup per day), and reduced fat milk (2% milk fat) for 3 weeks
      each, in random order, separated by a 2-week washout. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, and
      blood samples will be collected at screen and at the end of each intervention period. Plasma
      measurements will include LDL peak particle diameter; lipoprotein subclass concentrations;
      triglycerides; total, LDL, and HDL-cholesterol; apolipoproteins; glucose, insulin, and
      insulin resistance; high sensitivity C-reactive protein; uric acid; and liver enzymes.
