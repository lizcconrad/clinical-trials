  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a disease not always attributable to nutritional imbalance, frequently associated
      with changes in key hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axes. The regain of weight loss after
      hypochaloric diets has been ascribed to these HP disregulations. The aim of the study is to
      explore pituitary morphology and its association with pituitary function and metabolic
      phenotype in outpatient obese individuals evaluated in the period 2010-2013 at the Department
      of Experimental Medicine of the University of Rome La Sapienza, with features of HP disease
      in a cross-sectional .
