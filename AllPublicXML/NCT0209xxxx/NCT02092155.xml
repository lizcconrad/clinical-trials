    <textblock>
      Some patients that have a tunneled pleural catheter will not have the pleural fluid (water
      around the lung) return after some time (pleurodesis). The purpose of this study is to
      understand how the investigators can predict who will achieve pleurodesis and how this occurs
      by studying the pleural effusion.

    <textblock>
      An alternative and emerging treatment for malignant pleural effusions is the placement of a
      chronic indwelling pleural catheter.

      Tunneled pleural catheters (TPC) are ideal for treatment of malignant pleural effusion (MPE)
      associated with a trapped or non-expandable lung which will not have sufficient visceral and
      parietal pleura apposition for chemical pleurodesis. Transforming growth factor-Beta 1
      (TGF-β) is a profibrotic cytokine, and a potent inducer of Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
      (PAI-1) in human pleural mesothelial cells. PAI-1 inhibits protease-dependent fibrinolytic
      activity and along with TGF-β, its concentration is increased in exudative and tuberculous
      pleural effusion. TGF-β levels in pleural fluid have been shown to correlate with pleural
      thickness in tuberculosis pleurisy and empyema in rabbits.

      TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine primarily produced by mesothelial cells in the pleural
      space, but can also originate from lung parenchymal macrophages that migrate to the pleural
      space. In humans, TGF-β consists of three isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3). They share
      many biological activities and their actions on cells are qualitatively similar in most
      cases. TGF-β stimulates the extracellular matrix production and studies support that TGF-β
      over-production is a key regulator in pleural fibrosis and chemical pleurodesis. Moreover,
      TGF-β signaling for the production of PAI-1 is clearly noted in human mesothelial cells of
      different origins. Different inflammatory stimuli in the pleural space including malignancy
      and infection may activate TGF-β up-regulation and enhanced production which in turns results
      in PAI-1 expression.
