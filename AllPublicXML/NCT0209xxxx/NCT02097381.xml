  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is associated with a state of chronic, generalized immune activation that has
      been shown in many studies to be a key predictor of progression to AIDS. The molecular,
      cellular, and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the HIV-associated immune activation
      are complex and still poorly studied. There is, however, growing consensus that both viral
      and host factors contribute to this phenotype, with emphasis on the role played by the
      mucosal immune dysfunction (and consequent microbial translocation). Moreover if it is known
      that in HIV-infected individuals, a severe depletion of intestinal cluster of differentiation
      4 (CD4+) T-cells, is associated with loss of epithelium integrity, microbial translocation
      and systemic immune activation, the kinetics of intestinal CD4+ T-cell reconstitution under
      combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) remains poorly understood.

      This study sought to evaluate the reconstitution of intestinal CD4+ T-cells, including Th1
      and Th17, in blood and colon samples collected from HIV-infected individuals before and after
      a short term cART.
