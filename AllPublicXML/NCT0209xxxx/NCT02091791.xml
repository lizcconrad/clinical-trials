  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare two levels (high and low forces) of short term lumbar
      traction on pain and functional tests of the lower limbs in a specific population of patients
      presenting with acute lumbar sciatica secondary to disc herniation. The investigators
      hypothesize that, in this particular medical condition, high level of lumbar traction might
      be more effective than low level lumbar traction in decreasing the pain associated with acute
      sciatica.
