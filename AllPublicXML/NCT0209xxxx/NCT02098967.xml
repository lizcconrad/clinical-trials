  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open label, Phase I study of RO6839921 is a dose-escalation study with two arms. Prior
      to investigations in either arm, patients in a single cohort, Cohort 0, will receive
      non-escalating, intravenous (IV) doses of RO6839921 daily on Days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle.
      Interim PK and safety data from this cohort will be evaluated before initiating
      dose-escalation.

      In arm A, RO6839921 will be given to patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. In Arm
      B, RO6839921 will be given to patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
      The arms will escalate independently. Escalation will begin in solid tumor patients (Arm A)
      in single patient cohorts, using a new Continual Reassessment Method (n-CRM). Escalation for
      AML patients will be initiated at or below the dose level that causes &gt;/= Grade 2 hematologic
      side effects in Arm A. Escalation in AML patients will follow a rolling 6 design.

      In both arms, RO6839921 will be administered by IV infusion on Days 1-5 of 28-day cycles.

      There will be no intrapatient dose escalation. All patients may be treated until disease
      progression/relapse or unacceptable toxicity.
