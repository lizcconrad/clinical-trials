      It suggests in the Guideline that the postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have taken
      selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) therapy for 2-3 years could benefit from
      changing endocrine therapy to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). This is a prospective, randomized
      and non-inferior trial to evaluate the prognosis of changing endocrine therapy from SERMs to
      AIs in perimenopausal and recently postmenopausal women with early-stage hormone
      receptor-positive breast cancer.
