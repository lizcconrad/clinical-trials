  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a 3-way crossover design: it will assess the impact of consuming a beverage
      enhanced with satiety-relevant properties on subjective ratings of appetite and on energy
      intake compared with a low energy version with the same sensory characteristics, and a
      non-sensory enhanced high energy control.

      In addition, saliva samples will be collected at regular intervals for the identification of
      novel biomarkers of energy intake.

      The study will be a 3-way crossover design: it will assess the impact of a high-energy,
      sensory-enhanced beverage on energy intake through ad libitum food consumption and subjective
      feeling of appetite using visual analogue scales (VAS) compared to 2 control beverages
      following repeated exposures. Each participant will consume each beverage 10 times. This
      includes 2 satiety-testing sessions on site at Leatherhead Food Research, and 8 occasions
      consuming the product as a mid-morning snack during the participants' normal routine. Each
      participant will attend the Nutrition Unit on 6 different occasions (plus one screening
      visit) before and after repeated exposures to the beverages at home. The order in which
      participants receive the beverages will be counterbalanced and randomised. There will be a
      two-week washout period in which none of the beverages are consumed between the different
      beverage manipulations. Participants will fast overnight before each visit and consume the
      same evening meal before each test day. Participants will be instructed to avoid consuming
      food or calorific beverages for one hour before or after consuming the beverage. Following
      the last satiety testing day participants will be debriefed and open questions will be asked
      about experiences of the beverages in a focus group format.

    <description>Frozen saliva samples will be banked. On completion of the study saliva samples associating with the extremes of appetite rating or energy intake will be pooled (6-12 samples / pool) and the protein component analysed by quantitative proteomics using an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) workflow. Remaining samples will be retained for validation of proteins found to associate or predict appetite or energy intake.</description>
