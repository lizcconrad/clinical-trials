    <description>As per the DX-2930-02 clinical protocol, an AE was considered treatment-emergent if the onset time was after administration of study drug through the Day 120 post-dose final follow-up visit or, in the event that onset time preceded study drug administration, the AE increased in severity during the 120-day post-dose follow-up period.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>through 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>As per the DX-2930-02 clinical protocol, a SAE was any adverse experience occurring at any dose that resulted in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening experience: &quot;life-threatening&quot; referred to a situation in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, it did not refer to an event that might have caused death if it were more severe.
Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization: this did not include hospitalization for observation with release within 24 hours. A scheduled hospitalization for a pre-existing condition that had not worsened during participation in the study did not meet this criterion. Pre-planned hospitalizations for an elective medical/surgical procedure or routine check-ups did not meet this criterion.
Resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
Was a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
Was considered to be an important medical event</description>

    <measure>HAE Attack Rate Per Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 8 to Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-specified, primary efficacy analysis was based on subjects in the 300 mg, 400 mg, and placebo dose groups with a historical baseline attack rate of at least 2 attacks over the last 3 months prior to enrollment. The result is based on General Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis of repeated counts per week during the prespecified assessment period (Days 8 to 50; predicted to correspond to a period of notable drug exposure). Baseline HAE attack rate per week is a covariate, treatment group is a fixed effect, and subject is a random effect in the GEE model with independence working correlation structure.</description>

        <description>As per the DX-2930-02 clinical protocol, a SAE was any adverse experience occurring at any dose that resulted in any of the following outcomes:
Death

        <title>HAE Attack Rate Per Week</title>
        <description>The pre-specified, primary efficacy analysis was based on subjects in the 300 mg, 400 mg, and placebo dose groups with a historical baseline attack rate of at least 2 attacks over the last 3 months prior to enrollment. The result is based on General Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis of repeated counts per week during the prespecified assessment period (Days 8 to 50; predicted to correspond to a period of notable drug exposure). Baseline HAE attack rate per week is a covariate, treatment group is a fixed effect, and subject is a random effect in the GEE model with independence working correlation structure.</description>
