      The purpose of this study is to assess the continued safety of topical use of SD-101 cream
      (6%) in subjects with Epidermolysis Bullosa

    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare group of inherited disorders that manifest as blistering
      or erosion of the skin and in some cases, the epithelial lining of other organs, in response
      to little or no apparent trauma. There is a lack of effective agents for skin disorders
      involving blistering and lesion formation. Current approved therapies are minimally effective
      and have safety issues. Scioderm has developed SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) for treatment of EB.

      This is an open label extension study to assess the continued safety of topically applied
      SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) in subjects with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional
      non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa.

      SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) will be applied topically, once a day to the entire body for the
      duration of the study. Subjects who successfully complete the entire SD-003 study will have
      the option to roll over into the SD-004 study. The baseline visit 1 will occur at the final
      visit date for SD-003. The Body Surface Area (BSA) coverage of blisters and lesions
      assessment made at the final SD-003 study visit will be used as the baseline information at
      visit 1 for the SD-004 study. The subject will return to the study site for visit 2 through
      visit 14 (1080 days) to have BSA assessed. Body Surface Area will be assessed at all
      subsequent scheduled study center visits. Scheduled study center visits occur every 6 months
      after visit 14 (visits 16, 18, 20, etc.). After completion of visit 14, the next subject
      visit (visit 15) will be a phone call from the site to the patient. Telephone visits will
      occur every 6 months thereafter (visits 17,19, 21, etc.) and include assessment of adverse
      events and concomitant medications only. For female subjects of childbearing potential, a
      urine pregnancy test will be performed at visit 4 and every 6 months up to and including the
      final study visit.
