    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of two different dose
      levels of NT 201 (75 U or 100 U per cycle), compared with placebo, in reducing the salivary
      flow rate, and the severity and frequency of chronic troublesome sialorrhea that occurs as a
      result of various neurological conditions in adult subjects.

    <measure>MP: Change From Baseline in Unstimulated Salivary Flow (uSFR) Rate at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>uSFR was assessed by weighing of dental rolls soaked with saliva over 5 minutes and then procedure was repeated after 30 minutes and the average of the 2 results for flow rate was calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MP: Participant's Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The GICS was used to measure the impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale that ranged from -3 = very much worse to +3 = very much improved and was applicable for participant and caregiver. If the participant was not able to answer then carer's rating was to be recorded instead of participant's rating and the participant's rating was left blank.</description>

    <measure>MP: Change From Baseline in Unstimulated Salivary Flow (uSFR) Rate at Week 8 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>uSFR was assessed by weighing of dental rolls soaked with saliva over 5 minutes and then procedure was repeated after 30 minutes and the average of the 2 results for flow rate was calculated.</description>

    <measure>MP: Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS) at Week 1, 2, 8 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GICS was used to measure the investigator's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale that ranged from -3 = very much worse to +3 = very much improved and was applicable for participant and caregiver. If the participant was not able to answer then carer's rating was to be recorded instead of participant's rating and the participant's rating was left blank.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of the basic neurological condition associated with sialorrhea

             injury (for at least 3 months) at screening, defined as the presence of all of the
             following, at screening and at baseline and for at least the 3 months before screening
             (where retrospective response to questionnaires is impossible, a statement of
             equivalent severity will suffice):

             at least 4 weeks before study entry, i.e. screening, and must be planned to remain
             stable during the course of the study.

          -  Recent (i.e., four weeks) drug treatment for sialorrhea.

          -  Recent (i.e., one year for sialorrhea, 14 weeks for other indications) treatment with
             - or known hypersensitivity to - Botulinum toxin, or known hypersensitivity to any

        <description>The GICS was used to measure the impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale that ranged from -3 = very much worse to +3 = very much improved and was applicable for participant and caregiver. If the participant was not able to answer then carer's rating was to be recorded instead of participant's rating and the participant's rating was left blank.</description>

        <description>uSFR was assessed by weighing of dental rolls soaked with saliva over 5 minutes and then procedure was repeated after 30 minutes and the average of the 2 results for flow rate was calculated.</description>

        <title>MP: Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS) at Week 1, 2, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>The GICS was used to measure the investigator's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale that ranged from -3 = very much worse to +3 = very much improved and was applicable for participant and caregiver. If the participant was not able to answer then carer's rating was to be recorded instead of participant's rating and the participant's rating was left blank.</description>
