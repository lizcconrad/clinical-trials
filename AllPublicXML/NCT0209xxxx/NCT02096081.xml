  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that two FDA-approved botulinum toxin drugs called
      Xeomin® and Botox® can reduce the severity of vertical lines (wrinkles) that appear between
      the eyebrows (glabellar frown lines).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group clinical study
      to investigate the equivalence of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) to onabotulinumtoxinA
      (Botox®) in the treatment of glabellar frown lines.
