      To determine the accuracy of unguided versus ultrasound (US) guided knee joint injections in
      obese patients with no clinically detectable effusion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with BMI &gt; 30 and no clinically detectable knee effusions, with clinical symptoms
      and radiographic evidence of knee osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis, who have been
      referred for an intraarticular knee injection with corticosteroid will be randomized to
      either receive ultrasound guidance or not receive ultrasound guidance for their injection.
      One group will use the ultrasound guidance to position the needle. The other group will use
      landmarks to position the needle. For both groups, once the proceduralist is comfortable with
      needle placement for the injection, contrast dye will be injected and fluoroscopy used, to
      determine if the needle placement is correct. If it is determined the needle placement is not
      correct, fluoroscopy will be used to reposition it. Once needle placement is determined to be
      acceptable, the injection will be given. Patient demographics will be collected, along with
      pain scores preprocedure and two weeks post-procedure.

      Subjects are responsible for all clinical costs associated with the injection.

      There is no remuneration offered for study participation.
