  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial of a
      school-based stress management and coping skills training program among a sample of
      economically disadvantaged urban 8- to 12-year-old school children with physician-confirmed
      asthma. The investigators aim (1) to establish feasibility of this approach by recruiting
      from different schools and (2) to learn whether individuals assigned to receive the
      intervention show improvements in psychological function, decreases in lung inflammation, and
      related improvements in asthma health when compared with disease severity-matched peers who
      receive education-only or standard care.

    <description>Participants randomized to the &quot;I Can Cope&quot; condition will receive 6 face-to-face individualized sessions over a 2-month period. Each session will last 50 minutes and take place at the child's school either during approved times during the school day or as part of the after-school program. Sessions are psychoeducational and experiential and include opportunities for the child with asthma to: (1) learn about the pathophysiology of asthma; (2) understand the biological impact of stress on the body; (3) learn the relationship among thoughts, feelings, actions, and asthma; (4) acquire a set of coping skills to help deal with asthma-related and day-to-day stressors in their lives, and (5) receive training in biofeedback-assisted relaxation techniques.</description>
