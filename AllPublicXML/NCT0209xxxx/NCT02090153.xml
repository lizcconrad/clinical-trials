    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of S-1 plus Leucovorin
      (1 week on and 1 week off) as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic and recurrent
      gastric cancer.

      Patients enrolled in this study were orally treated with S-1 in doses of 40 mg (body surface
      area (BSA)&lt;1.25 m2), 50 mg (1.25≤BSA&lt;1.50 m2) and 60 mg (BSA≥1.50 m2) b.i.d. on days 1-7 in
      combination with LV given simultaneously at a ﬁxed dose of 25 mg b.i.d. on days 1-7, followed
      by a 7 day rest. Treatment courses were repeated every 2 weeks. Treatment was continued until
      progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.
