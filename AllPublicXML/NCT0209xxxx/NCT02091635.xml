  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a disorder characterized by chronic or recurrent upper abdominal
      pain or discomfort in the absence of a specific structural cause. Improving gastric
      accommodation and prokinetic effect seem to be an attractive physiological target in patients
      with FD. Motilitone (Dong-A ST, Yongin, Korea) is a new herbal drug that was launched in
      December 2011 in Korea for treating patients with FD. The current study aims to evaluate
      effects of motilitone on gastric accommodation and emptying after a meal in a group of
      healthy volunteers using three-dimensional gastric volume measurements by magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI). Healthy volunteers are randomly allocated to receive either motilitone or
      placebo in a double blinded manner. After 5 days of treatment, subjects undergo gastric MRI.
      The primary endpoint is gastric accommodation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers between 20 and 70 years of age without upper abdominal pain or
             discomfort and a structural abnormality on upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy
             performed within the preceding 6 months were eligible for the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria:

               1. any functional GI disease or previous abdominal surgery
