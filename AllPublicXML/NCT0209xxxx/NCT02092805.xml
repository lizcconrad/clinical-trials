    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of rTMS over primary motor cortex in
      patients suffering from malignant visceral pain. Thirty four patients were included in the
      study. They are divided randomly into 2 groups using closed envelop as real rTMS group and
      sham group. Real rTMS over the hand area of motor cortex (20 Hz, 10 trains with inter train
      interval 30 second with total pulses 2000, intensity 80% of motor threshold) every day for
      ten consecutive days (5 days/week) and the coil elevated and angled away from the head as
      sham stimulation. Patients were evaluated by verbal descriptor scale (VDS), visual analog
      scale (VAS), and Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) at the baseline, after 1st,
      5th, 10th session, 15 day and 1 month after end of sessions. Serum human dynorphin (Dyn)
      level was measured at baseline, 5th and 10th session.

    <description>The active group recieved real-rTMS over the motor cortical area corresponding to the hand of painful side. Each train consist of 2000 pulses at 20 Hz and 80% RMT (total duration 10s). The treatment was repeated every day for 5 consecutive days in week for two weeks (the total number of sessions had be given was 10 sessions).</description>
