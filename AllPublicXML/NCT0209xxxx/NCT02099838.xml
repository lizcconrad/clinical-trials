  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary failure of sulfonylureas (SUs) can occur in about 30%-40% of type 2 diabetic
      patients after treatment with SUs for 5 years, although SUs are widely used in type 2
      diabetic patients. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adding
      compound preparation of pioglitazone and metformin for type 2 diabetic patients who have bad
      glycemic control with the initial treatment of SUs.

    <textblock>
      Design of this clinical trial was multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo parallel
      controlled. Type 2 diabetic patients having bad glycemic control with the initial treatment
      of SUs were included. They were randomly divided into experiment group and control group,
      respectively taking compound preparation of pioglitazone and metformin (2mg/500mg) and
      placebo with identical shape immediately before a meal twice a day. Course of the treatment
      was 12 weeks.
