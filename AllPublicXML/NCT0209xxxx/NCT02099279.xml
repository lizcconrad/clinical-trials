    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is a
      major reason for ICU admission. Cardiac function is often impaired in this disease but its
      association with clinical outcome has not been fully established. The study aims to
      investigate the association between cardiac dysfunction and clinclial outcomes.

      This is a prospective observational study conducted in a 47-bed mixed ICU of tertiary
      academic teaching hospital. The study will be performed between January 2014 to December
      2015. All patients meeting the diagnostic criteria of AECOPD and admitted to ICU are
      potentially eligible for the present study. Relevant demographics and laboratory measurements
      are obtained. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is performed immediately after ICU
      admission by experienced intensivists. Cox proportional hazard regression model is fitted by
      using stepwise forward selection and backward elimination technique. If linear assumption is
      not satisfied, the linear spline function will be used.

        All patients meeting the diagnostic criteria of AECOPD and admitted to ICU are potentially
        eligible for the present study. The diagnosis of AECOPD is based on that defined in Global
        Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. AECOPD is defined using definitive
        criteria with at least two of the following major symptoms: increased dyspnea, increased
        sputum purulence, increased sputum volume; or one major and one minor symptom: nasal
        discharge/congestion, wheeze, sore throat and cough for at least two consecutive days.
