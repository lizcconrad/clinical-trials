  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects approximately 30 % of American veterans
      returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the current therapy is effective, a percentage
      of patients will fail to improve and will develop chronic treatment-resistant PTSD. Patients
      suffering from PTSD experience intense suffering, lack of productivity and a higher risk of
      suicide. Unfortunately, combat PTSD has a tendency to be resistant to current treatments.

      The central goal of this project is to develop a new therapeutic strategy involving the
      placement of intracranial electrodes to treat the symptoms of PTSD. The project is based on
      recent evidence showing abnormal activity in a specific brain region of PTSD patients,
      thought to be responsible for the core symptoms of PTSD.

          -  Patients must be stable on their current psychotropic medication for a period of 2
             months before implantation and agree to not increase dosages or add any new

             via clinical interview and CAPS.

          -  Confirmation of combat trauma exposure via military record review and a Combat
             Exposure Scale score &gt; 9.

          -  Minimum 5 year total illness duration, with no 6 month period of clinical remission
             during the 5 years prior to entry in the study.

          -  Clinical record documentation of non-response to at least 2 of the following
             antidepressants, alone or in combination, at maximally tolerated FDA recommended doses
             for ≥ 6 months: sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram,
             amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline, desipramine, clomipramine, phenelzine,

             minimum of 3 months.

          -  A minimum 3 month trial of prazosin at 10 mg per day or, if less, maximally tolerated
             FDA recommended doses, unless considered contraindicated based on co-morbid medical
             conditions or concomitant medications.

          -  Trial of at least 3 months of one of the following: lithium, divalproex sodium,

             inclusion. (Patients who are unable to complete 6 months of psychotherapy may be
             included if the cause of treatment cessation was that the risks of further treatment,
             including intense psychological suffering, outweighed the potential benefits of
             continuing the treatment).
