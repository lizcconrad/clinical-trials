      : The objective of this study is to determine the tolerability and therapeutic potential of
      oxytocin in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) when paired with a
      computer game intervention that is designed to enhance face perception skills. We designate
      two measures as our primary outcomes, based on prior published work with these interventions,
      and we propose a sample based on power analyses from these prior results. A second objective
      of this study is to learn about the breadth of possible positive effects that this
      combination therapy might have for children with ASD. To this end, we include a host of other
      exploratory measures that assess aspects of social motivation and attention, social
      perception, and social cognition. Thus, a second objective is to conduct a &quot;signal finding&quot;
      study - to gather outcome data on a range of dependent variables that theoretically should be
      related to oxytocin's effects on social processes, but for which there are no prior data. The
      signal finding aspect of this study will provide the preliminary data needed to design a more
      targeted follow up study.

      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in 52 children and
      adolescents with ASD. Diagnosis will be confirmed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      (DSM) criteria, supported by the Autism Diagnostic Interview and the Autism Diagnostic
      Observation Schedule. Subjects will be randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo for
      a 5 day period with concomitant game play of the FaceStation computer games, developed at
      CHOP. Measures of social function and cognition will be administered before and after the
      game play period. Two measures of social functioning will serve as our primary endpoints; all
      other measures will be treated as exploratory variables, with significance testing corrected
      for multiple comparisons.

      Recognizing faces is critical to social functioning, and can be improved for individuals with
      ASD by using intervention software in the form of appropriately designed computer games. The
      effects of this type of social intervention may be amplified with the concurrent use of
      oxytocin. Furthermore, these learning effects may impact social skills in general and
      translate to the level of the individual's everyday social behavior. Thus, the objective of
      this study is to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin in
      children and adolescents with ASD when paired with a computer game intervention that is
      designed to enhance face perception skills.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-testing on the The Part/Whole Identity Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Follow-up post testing (max 12 days)</time_frame>
    <description>4) Part/Whole Identity Test measures the extent to which the participant employed a featural or holistic face recognition strategy. In this task, a sample face is presented for 4 sec, followed by a test face composed of either two whole faces or two face parts. As expected in Part/Whole Identity, effect sizes ranged from a low 0.30 for the part mouth condition to a high of 0.81 for the whole eye condition, such that the condition measuring holistic processing in the eye region was most sensitive to group differences. This measure was also most sensitive to behavioral changes with the LFI intervention trial.</description>

    <description>Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (child version) (Baron-Cohen, et al., 2001) is a test of emotion recognition. This test asks children to pick the best word out of four options to describe the mental state of a set of eyes. The test includes 28 photographs of eyes with both affective (e.g., upset) and cognitive (e.g., thoughtful) mental state words as choices.</description>

    <description>Intranasal oxytocin (Trade name: Syntocinon) Pharmacological class: The pharmacologic and clinical properties of Syntocinon are identical with the naturally occurring hormone oxytocin, which is released from the posterior pituitary.
Route of administration: Intranasal Planned exposure: Each participant will receive one dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) per day for 5 days.
