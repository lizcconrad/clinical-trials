    <textblock>
      This multicenter, non-randomized, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      six treatment regimens in participants with advanced solid tumors for whom therapies that
      will convey clinical benefit are not available and/or are not suitable options per the
      treating physician's judgment.
