      Scientific Background: Inherent gaps exist between the worlds of research and clinical
      therapy, especially in mental-health systems. Developed as an important strategy aimed to
      bridge them, widening efforts worldwide have implemented Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM), a
      method devised for systematic ongoing quantitative measurements used in diverse clinical
      practices, from psychotherapies to psychiatric management. The efficacy of this approach has
      been repeatedly demonstrated in various measures, such as satisfaction with treatment by
      patients and therapists, lower drop-out rates, symptomatic benefits, and more.

      Objectives: The aim of the current study is to test the feasibility and the clinical benefits
      of implementation of a Routine Outcome Monitoring System in a public clinical center, as a
      pioneering project in Israel, at the &quot;Shalvata&quot; Mental Health Center.

      Working Hypotheses: Incorporation of a ROM system in routine clinical practice is
      hypothesized to improve patients' and therapists' overall satisfaction, allow for early
      detection and intervention in therapeutic raptures, decrease drop-out rates, and improve
      various clinical outcome measures.

      Methods: The suggested study is a two-stage (implementation and intervention) open trial. 900
      new outpatients in 'Shalvata' clinics will be recruited and randomized to intervention (ROM)
      and control groups. Assessment questionnaires will be filled periodically using 'CORE-NET', a
      computerized system enabling repeated measurements and feedback in a user-friendly and
      efficient manner.

      Data Analysis: The evaluation of the differential influence of monitoring processes on
      overall efficiency as compared to control group will be tested using Multiple Analysis of
      Variance (MANOVA). The predictive value of possible variables on process and outcome of
      therapy will be assessed using stratified regression analyses. The possible causal effects
      between specific lagged variables will be assessed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling and
      Time Series Analysis.

      Contribution: This pioneering study is the first in Israel to offer a routine systematic
      evaluation of therapeutic processes, as well as assessing its clinical effects. Consequently,
      a large and meaningful data-set will emerge, enabling significant enrichment of our
      evidence-based understanding of therapeutic processes.
