  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of performing a larger multicenter
      phase III trial to assess the effects of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in acute chest syndrome
      (ACS). Prespecified feasibility criteria consists of the ability to enroll potential study
      participants, which includes the timely notification of hospitalized patients with ACS, the
      capacity to consent eligible individuals, and the ability to appropriately randomize eligible
      patients within 24 hours of diagnosis. Additional feasibility objectives involve ensuring
      appropriate eligibility criteria, proper administration of the study drug, and the ability to
      completely and accurately collect clinical data of interest. The final aim of our pilot study
      is to provide preliminary data, with respect to treatment effect and variance, to allow
      sample size calculation in a larger trial given the lack of data available to help guide this
      process. The investigators hypothesize that the use of UFH in ACS will result in a decrease
      in the duration of hospitalization and improve other clinical outcomes, such as the duration
      of hypoxemia and duration of moderate to severe pain.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized within 24 hours of diagnosis to one of two treatment arms, Arm A, anticoagulation and standard of care, or Arm B, no anticoagulation and standard of care. Weight-adjusted UFH will be given at doses of 80 units per kilogram followed by 18 units per kilogram per hour intravenously for 7 days, or until discharge, if discharge is shorter than 7 days. UFH will be monitored by standard protocol to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time in the therapeutic range per institutional guidelines.
The experimental arm will receive standard of care, too, which will include the following: intravenous fluids, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, incentive spirometry, pain management, red blood cell transfusions, and exchange transfusions.</description>
