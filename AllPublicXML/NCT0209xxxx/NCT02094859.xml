      The primary purpose of this Study is evaluation of the safety and performance of the
      GlucoClear System (System).

      The primary safety objective will be assessed by:

      • Evaluation of any serious adverse device effects upon Sensor insertion through Sensor
      removal and a follow-up assessment one week (7 ± 3 days) after Sensor removal.

      The primary performance objective will be evaluated using the following criteria:

      15/20% Performance: Blood glucose measurements from the System must meet the ISO 15197 15/20%
      accuracy criteria (at least 95% of the matched pairs within ± 15 mg/dL of Comparator values ≤
      75 mg/dL and within ±20% of Comparator values &gt; 75 mg/dL).

      Design: Non-randomized, non-treatment, prospective, open label Study.

      After providing written informed consent, subjects meeting Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria will
      be connected to the System for a maximum of 72 hours.

      For the purposes of this clinical Study, the System will not display real-time glucose
      values, glucose trend graphs, or glucose alarms to either the Study Subjects or the Study
      Site Personnel. There will be no treatment of any Subject based on the output of the System.
      Diabetes management decisions throughout this Study (if applicable) will be conducted
      according to hospital procedures.

        -  1 set of laboratory measurements will be drawn per Subject for baseline.

        -  A maximum of 82 blood samples will be drawn per Subject during the 72 hour monitoring
           session including.

             -  Up to 75 blood samples drawn for comparative glucose measurement on laboratory
                analyzers. Blood samples will be taken from the sampling catheter in the peripheral
                vein in the contralateral extremity (relative to placement of the System) with no
                more than 25 samples taken within one day (00:00 to 23:59) for glucose measurement
                on laboratory analyzers (e.g., Yellow Springs Instrument glucose analyzer (YSI),
                Radiometer blood analyzer);

             -  Up to three (3) sets of laboratory measurements; and

             -  Up to 4 other blood samples, as needed. One week (7 + 3 days) after Sensor removal,
                subjects will be contacted for a follow-up assessment and document any subsequent
                adverse events.
