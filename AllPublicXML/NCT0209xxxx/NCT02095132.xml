      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 and
      irinotecan hydrochloride in treating younger patients with solid tumors that have come back
      or that have not responded to standard therapy. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 and irinotecan
      hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose of AZD1755
      (MK-1775) administered on days 1 through 5 every 21 days, in combination with oral irinotecan
      (irinotecan hydrochloride), to children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of AZD1755 (MK-1775) in combination with oral
      irinotecan administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of AZD1755 (MK-1775) in children with refractory
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of AZD1755 (MK-1775) and irinotecan within
      the confines of a Phase 1 study.

      II. To obtain initial Phase 2 efficacy data on the anti-tumor activity of AZD1755 (MK-1775)
      in combination with irinotecan administered to children with relapsed or refractory
      neuroblastoma, in children with relapsed or refractory medulloblastoma/CNS PNET (central
      nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor) and in children with relapsed or refractory
      rhabdomyosarcoma.

      III. To investigate checkpoint over-ride by AZD1755 (MK-1775) via the mechanism-based
      pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker of decreased cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylation
      in correlative and exploratory studies.

      IV. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers of AZD1755 (MK-1775) sensitivity, including
      v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral
      oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog (MYCN), phosphorylated-WEE1 G2 checkpoint kinase
      (p-Wee1), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Drosophila) (EZH2) and gamma-H2A histone family,
      member gamma-H2AX in tumor tissues in correlative and exploratory studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride orally (PO) and WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 PO on days
      1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
