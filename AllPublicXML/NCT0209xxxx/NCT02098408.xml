  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits are known to be a core feature of schizophrenia and seem to become
      manifest in the prodromal or Ultra-High Risk (UHR) state of psychosis. The cognitive deficits
      are known to pose a critical barrier to functional recovery. Hence it is of vital importance
      to find intervention strategies that can alleviate these cognitive deficits and consequently
      improve daily functioning, and quality of life, as well as the prognosis for UHR-patients.
      The investigators will examine whether:

        -  Cognitive remediation therapy will be superior to standard treatment in improving
           cognitive functioning in UHR- patients (null hypothesis: No difference between the two
           groups).

        -  Cognitive remediation therapy will be superior to standard treatment in improving
           psychosocial functioning and clinical symptoms in UHR-patients (null hypothesis: No
           difference between the two groups).

    <description>Neurocognition will be trained using the NEAR model (Medalia et al. 2003), whereas the training of social cognitive skills will be by use of the SCIT manual (Social Cognition and Interaction Training) developed by Roberts et al. 2014.
The intervention consists of 24 group sessions taking place once a week (two hours) and additional neurocognitive training at home. Furthermore, there will be a total of 12 individual sessions aiming at bridging the cognitive training to the everyday functioning of the patients.</description>
