    <textblock>
      The Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between
      partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health
      disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal
      Disease living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this
      community-based coalition include patients with kidney disease, dialysis facility staff and
      providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy
      organizations. The burden of kidney disease is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of
      kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, the investigators research
      suggests that racial disparities in access to kidney transplantation are concentrated in the
      Southeast, where African Americans are less likely to access each step in the transplant
      process. The long-term goal of the investigators Coalition is to use community- based
      participatory research approaches to develop, test, and disseminate sustainable, community
      interventions improve access to transplant for African American patients with kidney disease.
      The Reducing Disparities in Access to kidNey Transplantation (RaDIANT) community study
      proposes to use community-based participatory research methods to develop a multilevel
      intervention to reduce racial disparities in access to kidney transplantation. The long-term
      impact of this application will be to reduce racial disparities in the kidney disease
      community.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dialysis facilities within GA were considered for this intervention due to data
             restrictions. The remaining facilities were selected in a step-wise selection process
             1) The presence of a racial disparity in referral or 2) a crude referral risk less
             than six percent.

          -  The presence of a racial disparity was based on the crude referral risk difference and
             the standardized referral risk difference.

          -  The remaining facilities had a calculated 6-month crude referral risk mean of 0.06 and
             all facilities with a crude referral risk less than the mean were selected for
             inclusion.

          -  The final pool of 134 facilities were randomized to either the intervention or control
             group using a one to one ratio.

        Exclusion:

          -  Facilities with a 6-month population (from June-December 2012) of less than 13 End
             Stage Renal Disease patients &lt;70 years of age within a facility were excluded.
