  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of selective endovascular unilateral carotid body ablation in patients with
      treatment-resistant hypertension. All patients will be followed for two (2) years following
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a new method of treatment, unilateral carotid body ablation, for
      treatment- resistant hypertensive patients to restore more normal blood pressure control,
      which will reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. This strategy
      will increase the number of therapeutic options available to many patients and their
      physicians as well as offering the potential of normal blood pressure to those patients in
      whom blood pressure remains elevated despite vigorous, drug or device based therapies.

          -  Office systolic blood pressure (oBP) ≥ 160mmHg.

          -  Daytime mean ambulatory BP (ABPM) ≥ 140 mmHg.

          -  Persistent hypertension on at least three anti-hypertensive medications, including a
             diuretic, at stable, maximum tolerated dose within the last 90 days.

          -  No evidence for causes of secondary HTN (hypertension ) following thorough clinical
             assessment.

          -  At least one carotid body detected in CT angiography of the neck, defined as an
             hyper-enhanced ovoid structure strongly located poster-medially from the area of
             carotid bifurcation.

          -  Ability to give and giving informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential have a negative pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Calculated GFR (glomerular filtration rate) &lt; 30ml/min/m2

          -  Obstructive carotid atherosclerotic disease which precludes safe delivery of ablation
             catheter or performance of ablation

          -  Must be at least 6 months post renal denervation therapy.

          -  Oxygen saturation at rest below 92%.

          -  Requirement for oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation.

          -  Severe untreated obstructive sleep apnea (defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥
             30/hour during Polysomnography associated with an average minimum oxygen desaturation
             of &lt; 85%.

          -  Patients wish to participate in mountain climbing, sky diving or free diving.

          -  Pregnancy or anticipation of pregnancy.

          -  Acute coronary syndrome or unstable angina &lt; 6 months before scheduled procedure.

          -  History of repeated episodes of hypoglycemia with hypoglycemic unawareness.

          -  Known diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

             tortuosity or other anatomical findings that preclude safe placement of the guiding
             catheter or the investigational system, and the delivery of RF energy.

          -  Carotid body is not within reach of the investigational system due to position within
             the carotid bifurcation or distance of the CB (carotid body) from the femoral access
             point.

          -  Other abnormal angiographic findings that indicate the patient is at risk of a stroke,

             developmental or traumatic vascular lesion or tumor.

             required for informed consent and full participation in the study.
