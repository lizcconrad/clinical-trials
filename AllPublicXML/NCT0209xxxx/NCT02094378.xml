  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (participants assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences by chance),
      double-blind (identity of study drugs will not be known to participant or members of study
      staff), placebo-controlled (a substance without active drug identical in appearance to
      esketamine), 2-period crossover study (participants assigned to each treatment sequence will
      receive 1 dose of esketamine and 1 dose of placebo administered intranasally [through the
      nose]) conducted in healthy adult participants at a single center. Participants will complete
      3 study phases: A screening phase of up to 3 weeks; a 2-week double-blind treatment phase,
      which includes 2 treatment periods (Periods 1 and 2) separated by a washout interval of at
      least 7 days; and, a 1-week posttreatment (follow up) phase, if applicable. The duration of
      the study for each participant will be approximately 6 weeks. Blood and urine samples will be
      collected during the study for laboratory assessments. Participants will be monitored for
      safety from the time of signing the informed consent form up until 1 week after the last dose
      of study drug (or end of treatment).

    <description>The Cogstate® Computerized Battery of tests will include 5 tests: Detection (simple reaction time task measuring processing speed [lower score = better performance]); Identification (choice reaction time paradigm measuring attention [lower score = better performance]); One Card Learning (visual episodic memory measure [higher score = better performance]); One Back ( &quot;n-back&quot; working memory measure [higher score = better performance]); and, Groton Maze Learning Test (executive function measure; total number of errors made in attempting to learn the same hidden pathway on five consecutive trials at a single session [lower score = better performance]) (Maruff 2004, Snyder 2005).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in cognitive functioning measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>On day 1 at -1 hour, 40 minutes, and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing (or at the end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The KSS is a subject-reported assessment used to rate sleepiness on a scale of 1 to 9, ranging from 'extremely alert' (1) to 'very sleepy, great effort to keep awake, fighting sleep' (9) (Akerstedt 1990).</description>

    <time_frame>On Day 1 at -1 hour, 40 minutes, and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing (or at the end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The mental effort scale is a subject-reported assessment of the level of effort needed to complete the test battery on a 15-cm equal interval scale (Zijlstra1993).</description>
