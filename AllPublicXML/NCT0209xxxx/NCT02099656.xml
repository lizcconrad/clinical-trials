  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate
      the effects of lebrikizumab on airway eosinophilic inflammation in participants with
      uncontrolled asthma who are using inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment and a second
      controller medication. Enrolled participants will undergo a 3-week screening period during
      which assessments, including a bronchoscopy procedure, will be made. Participants will
      subsequently be randomized to receive lebrikizumab or placebo by subcutaneous (SC) injection
      on Day 1, Day 8, Week 4, and Week 8. Participants will continue their standard of care
      therapy throughout the study. End of treatment assessments will be taken at Week 12. Total
      study period, including screening and follow-up, is expected to last 23 weeks.
