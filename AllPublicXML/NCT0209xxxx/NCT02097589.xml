  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to: Improve the effectiveness of vaccinations by
      identifying the effect of cholesterol medication, statins, on immune responses.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the anti-inflammatory action of statins, it was proposed that statin treatment would
      decrease the efficacy of vaccination. This response has yet to be explored following a
      primary vaccination such as pneumococcal pneumonia. In this study, healthy volunteers will be
      divided into 2 arms receiving treatment for 28 days: 40 mg atorvastatin or placebo.

      Antibody titer for 23 serotypes, complete blood count (CBC), high-sensitivity c-reactive
      protein (hsCRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), lipids, cytokines (TNF-alpha,
      IFN-gamma, interleukins, etc.) and key membrane receptors (toll-like receptors, etc.) will be
      measured for baseline before statin or placebo treatment. On day 7 of treatment,
      pre-vaccination measures of the above parameters will be taken and an immune response will be
      induced in all groups using Pneumovax 23 at Day 7. On days 8, 14, 21, and 28 post-vaccination
      measures will be compared to baseline and between groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the effect of atorvastatin treatment on pneumococcal antigen specific antibody production.</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 49 days</time_frame>
    <description>The 24 subjects will be randomized into 2 groups of 12 individuals (6 per gender) and will be assigned to receive either atorvastatin treatment (40mg/day) or placebo (lactose pill) control.
Subjects will be asked to fast after midnight prior to any morning blood draws. On day 1 of treatment, blood will be drawn for a baseline. Treatment with either atorvastatin or placebo will begin on day one and will continue until day 28. Subjects will be instructed to take the study medication once a day at the same time each day.
On day seven of treatment, subjects will be immunized with Pneumovax 23, administered intramuscularly into the arm. Blood will be drawn at several time points following Pneumovax 23 administration. Measurements on blood will be made to determine the effect of statins on immune factor gene expression, serum protein levels, as well as at the cellular level.</description>
