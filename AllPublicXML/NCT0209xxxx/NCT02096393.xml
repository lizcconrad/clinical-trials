  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised control trial to assess the benefits of using patient specific
      instrumentation in total knee replacement surgery. Patient specific instrumentation is an
      individualised system for total knee replacement surgery. The system has been marketed and is
      already in use in some centres. The type of implant used remains the same but the sizing of
      the components, and alignment of the implant is expected to improve. This study assesses any
      improvement in implant alignment in using the patient specific instrumentation, any improved
      intra-operative outcomes and any long term clinical outcome improvements for patients.

      This is a randomised control trial to assess the benefits of using patient specific
      instrumentation in total knee replacement surgery. Patient specific instrumentation is an
      individualised system for total knee replacement surgery. The system has been marketed and is
      already in use in some centres. The process is similar to traditional knee replacement
      surgery but approximately 6 weeks prior to the operation patients will undergo an MRI scan of
      their knee, hip and ankle. From this data the dimensions and rotation of the knee can be
      accurately measured, and a custom made jig can be made specific to that patients anatomy. The
      jig is used intra-operatively to make accurate bone cuts according to this pre-operative
      plan, the type of implant used remains the same but the sizing of the components, and
      alignment of the implant is expected to improve. This study assesses any improvement in
      implant alignment in using the patient specific instrumentation, any improved intra-operative
      outcomes and any long term clinical outcome improvements for patients.
