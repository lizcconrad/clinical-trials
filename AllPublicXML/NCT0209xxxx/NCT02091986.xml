Patient to record his/her asthma symptom score twice daily. The following rating scales are to be used: 0 = None; no symptoms of asthma
= Mild symptoms; awareness of asthma symptoms and/or signs that are easily tolerated
= Moderate symptoms, asthma symptoms with some discomfort, causing some interference with daily activities or sleep
= Severe symptoms; incapacitating asthma symptoms and/or signs, with inability to perform daily activities or to sleep
Total asthma symptom score is derived as the sum of the daytime score plus the score from the previous nighttime, ie possible range (0 to 6).</description>

    <description>Study period average is defined as the average of the post-baseline values during the study taken after first dose of investigational product up to and including withdrawal from study or Week 12, minus the baseline assessment at randomization, for patients who remain in the study (irrespective of whether IP has been discontinued).
The PAQLQ(S) is a 23-item patient-reported questionnaire, each one reported on a 7-point scale (e.g. 1 = extremely bothered/all of the time; 7 = not bothered/none of the time). The PAQLQ(S) generates an overall score, as well as 3 domain scores: activity limitations (5 items), symptoms (10 items) and emotional function (8 items). The overall score will be calculated as the mean of the responses to each of the 23 questions (ie the range of 1-7, where higher scores indicate better quality of life). If any of the domain scores are missing, no total score will be calculated.</description>

        <description>End of study average is defined as the average of available records from 7 days before up to and including the day prior to withdrawal from study or Week 12, minus the baseline measurement at randomization, for patients who remain in the study (irrespective of whether IP has been discontinued).
Patient to record his/her asthma symptom score twice daily. The following rating scales are to be used: 0 = None; no symptoms of asthma
= Mild symptoms; awareness of asthma symptoms and/or signs that are easily tolerated
= Moderate symptoms, asthma symptoms with some discomfort, causing some interference with daily activities or sleep
= Severe symptoms; incapacitating asthma symptoms and/or signs, with inability to perform daily activities or to sleep

The PAQLQ(S) is a 23-item patient-reported questionnaire, each one reported on a 7-point scale (e.g. 1 = extremely bothered/all of the time; 7 = not bothered/none of the time). The PAQLQ(S) generates an overall score, as well as 3 domain scores: activity limitations (5 items), symptoms (10 items) and emotional function (8 items). The overall score will be calculated as the mean of the responses to each of the 23 questions (ie the range of 1–7, where higher scores indicate better quality of life). If any of the domain scores are missing, no total score will be calculated.</description>
