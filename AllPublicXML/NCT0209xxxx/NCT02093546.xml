      Study Visits:

      The following tests and procedures will be performed during your regular study visits while
      on GOG02290:

      During screening and at Day 28 (+/- 3 days):

        -  You will have a tumor biopsy to check for biomarkers.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn to test for biomarkers and circulating tumor
           cells (CTCs). Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your
           reaction to the study drug. CTC testing checks how many tumor cells are in the blood.

      Between Day 3 and Day 5 and at Day 56 (+/-3 days):

      -Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn to test for biomarkers and CTCs.

      Length of Study:

      After blood and biopsy samples have been collected, your participation in this study will be
      over.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 25 will take part at
      MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be enrolled on GOG0229O.

          2. Patients must have recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma, which is refractory
             to curative therapy or established treatments. Histologic confirmation of the original
             primary tumor is required. Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell
             types are eligible: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma,
             undifferentiated carcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma not
             otherwise specified (N.O.S.).

          3. Patients must have tissue available for molecular analysis. This can be tissue
             obtained at time of current recurrence or archival tissue from primary diagnosis or
             recurrence.

          4. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Measurable disease is defined as at
             least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest
             diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be &gt;/=10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or
             caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;/=20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph
             nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI. Measurable disease
             lesions must be amenable to pre- and post- treatment biopsy.

          5. Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this
             protocol as defined by RECIST. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be
             designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is
             obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation
             therapy.

          6. Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
             protocol, if one exists. In general, this would refer to any active GOG Phase III
             protocol or Rare Tumor protocol for the same patient population.

          7. Patients must have a GOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.

             uncomplicated UTI) b)Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be
             discontinued at least one week prior to registration c) Any other prior therapy
             directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, must be
             discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration. Any investigational agent
             must be discontinued at least 30 days prior to registration d) Any prior radiation
             therapy must be discontinued at least four weeks prior to registration e) At least 4
             weeks must have elapsed since the patient underwent any major surgery (e.g., major:
             laparotomy, laparoscopy) There is no delay in treatment for minor procedures (e.g.,
             tumor core biopsy).

          9. Patients must have had one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of
             endometrial carcinoma. Initial treatment may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy and
             radiation therapy, or consolidation/maintenance therapy. Chemotherapy administered in
             conjunction with primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer WILL be counted as a systemic
             chemotherapy regimen. Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to
             receive, one additional cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent
             disease.

         10. Patients MAY HAVE received non-cytotoxic (biologic or targeted) agent(s) as part of
             initial treatment and/or for management of recurrent or persistent disease, with the
             below stated exceptions (see NOTE below). Prior hormonal therapy is allowed, but must
             be discontinued at least one week prior to registration. NOTE: Prior therapy with PI3K
             inhibitors, AKT inhibitors and/or mTor inhibitors (e.g., everolimus, temsirolimus) is
             NOT allowed. Prior therapy with MEK inhibitors (e.g., AZD6244 or selumetinib) is NOT
             allowed.

         11. Patients must have adequate: a) Upper limit of normal (ULN) = institutional/laboratory

             Factors: International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
             &lt;/=1.5 x ULN

         12. All prior treatment-related toxicities must be CTCAE v4 grade &lt;/=1 (except alopecia)
             at the time of randomization.

         13. Patients with abnormal fasting glucose values &gt;160mg/dL at screening will be excluded.
             In addition, patients with Type 1 diabetes will also be excluded; however, patients
             with Type 2 diabetes will be allowed if diagnosed &gt;/=6 months prior to enrollment, and

             not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter
             absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels.

         15. The effects of trametinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because MEK inhibitors as well as GSK2141795 are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to randomization. Should a woman become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately.

         16. Patients must be 18 years or older. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 in
             patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible
             for future pediatric trials.

         17. Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting
             release of personal health information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had prior therapy with GSK2141795 or any other PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway
             inhibitor.

          2. Patients who have prior therapy with trametinib or any other MEK inhibitor.

          3. Patients who have uterine clear cell, mucinous, squamous, transitional cell, sarcomas,

          4. Patient with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer are excluded if there is any evidence of other malignancy
             being present within the last five years. Patients are also excluded if their previous
             cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy.

          5. Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days (or five half-lives, whichever is
             shorter; with a minimum of 14 days from the last dose) preceding the first dose of
             trametinib and during the study.

          6. Patients with history or evidence upon physical exam of central nervous system disease
             (CNS), including primary brain tumor or seizures not controlled with standard medical
             therapy. Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastasis or spinal cord
             compression.

          7. Patients who are pregnant or nursing.

          8. Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to the study drug or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To date there are

          9. Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug
             intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption,
             malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease) are excluded. Subjects with
             ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel
             obstruction are also excluded, as are any patients who cannot swallow the capsule
             whole. Capsules must not be crushed or chewed; naso-gastric or G-tube administration
             is not allowed.

             patients without bone disease is not permitted, except for the treatment of
             osteoporosis. c) Because the composition, PK, and metabolism of many herbal
             supplements are unknown, the concurrent use of all herbal supplements is prohibited
             during the study (including, but not limited to, St. John's Wort, kava, ephedra [ma
             huang], gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], yohimbe, saw palmetto, or
