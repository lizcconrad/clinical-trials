  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous evidences verified that erlotinib could dramatically improve the PFS and OS of
      non-small cell lung cancers who harbor EGFR sensitive mutations, however, primary or
      secondary resistance will be developed after TKI treatment, doctors do plenty of researches
      to overcome TKI resistance. FAST ACT-2 study present that, first line erlotinib combined with
      chemotherapy could improved mOS to more than 30 months in NSCLCs who harbor EGFR sensitive
      mutations, several study shows that sensitive mutations still exist after TKI resistance,
      because of the next generation TKIs(such as BIBW2992) are not avaliable at present, agents
      for met amplification(such as Crizotinib) are so expensive that many Chinese patients could
      not support. Thus, the investigators hypothesis that, after first line TKI treatment, the
      patients who developed TKI resistance could still benefit from second line TKI combined with
      chemotherapy.

      The investigators will enroll patients diagnosed with advanced non-squamous,non-small cell
      lung cancer, patients with EGFR TKI sensitive mutations and developed TKI resistance in first
      line treatment. After enrollment, the investigators will do biopsy again before second line
      treatment to find out the potential mechanism of TKI resistance, do EGFR mutation test for
      both sensitive and resistant mutation in exon 18, 19, 20 and 21; do KRAS, BRAF and PI3K
      mutation test, do FISH for MET and HER-2, the investigators do all these test to evaluated
      both primary and secondary resistance, the investigators do all these tests to get an
      overview for EGFR mutation status of each patient who develop TKI resistance. For second line
      treatment, patients will received a 28 days gemcitabine platinum combined with erlotinib
      scheme, after 4 cycle of combined chemotherapy, patients will receive erlotinib for further
      treatment until progression disease. For the patients who have stable brain metastases,
      combined chemotherapy should begin after local treatment, such as whole brain radiotherapy or
      sterotactic radiosurgery.

      the main endpoint of this study is mean PFS, second endpoints of this study consist of mean
      OS, 8 week ORR.
