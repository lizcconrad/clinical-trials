    <textblock>
      OMS302 is a mydriatic/anti-inflammatory combination investigational drug product being
      developed for use during intraoperative lens replacement (ILR). This study evaluates the
      effect of OMS302 on the signs of Floppy Iris Syndrome in subjects with a history of
      tamsulosin exposure who are undergoing ILR.

      <restrictive_agreement>The data resulting from the Study was to be made public by the sponsor at the end of the study after all results were available and analyzed, with a report on the study to have been prepared in consultation with the PI, rather than being published by the PI.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study had 2 parts. Part 1 evaluated the feasibility of the pupil measurement methodology in this patient population. The methodology was found not to be appropriate in this population. Therefore, part 2 of the study was not conducted.</limitations_and_caveats>
