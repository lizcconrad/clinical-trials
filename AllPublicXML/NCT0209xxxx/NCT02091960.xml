    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks through week 49, and then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression, initiation of new therapy or withdrawal of consent. The median duration of treatment was 70 days, and the maximum was 660 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate was defined as the percentage of evaluable participants with best objective response of confirmed complete response or partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, or prolonged stable disease (≥ 24 weeks).
Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions, and lymph nodes all &lt; 10 mm in short axis.
Partial response (PR) was defined as disappearance of target lesions or a ≥ 30% decrease in the size of target lesions, with persistence of non-target lesions and no new lesions.
Stable disease (SD) was defined as &lt; 30% decrease and &lt; 20% increase in the size of target lesions, persistence of non-target lesions, and no new lesions.
PR and CR required confirmation with equivalent or improved assessment no less than 4 weeks after the date that PR or CR was first observed. SD required confirmation with equivalent or improved assessment no less than 8 weeks after enrollment.</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks through week 49, and then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression, initiation of new therapy or withdrawal of consent. The median duration of treatment was 70 days, and the maximum was 660 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response was the best response across all time points, based on investigator assessments.
Best overall response rate was defined as the percentage of evaluable participants with a best objective response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at any time during the study per RECIST 1.1.
Complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions, and lymph nodes all &lt; 10 mm in short axis.
Partial response was defined as disappearance of target lesions or a ≥ 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with persistence of non-target lesions and no new lesions.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose date of study drug to 30 days after the last dose date of study drug or the start of subsequent treatment or date of death, whichever was first; median duration of treatment was 70 days, and the maximum was 660 days.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered study drug or who underwent study procedures and did not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An abnormality identified during a medical test was defined as an AE only if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, required active intervention, required interruption or discontinuation of study medication, or was clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.
An AE was defined as serious if it resulted in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Was life-threatening
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions
Congenital anomaly, or birth defect
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization
Other medically important event. Drug-related AEs were those assessed by the investigator as AEs whose relationship to the to the study drugs could not be ruled out.</description>

          <title>Anatomic Stage</title>
          <description>Breast cancer staging is based on size of the tumor, whether cancer cells have spread to lymph nodes or to other parts of the body, how aggressive the cells appear when viewed under a microscope, whether the cancer cells have receptors for estrogen and progesterone or have a gene mutation that causes them to make excess HER2 protein, and the results of gene expression profiling tests.
The stages of breast cancer range from 0 to IV, where Stage 0 is noninvasive or contained within the milk ducts and Stage IV breast cancer, also called metastatic, has spread to other areas of the body.</description>

Partial response (PR) was defined as disappearance of target lesions or a ≥ 30% decrease in the size of target lesions, with persistence of non-target lesions and no new lesions.
Stable disease (SD) was defined as &lt; 30% decrease and &lt; 20% increase in the size of target lesions, persistence of non-target lesions, and no new lesions.
PR and CR required confirmation with equivalent or improved assessment no less than 4 weeks after the date that PR or CR was first observed. SD required confirmation with equivalent or improved assessment no less than 8 weeks after enrollment.</description>
        <time_frame>Tumor assessments were performed every 8 weeks through week 49, and then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression, initiation of new therapy or withdrawal of consent. The median duration of treatment was 70 days, and the maximum was 660 days.</time_frame>

          <title>Best Overall Response Rate</title>
          <description>Best overall response was the best response across all time points, based on investigator assessments.
Best overall response rate was defined as the percentage of evaluable participants with a best objective response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at any time during the study per RECIST 1.1.
Complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions, and lymph nodes all &lt; 10 mm in short axis.
Partial response was defined as disappearance of target lesions or a ≥ 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with persistence of non-target lesions and no new lesions.
PR and CR required confirmation with equivalent or improved assessment no less than 4 weeks after the date of scan that PR or CR was first observed.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of first dose of enzalutamide until the date of disease progression per RECIST 1.1, or death from any cause on study, whichever occurred first. Participants who initiated another antitumor therapy before documented progressive disease (PD) or death, or who progressed or died after missing 2 or more consecutive radiological assessments were censored at the date of the last radiological assessment showing no progression.
Progressive disease was defined as a ≥ 20% increase in the size of target lesions and at least a 5 mm increase in size of target lesions from smallest size on study, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or any new lesions.</description>

An AE was defined as serious if it resulted in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Was life-threatening
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions
Congenital anomaly, or birth defect
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization
