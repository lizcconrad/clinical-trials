  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to analyze the perfusion (blood flow) characteristics of blood
      tumors. The investigators will be comparing the use of two contrast agents in this study.

    FDA safety concerns with repeated use of gadolinium-based contrast; subjects received
    additional dose of contrast with no direct clinical benefit

    <description>Calculations will be made of cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow or ktrans in brain tumors when different contrast agents are administered. These parameters reflect vasculature and angiogenesis in tumors.</description>

        Adults with brain tumors who have had a brain MRI ordered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with brain tumors will be enrolled. These subjects may be newly diagnosed,
             undergoing treatment or undergoing follow-up. If a subject has undergone surgery or
             treatment they should have what appears to be residual tumor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Renal failure (GFR &lt;45). Subjects will be screened utilizing UNMC gadolinium contrast
             guidelines.

          -  Allergic reactions to MRI contrast agents.

          -  Subjects who do not fit the criteria for the population we are evaluating.

          -  Subjects should not participate in this study if they have any of the following
             conditions:

               -  Anxiety attacks

               -  Panic disorder

               -  Claustrophobia

               -  Pregnant, or trying to become pregnant

               -  Breast feeding

          -  Subjects should not participate in this study if they have certain kinds of metal in
             their body, for example: a heart pacemaker, defibrillator, neurostimulator, a metal
             plate, certain otologic implants, certain types of heart valves, metal slivers in eye,
             brain aneurysm clips or metal slivers and bullet fragments in or near certain
             structures in their body. Our standard MRI safety screening will be performed on all
             subjects.

          -  If a subject has metal in their body that requires an additional x-ray beyond what is
             needed for the clinical MRI examination to safely perform the research MRI examination
             that subject would be excluded.Subjects not being able to return for a follow-up
             examination
