  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experiences of learning from paediatric physiotherapists were explored through
      unstructured interviews applying Colazzi's method to interpret the data. In this hermeneutic
      phenomenological study, six parents responsible for a physiotherapy home programme for their
      child were selected through convenience sampling. The purpose of this study was to obtain
      rich and valid information that could be analysed. The phenomenon of their learning
      experiences was formed and explored, its implications discussed and inferences made in light
      of current physiotherapy service delivery.
