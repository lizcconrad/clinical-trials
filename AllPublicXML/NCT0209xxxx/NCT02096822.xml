  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants undergo very frequent painful procedures during neonatal care particularly
      during the first few days. The support for the pain of the preterm is a priority for nurses
      and neonatologists. Previous studies showed that non-nutritive sucking combined with sucrose
      ensures effective pain-relief for preterm (28-32 weeks GA). Unfortunately, the use of sucrose
      is limited to 4 administrations per day which is insufficient compared to the average of
      daily painful procedures. So, validation of an effective non-pharmacological intervention to
      relieve or avoid pain is essential. Facilitated tucking alone has been validated for preterm
      less than 37 GA during heel stick procedure with the PIPP score but no study looks for the
      benefit for pain relief of the association of non-nutritive sucking and facilitated tucking
      during heel stick procedure.

      After randomization, baby will receive heel stick procedure with either non-nutritive sucking
      and sterile water or non-nutritive sucking and sterile water combined with facilited tucking.
      The sequence will be filmed. Evaluation of PIPP and DAN will be done after viewing by 3
      independent experts. Each child will receive only one procedure.
