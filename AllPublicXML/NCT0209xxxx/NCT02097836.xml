    <textblock>
      If a child with cerebral palsy does not develop independent sitting balance by 4 years of
      age, their prognosis for walking is very poor. Surprisingly little is known about how to
      facilitate head control or upright sitting balance and functional mobility in the child who
      is not developing these skills. This is one of the first studies that will examine
      intermediate stages in the development of the postural control system in children with
      neurologic deficits. Clinical researchers at The Movement Centre in Oswestry, England have
      developed a method called Targeted Training in which trunk control is trained in children
      segment by segment using a specific training device. This study aims to examine kinematic and
      electromyographic changes in a case series of children who undergo a 6-month Targeted
      Training intervention.

    <description>Custom training devices were imported from The Movement Centre for research purposes. The typical course of treatment involves loaning the customized equipment to each family for use in their home or in their child's educational setting. Training occurs once daily usually for 30-45 minutes. This is done 5 or 6 days per week. Training programs typically involve playing with balls or balloons or video games that motivate the child to hold the head erect and to wave the arms and hands and move the upper body.</description>
