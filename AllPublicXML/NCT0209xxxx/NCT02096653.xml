  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are attempting to determine whether intra- or
      extra-articular injections are more effective; the relative prevalence rate of
      intra-articular and extra-articular SI joint pain; and the accuracy of extra-articular
      injections using fluoroscopy as the reference standard. 124 consecutive patients with
      mechanical low back pain below L5, tenderness overlying the SI joint(s) and at least 3
      positive provocative maneuvers will be randomized to receive SI joint injections by 2
      different approaches.

      Group 1 will receive fluoroscopically-guided injections into the joint. Group 2 will receive
      landmark-guided injections into the tender area around the joint. In order to determine
      whether the injection in group 2 was intra-articular or extra-articular, an x-ray will be
      done after the injection to ascertain the location of contrast spread. The primary outcome
      measure will be pain relief at 1-month. Patients who obtain benefit at 1-month will be
      followed at 3-months, while those who fail to obtain benefit will exit the study to receive
      alternative care.

    <measure>Average Back Pain at 1 Month Measured Using the Numeric Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month from the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure compares the average back pain at baseline to the average back pain 1 month after the start of treatment. This is measured using the Numeric Pain Scale. The Numeric Pain Scale ranges from 0-10. 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst imaginable pain possible. The group receiving fluoroscopically-guided intra-articular injection is compared to the group receiving landmark-guided injections.</description>

    <description>Functional capacity measured using Oswestry disability index. The range of possible scores for Oswestry Disability Index are 0-100. 0 is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>
