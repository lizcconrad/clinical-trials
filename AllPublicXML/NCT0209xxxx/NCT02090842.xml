  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies demonstrated an inverse associations between cardiovascular events
      and milk and dairy product consumption. Evidence from human intervention studies suggests
      that both whey and casein may be effective in blood pressure-lowering, however there is
      limited data on the impact of milk proteins on vascular function. This research aims to
      compare the potential acute and chronic impacts of the two main milk proteins (whey and
      casein) with maltodextrin on blood pressure and vascular function. Furthermore, the effects
      of these proteins on the markers of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammatory
      status will also be investigated in 'at-risk' individuals.

      This research includes both an acute and chronic intervention study which have been
      independently powered on the appropriate outcome measures. This has generated different
      sample size requirements for the two studies (Actual participants on the acute study: n=27,
      and on the chronic study: n=38).
