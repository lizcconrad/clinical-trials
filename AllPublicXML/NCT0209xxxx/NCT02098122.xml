  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional recovery following SCI in adults is limited. Improvements in the quality of life
      of affected persons are associated with the recovery of functions that allow independent
      living, for example use of the arms and hands. Rehabilitative training has been shown to aid
      upper limb recovery. However, there are likely vast differences in the amount of time
      individuals spend actively training (during rehabilitation sessions in the clinic) and what
      they do in their non-training time (during daily life). The activity, or lack of, during the
      non-training period could interfere (positively or negatively), with the specific training in
      the rehabilitation session. However, there is little information available about this.

      Inertial measurement units are increasingly being used in human movement and rehabilitation
      research. The use of such technology is a promising approach to rapidly and discreetly
      collect objective movement information. The investigators plan to introduce a novel,
      long-term, activity sensor into clinical SCI rehabilitation. The investigators use this
      sensor to precisely measure movement of the upper limb over extended periods of time. Upper
      limb activity recordings from these sensors allow us to detail the amount and duration of
      activity during specific periods of upper limb rehabilitation and recovery.

      The investigators aim is to measure upper limb activity. The investigators aim to track
      changes in the activity of the upper limb during recovery and rehabilitation in patients with
      cervical SCI as well as collect reference values of upper limb activity in chronic sufferers.
      The recordings from this activity sensor will provide a more detailed understanding of how
      everyday upper limb activity contributes to functional recovery.

             function, i.e. plexus paresis.

          -  An orthopaedic or rheumatologic disease, e.g. osteoarthritis, which is expected to
