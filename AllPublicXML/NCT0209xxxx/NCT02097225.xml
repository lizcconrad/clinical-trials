      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of onalespib when given together
      with dabrafenib and trametinib in treating patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma or solid tumors
      that have spread to another place in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery.
      Onalespib, dabrafenib, and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and safety profile of onalespib
      (AT13387) given weekly in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with
      BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free
      survival (PFS) and document the 6-month PFS and 1-year overall survival (OS) of patients with
      BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable melanoma treated with AT13387 given weekly in
      combination with dabrafenib and trametinib.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and AT13387.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of onalespib.

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), trametinib PO once daily (QD) on
      days 1-28, and onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 6 months
      for up to 2 years.

             notable exception are endocrinopathies caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors that are
             appropriately treated with medical management (e.g. hormone replacement therapy,
             anti-diabetic agents)

             pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately

          -  Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of PT/INR by
             the site; exposure may be decreased due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus
             warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based upon PT/INR; consequently, when
             discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring
