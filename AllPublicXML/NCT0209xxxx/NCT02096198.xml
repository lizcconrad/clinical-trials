      This study is intended to gather medium (5- to 7-years) and long-term (minimum 8- to
      10-years) information regarding the performance and safety of the commercially available 36mm
      CERAMAX® Ceramic on Ceramic (COC) Total Hip System from a cohort of study subjects that were
      previously enrolled in the IDE study. (COC = 36mm ceramic acetabular bearing insert component
      that articulates with a ceramic femoral head in the COC total hip replacement system)

      Up to five (5) sites will participate. These sites participated in the IDE study and will
      continue subject follow-up.

      Subjects from the original IDE study (COC 36mm investigational subjects only) will be seen
      for a clinic visit at the time of consent (First visit at approximately 5 to 7 years post-op
      or 1825- 2919 days), and at minimum 8 years (2920-3649 days) , and minimum 10 years
      (3650-4015 days). Harris Hip evaluation, radiographic evaluation, subject hip-outcomes, and
      adverse event information will be collected at each visit.

      If a subject is not willing or able to return for a clinical and radiographic follow-up for
      either the minimum 8 year evaluation or the minimum 10 year evaluation, then a telephone
      interview may be utilized for the purpose of determining device survivorship.

    <measure>Harris Hip scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Harris Hip score means and Harris Hip sub-score means will be estimated at the First visit at 5-7 years (1825- 2919 days); Minimum 8-years (2920-3649 days); Minimum 10-years (3650-4015days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip score consists of five sub-scales: Pain, Function, Activities Deformity and Range of motion. The instrument is designed for completion by a clinician.</description>

    <measure>Subject Hip Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Subject Hip Outcomes will be estimated at the First visit at 5-7 years (1825- 2919 days); Minimum 8-years (2920-3649 days); Minimum 10-years (3650-4015days)</time_frame>
    <description>Subject Hip Outcomes is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that is designed for completion by the study subject. This hips outcomes self-assessment includes five (5) questions about subject satisfaction and hip function. The 5 questions relate to study subject function, pain, need for pain meds, satisfaction and their status (i.e., better, same or worse).
The percent of subjects who answer 'Yes' or 'Better' on each respective question will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic</measure>
    <time_frame>At first visit (5-7 years), at Minimum 8-years (2920-3649 days); Minimum 10-years (3650-4015 days)</time_frame>
    <description>At 5 to 7 years, at Minimum 8-years and at minimum 10-years, secondary radiographic outcome measures will include high quality antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of the operative hip, which will be obtained during the same postoperative follow-up intervals as for the clinical evaluations. At the first &quot;enrollment&quot; visit (5-7 years), an additional Cross-Table Lateral films will be collected to permit assessment of cup positioning.
Radiographic views will include:
AP Pelvis
AP femur
Lauenstein Lateral
Cross-Table Lateral (only at the first visit at 5-7 years)
As a single composite radiographic outcome, the percent of subjects with radiolucencies greater than 2 mm in any zone, acetabular cup migration greater than 4 mm, change in cup inclination greater than 4 degrees or osteolysis at the time of last radiographic assessment will be reported.</description>

    <description>Subjects who consent to participate in this trial have already had their index surgery for implantation of the study hip; however, potential adverse events may still occur and will be captured at each follow-up visit.</description>

    <description>The CERAMAX COC 36mm ceramic acetabular bearing insert component is manufactured from high purity, dense alumina matrix composite ceramic. The insert is available in several inner diameter sizes, including 36mm; only 36mm inserts will be utilized in this PAS. The inserts secure to DePuy's Pinnacle acetabular shells by means of an interlocking mechanical taper.</description>
