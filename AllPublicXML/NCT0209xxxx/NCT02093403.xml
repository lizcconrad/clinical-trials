    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Selinexor when given together
      with decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has returned after
      treatment (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as decitabine and Selinexor, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Selinexor (KPT‐330) in combination with
      decitabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To define the specific toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) of this combination.

      III. To determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of this combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR). II. To determine the rate and duration of
      complete remission (CR) +/- hematological recovery of KPT‐330 plus decitabine in AML.

      III. To conduct pharmacodynamic studies by measuring the effect of this chemotherapy
      combination on the kinome, micronome and epigenome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selinexor.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10 and
      Selinexor orally (PO) on days 11, 13, 18, 20, 25 and 27. Treatment repeats every 31 days for
      up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and Selinexor PO on days
      6, 8, 13, 15, 20 and 22. Courses repeat every 31 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
