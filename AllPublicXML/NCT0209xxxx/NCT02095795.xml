      The main objective of the present study was to compare the effects of exoskeleton devices
      used in electromechanical-assisted gait training after stroke compared to over ground
      conventional physical therapy in a single blind research.

      The second objective is to research when the devices can be used with the best chance of
      success in the functional recovery of gait in people who are unable to walk independently
      after stroke.

      Stroke is the leading cause of death and of serious long term disability in adults, three
      mouths after stroke, 20% of people remain wheelchair bound, and 70% walk at reduced velocity
      and capacity.

      People who suffer a stroke, when regain ambulatory function, walk with typically asymmetrical
      gait pattern, slow, and metabolically inefficient. These characteristics are associated with
      difficulty advancing and bearing weight though the more affected limb, leading to instability
      and increased risk of falls.

      Manually-assisted body-weight supported Treadmill training (BWSTT) is a contemporary approach
      to gait rehabilitation after stroke, whereas an individual walks on a treadmill, the
      therapists manually facilitate hemiparetic limb and trunk control in an effort to normalize
      upright reciprocal stepping and dynamic postural control. Advantages of this approach are
      that little to no ambulatory function is required to initiate locomotion and early post
      stroke training effects are transferred of improvements in over ground gait including:
      symmetry, speed, and endurance as well as motor impairment and balance scores.

      An example of electromechanical devices is Lokomat, a robotic gait orthosis combined with
      harness-supported body weight system is used together with a treadmill. However the main
      difference from treadmill training is that the patient's legs are guided by the robotic
      device according to a preprogrammed gait pattern. A computer-controlled robotic gait orthosis
      guides the patient, and the process of gait training in automated.

      Lokomat can be used to give non ambulatory patients intensive practice in terms of high
      repetitions, of complex gait cycles with a reduced effort for therapists, as they no longer
      need to set the paretic limbs or assist trunk movements.

      The main objective of the present study was to compare the effects of exoskeleton devices
      used in electromechanical-assisted gait training after stroke compared to over ground
      conventional physical therapy in a single blind research.

      The second objective is to research when the devices can be used with the best chance of
      success in the functional recovery of gait in people who are unable to walk independently
      after stroke.

    <description>All evaluation procedures are performed by the same examiner who was blinded to the aims of the study and to which group the participants are allocated.
The 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and 10 meters walking test are used to assess endurance and speed, respectively. The 6MWT quantifies functional mobility based on the distance in meters traveled in 6 minutes. This outcome is a measure of endurance and is particularly significant to evaluate the possibility to perform continuative tasks, that are particularly important for the rehabilitation of stroke patients and are relevant for an autonomous life.
The speed is quantified with the 10-meters Walk Test (TWT) over the ground. The gait speed measurement is performed over the middle six meters of the TWT and patients are asked to walk at their comfortable speed.</description>

    <description>Patients in the experimental group received a multimodal treatment intervention consisting of 60 minutes of conventional treatment according to the Bobath approach (Bobath B. Adult hemiplegia: evaluation and treatment. Oxford: Butterworth-Heineman, 1990) followed by 30 minutes of robotic gait training on the Lokomat robotic system with the supervision of an expert rehabilitator. Patients started the first session with 50% weight unload and 1.5 Km/h gait speed, performances increments are allowed only in the following sessions. Each patient received 20 sessions over a period of 4 weeks (5 sessions per week).</description>

    <description>The Lokomat (Hocoma, Zurich, Switzerland) is robotic device conformed as an exoskeleton on the lower limbs of the patient. Through active and passive actuators, it realize a proper trajectory with an associated motion profile of the involved limbs. The results are physically guide repetitive, rhythmic, bilateral lower extremity movements in order to simulate a physiological gait cycle.The system uses a dynamic body weight-support system to support the participant above a motorized treadmill synchronized with the Lokomat. Participants were provided verbal encouragement to actively step in conjunction with the movement presented by the Lokomat.</description>
