      Overall duration of this trial will be 3 years after approval of MFDS.

      Each subject will participate around 26 weeks, which include the 24 weeks treatment period
      and 2 weeks safety follow up period. Withdrawn subjects due to efficacy after 4 weeks
      treatment will participate in 6 weeks in total including 2 weeks safety follow up. Withdrawn
      subjects with other reason also have 2 weeks follow up period.

      A Multicenter, One group, Open-label Study. Cilostazol will be treated for additional 24
      weeks to the subject who had completed 021-KOA-1301i study. PletaalÒ(Cilostazol) is taken
      100mg oral tablets bid during 2 3weeks after dosing of PletaalÒ(Cilostazol) 50mg oral tablets
      bid during 1 week. The dose can be adjusted by investigator's discretion during the study and
      the detailed method is described in the Protocol. Subject who has 2 or more chest pain at 4th
      week will be withdrawn from the study (But, subjects who show 50% or more of chest pain
      decrease compared to 1st week would not be withdrawn.). Subjects who participated in this
      trial will have 2 weeks follow-up after study completion.
