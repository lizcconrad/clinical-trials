    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the retention rate of Abatacept SC over 24 months in
      routine clinical practice, in rheumatoid arthritis patients, in each country involved in the
      study. The purpose of the UK substudy is to explore whether integrating self-assessment into
      routine care could maintain tight control (of inflammation/disease activity) and at
      potentially lower cost resulting in improved health outcomes and cost-effectiveness.
