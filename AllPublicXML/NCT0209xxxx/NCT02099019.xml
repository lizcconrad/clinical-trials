      As the prospective, observational, cross-sectional study, the accuracy of CT
      angiography-based therapeutic decision-making for revascularization will be evaluated. The
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of CT angiography-based
      therapeutic decision-making for revascularization prior to conventional angiography whether
      CT angiography is an accurate non-invasive technique to determine the most appropriate
      therapeutic strategies.
