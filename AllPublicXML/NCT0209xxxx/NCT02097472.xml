    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of PATH-wSP, administered
      intramuscularly to healthy Kenyan adults and toddlers who have been primed with a
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).

      Additionally, the study will explore whether a measurable immune response is elicited when
      PATH-wSP is administered to healthy Kenyan adults and toddlers who have been primed with PCV.
