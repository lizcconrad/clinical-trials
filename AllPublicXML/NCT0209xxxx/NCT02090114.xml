  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, single site, open label study of the effects of parenteral testosterone followed
      by enzalutamide or abiraterone or castration-only therapy in men with metastatic CRPC who
      previously progressed on one of these forms of therapy. The study will enroll three cohorts
      of patients: men with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on enzalutamide (Cohort A); men
      with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on abiraterone acetate (Cohort B); and men with
      metastatic CRPC who have progressed on first line castration-only therapy (Cohort C).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will enroll up to 90 patients, 30 for each cohort. Eligible patients will continue
      on androgen ablative therapy with LHRH agonist (i.e. Zoladex, Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron) if
      not surgically castrated to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Patients will also
      receive intramuscular injection with either testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate
      at a dose of 400 mg every 28 days. This dosing scheme was designed to produce rapidly
      fluctuating serum testosterone levels from the supraphysiologic to the near-castrate range
      (i.e. Bipolar Androgen Therapy [BAT]). Assessments for response to testosterone will be made
      approximately every 3 months. Upon displaying evidence of progression, patients will then go
      on to receive either abiraterone or enzalutamide (whichever agent they had previously
      progressed on prior to study enrollment) or remain on LHRH agonist therapy and receive no
      additional androgen ablative hormonal therapy.
