  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached epidemic proportions and is rapidly
      becoming the one of most common causes of chronic liver disease in children. The pathogenesis
      of NAFLD is generally considered the result of a series of liver injuries, commonly referred
      as &quot;multi-hit&quot; hypothesis. Several studies suggest that inflammatory pathways and oxidative
      stress could be responsible of disease progression.

      The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Vitamin D in children and adolescents with biopsy-proven
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-six children or adolescents (4-16 years) with liver biopsy proven NAFLD will be
      enrolled. They will be randomized to treatment with DHA and Vitamin D (n=33) or an identical
      placebo (n=33) given orally for a period of 6 months. All patients will be included in a
      lifestyle intervention program consisting of a diet tailored on the individual requirements
      and physical exercise.

      Patients will undergo a medical evaluation at 3-6 and 12 months during the 12-months study
      period. Liver biopsy will be performed at baseline and at 12 months. Anthropometric
      measurements and laboratory tests, including liver enzymes, gluco-insulinemic profile and
      lipids will be performed at baseline and repeated at 6-12 months
