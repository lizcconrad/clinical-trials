    <measure>Incidence of Major Adverse Events That Occurred Within 30 Days Post-procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Major adverse events include Acute myocardial infarction; Death from progressive heart failure, death from aortic or peripheral artery disease, from renal failure and sudden cardiac death; New-onset heart failure; Stroke; Aortic or lower limb revascularization procedure; Lower limb amputation; Beginning dialysis; Hospital admission for hypertensive emergency unrelated to non-adherence or non-persistence with drugs at each follow up visit; Hospitalization for atrial fibrillation.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>These adverse events include renal artery stenosis (≥60% diameter reduction confirmed by MRI or renal angiography); peri-procedural renal artery dissection or perforation requiring intervention, serious arterial access site related complications requiring intervention or prolonging hospitalization; ≥25% reduction between baseline and 12 months in renal function measured by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), as well as composite of major adverse cardiovascular and/or renal events.</description>

    <description>Office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measures were summarized to assess the reduction in blood pressure from baseline visit to post baseline at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Negative values for change represent reductions.</description>

             pressure readings measured according to the BP guidelines.

          2. Subject is adhering to a stable drug regimen of at least 3 different classes of
             anti-hypertensive medications, including a diuretic (with no changes for a minimum of
             2 weeks prior to enrollment) at optimal dose and is expected to be maintained for at
             least 6 months.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

             investigational device(s).

          3. Subject has main renal arteries that are &lt; 20 mm in length or &lt; 4 mm in diameter.

          4. Subject has a prior history of any renal artery intervention including but not limited
             to balloon angioplasty, stenting, renal denervation or surgery.

          5. Subject has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt; 45mL/min/1.73m2, using
