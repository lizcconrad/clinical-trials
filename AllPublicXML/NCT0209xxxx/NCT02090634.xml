  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for successful HIV viral
      suppression. Nonadherence to ART poses several potentially serious health consequences,
      including higher viral loads, faster progression to AIDS, and a heightened risk of viral
      mutations, treatment resistance and HIV transmission.

      The prevalence of serious mental illness (SMI) conditions, including bipolar disorder (BD),
      is elevated among HIV-infected populations and is associated with poor ART adherence.
      HIV-infected individuals with co-occurring BD (HIV+/BD+), when compared to demographically
      similar HIV+/BD- persons, demonstrated poorer ART and psychotropic medication adherence and
      were twice as likely to be non adherent to their ART regimen using a â‰¥ 90% cutoff score.
      HIV+/BD+ individuals are particularly at-risk for medication non adherence, and there is a
      critical need to develop interventions to improve adherence in this population.

      Poor psychotropic medication adherence is also common among people with SMI - it has been
      estimated that 40% of those with BD do not take their mood stabilizer as prescribed. Among
      persons with BD, nonadherence to psychotropic medications can lead to greater risk for manic
      and depressive episodes, decreased quality of life, suicide attempts, and hospitalization.

      The utilization of mobile health (i.e., mHealth) technologies to improve everyday functioning
      is growing. mHealth interventions capitalize on technology already incorporated into most
      people's daily lives (e.g., cell phones) to assist people with behavior modification and
      disease self-management. Text messaging, in particular, may support daily ART adherence by
      delivering reminders at precise times to match an individuals' dosing schedule. The initial
      evidence for using text messaging to improve ART medication adherence has been compelling.
      Researchers and clinicians have also started employing technology-based approaches to improve
      treatment for individuals with BD.

      Taken together, a distinct need for RCTs utilizing text messaging to improve medication
      adherence within an at-risk HIV population is warranted. Individualized Texting for Adherence
      Building (iTAB) is one such intervention.

      The investigators propose an intervention development study designed to address these
      potential mechanisms of nonadherence with the following Specific Aims: 1) To further develop
      and refine a personalized, automated, real-time, mobile phone, text messaging intervention
      (iTAB) designed to improve adherence to ART and psychotropic medications among HIV+/BD+
      persons; 2) To evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a brief psychoeducation plus
      text messaging intervention (iTAB) as compared to psychoeducation alone (CTRL) for the
      improvement of objectively measured medication adherence among HIV+/BD+ persons; and 3) To
      examine predictors of within-person trajectories of nonadherence using the longitudinal data
      collected over the study. In order to realize these aims, the investigators will leverage the
      infrastructure of two unique UCSD resources increasing likelihood of study success, impact,
      and innovation: 1) the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP), which encompasses
      multiple NIH-funded studies that focus on the effects of HIV infection, and 2) the California
      Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), which conducts research
      on state-of-the-art wireless means of health promotion. Initially, the investigators will
      refine the iTAB intervention to ensure that it is user-centered and tailored to the needs of
      HIV+/BD+ persons via focus groups and rapid prototyping. Once refined, the proposed iTAB
      intervention will use text messages that are automated, scalable, personalized, interactive,
      flexible, and motivating. The investigators will assess the acceptability and effectiveness
      of iTAB in improving objectively measured adherence (i.e., MEMS caps) over a 4-week period
      via a pilot RCT with 25 HIV+/BD+ assigned to the iTAB intervention and 25 HIV+/BD+ assigned
      to a psychoeducational control. Predictors of nonadherence including neuropsychological
      impairment, and mood will be examined to determine whether iTAB is better able to compensate
      for these factors associated with nonadherence as compared to CTRL. Further refinement to the
      iTAB intervention will be made in order to pursue a large-scale R01 using the investigators
      tailored intervention.
