      20 patients having received an AO large external fixator at the tibia will be equipped with a
      data logger device (AO Fracture Monitor) attached post-operation to a connection rod of the
      external fixator. The device continuously measures deformation of the fixator frame due to
      weight bearing for up to 6 months by means of a strain gauge. Several parameters are
      calculated from the recorded change in the strain signal and are stored at a regular
      interval.

      Maturation of fracture callus leads to unloading of the fracture fixation hardware due to an
      increased load-share of the repair tissue. A novel data logger device (AO Fracture Monitor)
      continuously measures the decline in fixation hardware deflection under physiological loading
      as indirect indicator for the healing progress. Parameters obtained from the data logger
      device carry potential to significantly improve the assessment of fracture healing in the
      future. Meaningful interpretation of measurements requires a set of clinical reference data.

      20 patients having received an AO large external fixator at the tibia will be equipped with a
      data logger device (AO Fracture Monitor) attached post-operation to a connection rod of the
      external fixator. The device continuously measures deformation of the fixator frame due to
      weight bearing for up to 4 months by means of a strain gauge. Several parameters are
      calculated from the recorded change in the strain signal and are stored at a regular
      interval. Data is collected from the AO Fracture Monitor at follow-up visits of the patient
      by wireless data transfer. Together with additional variables such as treatment details,
      fracture healing and pain reported by the patient, the collected data is used to build up a
      database. Data from the AO Fracture Monitor will be correlated with patient data to
      investigate the relevance and reliability of the data derived from the AO Fracture Monitor.

      In this phase, the study does not imply changes on the operational treatment, nor does it
      allow for therapeutic consequences based on the derived data.

    <description>Two reference deformation values are measured under a load 20 kg and 30 kg respectively. The patient steps with his injured leg on a bathroom scale and loads it first with the reference load of 20 kg. The investigator then starts the measurement of the corresponding deformation value. After an acoustic signal indicates the end of the measurement, the procedure is repeated with a reference load of 30 kg. If the patient is not able to put the required load on his leg (e.g. due to pain), the reference value should be measured at a lower load with a note of the actually applied load in the patient record.</description>

    <description>The Radiographic Union Score for Tibial fractures (RUST score) is a reliable score to assess the healing of tibial fractures. Each of the four cortices (anterior, posterior, medial and lateral) is given a value from 1 to 3, depending on the presence of a callus and the visibility of the fracture line. The sum of the individual cortical scores results in a RUST value between 4 (definitely not healed) to 12 (definitely healed).
To investigate, whether patient activity as measured by the AO Fracture Monitor correlate with the radiological assessed course of healing.</description>
