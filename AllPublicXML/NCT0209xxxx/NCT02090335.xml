  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project, which has not changed, is to improve the health and fitness of
      persons with serious mental illness (SMI) using an innovative model: In SHAPE Lifestyles.
      Participants are randomly assigned to the In SHAPE program or Health Club Membership and
      Education only.

      The three specific aims of this study are to:

        1. To compare the treatment groups with respect to improvement in physical fitness
           outcomes, including: (a) health behaviors (engagement in exercise and diet changes); and
           (b) indicators of physical fitness.

        2. To compare the treatment groups with respect to improvements in mental health outcomes,
           including negative symptoms, depression, and self-efficacy.

        3. To explore differences in the treatment groups with respect to psychosocial functioning,
           health status, and acute service use, and the effects of selected demographic, clinical,
           and health behavior variables on primary outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Individuals with SMI die 10-25 years earlier than the general population and have
      disproportionately greater rates of medical comorbidity and disability associated with high
      rates of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and poor dietary habits. Despite
      greater costs and adverse outcomes associated with the combination of mental illness and poor
      physical health, little attention has been paid to the development of health promotion
      interventions designed to address the needs of the high-risk group of people with SMI. This
      study is testing an innovative approach to reducing these problems and developing a program
      that will potentially have a downstream effect on early mortality for the vulnerable
      population of people with SMI.
