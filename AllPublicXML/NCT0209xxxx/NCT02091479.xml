      In patients with a high thromboembolic risk, withdrawing anticoagulant treatment is
      recommended in some situations, including when major hæmorrhage occurs. But withdrawing
      treatment can be risky. In patients on a curative dose of anticoagulant medicine, treatment
      withdrawal heightens the risk of thromboembolic events occurring, with potentially major
      consequences. For instance, mechanical valve thrombosis is fatal in 15% of patients.
      Resumption of anticoagulation is therefore critical in patients at high risk for
      thromboembolic events.

      However, in these patients having presented major hæmorrhage, resumption of anticoagulation
      heightens the risk of hæmorrhage recurrence. This risk is even higher when the original
      hæmorrhage was not accessible via surgical, endoscopic or endoluminal hemostasis.

      As far as investigators know, there is no data in the literature to rely on when the major
      hæmorrhage is not accessible via hemostatic intervention and the risk of thrombosis is high.
      When confronted with patients who need anticoagulation but have a high risk of hæmorrhage
      recurrence, the question of when treatment should be resumed has not been resolved. This is
      why investigators propose to conduct a randomised comparative study to evaluate two treatment
      strategies - early resumption (H48 to H72) versus late resumption (H120 to H144) of
      anticoagulation.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the present study is to evaluate in terms of bleeding
      risk, thrombosis risk and mortality at one month, the effect of early vs. late resumption of
      anticoagulation in patients having presented with serious hæmorrhage while on curative-dose
      anticoagulants and facing a high thromboembolic risk.

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a comparative, randomised, open study assessing after 1 month and 3
      months the effect of early (H48 to 72) versus late (H120 to 144) resumption of
      anticoagulation in patients presenting with serious bleeding while on anticoagulants
      (excluding intracerebral bleeding) and with a thromboembolic risk evaluated as high (except
      mitral prostheses). The accumulated frequency of major hæmorrhage, thromboembolic events and
      deaths should be 26% in case of early resumption and 15% in case of late resumption, i.e. a
      relative risk reduction of 43%. Based on this hypothesis, to obtain 80% power with two-sided
      α being 5%, each group should include 208 patients, for a total of 416 patients.

      EVALUATION CRITERIA: The main criteria in this study will be the accumulated one-month
      incidence of hæmorrhage recurrence, thromboembolic complications and deaths. It is a combined
      criterion associating:

        -  Fatal hæmorrhage proven by autopsy or sudden deaths in a clinical context strongly
           suggestive of hæmorrhage

        -  Fatal thromboembolic events proven by autopsy or imagery or sudden deaths in a clinical
           context strongly suggestive of thrombosis

        -  Any clinically significant hæmorrhage leading to temporary (&gt; 24 hours) or permanent
           withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment

        -  Any symptomatic thromboembolic event in any territory, proven by imagery or surgery

      These events will be validated by a committee for the validation of critical events blind to
      the date of anticoagulant treatment resumption. The secondary evaluation criteria will be
      symptomatic hæmorrhages, fatal or not, symptomatic thromboembolic incidents, fatal or not,
      and mortality at 1 month and 3 mont
