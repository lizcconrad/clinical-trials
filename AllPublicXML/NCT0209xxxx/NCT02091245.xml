  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves participants who have acute lymphoblastic or acute myelogenous
      leukemia that has relapsed or has become resistant (or refractory) to standard therapies.
      This research study is evaluating a drug called KPT-330. Laboratory and other studies suggest
      that the study drug, KPT-330, may prevent leukemia cells from growing and may lead to the
      destruction of leukemia cells. It is thought that KPT-330 activates cellular processes that
      increase the death of leukemia cells. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the side
      effects of KPT-330 when it is administered to children and adolescents with relapsed or
      refractory leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to determine a safe dose of KPT-330 and will be giving
      participants different dose levels of the study drug. Three to six participants will receive
      the starting dose of the drug. If the side effects are not too severe, the next group of
      participants will take the study drug at a higher dose level. Up to 3 dose levels of the
      study drug will be tested, but once each participant has been assigned a dose level, the
      participant will always receive the same dose. The highest dose that people can be given
      safely is called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the MTD is determined, up to 10
      additional participants will receive that dose to further study the drug.

      Participants between the age of ≥18 months (540 days) and ≤ 21 years with relapsed (second or
      subsequent relapse) or refractory ALL or AML will be eligible to enroll. KPT-330 will be
      administered twice a week on Days 1 and 3 for four weeks (a cycle is 4 weeks). All
      participants will receive intrathecal chemotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle. Participants with
      CNS-2 disease will receive additional doses of IT chemo. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be
      collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1-3 and 15. PK samples will be collected during Cycle 2 on
      Day 15. Pharmacodynamic (PD) samples will be collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1-3. PD samples
      will be collected during Cycle 2 on Day 15. Additional optional correlative biology sample
      will be collected. Participants are monitored closely for adverse events. Participants will
      have physical exams and blood work more than once a week during all cycles.

          -  The effects of KPT-330 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because many chemotherapeutic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant

             immediately.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy (other than acute leukemia) are
