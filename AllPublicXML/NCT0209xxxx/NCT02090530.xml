      This study supports the collection of tumor specimens for CLIA-certified genomic testing and
      research testing in parallel. CLIA-certified tests have established measurements of accuracy
      and precision which allow for return of results. This study does not involve treatment, only
      testing, which could be used to meet eligibility criteria in other trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer

          2. Patients with any malignancy.

          3. Patients must have tumor suitable for research tumor biopsy (as assessed by trained
             specialists in interventional radiology) and Patients are medically fit to undergo a
             tissue biopsy or surgical procedure to get tumor tissue OR If Patients do not have a
             tumor suitable for biopsy but have another tissue available for molecular evaluation.

             OR Patients are undergoing standard of care surgeries or procedures where fresh
             specimens will be first used for routine pathologic assessment and only then will
             leftover tissue be used for research purposes.

          4. Procedure-specific signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-related
             procedures.

          5. Women and minorities are included in this protocol.

          6. Patients with multiple malignancies remain eligible.

          7. Patients with an inherited cancer syndrome or a medical history suggestive of an
             inherited cancer syndrome remain eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. It is the enrolling study physicians discretion to decide if a patient is not fit
             enough to undergo tissue biopsy.

          2. Patients who are incarcerated are not eligible to participate.
