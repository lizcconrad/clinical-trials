      Project aim: To compare the effectiveness and acceptability of a conventional and a religious
      internet-supported cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) for depression in Romania.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggest that incorporating religious beliefs into conventional CBT appears
      to be helpful for religious individuals. In order to have two active comparable interventions
      the investigators added to the conventional CBT a similar set of exercises devised from the
      positive psychology paradigm.

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Absolute values (average score) of Back Depression Inventory-II at 11 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was designed to measure participant's level of depression. The scale is unidimensional and the total score rages from 0 to 63. Low scores are associated with low levels of depression, while high scores are associated with high levels of depression.
This represents the post-intervention assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>Absolute values (average score) of BDI-II at 37 weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was designed to measure participant's level of depression. The scale is unidimensional and the total score rages from 0 to 63. Low scores are associated with low levels of depression, while high scores are associated with high levels of depression.
This represents the measure of depression at 6 month after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Absolute values (average score) of QOLI at 11 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI) is an established rating scale of self-perceived quality of life across 16 domains. The scale is unidimensional and the total score rages from -6 to +6. Low scores are associated with low self-perceived life quality, while high scores are associated with high self-perceived life quality.
This represents the post-intervention assessment.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Absolute values (average score) of QIDS-SR after 11 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR) was designed to measure participant's level of depression. The scale is unidimensional and the total score rages from 0 to 27. Low scores are associated with low levels of depression, while high scores are associated with high levels of depression.
This represents a secondary outcome measure for depression taken immediately after the intervention.</description>

        <title>Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was designed to measure participant’s level of depression. The scale is unidimensional and the total score rages from 0 to 63. Low scores are associated with low levels of depression, while high scores are associated with high levels of depression.
This represents the measure of depression at 6 month after the intervention.</description>

        <population>Only 10 participants from the C-CBT and 9 participants from the R-CBT completed the follow-up assessment questionnaires. Participants from the Wailt-List Control Group were lost at follow-up.</population>
