  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of consumption of a novel food supplement
      consisting of Canola Oil, Fibre and DHA, containing the most effective food bioactives,
      including n-3 fatty acid enriched dietary oil high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and
      soluble dietary fibre, aiming at the management of heart disease risk factors in people with
      metabolic syndrome and to test its efficacy and safety in humans.

      The proposed study is a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial, it will be conducted at
      the Richardson Centre for Functional Food and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN), University of Manitoba.
      The study design will consist of 4 phases with 30 days per phase, each phase will be
      separated by 4-week washout periods. Participants will consume a recommended
      weight-maintaining diet (35% energy from fat, 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein) supplemented
      with the following novel Muffin and cookies: (a) control food containing butter, sunflower
      and safflower oil comprised largely of saturated fat with substantial levels of n-6 linoleic
      acid, and refined wheat flour common to current North American intakes, (b) food containing
      high oleic canola oil and docosahexaenoic acid (HOCO-DHA) and refined wheat flour, (c) food
      containing high molecular weight barley B-glucan and a combination of sunflower, safflower
      oil and butter, (d) food containing combination of HOCO-DHA and high molecular weight barley
      β-glucan. Treatments will be isocalorically incorporated into muffin and cookies consumed in
      equal parts at breakfast and supper.

    <description>Participants will be asked to consume deuterium oxide (D2O) at the end of each phase. In addition, on day 29 a fasting baseline blood sample is taken prior to administration of an oral dose of D2O as tracer to measure fractional cholesterol synthesis. Fasting blood samples will be obtained 24 h following the tracer dose on day 30.</description>

    <time_frame>Blood samples will be collected at the start and end of each of the four 4-week treatment phases over a period of seven months</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma and RBC total lipids will be extracted using the Folch method involving chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 0·01% BHT and heptadecanoic acid as an internal standard. Extracted fatty acids will be methylated with methanolic HCl. Fatty acid methyl esters will be separated on a Supelcowax 10 column using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector .</description>
