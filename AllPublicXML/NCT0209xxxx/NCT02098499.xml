  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haloperidol is known to be a safe alternative medication to control difficult pain, and has
      been shown effective when compared to placebo for controlling headaches. Investigators
      hypothesized that the combination of haloperidol and diphenhydramine would be a useful
      medication choice for migraine headache patients in the emergency department in comparison to
      a common migraine treatment regimen of metoclopramide and diphenhydramine.

      Investigators conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in migraine
      patients who presented to an academic emergency department between June 2013 and November
      2013. Research data was derived from an IRB approved protocol. All subjects met IHS migraine
      criteria and received a one liter bolus of normal saline plus 25 milligrams (mg) of
      diphenhydramine. Subjects were subsequently randomized to receive 10 mg metoclopramide or 5
      mg haloperidol IV. Pain was self-reported at onset and at 20 minute intervals using a 100mm
      visual analog scale (VAS). Adequate pain control was considered to be patient satisfaction
      with symptomatic relief. If adequate pain relief was not obtained after 80 minutes, rescue
      medication was given at the treating physician's discretion. Adverse reactions were recorded
      and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained before and after study medication administration.
      Follow up phone surveys were performed 72 hours after discharge to assess headache
      recurrence, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction.
