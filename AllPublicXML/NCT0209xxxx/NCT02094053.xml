    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative study and open-label
      extension study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of E2020 in subjects with Down syndrome
      having regression symptoms and disabled activities of daily living.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose (two doses),
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative study followed by an open-label extension
      study of E2020 in subjects with Down syndrome having regression and disabled ADL. A total of
      60 subjects will be randomized to one of three dosing groups (at 1:1:1) to receive 3 mg of
      E2020, 5 mg of E2020, or placebo for 24 weeks based on their total scores of Body
      Functionality Checklist, sex, and study site as the allocation factors. This study consists
      of Pre-randomization Phase (4 weeks), Double-blind Phase (28 weeks), and Extension Phase (24
      weeks). The Double-blind Phase includes a 24-week treatment period plus a 4-week transition
      period.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>For the changes in a total score of Body Functionality Checklist (51 items) from Week 0 of the treatment period, Kruskal-Wallis test will be performed in the 3 mg group, the 5 mg group and placebo group to represent statistical significance. Summary statistics of the total score of Body Functionality Checklist (51 items) at each evaluation time and changes from before study drug administration in the treatment period will be calculated by dose group.</description>

    <measure>Safety of E2020 and placebo in subjects with Down syndrome having regression and disabled ADL.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The safety will be measured by frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the treatment period, statistics of laboratory parameters, blood pressure, and pulse rate at each evaluation time and changes from before study drug administration, and 12-lead ECG assessment, frequency distribution (yes/no) at each evaluation time will be collected and the percent (%) will be calculated by dose group.</description>

    <description>Population PK analysis will be performed to build PK models to explain plasma donepezil hydrochloride concentration data. In addition, the models may be used to explore relationship of PK data with demographics, efficacy, and AEs.</description>
