  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the two most established
      primary treatments for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer: radical retropubic
      prostatectomy, and external-beam radiotherapy. The primary aim is assessing biochemical
      disease-free survival, overall survival, and prostate cancer-specific survival. As secondary
      objectives quality of Life impact of treatments' side effects will be also assessed.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients had clinically localized (clinical TNM classification T1 or T2),
      biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate and were randomly treated with RRP or EBRT.
      Exclusion criteria included prior treatment for prostate cancer, the presence of metastatic
      disease on imaging studies, the receipt of neoadjuvant androgen ablation before registration,
      and an inability to read or understand Italian language. The institutional review boards of
      every participating centre approved the study design. Every patient enrolled signed an
      informed-consent form approved by the institutional review boards. Clinical information
      collected from the medical record included pre-treatment serum prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) level, clinical T classification, and biopsy Gleason score. Follow-up assessments were
      completed before treatment and every 3 months after treatment. Subjects who sought primary
      treatment elsewhere or did not return follow-up questionnaires beyond the initial assessment
      were excluded from this analysis.

    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who are free of biochemical relapse after a specified duration of time. Biochemical recurrence is measured by PSA levels. The definition of biochemical recurrence was based on a review of the literature and consideration of clinical practice in the year 1997. Biochemical recurrence among patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) was defined as a measurable serum PSA concentration 0.2 ng/ml or greater. The American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) criteria were used to define progression after radiation therapy. The ASTRO consensus definition specifies progression as 3 consecutive increases in serum PSA documented at intervals of 6 or more months.</description>

    <measure>•Perceived general health measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36).</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) version 2 contains 36 items covering eight dimensions: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health. For each dimension, a score ranges from 0-100 (higher score indicate better health).Physical and mental component summaries are constructed, using recommended scoring algorithms. Summary scores are standardized to have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 in the general population.</description>

    <measure>•Cancer specific Quality of Life measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General and Prostate specific - (FACT-G and FACT-P, respectively).</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) version 4.0 was designed to measure Quality of Life in cancer patients. It consists of 27 items in 4 dimensions measuring Physical, Social/familial, Emotional, and Functional well-being. The Prostate module (FACT-P) is specific for patients with prostate cancer and contains 12 questions about urinary symptoms, and bowel and sexual function. Scores range from 0 to 108 on the FACT-G, and from 0 to 48 on the FACT-P, with 0 representing perfect health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>•Urinary symptoms measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was developed to assess the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms associated to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and has also been applied to other conditions that cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The IPSS consists of a total of seven questions that deal with voiding symptoms (incomplete empty, intermittency, weak stream and straining to void) and storage symptoms (frequency, urgency and nocturia) and an additional question to measure quality of life. The score ranges from 0 to 35, with lower scores denoting a better health state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>•Sexual symptoms measured by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIES).</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIES) is a 15-item, self-administered questionnaire scale for the assessment of erectile function. Scores range from 5 to 75, with higher scores denoting a better sexual function.</description>

    <description>The surgery arm underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy, performed by a technique described by Walsh.surgery started with dissection of the pelvic lymph nodes. If there were no signs of metastasis in frozen sections, the operation was continued with retropubic radical prostatectomy. The prostatectomy is performed in retrograde way, preserving the neurovascular bundles if feasible. The degree to which the surgeon preserve the nerves is categorized as non-nerve-sparing, unilateral nerve-sparing, or bilateral nerve-sparing.The operative time is about 2 to 3 hours and required hospital stay. The patient has a urinary catheter placed for 6 to 9 days to facilitate bladder emptying.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>External beam radiotherapy is carried out with intensity-modulated radiation technique. The treatment is designed to maximize the radiation dose to the prostate and seminal vesicles and minimize exposure to surrounding structures, including the bladder and rectum. Radiation to the prostate was delivered in fractionated doses divided over multiple treatments (180 to 200 centigray (cGy) daily fractions, 5 days per week) for a total dose to the prostate of 68 to 77 gray (Gy), prescribed at 90% to 100% of the isodose line.</description>
