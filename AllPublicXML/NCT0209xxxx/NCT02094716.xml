  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine and compare the safety and efficacy of permethrin foam 4% and permethrin foam 5%
      with that of vehicle in subjects with scabies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that a majority of subjects will require and receive a single treatment;
      however, those subjects not showing improvement at the follow-up visit 2 weeks after initial
      treatment will be treated a second time. Those subjects originally assigned to vehicle for
      the first treatment will receive a &quot;re-treatment&quot; with one of the active doses.

    <description>The primary efficacy variable is &quot;treatment success&quot;. In protocol v2.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In protocol v3.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an &quot;eradication of infestation&quot;: a) no burrows, b) a reduction in the Signs/Symptoms, and c) no evidence of a live mite on microscopy.</description>

    <description>The change in the signs/symptoms related to the condition in each treatment group at Days 14 and 28, as well as at Day 42 for those subjects provided with re-treatment at Day 14 who show improvement in their IGA score at Day 28.</description>

    <description>The proportion of subjects designated as &quot;treatment success&quot; (see definitions above) following one treatment versus two treatments.
