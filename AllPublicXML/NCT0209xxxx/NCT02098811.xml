      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of a
      non-invasive 1064nm laser and 940nm diode, for the disruption of subcutaneous adipose tissue
      and skin tightening.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-smoking subjects between ages of 20-55 years of age presenting excess abdominal
             tissue (fat and skin), are candidates for an abdominoplasty procedure and are willing
             to allow the use of this device on their skin

          -  Subjects (Group 2 and 3) who will allow the excess skin removed as part of the
             abdominoplasty to be sent for laboratory analysis

          -  Understand and accept the obligation associated with the procedure

          -  Subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I to VI.

          -  Subjects (Group 2 and 3) who are willing to consent to participate in the study will
             be asked to undergo treatment, elasticity and ultrasound measurements, as outlined for
             each group and defined in section 6.0.

          -  Subjects must agree to maintain the same diet and exercise regime throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous liposuction/lipo-sculpture or any type of procedure in the abdominal area
             in the past 6 months

          -  A history of allergic reactions to medications or anesthesia required for the
             procedure

          -  A history of thrombophlebitis

          -  A history of acute infections

          -  A history of heart failure

          -  Received or is anticipated to receive antiplatelets, anticoagulants, thrombolytics,
             vitamin E or anti-inflammatories within 2 weeks pre treatment

          -  Intolerance to anesthesia or medications to be prescribed before or after the
             procedure.

          -  Any medical condition, that, in the investigator's opinion would interfere with the
             patient's participation in the study

          -  Taking medications that are photosensitive

          -  A history of keloid formation

          -  A study subject must not be pregnant or have been pregnant in the last 3 months

          -  The physician has the right to make determination of eligibility as he/she determines
             based on the standard of care
