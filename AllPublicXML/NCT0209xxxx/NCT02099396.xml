    <textblock>
      The purpose was to evaluate efficacy, safety and effects on survival for lobaplatin and
      Gemcitabine in combination with Docetaxel, which can provide a kind of completely new
      second-line chemotherapy program for osteosarcoma patients in aggressive-phase, provide
      accurate and reliable evidence-based results for clinical applications of lobaplatin in
      osteosarcoma patients as one of the third-generation of platinum drugs, and further
      consummate and enrich clinical practice guidance on osteosarcoma all over the world.

    <description>Objective remission rate (ORR): it refers to the percentage of patients for whom tumors decrease to certain sizes and maintain for a period, including CR and PR cases. The criteria for evaluations on therapeutic efficacy are divided into complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression of disease (PD) according to the RECIST criteria (please refer to attachment 1 for details).</description>
