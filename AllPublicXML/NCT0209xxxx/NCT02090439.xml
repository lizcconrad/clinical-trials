  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the diagnosis of renal colic gallstone , in addition to clinical and biological factors,
      it is a key : medical imaging. Currently , the French recommendations require at least a
      couple of Abdomen radiography Without Preparation lying face (ASP ) associated with abdominal
      ultrasound . &quot;The abdominopelvic CT scan without injection of contrast is the examination of
      choice.

      Current recommendations in the management of gallstone colic simply based on the joint use of
      analgesics , anti inflammatory drugs and control of water intake .

      The mechanism of analgesic action of this treatment is a decrease in the pressure in the
      cavities by decrease in diuresis and inflammation treatment of ureteral permitting passage of
      urine . )

      The expulsive medical therapy remains under evaluation. The French Association of Urology
      does not recommend at this time for lack of evidence deemed sufficient.

      For foreign companies Urology (EAU , AUA) , the use of calcium channel blockers or alpha
      blockers in the treatment of symptomatic lower ureteral stones (4 to 10mm ) is recommended
      (grade 1A) . However, there are less formal studies of their effectiveness .

      Investigators wish to demonstrate the effectiveness of alpha in medical expulsive therapy for
      pelvic stones 4 to 10mm .
