    <measure>Change in Quality of caregiver-child interactions from baseline at 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>We are using the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Teaching Scales to assess quality of caregiver-child interactions. Caregivers select an activity that their child cannot perform, such as drawing, and spend up to 5 minutes teaching this activity to the child. The interaction is video-recorded and coded for the caregiver's sensitivity to cues, response to distress, and fostering of social, emotional, and cognitive growth, as well as for the child's clarity of cues and responsiveness to the caregiver.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver helplessness from baseline at 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver helplessness is measured by the Caregiving Helplessness Questionnaire, comprising 45 items specific to interactions with the child. We evaluate 2 subscales for this study: Mother-Child Frightened and Mother Helplessness (&quot;mother&quot; is changed to &quot;caregiver&quot;)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver stress from baseline at 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver stress is measured by the Parenting Stress Index/Short Form, a 36-item questionnaire with 3 subscales: caregiver distress, caregiver-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow ups</time_frame>

    <description>The intervention consists of delivering the Promoting First Relationship (PFR) program. PFR comprises 10 sessions and lasts approximately 12 weeks. Each session lasts approximately 30 minutes, and begins with brief (~10 min) discussions and education on the target topic for that week . The remaining 20 minutes will alternate between video recording a structured interaction between the caregiver and child or viewing the previous session's recording and engaging in reflective discussion about successful caregiving strategies and child's response to caregiver behavior. Trained PFR specialists who are community members use the 5 &quot;consultation strategies,&quot; labeled Joining, Positive Feedback, Instructive Feedback, Reflective Questions and Comments, and Instruction with Handouts.</description>
