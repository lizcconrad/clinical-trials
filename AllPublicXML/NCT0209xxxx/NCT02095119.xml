    <textblock>
      The following is an open label, non comparative, pilot study of palliative treatment as a
      second, third line or more of treatment in patients with recurrent, persistent or Metastatic
      Cervical Cancer; it has a limited sample of 15 patients with the primary goal of evaluating
      the response (defined as: Complete, partial or stable disease) to treatment with a Monoclonal
      Antibody, Nimotuzumab, on a weekly basis + CDDP 50mg/m2/BSA as a single agent every 3 weeks
      for patients with good renal function (Creatinine clearance =&gt; 60) or Gemcitabine 800
      mg/m2/BSA in patients with renal failure (Creatinine clearance &lt;60).

      Secondary objectives consist of evaluating disease-free survival, overall survival and assess
      patient tolerance to treatment with Nimotuzumab.

    <description>Treatment response will be evaluated according to the new International Criteria from Response Evaluation Committee in Solid Tumors (RESIST). Antitumoral response will be evaluated from patient´s inclusion after 4 weeks of induction therapy and then every 3 months until second year of follow up for each patient.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>After patient´s inclusion every 3 months for a period 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival will be defined as the time elapsed since the beginning of interventions until progressive disease is documented by growth of measurable lesions or new lesions on CT Scan or MRI according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (JNCI 92 (3): 205-216, 2000).</description>

    <measure>Drug Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>from patient´s inclusion every 2 weeks for a period of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Drug toxicity will be assessed with hematologic, renal and hepatic laboratory measures as well as patient symptomatology and physical findings. Any abnormality in these parameters will be reported as an adverse event according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0(CTCAEV3.0, 2006)</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Nimotuzumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Monoclonal antibody Nimotuzumab will be administered alone at a 200mg dose weekly during the first 4 weeks. Posteriorly it will be administered with a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks in combination with chemotherapeutic agents Cisplatin in patients with good renal function or Gemcitabine in patients with kidney failure data until exclusion or death occurs. The administration will be intravenously in 250 ml of saline solution in a time period of 30 minutes.</description>
  </intervention>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Cisplatin</intervention_name>
    <description>Cisplatin will be administered at a calculated dose of 50mg/m2/BSA every 21 days as concomitant therapy to Nimotuzumab, until 6 cycles are completed, exclusion or death occurs, only in patients whose creatinine clearance as defined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation is &gt;/= 60. The administration form will be intravenously.</description>
  </intervention>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Gemcitabine</intervention_name>
    <description>Gemcitabine will be administered at a calculated dose of 800 mg/m2/BSA every 21 days as concomitant therapy to Nimotuzumab, until 6 cycles are completed, exclusion or death occurs, in patients with kidney failure data(Creatinine clearance as defined by the Cockcroft -Gault equation &lt; 60). The administration form will be intravenously.</description>
  </intervention>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>CT Scan</intervention_name>
    <description>A CT Scan will be performed in all patients prior to the beginning of treatment to assess any measurable tumor found by this method. The CT Scan will be repeated once the patient completes the induction phase with Nimotuzumab (4 once a week doses), when the patient has completed 3 full cycles of combination therapy with Nimotuzumab (every 2 weeks)and Gemcitabine or Cisplatin (every 21 days)and once more when the patient has completed 6 full cycles of the aforementioned therapy.</description>
