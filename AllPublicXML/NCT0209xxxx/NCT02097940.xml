      This study presents the hypothesis that the sensory processing engine improves balance and
      agility for football athletes.

      Objectives: To investigate the influence of the sensorimotor treatment in balance, agility
      and functionality soccer players assessed using force platform, functional tests and
      questionnaires.

      Methods: This study was characterized as a randomized clinical trial. 20 male soccer players
      was assessed by means of questionnaires, force platform in one foot, and functional tests of
      balance and agility (Side Hop Test, Figure of Eight Hop Star Excursion Balance Test and
      Test). To the platform, the parameters of the center pressure (COP) in the anterior-
      posterior and medial -lateral directions was used for analysis, to functional tests the
      time-second performance was analyzed. Initially all athletes respond to the questionnaires,
      was evaluated on the force platform and through functional testing by blind evaluators.
      Following, they were randomized to treatment groups (n=10) and control (n=10). The treatment
      group performed 6 weeks of proprioceptive exercises with shifts and one-leg jumps and bipedal
      support.

      The control group remained in soccer training. At the end of the treatment protocol and all
      were reassessed following the cross-over, where the control group performed the same
      treatment sensory motor was developed.
