      The purpose of this study is to characterize the bacterial strains that colonize children
      with atopic dermatitis.

      The investigators hypothesize that rectal cultures will be more sensitive than anterior nares
      cultures for detecting S. aureus colonization, and that strains of S. aureus colonizing
      patients with atopic dermatitis will be resistant to commonly used topical antibiotic
      ointments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by pruritis and
      eczematous lesions with a worldwide prevalence of 15-20%. The burden of disease is highest in
      the most developed nations and predominantly affects children, with 50% of cases arising in
      the first year of life, and most others arising in the first 5 years. There is a well-known
      increased susceptibility to skin infection with S. aureus in patients with AD, and such
      infections are associated with clinical deterioration. While it is routine to evaluate for S.
      aureus colonization in the anterior nares, there is recent evidence suggesting that rectal
      colonization may be more significant. The significance of colonization site has not been
      evaluated in the AD population.

      Additionally, while topical antibiotics are a mainstay of treatment in AD, there is no
      routine data on the resistance to these agents.

      Our aim is to characterize the S. aureus colonization patterns in children with AD, including
      site of colonization and antibiotic resistance. We will analyze routinely-collected skin
      culture specimens from children with AD seen at our center and determine antibiotic
      susceptibility profiles. The significance of colonization site will be analyzed.

        Subjects will be recruited from the pediatric dermatology faculty practices and resident
        clinics at CUMC as well as from the units of the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New
        York. As per CUMC policy, the investigators will not directly approach potential subjects
        until the subject's physician has ascertained and documented that their patient is willing
        to discuss the research with the investigators.
