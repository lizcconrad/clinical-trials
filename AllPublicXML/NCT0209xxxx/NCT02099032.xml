  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polar lipids have a specific chemical structure: they are an essential component of human
      cell membranes, play a major role in the nervous system and also influence the metabolic
      pathways including the cholesterol metabolism.

      Polar lipids are used in food-processing industry for their emulsification properties. The
      most famous emulsifier is soya lecithin but milk also naturally contains natural emulsifiers
      such as polar lipids.

      The purpose of this research is to study plasma cholesterol variation after daily intake of
      milk polar lipids-fortified cheese products. The volunteers will have to consume 100 g of
      cheese product during four weeks instead of their usual cheese products.

      It is a bi-centric study with a centre in LYON (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine
      Rhône-Alpes) and CLERMONT-FERRAND (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne).
