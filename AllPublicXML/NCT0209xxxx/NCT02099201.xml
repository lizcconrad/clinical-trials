  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      multiple-ascending oral dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamics of ACT-389949 in healthy subjects.

      Part A of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability following once a day oral
      dosing of ACT-389949 for 9 days and investigate ACT-389949 pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics.

      Part B of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ACT-389949 following a
      maximum of two different oral dosing regimens: ACT-389949 given either every 3 days for 13
      days or every 2 days for 9 days (5 doses for each regimen).

      Part C of the study, if required, will provide additional information to that obtained from
      Parts A and B in terms of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      ACT-389949.
