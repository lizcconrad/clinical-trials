      Tooth loss in periodontitis patients is associated with patient and site factors as well as
      with treatment provided. Not much is known about long-term tooth loss in periodontitis
      patients in private practice in the UK. The study plans to follow-up 200 subjects with
      periodontitis (and currently on maintenance therapy) for 5 years. The effect of treatment
      provided, site and patient risk factors on tooth loss will be studied.

          3. Willing to give written informed consent for study participation

          4. Willing to undergo SPT as per standard of care for at least 5 years

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Serious medical history that prevents patients from undergoing dental treatment

          2. History of rheumatic fever, heart murmur, mitral valve prolapse, artificial heart
