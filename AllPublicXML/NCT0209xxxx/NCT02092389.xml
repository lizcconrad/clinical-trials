  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to explore the fecal calprotectin (fC) levels of UC patients
      under adalimumab therapy and the correlation with their general wellbeing (Quality of Life
      [QoL]), workability, and disease activity.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, observational study in which Humira (adalimumab) is prescribed
      in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with
      regards to dose, population and indication. The assignment of the patient to a adalimumab
      containing regimen has to be decided in advance and has to be current practice. The
      prescription of adalimumab is clearly separated from the decision to include the participant
      in this study.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Fecal Calprotectin (fC) Level ≤ 150 µg/g After 12 Months of Treatment With Adalimumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal calprotectin (fC) is a non-invasive surrogate marker of inflammation in the small intestine and levels below 250 ug/g is associated with mucosal healing. fC levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and/or a validated quantitative rapid test. The study was terminated due to low enrollment. Although no meaningful analysis can be presented, data for subjects with available data for fC levels at Month 12 at the end of study (termination) are provided.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Patient's Workability Measured Using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment:Ulcerative Colitis (WPAI:UC) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI:UC is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity (work time missed and work and activity impairment) during the past 7 days due to UC. The scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity. Change in WPAI-UC is calculated by deducting the final score from the baseline score. Increased (positive) scores correspond to a reduction in the percentage of lost work productivity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Patient's Quality of Life (QoL) Measured Using the Short Inflammatory Bowl Disease Questionnaire (sIBDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The sIBDQ is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaire, able to detect and define meaningful clinical changes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients by measuring physical, social and emotional status. The sIBDQ consists of 10 questions, each question is scored on a scale from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). The scores are summed up and divided by 10 for a mean score ranging from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). Increased scores correspond to an improvement in QoL.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Disease Activity Determined by Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>A partial mayo score (mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment [PGA]).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Patient's Workability Measured Using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment:Ulcerative Colitis (WPAI:UC) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The WPAI:UC is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity (work time missed and work and activity impairment) during the past 7 days due to UC. The scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity. Change in WPAI-UC is calculated by deducting the final score from the baseline score. Increased (positive) scores correspond to a reduction in the percentage of lost work productivity.</description>

        <description>The sIBDQ is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (QoL) questionnaire, able to detect and define meaningful clinical changes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients by measuring physical, social and emotional status. The sIBDQ consists of 10 questions, each question is scored on a scale from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). The scores are summed up and divided by 10 for a mean score ranging from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). Increased scores correspond to an improvement in QoL.</description>
