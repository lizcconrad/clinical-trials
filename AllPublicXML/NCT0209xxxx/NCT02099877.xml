  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational double-blind study, the investigators aim to assess the
      effect of the single nucleotide polymorphism of the μ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1, p.118A/G)
      on the duration of epidural fentanyl labor analgesia.

    <textblock>
      The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), p.118A/G of the µ -opioid receptor gene (OPRM1),
      may alter pain perception and individual response to opioid analgesia. This SNP leads to a
      variant µ-opioid receptor in which an asparagine is substituted for aspartate as the 102nd
      amino acid of the receptor protein (p.Asn102Asp). At the investigators' institution, it is
      common practice to initiate labor analgesia with epidural fentanyl. No data are available to
      determine how the µ-opioid polymorphism affects pain perception and response to opioids, such
      as fentanyl, in the investigators' population. The investigators aim to assess the effect of
      the single nucleotide polymorphism of the µ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1, p.118A/G) on
      duration of epidural fentanyl labor analgesia.

      This is a prospective observational and double-blind study. Before initiation of epidural
      labor analgesia, venous blood will be drawn into coded EDTA tubes. DNA isolation and
      genotyping of OPRM1:p.118A/G will be performed at the American University of Beirut. In 250
      parturients, labor epidural analgesia will be initiated with 100 µg of epidural fentanyl
      following a test dose of lidocaine and epinephrine. No drugs will be injected until second
      request of analgesia. Patients will be divided into two groups based on their genetic groups:
      Group A consists of wild-type homozygote (A118), and Group G includes heterozygote and
      homozygote carrying the G118 allele. Duration of fentanyl analgesia (primary outcome) will be
      compared. Data will be presented as a mean ± SD or numbers and percentages. Statistical
      analysis will be performed with the Student's t-test, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test as
      appropriate. P value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

    <description>Nulliparous parturients ≥ 37 weeks gestation, with ASA I or II, with an uncomplicated course of singleton vertex pregnancy requesting epidural analgesia for pain relief will be included.
When the patient requests analgesia, cervical dilatation will be verified by the obstetric resident/attending. Then epidural analgesia will be initiated with a test dose of 3mL of 2% lidocaine and epinephrine 15 µg and a dose of fentanyl 100 µg diluted to a total volume of 10 mL with preservative- free normal saline. Before placement of the epidural, venous blood (2 mL) will be drawn into special tubes. Genotyping of OPRM1: p.118A/G will be also performed.</description>
