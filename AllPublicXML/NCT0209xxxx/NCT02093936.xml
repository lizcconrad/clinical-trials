  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Induced sputum (IS) is a noninvasive methodology for evaluating airway
      inflammation in a large number of pulmonary diseases, i.e, Asthma, Chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease and Interstitial Lung Diseases. Several studies have defined normal values
      and cut-off points for this technique based on cellular components of IS, such as percentages
      of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and CD4/CD8 ratio of T cell lymphocytes. However,
      normal values and cut-off points for lymphocyte percentages indicative of pathology have not
      yet been established or validated. This component of IS has considerable clinical value.
      Similar to other constituents of IS, it can provide biological insights into the pathogenesis
      of respiratory disorders and contribute to establishing the diagnosis and guiding treatment
      management of a variety of airway diseases.

      The purposes of this study are to define normal values and cut-off points of lymphocytes in
      IS among individuals with respiratory disorders and healthy volunteers, and to verify the
      current reference values of the percentage of eosinophils, neutrophils and CD4/CD8 ratio in
      IS.

      Methods: A Cross Sectional study which includes a database on up to 900 patients who
      participated in various studies conducted in the Pulmonary Laboratory of Tel Aviv Sourasky
      Medical Center between 2005 to 2012 will be established. The study population will include
      patients diagnosed as having various pulmonary diseases and a group of healthy volunteers who
      will serve as controls. The cut-off for normal values of lymphocyte, eosinophil and
      neutrophil percentages and CD4/CD8 ratio in IS will be defined by using ROC curves and
      evaluating sensitivity and specificity. The comparison of the different values to those in
      the literature will be done by using the Spearman rank correlation.

      The results of this study will provide supplementary information on lymphocyte counts in IS
      for identifying and treating various respiratory diseases.

        People who were sent to the Pulmonology and Allergy Laboratory in the Tel Aviv sourasky
        medical center between the years 2005-2012. Some had a certain occupational or
        environmental exposue, some had pulmunary symptoms or diseases and some had both of the
        above. They were sent in order to examine through spirometry and induced sputum tests
        wheather they suffer from a pulmonary pathology.
