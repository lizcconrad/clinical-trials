      This will be a randomized, double-blind (evaluator-blind), vehicle-controlled study of 50
      enrolled subjects. Adult subjects (greater than 18 years old) who present with a mildly
      infected diabetic foot ulcer (IDSA criteria) having full thickness (i.e., through the dermis
      but not involving joint capsule, tendon, and bone). Subjects must also provide informed
      consent and meet all other entry criteria to be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive
      PluroGel N or PluroGel vehicle.

             Subjects whose diabetes is considered &quot;controlled&quot; by diet or medication in the
             opinion of the physician.

               -  Males or females at least 18 years old.

               -  Subjects must have a full thickness (i.e., extending through dermis but not
                  involving tendon, bone, or joint capsule) ulcer on the foot distal to the
                  malleoli with a surface area ≥1 cm2 after the wound has undergone appropriate
                  debridement. Subjects must have localized mild infection of the ulcer, as defined
                  by the IDSA criteria as per Appendix C, with in the PGN1300 Protocol, which the
                  investigator believes would ordinarily be treated on an outpatient basis.

        IDSA mild infection of an ulcer is defined as:

        The presence of ≥2 of the following items:

          -  Local swelling or induration

          -  Erythema

          -  Local tenderness or pain

          -  Local warmth

          -  Purulent discharge (thick, opaque to white or sanguineous secretion) Local infection
             involving only the skin and the subcutaneous tissue. If erythema, must be &gt;0.5 cm to
             ≤2 cm around the ulcer.

               -  Diabetic Foot Infection-General Parameters Score of at least 2 must be obtained
                  in order to be eligible for enrollment.

               -  Diabetic Foot Infection-Wound Size Score of at least 1 must be obtained in order
                  to be eligible for enrollment.

               -  The diagnosis of mild infection must be confirmed immediately following the Day 0
                  (Enrollment Visit) debridement, although pre-debridement purulence is to be
                  counted as one manifestation of infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with IDSA-defined moderate infection as per Appendix C, including cellulitis
             extending &gt; 2 cm; lymphangitis; spread beneath the fascia; deep tissue abscess;
             osteomyelitis; gangrene; muscle, joint, or bone involvement.

               -  Subjects with IDSA-defined severe infection as per Appendix C, within PGN1300
                  Protocol including systemic toxicity or metabolic instability (e.g., fever,
                  chills, tachycardia, hypotension, confusion, vomiting, leukocytosis, acidosis,
                  hyperglycemia, or azotemia).

               -  Subjects with systemic inflammatory response signs, as manifested by ≥2 of the
                  following :

               -  Subjects currently receiving antibiotic treatment for a localized infection of
                  the study ulcer and whose infection is improving in response to treatment.

               -  Subjects requiring concurrent systemic antimicrobials during the study period for
                  any infection, including diabetic foot ulcer.

               -  Subjects in whom bone or joint involvement is suspected based on clinical

                  vascular reconstructive surgery. Subjects who are expected to be unable to care
