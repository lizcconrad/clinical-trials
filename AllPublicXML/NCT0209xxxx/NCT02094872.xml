    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well molecularly targeted therapy works in treating patients
      with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body. Patients must have received or do
      not qualify for prior immunotherapy. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs
      or other substances to identify and attack specific types of cancer cells with less harm to
      normal cells. Molecularly targeted therapy works by treating patients with substances that
      kill cancer cells by targeting key molecules involved in cancer cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the difference in best overall response rate (BORR) between patients treated
      with MEK162 following personalized molecularly guided assignment vs. a historical BORR of 7%
      in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of performing individualized drug therapy (including novel agents
      and commercially-available agents) in the context of a personalized medicine clinical trial.

      II. To define the difference in progression free survival (PFS) between patients treated with
      MEK162 following personalized molecularly guided assignment vs. a historical PFS rate of 2
      months in this patient population.

      III. To continually assess data in real time so as to iteratively refine and standardize a
      set of statistical and informatics methodologies for matching treatments to the patient's
      tumor, based on the molecular profile.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis via sequencing. Based on the results of the DNA and RNA
      analysis, patients receive molecularly targeted therapy. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             eligible for immunotherapy; pts. are defined as &quot;BRAF wild-type&quot; if they test negative
             for V600 mutations based on a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)

             to undergo up to two surgical resections/biopsies to collect tumor for research
             purposes; the first of these biopsies will occur at the beginning of the study, prior
             to genetic analysis and Rx; the second BX will be performed at the time of DZ
             progression/end of study should funding be available

          -  Patients must have measurable DZ (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             [RECIST] version 1.1 [v1.1] criteria), defined as at least one lesion that can be
