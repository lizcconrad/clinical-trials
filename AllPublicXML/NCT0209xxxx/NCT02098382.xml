    <textblock>
      Non-interventional prospective data collection designed to evaluate clinical outcome on the
      efficacy of the use of Dilapan-S in the indication of labor pre-induction in women
      with/without a history of Caesarean section. The evaluation will be based on prospective data
      collection in at least four obstetrics centers in the Czech Republic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays there is a rising need for non-pharmacological cervical ripening methods as the use
      of prostaglandins is frequently limited by various contraindications. Dilapan-S is a
      hygroscopic uterine neck dilator. Its mode of action consists in the hydrophilic properties
      of the device absorbing fluids from surrounding tissue structures, thus expanding the volume
      of Dilapan-S sticks which subsequently exert radial pressure on the surrounding structures
      (uterine neck) to dilate progressively. Endocervical pressure on the uterine neck results not
      only in its mechanical dilatation but pressure on endocervical structures also stimulates the
      production of endogenous prostaglandins, which promote cervical ripening through its
      collagenolytic action. Although Dilapan-S is widely used in labor pre-induction, published
      study data comparing its clinical efficacy and safety in females with/without caesarean
      section in medical history are lacking.
