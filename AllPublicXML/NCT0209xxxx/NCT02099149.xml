  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compare anticapsular antibody levels against Group B Streptococcus at delivery in mothers and
      their infants who develop disease versus those who do not. Use this comparison to establish
      antibody levels associated with reductions in risk of GBS disease in infants aged less than
      90 days.
