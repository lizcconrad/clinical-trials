  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      PK of escalating doses of DLYE5953A administered to patients with incurable, locally
      advanced, or metastatic solid malignancy that has progressed on standard therapy. The Phase I
      study consists of two stages: Stage 1 dose-escalation and Stage 2 expansion in selected
      patients. In Stage 1, a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design will be used to examine the safety,
      tolerability, and PK of increasing doses of DLYE5953A. In Stage 2, patients will be enrolled
      to further characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK of the proposed dose and schedule
      for future studies.
