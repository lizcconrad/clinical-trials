    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rVIII-SingleChain in pediatric patients with severe
      hemophilia A. A minimum of 25 previously treated subjects â‰¥ 6 to &lt; 12 years of age and at
      least 25 subjects &lt; 6 years of age who have undergone &gt; 50 exposure days (EDs) with a
      previous Factor VIII (FVIII) product are planned to be enrolled. Subjects will be assigned to
      either an on-demand or prophylaxis treatment regimen and will receive rVIII-SingleChain at a
      dose to be determined by the investigator. Hemostatic efficacy will be assessed by the
      subject/caregiver and the investigator who will assess overall efficacy by a 4-point scale.

    <description>Rate of treatment success where treatment success of a bleeding episode is defined as a rating of &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; based on the investigator's overall clinical assessment of hemostatic efficacy (using a 4-point scale of excellent, good, moderate or poor/no response) on the on-demand and prophylaxis regimens combined. The rate of success was based on the number of treated bleeding events; there were 347 treated bleeding events in the Efficacy Population.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be assigned to either an on-demand or prophylaxis regimen and will receive rVIII-SingleChain as an intravenous (IV) infusion. Subjects assigned to a prophylaxis regimen will be treated with 15 to 50 IU/kg of rVIII-SingleChain every second day or 2 to 3 times per week, or at the investigator's discretion, based on available PK data, the FVIII treatment regimen used before enrollment and/or the subject's bleeding phenotype. The dose for on-demand treatment of a bleeding episode is based on the recommendations of the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), with a minimum dose of 15 IU/kg. All subjects were to be treated for a minimum of 50 EDs. For the PK evaluation, the subjects will receive a single IV dose of 50 IU/kg of rVIII-SingleChain on Day 1 at the start of the PK evaluation period.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This multicenter, multinational study enrolled subjects at 37 participating study centers in Australia, Europe, Georgia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Philippines, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Screening took place 4 to 28 days prior to first dose of study product (rVIII-SingleChain). A total of 88 subjects were screened, 4 of these did not fulfill all eligibility criteria and were therefore screening failures.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>rVIII-SingleChain</title>
          <description>Subjects were assigned to either an on-demand or prophylaxis regimen and received rVIII-SingleChain as an intravenous (IV) infusion. Subjects assigned to a prophylaxis regimen were treated with 15 to 50 IU/kg of rVIII-SingleChain every second day or 2 to 3 times per week, or at the investigatorâ€™s discretion, based on available PK data, the FVIII treatment regimen used before enrollment and/or the subjectâ€™s bleeding phenotype. The dose for on-demand treatment of a bleeding episode was based on the recommendations of the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), with a minimum dose of 15 IU/kg. All subjects were to be treated for a minimum of 50 EDs. For the PK evaluation, the subjects received a single IV dose of 50 IU/kg of rVIII-SingleChain on Day 1 at the start of the PK evaluation period.</description>
