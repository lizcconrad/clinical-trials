  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi center, patient sponsored study of
      Adipose-Derived Stromal Cell (ASC) implantation via intramuscular injections in patients who
      have critical limb ischemia not amenable for revascularization.

      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      diagnosed critical limb ischemia ASCs will be collected from the patient's adipose-derived
      tissue (body fat). Using local anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the
      adipose tissue specimen. The adipose tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for
      separation of the adipose tissue derived stem cells. In addition, peripheral blood will be
      collected for isolation of platelet rich plasma, which are then combined with the ASC's for
      intramuscular injection into the lower limb.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ~ 18 years

          -  Existence of limb ischemia, with clinical presentation corresponding to Rutherford
             Categories 2-6 as defined in the reporting standards adopted by \ the Society of

             III, or IV

          -  Patients with, ischemia and ischemic ulceration provided patient have angiographic
             evidence of vascular compromise and is not a candidate for revascularization

          -  Stable and on optimal medical management for &gt; 60 days as follows:

          -  Clopidogrel/aspirin therapy or other anticoagulation therapy, cholesterol- lowering
             agent, and⁄or antihypertensive medication
