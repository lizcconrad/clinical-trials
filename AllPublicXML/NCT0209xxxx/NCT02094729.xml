    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamic response of repeated intravenous infusions of BAN2401 in
      subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild
      Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple ascending dose
      study in a total of 24 subjects (8 subjects per cohort) with MCI due to AD and mild AD. The
      study consists of three cohorts to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of BAN2401 at
      three dose levels (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg). Each cohort consists of Screening Period before
      randomization, Treatment Period from randomization to last dose, and Follow-up Period after
      last dose. Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will receive 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg of BAN2401,
      respectively.

          5. Evidence of infection, tumor, stroke or other clinically significant lesions that
             could indicate a dementia diagnosis other than AD on brain MRI at Screening

          6. Evidence of other clinically significant lesions that could indicate a dementia
             diagnosis other than AD on brain MRI at Screening, or other significant pathological
             findings on brain MRI at Screening

          7. A prolonged QT interval (QTcF greater than or equal to 450 ms) as demonstrated by a
             repeated ECG at Screening

          8. Any other clinically significant conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal disease) that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could
             affect the subject's safety or interfere with the study assessments

          9. Severe visual or hearing impairment that would prevent the subject from performing
             psychometric tests accurately.
