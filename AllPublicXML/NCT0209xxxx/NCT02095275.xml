  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is rapidly released by the ventricles of the heart in
      response to myocardial stretch. This cardiac neurohormone is mostly elevated in patients with
      fluid overload or myocardium dysfunction. BNP is a very useful and important marker. It can
      predict mortality and cardiac events in patients in the ICU setting. In stable hemodialysis
      patients with normal LV function on echocardiography, high BNP levels are likely the result
      of blood volume expansion and require reduction in postdialysis dry weight.

      In the past, there were many methods to evaluate fluid status. Some are not reliable such as
      central venous pressure or physical examination. Some are invasive and expensive such as Swan
      Ganz、PiCCO catheter or bioimpedance device. Nevertheless, About the relationship between BNP
      and fluid status, a study found a significant relation between bioimpedance-derived body
      composition (BC) (fluid distribution) parameters and BNP concentrations. This relationship
      was independent of the cardiac history of the patient and suggests that the natriuretic
      peptide levels are to some degree modifiable by changing a patient's fluid distribution.

      In this study, the investigators want to observe that if the level of BNP can predict the
      occurrence of acute kidney injury and the need of renal replacement therapy. Besides, the
      investigators also want to see if BNP can be a useful and convenient marker to guide
      adjustment of optimal fluid status and then to improve outcome.

      patients with normal LV function on echocardiography, high BNP levels are likely the result
      of blood volume expansion and require reduction in postdialysis dry weight.

      On the other hand, ample recent data have highlighted the role of ﬂuid accumulation on
      mortality and non-recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with acute kidney
      injury (AKI). In the past, there were many methods to evaluate fluid status. Some are not
      reliable such as central venous pressure or physical examination. Some are invasive and
      expensive such as Swan Ganz、PiCCO catheter or bioimpedance device. Nevertheless, About the
      relationship between BNP and fluid status, a study found a significant relation between
      bioimpedance-derived body composition (BC) (fluid distribution) parameters and BNP
      concentrations. This relationship was independent of the cardiac history of the patient and
      suggests that the natriuretic peptide levels are to some degree modifiable by changing a
      patient's fluid distribution.

      In this study, we want to observe that if the level of BNP can predict the occurrence of
      acute kidney injury and the need of renal replacement therapy. Besides, we also want to see
      if BNP can be a useful and convenient marker to guide adjustment of optimal fluid status and
      then to improve outcome.
