      Background: Squamous metaplasia refers to the pathological transformation of the urothelium
      leading to non-keratinised stratified squamous metaplasia (N-KSM).

      Objective: To present the investigators experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of N-KSM
      of the urinary bladder in children.

  <detailed_description>

      Design, setting, and participants: In this study, the investigators present their experiences
      in the diagnosis and treatment of N-KSM of the urinary bladder in children aged from 5 to 17
      years. From 2005 to 2013, metaplasia was diagnosed in 119 patients - 116 girls and 3 boys.
      The reasons behind visiting the hospital were non-specific intense pain in the abdomen,
      recurrent urinary tract infections, and urination disorders. The most common symptoms of
      urinary bladder dysfunction were pollakiuria and difficulties in initiating micturition and
      retention of urine (reduced detrusor muscle activity).

      Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: In 20 patients (16.8%), metaplasia was
      incidentally diagnosed during cystoscopy performed for other causes. Only the children whose
      bladders showed metaplastic changes on cystoscopy were subjected to a bladder biopsy for
      collecting specimens for further histopathological examination.

    <description>Owing to the absence of an established treatment modality for squamous metaplasia of the urinary bladder in children, we developed our own treatment modalities. Children presenting with recurrent urinary tract infections on medical interview, were subjected to ultrasonography of the urinary system, repeated urinalysis, and urine culture tests. Then, on the basis of antibiogram findings, antibiotic and chemotherapeutic treatment was administered to eliminate the bacteriological factors. Second-generation cephalosporin was prescribed for 10 days, and then treatment crossover with chemotherapeutics in therapeutic dose (change in every week) during 3 months.</description>
