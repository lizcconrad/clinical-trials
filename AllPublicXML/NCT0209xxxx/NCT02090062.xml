      Parts of patients are diagnosed as H. pylori -negative before ER, whereas the specimens
      become H. pylori-positive after ER, which may have a role in the recurrence of EGC. Our study
      aims to determine the difference in H. pylori infection rate of EGC patients before and after
      ER , and discuss the causes leading to the difference, which can provide references for
      improving the diagnostic accuracy of H. pylori infection and reducing EGC's recurrence rate.

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and the second
      leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Nowadays, endoscopic resection（ER） is widely accepted
      as the primary treatment for early gastric cancer (EGC) without lymph node metastasis，which
      includes endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection
      (ESD).However, recurrence rate after endoscopic resection for EGC still achieves 6.7%-14%.
      However, there is no comparative analysis about H. pylori infection rate before and after ER
      yet.

    <description>Information on the H pylori infection status before ER will be collected from the medical records of each patient. A positive result on at least one rapid urease test, urease breath test or Giemsa staining is deemed to be indicative of H pylori infection .Each specimen after ER will be detected H pylori infection status in two weeks. Then we analyze the difference in H. pylori infection rate before and after ER.</description>
