  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are the gold standard in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome
      (AWS). Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid also known as sodium oxybate (SMO) has been tested as a
      treatment for AWS with encouraging results. Aim of this phase IV, multicenter randomized
      double-blind, double dummy study is to evaluate the efficacy of SMO in comparison to oxazepam
      in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms (AWS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, multicenter randomized (1:1), active drug-controlled study (double-blind,
      double dummy) with parallel groups evaluating the efficacy of SMO versus oxazepam in the
      treatment of AWS in alcohol-dependent patients.

      A placebo-controlled design was considered but excluded, given that a gold standard treatment
      for AWS is available (i.e., BDZs).

      Furthermore, considering that SMO and oxazepam have two different pharmaceutical formulation
      (suspension and tablets, respectively), a double-dummy design was adopted.

      Thus, all subjects will receive both medications, tablets (oxazepam or placebo) and
      suspension (SMO or placebo), at the same time.

    <description>The primary outcome was the reduction of symptoms of AWS reflected by the course of the total CIWA-Ar scores from the start (baseline) to the end of the study (day 10) and to the end of follow up (day 20, 10 days after drugs discontinuation).</description>

    <description>Secondary outcome variables included the course of alcohol abstinence. In order to confirm daily alcohol abstinence, a breath analyzer was used. In addition, to define those subjects remaining abstinent throughout the whole treatment period, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (%CDT) was evaluated at the time of screening and at the end of the treatment period.</description>
