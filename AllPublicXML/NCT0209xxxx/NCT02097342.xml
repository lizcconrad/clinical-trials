  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned to evaluate if linagliptin can improve insulin sensitivity in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the effect of linagliptin on pancreatic function
      will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) . Patients
      with T2DM in the age group 30-65 years and duration of diabetes less than five years will be
      screened. After exclusion, those who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the
      study.

      Once eligibility criteria are confirmed, patients will be educated about their disease and
      will be advised weight maintenance diabetic diet and exercise throughout the study period.
      Patients will be randomized to three groups - linagliptin (5mg OD) or voglibose (0.2mg TDS)
      or placebo OD. Metformin will be continued in all patients. To evaluate the effect of
      linagliptin on insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, independent of changes in HbA1c,
      the voglibose group is included. Each group will have 10 patients and will be followed up for
      6 months. Both patients and physicians will be blinded to the treatment.

      After having written informed consent, a detailed history and a thorough clinical examination
      will be done in all subjects including measurement of height, weight, body mass index and
      waist circumference. Hemoglobin, liver function tests, renal function tests, lipid profile,
      HbA1c, fasting plasma insulin , C-peptide, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance
      index(HOMA-1R) and homeostasis model assessment-beta cell function index (HOMA-β) will be
      done at baseline. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study and a mixed meal test will be
      performed in all patients (on different days) at baseline and after 6 months of follow up.
      Biochemical parameters will be measured again 6 months after therapy. Fasting and
      post-prandial blood glucose will be done monthly for 6 months.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp of 2 hours duration will be done at baseline and after 6 months of treatment in all patients. Medications taken by the patient will be omitted on the day of test.After an overnight fast of 10 hours, intravenous catheter will be inserted, under sterile precautions, into the antecubital vein for infusion of insulin and dextrose solutions, while another catheter will be inserted in an anti-flow direction into the dorsal vein of the contralateral hand for arterialized blood sampling.
An insulin infusate of 300 mU/ml will be administered at a constant rate, after an initial priming dose, while a 25 percent dextrose solution is administered at varying rates to maintain blood glucose at 90 mg/dl. Blood glucose will be analyzed by a bedside glucose analyzer every 5 minutes. M value, a measure of glucose utilisation will be calculated during the steady state (last 30 minutes of the test)</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting and 2 hour postprandial blood glucose will be at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. HbA1C will be done at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.
HOMA-IR and HOMA-β will be done at baseline and after 6 months. Patients will also be subjected to a mixed meal test at baseline and at 6 months. Mixed meal test will be done 3-7 days after clamp study. After an overnight fast of 10 hours, patients will be given standardized mixed meal, 2.5 g/ kg. (Ensure, Abbott Nutrition, Abbott Laboratories) Medications normally taken by the subject in the morning will be administered 20 min prior to the start of the test meal. Samples for glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) will be taken at 0,30,60,90,120,150 and 180 minutes following the ingestion of meal. Total area under curves for glucose, insulin, C-peptide and GLP-1 from pre meal to 180 min will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule.</description>
