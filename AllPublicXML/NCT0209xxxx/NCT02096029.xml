    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of &quot;sampling&quot; of smoking cessation
      medications (nicotine patches and lozenges) among smokers seen in primary care settings. Half
      of study participants will be provided with samples of medication, to use however they wish;
      the other half will not be provided with these samples. All smokers will be advised to quit
      through routine contact with their physician. After the primary care contact, all
      participants will be contacted by phone for three brief follow-up interviews, which will
      involve answering questionnaires about their smoking habits.
