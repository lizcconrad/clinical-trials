  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new OSAS Implant is intended for use in the palate (hard and soft palate/ see picture
      above) in order to stiffen and stabilize the soft palate, which may reduce the severity of
      airway obstructions and of snoring in patients suffering from OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea).
      Indications for use of the System include: symptomatic, habitual, social snoring due to
      palatal flutter or upper airway obstruction primarily caused by the retropalatal obstruction.
      The System is labeled for use by physicians only.

      The primary endpoint is the Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) in the 90 days follow-up.

      Study hypothesis: Reduction of initial AHI ≥20%

Study hypothesis: Reduction of initial AHI ≥20%. AHI is measured using cardio-respiratory polygraphy. Two measurements are performed before treatment and at 90 days follow-up in order to reduce effects from night-to-night variability.</description>
