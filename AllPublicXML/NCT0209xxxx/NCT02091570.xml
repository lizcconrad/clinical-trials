      Participant eligibility will be screened at visit 1. Test days will commence at 8 to 10 a.m.
      and visits two to four will be spaced four days apart. On visit days participants consume a
      nutrition bar; satiety and hunger ratings, blood samples are collected simultaneously over a
      three hour period. After completion, participants will complete gastrointestinal (GI)
      tolerability as well as Palatability and Adverse Events questionnaires.
