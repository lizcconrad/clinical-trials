  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop and refine a suicide intervention protocol, and pilot test a
      culturally tailored randomized control trial to reduce suicidal thoughts among U.S. Chinese
      older adults. During the first phase of the study, the investigators plan to invite the
      community advisory board and key stakeholders to participate in the iterative design and
      refinement of the study protocol. During the second phase of the project and after the
      initial screening and based on a specific set of inclusion criteria, the investigators will
      invite U.S. Chinese older adult to participate in a pilot randomized control trial of a
      culturally adapted intervention to reduce the frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts in
      Chinese older adults. During the third phase of the project, the investigators plan to invite
      pilot intervention participants as well as key stakeholders and health care professionals on
      the cultural acceptability of the pilot intervention. Through the achievement of these
      objectives, the investigators will set the foundation to fully test a culturally adapted
      in-home intervention, which may be particularly suitable for Chinese older adults with
      suicidal thoughts as it addresses cultural-specific barriers and integrates care management
      within existing community services agencies using non-mental health professionals, including
      community health workers.
