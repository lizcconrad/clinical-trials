  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undernutrition and growth restriction due to poor diet and inadequate nutrient intake
      continues to be a global challenge, particularly in the developing countries including
      Uganda. The etiology of inadequate nutrient supply to infants may relate to lack of resources
      or knowledge or a combination of both. Poor nutrient intake and impaired growth may affect
      brain and cognitive development.

      This study aims to evaluate nutrient intake, growth and cognitive function among children
      between 6 and 36 months living in the fertile Kabale and Kisoro region in south-western
      Uganda. The investigators hypothesize that nutrition education to mothers can bring about
      improved dietary intake and nutritional status among children aged 6-36 months.
