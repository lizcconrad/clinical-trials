  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is in the centrum of the process of reverse
      cholesterol transport from peripheral cells to the liver[10]. HDL-C promotes endothelial
      generation of nitric oxide (NO) and improves endothelial function and arterial
      vasoreactivity[11]. In several studies, lower HDL-C level was reported to be associated with
      increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk[12-14]. HDL-C also has anti- inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant activities[15,16]. Concerning anti-inflammatory activity, HDL-C inhibits the
      activation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils[17,18] and inhibits the expression of
      endothelial adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and
      E-selectin[15].

      In this study we aimed to investigate the relation of HDL-C level with systemic inflammatory
      markers in patients with cardiac syndrome X (CSX).

        CSX was defined as typical chest pain during rest or effort, abnormal test result for
        exercise ECG and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and the presence of angiographically
        normal epicardial coronary arteries. Control group was selected from volunteers presented
        to our hospital with the complaint of typical anginal chest pain who had no ischemia on
        myocardial perfusion scintigraphy or during the treadmill exercise test, had similar risk
        profile with the patients (diabetes, hypertension, age, gender) and had normal epicardial
        coronaries at coronary angiography.
