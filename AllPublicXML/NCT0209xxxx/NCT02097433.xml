  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the global clinical development program for Dacomitinib, studies are planned in
      cancer patients in China. An assessment of Dacomitinib pharmacokinetics in Chinese subjects,
      as required by the Chinese Health Authorities, is therefore warranted.

      The single 45 mg oral dose pharmacokinetics of Dacomitinib will be characterized.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

             of 18 and 45 years, inclusive. (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant
             abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination,
             including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG or clinical
             laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 19.0 to 24.0 kg/m2; and a total body weight should be 50 kg
             (110 lbs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant dermatologic, hematological, renal,
             endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric,
             neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated,
             asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  Drug dependency, a positive urine drug screen and/or alcohol dependency.

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine- containing products (or a positive urine cotinine test).

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug or biologic within the last 3 months (or as
             determined by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication, whichever is longer.
