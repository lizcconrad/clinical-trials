  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been recently studied for evaluation of coronary
      stenting. Because of high resolutions, several reports have shown that OCT is appropriate for
      evaluating neointimal tissue after coronary stent implantation. Also, the strut coverage and
      the characterization of neointimal tissue can be accurately evaluated. Furthermore,
      OCT-defined coverage of a stent strut was proposed to be related with clinical safety in
      drug-eluting stents-treated patients. Therefore, we will evaluate the appropriateness of
      currently using coronary stents (e.g. Sirolimus eluting stent, Paclitaxel-eluting stent,
      Zotarolimus-eluting stent, Everolimus-eluting stent, Biolimus eluting stent, EPC(endothelial
      progenitor cell) Capture stent, etc) based on the findings of OCT. Additionally, we will
      evaluate neointimal hyperplasia, malposition or strut coverage to decide the differences in
      the stent characteristics, the duration of antiplatelet use, and the differences according to
      the clinical presentations.
