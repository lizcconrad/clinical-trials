  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more women are on buprenorphine or methadone during pregnancy for a history of
      opioid addiction. Currently, pain control after cesarean section for women already on these
      medications, if they need operative delivery, is a challenge due to the pharmacology of those
      drugs. They have higher pain scores and 45-47% higher opiates requirement. To improve pain
      control, some unique regional anesthesia techniques have been employed, besides opioid and
      non-opioid medication management through the oral, intravenous, and/or neuraxial (spinal or
      epidural) route. One is a TAP block ( transversus abdominis plane block), a regional
      anesthesia procedure in which long acting local anesthetic, such as ropivacaine, is injected
      on both sides of the patient's abdomen to numb the nerves supplying the abdominal wall, or
      the surgical site. Another is a patient - controlled epidural, a small flexible catheter that
      is inserted in the back into the epidural space near the spine, which bathes the spinal nerve
      roots with long acting local anesthetic, such as bupivacaine, and with an opioid, such as
      fentanyl, to numb the nerves going to the surgical site. Through an epidural pump, the
      patient receives a continuous infusion of local anesthetic and can delivery more medication
      as needed through a bolus feature. There have case reports, or case by case accounts, of
      these techniques, and it is suspected these techniques result in better pain control with
      minimal side effects. No clinical, human or animal, has evaluated these techniques in a
      controlled and through manner, either comparing the two techniques to each other or comparing
      them to the common care of opioid and non-opioid medication management through the oral,
      intravenous, and/or neuraxial route, including neuraxial hydromorphone or morphine.

    <description>One unique regional technique for lower abdominal surgery, that has been shown effective for Cesarean Section in particular, is the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, which blocks T6-L1 sensory nerve branches and provides anesthesia to the anterior abdominal wall. The TAP block has been recommended and shown in case reports, but not clinically studied with trials, for patients on methadone or buprenorphine, to improve post-operative pain control. A long active local anesthetic, called ropivacaine, will be used to provide this anesthesia.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Common Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Common care refers to the common way pain is treated after Cesarean Section: a long-acting spinal or epidural opioid such as morphine, plus oral and IV opioids and non-narcotic adjuncts such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. Due to the potential issues such as ineffectiveness and fear of respiratory depression, increasing the dosing of these opioids may not be ideal.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>For post-Cesarean analgesia, another regional technique that has been employed for superior pain control is continued epidural analgesia with local anesthesia and an opioid, either in addition or instead of long acting neuraxial opioids (Cohen). One study revealed equal analgesic efficiency, higher patient satisfaction scores, and less side effects with patient controlled epidural ropivacaine compared to epidural morphine (Chen). This is an especially attractive option for opioid dependent patients, but like the TAP block, has been not studied whether or not it lessens acute or chronic postoperative cesarean section, in the setting or in the absence of neuraxial opioids.</description>
