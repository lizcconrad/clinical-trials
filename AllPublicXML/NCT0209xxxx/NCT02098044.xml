    <textblock>
      The OA and Football Study is an epidemiological study designed to establish the prevalence of
      knee osteoarthritis in retired professional footballers. The study will also identify the key
      risk factors associated with knee osteoarthritis. The study is comprised of three phases:
      Phase I involves the dissemination of a questionnaire (demographic details, players history,
      injury and surgery and other known risk factors of OA), Phase II is a radiographic study that
      involves x-rays in a sample of footballers both with and without knee pain and Phase III is a
      case control study which will compared retired professional footballers with age-matched
      controls recruited from the general population in the East Midlands region.

      Number of Participants:

      Phase I: 1000 Phase II: 855 Phase III: 500

      Primary outcome: The questionnaire will contain player specific information and will include
      validated outcome measures such as the health status questionnaire as well as self-reported
      pain, recall of injury and surgery history. The results of the questionnaire will be exported
      firstly to Excel and subsequently, into MS Access as part of a managed database.
