      The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment effectiveness of steroid therapy for
      vestibular neuritis by using video head impulse test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective, randomized controlled study. The enrolled vestibular neuritis
      patients were randomized to conservative treatment or steroid treatment when they are
      diagnosed with caloric test. After initial vestibular work-up including caloric, video head
      impulse tests, and a questinnaire (DHI), the patient was examined with the same tests again
      at 6 months later. The efficacy of steroid for the patients with vestibular neuritis would be
      determined by the comparison of the data of each group.
