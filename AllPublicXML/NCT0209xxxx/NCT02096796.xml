  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arm Pump is a sport specific term drivers use to describe Acute or Chronic Compartment
      Syndrome of the forearm. Drivers experience pain in the forearms due to increased blood
      pressure in forearm muscle compartments. No strategies nor methods have been used to diminish
      the risk to suffer from arm pump within motor cross.

      This project aims to look at ergonomics of driving and its relationship with the occurrence
      of arm pump.

      The investigators will first investigate the experience of motor cross athletes with arm pump
      through motor cross federations in Belgium and The Netherlands (survey).

      Two groups of athletes will be selected (20 persons within each group) who will be invited to
      the motor cross track to investigate their hand grip strength, motor driving position, muscle
      activity.
