  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have planned this project to evaluate the follow-up program after surgery
      due to cervical cancer and to explore the possibilities for different tests of Human
      Papilloma Virus (HPV) in contributing to the customization of the follow-up program.

      Purpose:

      The investigators effort is to provide the background for an evidence-based update of the
      follow-up program after surgery due to cervical cancer with the purpose of early diagnosis of
      recurrence affecting quality of life for as few women as possible.

    <description>Patients treated with surgery alone for uterine cervical neoplasms attending surveillance at Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Oncogynecological unit, Aarhus University Hospital from 01.01.14 From 01.01.15 patients will be recruited from Oncogynecologic units at Aalborg University Hospital and Rigshospitalet. Recruitment of patients from these institutions has not been successful and has been closed.
It is expected due to political decisions that the cervical cancer patients from the uptake area of Aalborg University Hospital will be treated at Aarhus University Hospital and they will then be eligible for the study</description>
