      The aims of this research are to validate and develop of therapeutic strategies for patients
      with colorectal lesions in real time through pCLE(probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy).
      Endomicroscopy is a technique for obtaining histology-like images from inside the human body
      in real-time. Total objections are 311 patients.

      Specific research topics are as below.

        1. Diagnosis and classification of colon polyps through pCLE

        2. Evaluation of the depth of invasion of colorectal cancer or lateral growth type tumor
           through the pCLE

        3. Differential diagnosis of colorectal submucosal tumor through the pCLE

        4. Differential diagnosis of ileocecal ulcers through the pCLE

      The study will be conducted to measure sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, amphoteric predict
      of pCLE diagnosis, and calculate the agreement of prediction compared to the pathological
      findings of lesions Check diagnostic agreement of technical phrases which are derived, the
      matching degree between observers, and will develope a new classification method based on
      this.

    <description>After shooting 10% fluorescein sodium in,2.5-5 .0 ml to the object with colorectal disease, the lesion will observed and evaluated with pCLE in real-time and also stored the inspection images.
Then, determines the treatment plan to determine which is applied currently in clinical, Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, amphoteric predict of pCLE diagnosis, and calculate the agreement of prediction compared to the pathological findings of lesions Based on the inspection image stored, using Delphi approach tests, two or more are discussed, to derive a significant technical phrases.
Check diagnostic agreement of technical phrases which are derived, the matching degree between observers, and developed a new classification method based on this.</description>
