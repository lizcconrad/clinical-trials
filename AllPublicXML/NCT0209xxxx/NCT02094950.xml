    <textblock>
      This is a single arm clinical trial to establish the feasibility of conducting a clinical
      trial of acupuncture in reducing dyspnea among lung cancer survivors who have completed
      chemoradiotherapy. Twelve subjects with dyspnea will be recruited to this clinical trial. Up
      to 10 sessions of acupuncture will be delivered over the course of 8-10 weeks. The primary
      outcome will be dyspnea as measured by the English version of the Cancer Dyspnea Scale at the
      completion of the intervention.

          -  Completion of concurrent CRT at least 6 months prior to randomization.

          -  Dyspnea which worsened after Chemoradiotherapy, leading to a ATS dyspnea score greater
             than or equal to 2 (Walks slower than people of the same age on the level because of
             breathlessness or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace on level)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current receipt of therapy for treatment related pneumonitis for 3 weeks.

          -  Surgical resection of this LC (lobectomy or pneumonectomy)

          -  Another organic cause of dyspnea necessitating treatment (eg pleural effusion
             appropriate for thoracentesis, rapidly progressive intrathoracic recurrence,
             symptomatic pulmonary embolus after CRT, untreated anemia with hemoglobin8 g/dL)

          -  Current bleeding disorder by history
