    <textblock>
      Abnormalities in the gene encoding Factor VIII (FVIII) results in hemophilia A, an X-linked
      recessive bleeding disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 5000 males. Hemophilia A patients are
      classified into 3 different categories based on residual FVIII activity compared to normal:
      mild (6-40%), moderate (1-5%) and severe (&lt;1%). This categorization correlates to some degree
      with bleeding phenotype, but does not completely define it. Some patients with hemophilia A
      bleed less often than others despite identical plasma FVIII levels. The cause(s) of this
      phenotype heterogeneity in hemophilia A remains largely unknown, despite a number of studies
      of possible factors.

      Activated platelets, in addition to their role in primary hemostasis, play a major role in
      secondary hemostasis (coagulation) by providing a phospholipid surface to which coagulation
      factors bind. A role for platelets in the hemorrhagic propensity of hemophilia A has been
      suggested in the past, but only a small number of studies have been performed with
      limitations in assays performed and numbers of patients. The purpose of the present study is
      to determine whether platelet reactivity in severe hemophilia A patients is associated with
      past bleeding frequency and/or predicts future bleeding frequency.
