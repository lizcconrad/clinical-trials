  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is presumed that families of poorly controlled diabetic adolescents (type 1) would benefit
      from parents' counselling, guided by &quot;the New Authority&quot; model.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;The New Authority&quot; model has been shown to be helpful in risk behaviors such as children's
      violence and school refusal. It is assumed the model would prove helpful in the risk behavior
      of lack of adherence to diabetes treatment regimen. The treatment is give to parents only,
      without the adolescent's participation. It is predicted to improve self care, parents'
      monitoring, family conflict and parents' helplessness.
