      This study looks at the effects of a mother's genes and other characteristics (mother's age,
      baby's age, race, and other diseases) on the ability of nifedipine to end contractions and
      prevent an early delivery. This information will be used to decide what amount of nifedipine
      women need to best treat preterm contractions.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the amount of nifedipine in
      a woman's body and its effect on ending preterm (early) labor contractions and delaying
      delivery by at least 48 hours. The study will also look at the effects of genes (materials
      passed from parent to child that determine the make-up of the body) and other characteristics
      (for example mother's age, baby's age, race, and other diseases or drugs) on the ability of
      nifedipine to end the contractions. We will use this information to decide what amount of
      nifedipine women need to best treat preterm contractions. This study will also examine the
      effect of pregnancy on how fast nifedipine is removed from the woman's body.

      This study will be conducted on two phases. The first will study women who are starting
      nifedipine for treatment of preterm labor. Nifedipine dose will be determined by the
      patient's physician. Blood samples will be obtained from the mother to determine the
      concentration of nifedipine and its metabolite, oxidized nifedipine, during one dosing
      interval. A blood sample will also be obtained for DNA isolation to examine variants in genes
      involved in the nifedipine pathway. We will also collect data on uterine contractions and
      blood pressure through clinical monitoring. After delivery, maternal and umbilical cord blood
      samples will be obtained, along with a piece of placenta. Women who take part in the first
      phase will be asked to return 6-10 weeks after delivery. At that time, she will take a single
      dose of 10 mg immediate release nifedipine by mouth and blood samples will be collected for
      up to 6 hours. Blood pressure will also be monitored prior to collection of each blood sample

    <description>The primary study outcome is prevention of delivery for 48 hours with attainment of uterine quiescence, defined by 12 hours of six or fewer contractions per hour and no further cervical change. Failure of the primary outcome occurs if, in the first 48 hours, patients deliver, rupture membranes, experience recurrent preterm labor, continue to contract or experience cervical change, or required the use of alternate tocolytics. Secondary outcomes include time to uterine quiescence (â‰¤6 contractions/hour), birth weight, gestational age at delivery, maternal and neonatal adverse effects.</description>
