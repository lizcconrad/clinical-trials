  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent reports have identified a specific oncogenic mutation L265P of the MYD88 gene in
      approximately 90% of the patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. MYD88 is a key linker
      protein in the signaling pathway of Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) 7, 8, and 9, and IMO-8400 is
      an oligonucleotide specifically designed to inhibit TLRs 7,8, and 9. The scientific
      hypothesis for use of IMO-8400 to treat patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia depends
      on the inhibition of mutant MYD88 signaling in the TLR pathway, thereby interrupting the
      proliferation of cell populations responsible for the propagation of the disease.
