  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, unmasked, study of IAI in patients with choroidal
      neovascularization secondary to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Twenty treatment
      naïve and previously treated PCV eyes will be enrolled (only one study eye per patient will
      be enrolled). A maximum of 10 previously treated eyes will be enrolled. Consented, enrolled
      patients will be followed monthly. All patients will receive monthly IAI 2.0 mg
      intravitreally for 3 months (Baseline, Months 1 and 2), followed by mandatory IAI 2.0 mg
      every 2 months (Months 4, 6, 8 and 10) for 12 months. Patients can receive additional IAI
      treatment (Months 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) if the re-treatment criteria are met. Starting at Month
      3, patients can receive non-anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) rescue therapy
      (ie: Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), laser, intravitreal steroids) if the pre-defined criteria
      are met.
