      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of Battlefield Auricular
      Acupuncture (BFA) to standard therapy causes reduction in pain, medication use, time to
      ambulation without assistance, hours missed from work and increases quality of life after
      lower extremity surgery at two Air Force Medical Centers.

      We will recruit 429subjects into this research study, for an expected 309 completing the
      study. We estimate 120 subjects will either withdraw consent or become ineligible for the
      study. Subjects will be â‰¥18 years or older and scheduled for lower extremity surgery. To
      randomize subjects, we will employ a random number generator, which will minimize difference
      between study groups. Additionally, we will collect data about patients' length of hospital
      stay, which will allow for statistical control of the variable, complexity of surgical
      procedure. The Research Assistants/Coordinators will be responsible for obtaining Informed
      Consent and HIPAA Authorization from subjects, collecting data, and de-identifying data prior
      to review and analysis by the Investigators. The Investigators will be responsible for
      ongoing protocol monitoring, insertion of needles, verifying inclusion/exclusion criteria,
      and analyzing data.
