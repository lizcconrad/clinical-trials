  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, eligible alcoholic inpatients recruited from a specialized clinic for
      addiction treatment, filling inclusion criteria and not showing any exclusion criteria, will
      be randomized to receive the repetitive (5 sessions, every other day) bilateral dorsolateral
      Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC: cathodal left / anodal right) tDCS (2 milliamperes, 5 x 7 cm2, for
      20 min) or placebo (sham-tDCS). Craving to the use of crack-cocaine will be examined before
      (baseline), during and after the end of the tDCS treatment. Other clinical outcomes, and also
      visual P3 event-related potential and neuroimagings exams will be also performed before and
      after treatment.

      Based in our previous data, our hypothesis is that repetitive bilateral tDCS over dlPFC will
      favorably change clinical, cognitive and brain function in alcoholism and these will be
      long-lasting effects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before (baseline) and after tDCS or sham-tDCS treatment, subjects will be examined:

        1. clinically, regarding craving (obsessive compulsive scale), depressive (Hamilton
           depression rating scale) and anxiety (Hamilton anxiety rating scale) symptoms and
           quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF);

        2. cognitively, regarding frontal (Frontal assessment battery), mental state (mini-mental
           status examination) and working memory (verbal and visual-spatial n-back tasks);

        3. P3 cue-reactivity in visual event-related potentials (ERPs);

        4. neuroimaging: structural (volumetric) and functional such as resting stating functional
           magnetic resonance (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

      They will be followed-up for clinical examination at least 6 months after treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in craving (5 items from obsessive compulsive drinking scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four applications: before tDCS treatment (baseline), first and second weeks, during the treatment, and in the third week, after the end of the tDCS treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Five items (1, 2, 4, 5, and 13) from the original obsessive compulsive drinking scale (Bohn et al., 1996), which are believed to reliably assess craving in a narrow sense (de Wildt et al., 2005; Furieri and Nakamura-Palacios). These items will be applied at the beginning, during and at the end of the treatment with sham-tDCS or tDCS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (baseline) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (in the third week).</time_frame>
    <description>The FAB, developed by Dubois et al. (2000) was used to explore the following six different domains of executive function: (1) conceptualization; (2) mental flexibility; (3) motor programming; (4) sensitivity to interference; (5) inhibitory control; (6) autonomy. Each of these items is scored from 0 (zero) to a maximum of 3. Thus, the maximum score of FAB is 18. A single well trained examiner administered this assessment. The instrument was carefully explained and pretrained shortly before its full application at the beginning and at the end of the five-week treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (baseline) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (in the third week).</time_frame>
    <description>An adapted version of the MMSE in Portuguese was used. This version included an 11-item examination that examined five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score that could be achieved was 30, while a mean score between 23 and 26 or between 26 and 29 would be expected according to the age and educational level (Crum et al., 1993) of the alcoholics. The instrument was also explained and pre-trained shortly before its full application at the beginning and at the end of the five-week treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (baseline) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (in the third week).</time_frame>
    <description>A structured multiple-choice questionnaire was used to assess the severity of depression symptoms. This instrument assesses the severity of symptoms observed in depression, such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and weight loss (Hamilton, 1960). The examiner must choose between the possible answers to each question by interviewing the patient and by observing the patient's symptoms. Each question has between 3 and 5 possible answers that increase in severity. In the original scale, the first 17 questions contribute to the total score, while questions 18 to 21 provide additional information about depression (e.g., diurnal variation, paranoid symptoms), but are not included in the total score of the scale. This scale was applied at the beginning and at the end of the five-week treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (baseline) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (in the third week).</time_frame>
    <description>A structured multiple-choice questionnaire (Hamilton, 1959) designed to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms was employed. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (e.g., mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (e.g., physical complaints related to anxiety). This scale was also applied at the beginning and at the end of the five-week treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (baseline) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (in the third week).</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated instrument of cross-culturally valid assessment of quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF) with 26 questions (1998; Skevington et al., 2004) translated to Portuguese (Fleck et al., 2000) was applied at the beginning and at the end of the five-week treatment. This instrument yields four domains (physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment) and two individually scored items regarding overall perception of quality of life (Q1, i.e., first question) and health (Q2, i.e., second question). The four domain scores are scaled in a way that higher scores stand for higher quality of life. These scores were transformed to be comparable with the scores used in the WHOQOL-100 (WHO, 1996)</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before tDCS treatment (baseline) and after the end of the tDCS treatment (in the third week).</time_frame>
    <description>Electrophysiological recording will be obtained through a 32-channel system (QuickAmp40, BrainProducts Ltd, Munich, Germany) using active electrodes with an integrated impedance converter for noise subtraction circuits (actiCAP BP; BrainProducts Ltd, Munich, Germany) placed on the scalp according to the International 10/20 EEG system. Data will be recorded with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, and analog filtered between 0.016 and 1000 Hz with common average reference.
The investigators adapted a cue-reactivity paradigm (LaRowe et al., 2007) following standard cue-reactivity paradigms well established for pictures (Prisciandaro et al., 2012) and videos (Volkow et al., 2011). During picture presentation the subjects will be asked to press a button whenever the crack-related pictures are presented, and to withhold the response when the neutral pictures are presented (50% of the time).</description>

    <description>Direct currents will be transferred via a pair of carbonated-silicone electrodes (35 cm2) with a thick layer of high conductive gel for EEG underneath them. The electric current will be delivered by an electric stimulator. To stimulate the left DLPFC, the cathode electrode will be placed over F3 according to the 10-20 international system while the anode will be placed over the contralateral F4 region. The currents will flow continuously for 20 minutes with an intensity of 2 milliamperes.</description>
