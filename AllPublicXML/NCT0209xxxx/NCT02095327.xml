      The purpose of our study is to better understand how caregivers of individuals with dementia
      cope with their family member's illness. If you are eligible for the study and would like to
      participate, we will schedule a one-time phone interview, which will last approximately 2
      hours for which you will be compensated for your time.

      Eventually, results of this study will be used to develop treatments that will hopefully help
      caregivers cope more effectively with managing dementia in a loved one.
