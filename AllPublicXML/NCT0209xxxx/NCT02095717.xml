      Multicenter randomized phase II study, double-blind, comparing Taxotere plus curcumin versus
      Taxotere plus placebo combination in first-line treatment of prostate cancer metastatic
      castration resistant. Assess time to progression (time to progression) of metastatic disease
      (from first day of treatment in the trial).

    <description>Assess time to progression (time to progression) of metastatic disease (from first day of treatment in the trial). Progression was defined as an increase (of) injury (s) tumor (s) (RECIST) or an increase in PSA levels (≥ 25% and ≥ 2ng/ml increase) or the appearance of new lesions metastatic (at least 2 new lesions for bone lesions).
