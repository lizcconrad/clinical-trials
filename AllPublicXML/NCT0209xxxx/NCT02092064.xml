      Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is also known recurrent polyserositis the most common
      hereditary recurrent febrile disorder. It is characterized by paroxysmal episodes of the high
      fever and signs of serositis-peritonitis, pleuritis, synovitis. Between these attacks,
      patients are usually asymptomatic. FMF mainly affects populations of the Mediterranean region
      such as Turks.

      The diagnosis of FMF may be extremely difficult to establish in the presence of atypical
      signs, and absence of family history . Colchicine is effective in most of the patients with
      FMF. The one the most important complications of FMF is the development of renal amyloidosis.
      It potentially progress sequentially through preclinical, proteinuric, nephrotic, azotemic
      and uremic stages to end stage renal disease if not treated properly with colchicine.
      Previous studies suggests that colchicine does not appear to be a major human teratogen, and,
      probably, has no cytogenetic effect.

      FMF affects females mainly in their childbearing years. FMF is associated with higher rates
      of recurrent abortion, premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and preterm birth. Despite of
      adverse outcomes have been reported in pregnants with FMF the outcome of pregnancies in FMF
      appear favorable with the healthy population since the usingof the colchicine. Although the
      effect of pregnancy on the course of FMF related amyloidosis is controversial, it is
      generally accepted that renal function may disrupt during pregnancy.

      Few studies have investigated the effect of FMF complications (amyloidosis and nephrotic
      syndrome) on pregnancy course.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of basal proteinuria on pregnancy outcome
      of patients with Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).
