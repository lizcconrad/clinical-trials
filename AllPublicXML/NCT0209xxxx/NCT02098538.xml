  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is an oral medication that can interfere with cancer cell growth and reduce the
      growth of blood vessels around tumors. This study will help find out if regorafenib is a
      useful drug for treating patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas. Regorafenib has been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in other cancers, but remains an
      experimental drug that has not yet been approved for use in adenoid cystic carcinoma.

      In this study, the patient will initially be treated with a dose of regorafenib that is lower
      than what the FDA approved for other cancers in an attempt to decrease the risk of side
      effects. It is possible that this lower starting dose may not be as effective as the higher
      FDA approved dose. If the patient does well with the lower dose for at least a month on
      treatment, the physician may consider increasing the dose to the FDA approved dose.

    <description>All eligible patients will receive a starting regorafenib dose of 120 mg daily taken orally for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle. Patients for whom regorafenib dose reduction was not performed or required may have their treatment dose increased to the FDA-approved dose of 160 mg daily orally for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle in cycle #2 or beyond (this is not mandatory). RECIST v1.1 tumor assessments will be made at baseline (CT or MRI) and then approximately every 2 cycles (or every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week)). After 10 months, imaging will be done every 3 cycles (or every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week)). Patients may remain on study until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma.
             Cancers arising from non-salivary gland primary sites are allowed.

          -  Patients must have recurrent and/or metastatic disease not amenable to potentially
             curative surgery or radiotherapy.

          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the end of prior systemic treatment (4 weeks
             for bevacizumab- containing regimens) or radiotherapy with resolution of all
             treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 (or tolerable grade 2) or
             back to baseline (except for alopecia, lymphopenia, or hypothyroidism). Any number of
             prior therapies for recurrent/metastatic ACC are allowed.

          -  Patients must have RECIST v1.1 measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that
             can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded
             for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Patients must have documentation of a new or progressive lesion on a radiologic
             imaging study performed within 6 months prior to study enrollment (progression of
             disease over any interval is allowed) and/or new/worsening disease related symptoms
             within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Note: This assessment will be performed by
             the treating investigator. Evidence of progression by RECIST criteria is not required.

          -  Patients must have archival tissue from the primary tumor or metastases available for
             correlative studies. Either a paraffin block or twenty unstained slides are
             acceptable. If twenty slides are not available, a lesser amount may be acceptable
             after discussion with the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alan L. Ho.

          -  Patients must agree to undergo biopsy of a malignant lesion. Biopsies do not need to
             be done if either the investigator or person performing the biopsy judges that no
             tumor is accessible for biopsy or that biopsy poses too great of a risk to the
             patient. Patients may also be exempt if frozen tumor tissue has been collected within
             12 months of study enrollment that the Principal Investigator deems is
             appropriate/sufficient for analysis on this protocol.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%,).

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (3 months) as determined by the investigator.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (3 months) as determined by the investigator.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed
             consent form. A signed informed consent form must be appropriately obtained prior to
             the conduct of any trial-specific procedure.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limits of normal (ULN) Alanine aminotransferase
                  (ALT) and aspartate amino-transferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects
                  with liver involvement of their cancer)

               -  Alkaline phosphatase limit ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with liver
                  involvement of their cancer)

               -  Lipase ≤ 1.5 x the ULN

               -  Amylase ≤ 1.5 x the ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the ULN or calculated creatinine

                  be allowed.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 2 weeks prior to the start of study drug. Post-menopausal women (defined as no
             menses for at least 1 year) and surgically sterilized women are not required to
             undergo a pregnancy test.

          -  Subjects (men and women) of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception beginning at the signing of the consent form until at least 3 months
             after the last dose of study drug. The definition of adequate contraception will be
             based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.

          -  Subject must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.

                  allowed if the medication dose and/or INR/PTT are not considered stable by the
                  treating physician. If the dose and/or INR/PTT are stable, therapeutic
                  anticoagulation with Vitamin-K antagonists is allowed with close monitoring.
                  Anticoagulation with heparin or heparinoids is allowed.

               -  Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

               -  Any hemorrhage or bleeding event ≥ NCI CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks prior to

               -  Subjects with a past or current diagnosis of another malignancy that will
                  interfere with conduct of the trial. Patients with past or current cancer
                  diagnoses other than ACC are allowed to enroll if the investigator believes it
                  will not interfere with trial conduct.
