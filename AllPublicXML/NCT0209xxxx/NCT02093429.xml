  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design includes a 3-dose randomization phase to determine effective doses of
      INCB047986 in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are refractory or unlikely to
      respond to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) followed by an extension phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After 50% of the subjects have completed 16 weeks of treatment (10 subjects in each dose
      group), a planned interim analysis will be conducted to determine which, if any, dose levels
      warrant further investigation based on observing at least 3 responses for hematologic
      improvement in erythrocytes (HI-E) and adequate safety and tolerability.

      Subjects who do not meet the response criteria for erythroid improvement may be treated with
      ESA in combination with INCB047986 for an additional 16 weeks.

      The study comprises:

      Screening: up to 4 weeks. Treatment Phase 1: at least 16 weeks of INCB047986. Treatment Phase
      2: at least 8 and up to 16 weeks of INCB047986 in combination with ESA if failed treatment in
      Phase 1.

      Extension Phase: Subjects receiving benefit from either therapy may continue indefinitely or
      until the study is terminated.

      Follow-Up: 30 (± 7) days after the last dose of INCB047986 is taken.

             respond to ESA therapy should meet one of the following criteria:

               -  ESA failure as defined by no improvement in Hgb of at least 1.5 g/dL after 8
                  weeks of at least 40,000 IU per week of EPO (or equivalent).

               -  Have a serum erythropoietin (EPO) of ≥ 500 IU and Hgb level &lt; 10.0 g/dL.
