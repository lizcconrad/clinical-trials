  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) accidentally
      leads to a side effect of brain inflammation. Patients with treatment resistant depression
      who are planning to take ECT will be subsequently approached to participate in the study.

    <textblock>
      The first scan will take place before the first ECT session. The second scan will occur after
      a minimum of six ECT sessions (average 2.5 weeks). Secondary measures will include mood
      symptom severity, neurocognitive measures, peripheral inflammatory markers and TSPO genotype.

      The hypothesis is that neuroinflammation will be increased by ECT.

      There will be no alterations to standard care of depressed patients due to participation in
      the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline and after average 2.5 weeks of ECT treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Scores on the 17-item HDRS will be taken at the time of the PET scan (baseline and post-ECT) to assess whether the magnitude of change in TSPO distribution volume is associated with changes in symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Neurocognitive Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after average 2.5 to 5 weeks of ECT treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive measures will be take at baseline and post-ECT to assess whether TSPO Vt is related to neurocognitive function. Neurocognitive battery includes:
Autobiographical Memory Interview-Short Form (AMI-SF) Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) Wisconsin Card Sorting Test Comprehensive Trail Making Test Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-Digit Symbol Subtest Stroop Color and Word Test Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Boston Naming Test Judgement of Line Orientation Weschler Test of Adult Reading</description>

    <description>To explore whether peripheral and central inflammation are related markers of peripheral inflammation (TNF-alpha, IL-6, CRP and IL-1beta) will be measured and correlated to brain TSPO Vt.</description>
