  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine how reducing the amount of simple sugars in the diet
      affects sweet taste perception. Healthy adult subjects will be assigned to either follow
      their usual diet, or to replace sugar calories with fats or starch.

      The investigators hypothesize that eating less sugar will:

        1. cause foods and drinks with a given amount of sugar to taste sweeter

        2. cause people to prefer lower levels of sugar in foods and drinks

    <measure>Change in Sweet Taste Intensity over Five Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly (for five months)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated the sweetness of pudding and beverage samples that varied in sucrose concentration during each study month to determine how perception changes over time with diet manipulations</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pleasantness Over Five Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly (five month participation duration total)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated hedonic value (degree to which the sample was pleasant) for model pudding and beverages that differed in concentration of sucrose once each month over five months to determine how perception changed over time with the diet manipulation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sucrose detection thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Every month (for five months)</time_frame>
    <description>Test of the minimum concentration of sucrose solution that subjects can discriminate from water. Forced-choice, ascending concentration method.</description>

    <description>BMI, calculated based on weight and height. This was measured both to balance treatment groups and to ensure that assigned diets maintained adequate energy balance (no change in BMI over the study was the ideal outcome for all groups)</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects met with a dietician who discussed diet records. After the first month (baseline, regular diet), the dietician made suggestions geared toward reducing calories from simple sugars by 40%. This will be achieved by replacing sugar calories with complex carbohydrates and fats, while maintaining energy balance (same number of calories as the baseline month).</description>

    <description>All subjects followed their usual diet during month 1. For months 2-4: sham diet intervention for the control group, 40% reduction in sugar calories for the experimental group. All subjects were allowed to chose any diet they wished during month 5.</description>
