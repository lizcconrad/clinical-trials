    <textblock>
      This is an open label study designed to examine the effects on concurrent administration of
      Radium Ra 223 dichloride and Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone in subjects with symptomatic
      castrate resistant prostate cancer and with bone metastases, in both the pre- and post-
      chemotherapy setting. Both medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      for this indication.

      Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled to obtain 30 evaluable subjects. All subjects will
      receive Radium Ra 223 dichloride every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses over 24 weeks and
      concurrent Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone for a minimum duration of 26 weeks.

      Subjects will be evaluated 30 days after the last dose of Radium Ra 223 dichloride. All
      adverse events deemed to be study related will be followed until resolution. Including
      screening, the total duration of the study is 32 weeks.

    <measure>Number and Percentage of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Improvement (Between Baseline and End of Treatment) in Quality-of-Life Determined by the Minimum Increase From Baseline in Scores as Per the QOL CMI Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects were evaluated at the screening visit, monthly during the study, and 30 days after the last dose of Radium Ra 223 dichloride, which will be approximately 32 weeks after the screening visit of evaluable subjects.</time_frame>
    <description>Following Quality of Life questionnaires were given at each visit:
FACT-P assesses symptoms/problems related to prostate carcinoma and its treatment. It is a combination of the FACT- General + the PCS (Range 1-156, higher scores better).
The FACT-General (FACT-G) is a 28 item QOL measure that provides a total score as well as subscale scores: Physical (0-28), Functional (0-28), Social (0-28), Emotional (0-24) Well-being, and Satisfaction with Treatment was not assessed for this study (The total range was between 1-108, higher scores better)
FACT-TOI is derived from the sum of the Physical Well-Being, Functional Well-Being, and Prostate Cancer subscale scores; a sensitive measure of patient-reported health (Range 1-104, higher scores better)
PCS is a 12-item prostate cancer subscale that asks about symptoms and problems specific to prostate cancer (Range 0-48, higher scores better).</description>

    <measure>Number and Percentage of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Improvement (CMI) in Pain (Between Baseline and End of Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects were evaluated at the screening visit, monthly during the study, and 30 days after the last dose of Radium Ra 223 dichloride, which will be approximately 32 weeks after the screening visit of evaluable subjects.</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in Bone Pain was assessed using the Bone Pain Inventory (BPI)
Pain Severity: Pain severity is the composite of scores of worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain now. CMI criteria: Decrease &gt;30% at two consecutive visits in Pain Severity Score in 24 hours without an increase in analgesic use.
Pain interference: Pain interference is the composite scores on general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relationships with others, sleep and enjoyment of life. CMI criteria: Decrease by 1.25 points or more compared with baseline at two consecutive visits.
Transient Pain Flare: Based on the work of Atkinson et al, a transient pain flare was assessed by pain at its worst in 24 hours. CMI criteria: &gt; 2 points on the BPI-SF Worst Pain scale and subsequent reduction after initiation of Ra-223 and during the first 3 cycles.</description>

    <description>Radium Ra 223 dichloride - A targeted alpha particle-emitting pharmaceutical (a radiopharmaceutical drug) is a ready-to-use solution for intravenous injection containing the drug substance radium dichloride. The active moiety is the alpha particle emitting nuclide Ra-223, present as a divalent cation (223Ra2+) and Abiraterone Acetate - A CYP17 inhibitor, indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Administration of Abiraterone Acetate may result in mineralocorticoid-related adverse events (AEs), due to CYP17 inhibition. Therefore, Abiraterone Acetate is administered in combination with Prednisone to reduce the frequency of these AEs.</description>

        <description>Following Quality of Life questionnaires were given at each visit:
FACT-P assesses symptoms/problems related to prostate carcinoma and its treatment. It is a combination of the FACT- General + the PCS (Range 1-156, higher scores better).
The FACT-General (FACT-G) is a 28 item QOL measure that provides a total score as well as subscale scores: Physical (0-28), Functional (0-28), Social (0-28), Emotional (0-24) Well-being, and Satisfaction with Treatment was not assessed for this study (The total range was between 1-108, higher scores better)
FACT-TOI is derived from the sum of the Physical Well-Being, Functional Well-Being, and Prostate Cancer subscale scores; a sensitive measure of patient-reported health (Range 1-104, higher scores better)
PCS is a 12-item prostate cancer subscale that asks about symptoms and problems specific to prostate cancer (Range 0-48, higher scores better).</description>
        <time_frame>Subjects were evaluated at the screening visit, monthly during the study, and 30 days after the last dose of Radium Ra 223 dichloride, which will be approximately 32 weeks after the screening visit of evaluable subjects.</time_frame>
        <population>Improvement at the EOT visit was defined as increase from baseline of &gt;= 10 points for FACT-P Total Scale. &gt;9 points for FACT-G Total and FACT-TOI scales, and &gt;=3 points for the remaining scales.</population>

Pain Severity: Pain severity is the composite of scores of worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain now. CMI criteria: Decrease &gt;30% at two consecutive visits in Pain Severity Score in 24 hours without an increase in analgesic use.
Pain interference: Pain interference is the composite scores on general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relationships with others, sleep and enjoyment of life. CMI criteria: Decrease by 1.25 points or more compared with baseline at two consecutive visits.
Transient Pain Flare: Based on the work of Atkinson et al, a transient pain flare was assessed by pain at its worst in 24 hours. CMI criteria: &gt; 2 points on the BPI-SF Worst Pain scale and subsequent reduction after initiation of Ra-223 and during the first 3 cycles.</description>
