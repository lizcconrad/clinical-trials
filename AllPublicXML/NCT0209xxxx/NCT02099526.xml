  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the study are to investigate the needs of older (age 60+) caregivers caring for
      adults with cancer at 1-week and 2 weeks following hospital discharge and to explore
      strategies that may assist caregivers in their home caregiving needs. This study will explore
      how these needs vary based on caregiver spirituality and relationship with the care
      recipient.

      The study will enroll cancer patients and their caregivers admitted to 9100 and 9300, which
      are the hematological and non-hematological malignancy units at Duke University Medical
      Center (DUMC) respectively. Results of this study will lay the groundwork for creating
      tailored interventions for caregivers that are compatible to their preferences and more
      responsive to their needs.

      Baseline demographic data about the caregiver and patient will be collected at patient beside
      prior to hospital discharge. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with the cancer
      caregivers in their home at 1-week after their loved one was discharged from the hospital,
      and at 2-weeks after discharge from the hospital. This study utilizes a qualitative
      descriptive design.
