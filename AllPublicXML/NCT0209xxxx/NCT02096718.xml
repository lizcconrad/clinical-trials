  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the influence of moderate to
      severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose afatinib in
      comparison to a control group with normal renal function.

      The assessment of safety and tolerability will be an additional objective of this trial and
      will be evaluated by descriptive statistics.

             investigators assessment, as based on the following criteria: a complete medical
             history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate

             and Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance, e.g.
             repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg (millimeter of mercury) or &gt;
             140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg, repeated measurement of
             pulse rate &lt; 45 bpm (beats per minute) or &gt; 90 bpm.

          -  Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease.

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological, dermatological or hormonal disorders.

          -  Relevant gastrointestinal tract surgery (except appendectomy).
