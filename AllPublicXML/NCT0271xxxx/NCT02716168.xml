  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background International guidelines underline the importance of strengthening the
      coordination and continuity of cancer care. The different roles of general practitioners and
      oncologists with regard to treatment, follow-up and rehabilitation during and after cancer
      treatment are often obscure to cancer patients. Parallel courses of healthcare are often
      taking place instead of coordinated care characterized by continuity and partnership between
      care providers. Patients may feel uncertain about the health professionals' skills and area
      of responsibility. Healthcare seeking and support during and after cancer treatment may,
      therefore, be inappropriate, leaving patients feeling insecure and lost between care
      providers.The study aims to design and evaluate a new way of communication and shared
      decision-making that brings the patient, the oncologist and general practitioner together in
      a shared video-consultation in the early phase of chemotherapeutic treatment. The effect of
      the intervention in addition to usual care will be tested in a randomized controlled trial at
      Vejle Hospital in the Region of Southern Denmark. Based on sample size calculation,
      investigators intent to include 300 patients at the Department of Oncology and their general
      practitioners. Results and process outcomes will be evaluated qualitatively and
      quantitatively, questionnaires to patients, general practitioners and oncologists, and data
      from registers.
