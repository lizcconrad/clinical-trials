  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to elucidate the relationship between inflammation and
      lipoprotein atherogenicity, and to determine the relative contribution of inflammation and
      lipids to CV risk in RA. The central hypothesis of this study is that inflammation and
      lipoprotein atherogenicity is tightly linked such that both factors are important to assess
      CV risk in RA. Further, the investigators hypothesize that this relationship is obscured by a
      consideration of routine lipids alone.
