    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is the evaluation of system accuracy following ISO 15197:2013
      (E), clause 6.3 in which accuracy requirements and applicable test procedures for blood
      glucose monitoring systems intended for self-monitoring of blood glucose by patients are
      stipulated.

      However in this study, system accuracy evaluation will be performed for Hemocue Glucose 201+
      and Hemocue Glucose 201 RT which are both glucose monitoring systems for professional use
      only on behalf of the IDT with one reagent system lot for each BGMS.

      Main goal is the evaluation of system accuracy of both of the hemocue Systems. (english)

    <description>System accuracy criteria
Following ISO 15197:2013 (E), the BGMS shall meet both of the following criteria:
Criterion A: 95 % of the measured glucose values shall fall within either ± 15 mg/dl (0.83 mmol/l) of the average comparison measurement result at glucose concentrations &lt; 100 mg/dl (5.55 mmol/l) or within ± 15 % at glucose concentrations ≥ 100 mg/dl (5.55 mmol/l).
Each lot shall pass acceptability criterion A.
Criterion B: 99 % of individual glucose measured values shall fall within zones A and B of the Consensus Error Grid (CEG) for type 1 diabetes.</description>
