        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  20 - 80 years of age (in full)

          -  A definite Meniere's disease patient according to the diagnostic criteria of AAO-HNS
             (1995), who has had 2 or more episodes of rotary dizziness lasting more than 20
             minutes within the last 3 months (12 weeks) and 1 or more episodes of hearing loss
             recorded by audiometry, and has tinnitus or ear fullness.

          -  For female subjects with the possibility of pregnancy during the study period, a
             subject whose urine pregnancy test result was negative at the time of the screening
             visit. A subject in menopause for at least one year, one who has no possibility to
             become pregnant through surgery, or one who effectively uses an acceptable
             contraceptive measure. A subject who definitely agreed to use an adequate
             contraceptive measure during the clinical study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient with the history of ear surgery

          -  A patient with the history of endolymphatic sac surgery

          -  A patient who used steroids or gentamycin in the eardrum within the last 6 months

          -  A patient to whom Isobide was administered within 3 months at the time of screening

          -  A patient who has an infection in the ear, paranasal sinuses or the upper airway
             system

          -  A patient who has a disease, other than Meniere's disease, that manifests as
             repetitive dizziness (e.g. Migrainous vertigo, vertebrobasilar transient ischemic
             attack, acoustic neuroma)

          -  A patient who has acute intracranial hematoma (If this drug is administered to a
             patient suspected of having an acute intracranial hematoma without checking for the
             existence of an intracranial hematoma, bleeding that had been stopped temporarily by
             brain pressure can occur again when intracranial pressure is reduced. Thus, eliminate
             the cause of bleeding and administer the drug after ensuring that there are no
             concerns of rebleeding)

          -  A patient with anuria (with urinary output of less than 100 mL/day)

          -  A severely dehydrated patient (loss of 10% or more of body weight)

          -  A patient with acute pulmonary edema

          -  A patient with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or higher)

          -  A patient with an adrenal tumor

          -  A patient with pheochromocytoma

          -  A patient who is hypersensitive to the ingredients of the test and control drugs

          -  A patient with a hereditary disease such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactose
             deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption

          -  A woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  A patient who is deemed ineligible for this clinical study by the analyst
