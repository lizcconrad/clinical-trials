  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most common and distressing symptoms in teenage and young adult cancer
      patients. Despite this, there has been virtually no research evaluating treatment for
      cancer-related fatigue in this young patient group. The investigators are undertaking a small
      qualitative study to co-design a fatigue intervention, that will then be evaluated in future
      research to assess its effectiveness.

    <textblock>
      This small qualitative study will involve 7-10 patients who are within one year of completing
      cancer treatment, as well as some parents. Participants will be recruited from one centre,
      the Cambridge Teenage and Young Adult cancer Principal Treatment Centre. The three phases
      will involve a) participants being interviewed individually and attending a focus group, b)
      patients receiving the prototype co-designed intervention, and c) participants being
      interviewed after the intervention to provide feedback to allow further refinement of the
      intervention. The intervention will be delivered by an Allied Health Professional in the
      setting that participants have chosen. It is likely to involve, at a minimum, education about
      fatigue and support with increasing activity. It will not include administration of any
      medication.
