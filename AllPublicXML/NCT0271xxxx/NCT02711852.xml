    <textblock>
      This long-term, continued treatment study will evaluate the long-term safety of duvelisib in
      patients with hematologic malignancies that were previously treated with duvelisib in a
      previous sponsor-approved study.

      Study IPI-145-23 is an international, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study
      designed to evaluate the long-term safety, clinical activity and overall survival data of
      duvelisib in patients with hematologic malignancies. Only subjects who have participated in a
      previous duvelisib study that are approved by the sponsor will be allowed to enroll in the
      study.

      Enrollment is undetermined as multiple duvelisib studies are allowed to rollover active
      subjects with Verastem's approval. Subjects in active treatment and subjects in survival
      follow-up are allowed to rollover to this study. For subjects on active treatment, subjects
      will continue the same dose from their previous duvelisib study and will take duvelisib twice
      daily (BID) for 28 day continuous cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      For subjects in survival follow-up, subjects will continue to be followed for survival in
      this study for the duration outlined in their previous duvelisib study.
