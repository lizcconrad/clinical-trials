    <textblock>
      Adolescents with concussion will be randomly assigned to a treatment group where they will
      receive sub-threshold exercise, or assigned to a placebo group where they will receive
      structured stretching exercises. Both groups will receive standard medical coverage with
      regular clinic visits. All participants will record symptoms daily on a dedicated web site.
      All participants will be evaluated at time 1 with (1) structured physical exam, and (2)
      structured exercise stress test which is terminated when there is symptom exacerbation. The
      primary outcome measure is time to recovery where recovery is defined as (1) asymptomatic for
      two consecutive days, and (2) ability to exercise to exhaustion without exacerbation of
      symptoms, and (3) confirmed by a physician based on a structured physical exam.

    <description>Participants will receive an exercise prescription based on their heart rate threshold (HRT) for symptom exacerbation during the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT). The script will ask the participant to exercise one a day for 20 minutes at 80% of HRT. Participants will wear a smart watch to monitor their frequency, actual time and HR during exercise. Treatment will continue until participant is fully recovered from their concussion. Intervention: Sub-Threshold exercise prescription</description>
