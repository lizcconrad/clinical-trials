  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single-center, randomized, prospective cohort study is to evaluate the
      clinical outcome and negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) mediated modulation of the
      biologic milieu of a modified NPWT dressing on split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a prospective randomized trial in which subjects will be
      assigned to a modified negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressing or standard moist
      dressing. The investigators will measure the percentage of re-epithelization at set
      postoperative time intervals using digital photography, pain using the visual analog scale
      (VAS), and healing quality using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). The investigators
      hypothesize that the NPWT will lead to less pain and increased re-epithelization in a shorter
      postoperative time course. This specific aim seeks to prove/disprove that patients who
      receive a modified NPWT dressing perceive the advantage with improved healing, pain, shorter
      length of stay, and other wound symptoms related to delayed donor site wound healing.

      The donor site for STSGs provides a consistent model of superficial wounds that offers the
      opportunity to study both mechanisms of wound healing and potential mechanisms of action of
      NPWT. In patients undergoing both standard dressings and NPWT, the investigators will sample
      the wound exudate and perform microbiopsies of the healing wound at fixed intervals and
      perform histologic and molecular analysis in order to quantify the degree of
      re-epithelization and the trophic and inflammatory profile of the healing wound.

    <description>In the experimental group, a microporous silver-impregnated foam with a thin silicone contact layer (Mepilex Ag) will be applied. A macroporous foam layer (V.A.C. GranuFoam) and an occlusive dressing (V.A.C. Drape) will then be applied to cover the foam, plus 3-5cm border of intact skin. The occlusive dressing will then be pinched and a 2cm hole will be cut to apply the SensaT.R.A.C. Pad that supplies pressure from the NPWT unit. NPWT will be applied at 125mmHg throughout treatment using KCI's InfoV.A.C. Therapy Unit. The donor site dressing will be replaced on postoperative day 5-7 and a new occlusive dressing (Tegaderm) will be applied.</description>
