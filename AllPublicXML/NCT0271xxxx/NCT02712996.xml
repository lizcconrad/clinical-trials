  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether Vyvanse, a psychostimulant, can
      help children ages 6-16 with attention deficits due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Vyvanse
      is currently approved for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity (ADHD). The exact
      effects this drug may have on adults with attention deficits caused by TBI have been
      investigated prior. The exact effects this drug may have on children with attention deficits
      caused by TBI are not known, but the investigators expect that Vyvanse will be of some help
      in treating this population as well.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of inattentiveness, impulsivity, and poor persistence have been observed in children
      following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These often are among the most prominent symptoms
      manifested and may contribute to interference in a variety of other functional domains.
      Although there has been some use of psychostimulant medication to treat TBI-acquired
      attention deficits, it remains a relatively uncommon clinical practice. This study, by
      highlighting mechanisms of action, could serve to promote the appropriate use of this type of
      treatment for the patients.

    <measure>Assessing sustained attention and response inhibition in children using Vyvanse versus Placebo by measuring preservations on the Conners Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Preservations represent responses in which reaction time was less than 100 ms; these responses are assumed to be anticipatory, random, or slow/inattentive (i.e., carried over from the previous response) because it is physiologically impossible to respond accurately in so short a time. Higher T-scores, percentiles, and means indicate worse performance.</description>

    <measure>Assessing sustained attention and response inhibition in children using Vyvanse versus Placebo by measuring Hit Reaction Time (RT) Block Change on the Conners Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Block Change measures inattention and vigilance. Lower values indicate less slowing in RT as the test progressed. High T-scores indicate decreased vigilance over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing sustained attention and response inhibition in children using Vyvanse versus Placebo by measuring RT Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) on the Conners Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) Change assesses the ability to adapt to changing inter-stimulus intervals. Inter-stimulus intervals refers to the amount of time between presentation of stimuli. High t-scores indicate that RT increased as the ISI increased; negative values indicate that RT decreased as the ISI increased.
Less Hit RT ISI Change indicates less variability in RT depending on the speed of presentation.</description>

    <measure>Assessing sustained attention and response inhibition in children using Vyvanse versus Placebo by measuring RT Standard Error (SE) on the Conners Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conner's Continuous Performance Task (CPT-II) measure sustained attention and response inhibition.
CPT-II Hit Reaction Time (RT) Standard Error (SE) measures inattention. Consistency of response times is measured by the standard error for responses to targets. Higher values indicate a greater amount of inattention.</description>

    <measure>Assessing working memory and concentration in children using Vyvanse versus Placebo by measuring performance on the Digit Span subtest of the Wechler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fifth Edition (WISC-V)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Digit Span repeats strings of digits of increasing length said by the examiner in the same (forward) and in reverse (backward) order. It measures working memory and concentration with a range of scaled scores from 1-19, with higher scaled scores indicating better performance when compared to population norms.</description>

    <measure>Assessing severity of symptoms associated with ADHD in children when using Vyvanse versus placebo by administering the Conners-3 Parent and Self-Report Forms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Conners-3 Parent and Self-Report Forms are assessment tools that prompts an observer to provide valuable information about the client. This instrument is helpful when considering a diagnosis of ADHD or related problem. High scores on the &quot;Inattention/Memory Problems&quot; sub-scale may indicate difficulty in concentration, difficulty planning or completing tasks, forgetfulness, absent-mindedness, and/or being disorganized.
T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) are used to measure ratings with higher t-scores indicating greater inattention and memory problems. When a t-score is around 60, this indicates greater risk.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing executive functioning in children when using Vyvanse versus placebo by administering the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF is a standardized rating scale developed to observe everyday behaviors associated with specific domains of the executive functions in children. It is to be administered to children of age and parents of children participating in the study. The scores will be compared within-subject, i.e., when an individual child is taking Vyvanse for six weeks versus when he/she is taking placebo for six weeks, and also between-subject, i.e., collectively comparing executive performance assessment in children with TBI-related attention deficits using Vyvanse versus taking a placebo.</description>
