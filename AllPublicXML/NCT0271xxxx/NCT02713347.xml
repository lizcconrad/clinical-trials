  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common
      serious illnesses. Despite disease-specific medical care for CHF and COPD, people with either
      illness are often left with poor quality of life (i.e., burdensome symptoms, impaired
      function). Furthermore, while CHF and COPD are leading causes of hospitalization and
      mortality, few people with either illness engage in advance care planning, the process of
      considering and communicating healthcare values and goals. The investigators are conducting a
      randomized clinical trial to study a symptom management, psychosocial care and advance care
      planning intervention to improve quality of life. The study is important because it aims to
      improve quality of life and provision of care according to peoples' goals and preferences in
      common, burdensome illnesses. Furthermore, this study will generate information that supports
      the broader dissemination and implementation of the intervention and informs the development
      of future palliative care and team-based interventions in the VA.

    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have
      commonalities that make them ideal for early palliative care provided alongside
      disease-specific treatments. Quality of life is reduced in both illnesses because, despite
      disease-specific treatments, the same symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, fatigue) often
      persist in CHF and COPD. Quality of life is also reduced because between 50-60% of people
      with either illness have clinically significant depressive symptoms. Finally, while CHF and
      COPD are leading causes of hospitalization and mortality, few people with either illness
      engage in advance care planning. Providing palliative care concomitantly with other medical
      care offers an important opportunity to improve quality of life and advance care planning for
      people with CHF or COPD. For other conditions such as lung cancer, when provided early, prior
      to the end of life, palliative care improves quality of life, depressive symptoms, and
      survival while reducing health care utilization. While palliative care has been well-studied
      in patients with advanced cancer, it has not been adequately studied in CHF or COPD. The goal
      of this proposal is to determine whether the benefits of early palliative care extend to CHF
      and COPD.

      The investigators developed and demonstrated early success with a patient-centered palliative
      care intervention to improve quality of life (i.e., symptoms, function) and advance care
      planning in CHF and COPD. The intervention consists of the following components: (1)
      algorithm-guided management of breathlessness, fatigue, and pain, provided by a nurse; the
      algorithms supplement disease-focused treatments with palliative and behavioral treatments;
      (2) a 6-session psychosocial care program targeting adjustment to illness and depression,
      provided by a social worker; and (3) engagement of patients and providers in advance care
      planning. The nurse and social worker are teamed with a palliative care specialist and
      representative primary care provider in brief weekly meetings. The team is integrated into
      primary care through nurse interaction with primary care providers and through electronic
      medical record (CPRS) communication.

      The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness and implementation study.
      Population-based sampling methods will be used to enroll 300 Veterans with CHF or COPD who
      have poor quality of life and are at high risk for hospitalization or death. The primary aim
      is to test the effectiveness of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial
      (intervention vs. enhanced usual care) in two VA health care systems. In a secondary aim, the
      investigators will examine the implementation of the intervention to guide future
      implementation and dissemination, increase the relevance to operational partners, and
      maximize the effectiveness of subsequent palliative care and team-based interventions.

      Aim 1: Determine the effect of the intervention on (a) quality of life as a primary outcome,
      and (b) depression, symptom burden, advance care planning communication and documentation,
      disease-specific health status, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality
      as secondary outcomes.

      Aim 2: Examine the implementation of the intervention.

      Aim 2a: Assess the degree, barriers, and facilitators of implementation of various
      components. Identify which intervention components and processes are most critical from the
      perspectives of patients, intervention team members, and primary care providers whose
      patients received the intervention.

      Aim 2b. Evaluate the resources (e.g., personnel time and other costs) associated with the
      intervention, and estimate the resources needed for implementation and maintenance in other
      VA settings.

      The proposed study is significant because it addresses patient-centered needs in illnesses
      that are major sources of disability. The study is innovative because it tests the
      effectiveness of palliative care in CHF and COPD, leading causes of death among Veterans. In
      addition, the intervention is integrated into primary care, and the intervention components
      are structured to ease replication, implementation, and dissemination.
