  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) features symptoms related to a decreased cardiac autonomic
      response, pulmonary function and exercise capacity.

      Non-pharmacological interventions are low cost and can significant enhance outcomes in these
      patients. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been proposed as a viable
      therapeutic approach in patients with functional limitations, particularly those that present
      with difficulty to perform exercise protocols.

      Objective: to evaluate the impact of NMES on exercise capacity, spirometry values and quality
      of life of patients with PH.

      Material and methods: prospective randomized controlled study with a control group (GC, n9)
      and NMES goup (GE, n8). Quality of life and exercise capacity through the six-minute walk
      test (6MWT) were assessed before and after the NMES protocol.

      Results: the GE presented with a significant improvement in distance walked in the 6MWT,
      cycle ergometry, spirometry and quality of life in the areas of vitality, emotional and
      social aspects of the questionnaire Short Form Health Survey-36.

      Conclusion: NMES is a useful tool in the treatment of patients with PH, resulting in improved
      exercise capacity, quality of life and lung function testing.

    <description>Receiving the usual care and guidance on their illness, underwent 30 minute NMES sessions twice a week for two months using an electrostimulator. Specifically, 5 cm adhesive surface electrodes in four alternate channels on the Rectus Femoris (two channels the right and two on the left) were used to deliver two-phase symmetrical currents, with a rectangular pulse wave at a frequency of 35 Hz and pulse duration of 250 μ. The time of ascent and descent was one second, contraction time was four seconds and relaxation was eight seconds.</description>
