  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 36-month multi-center randomized effectiveness trial to compare
      the impact of an Enhanced Usual Care (Control) intervention, with Exercise Coaching
      (Exercise), on Fragility Fractures and Serious Fall-Related Injuries (FF/SFRI) in patients
      with a previous fragility fracture (FF).

      The investigators will also examine the impact of the intervention on several secondary
      outcomes like: loneliness, physical function, and bone strength. The investigators will do
      this by following a Pragmatic trial design: 1) limiting exclusions to increase
      representativeness, 2) limiting research contacts (average 30 min/year) and 3) limiting
      measures to those practicable for use in usual care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will be held in churches, community centers, and senior residential
      facilities. Investigators will work with the exercise sites to recruit up to 125 individuals
      (5 per exercise site location) to serve as the Group leaders at each site location. Group
      leaders will be trained on the exercises and leadership roles to help lead the group. The
      investigators will ask them to come at least once per week, so the time commitment is
      minimal.

      The investigators will be recruiting 2100 patients who have suffered a fragility fracture and
      will randomly assign them to one of two conditions: (A) Control Group - Enhanced Usual Care
      and (B) Intervention Group - Enhanced usual care plus Exercise coaching that includes
      in-person and phone coach contacts to encourage and support strength, balance and walking
      activities.

    <measure>Number of Participants experiencing Fragility Fractures and Serious Fall-Related Injuries (FF/SFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Every 4 months the investigators will call the participants asking questions about the main outcome, FF/SFI. A fall calendar will be given to the participant to record all fall events (e.g., date, location). This will help participants to recall falls during the 4 month period. In addition, this will allow medical records to be requested, using a signed authorization form (part of the consent form). The investigators will review all relevant Electronic Health Records (EHR) information, such as hospital and emergency department discharge summaries, outpatient visit notes, consultation notes, physical exam notes, dictated radiologist notes and plain film radiography.</description>

The investigators will also search the electronic health record for any use of osteoporosis medications, in case they are not recalled by participants. Other medications will be asked at each time point as well, as certain medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) are known to strongly increase fall risk</description>

    <description>For month one of the exercise intervention the investigators will conduct only strength and a few balance exercises to rehabilitate the participants. After the first month, and once the participants feel comfortable, the investigators will incorporate aerobic and additional balance exercises. The investigators will personalize participant programs based on baseline levels and increase them gradually. The exercise session will be conducted 50 minutes 3 times a week. Between sets there is a 60-second break.
Every month the coach will record steps from the pedometer and record patient adherence to exercise sessions, and every 2 months the coach will measure strength and will track resistance band color from the exercise trackers.
For the individuals exercising at home, the investigators will distribute the exercise Digital Versatile Disc (DVDs) every 9 months and the coach will continue to contact them, just as if they were joining the group. Coaches will encourage group participation.</description>
