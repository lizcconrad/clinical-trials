  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective analysis of all patients receiving TAVI in the United Kingdom (UK). Stroke
      rates following TAVI are roughly 3%. There are several device and procedure related
      characteristics which may increase the risk of stroke. We will examine if there is a signal
      in the UK registry. This will be important is TAVI is to be extended down to lower risk
      patient cohorts.

      Factors to be examined include (but not limited to):

      need for Pre-procedure Balloon aortic Valvuloplasty (BAV) Need for two valves need for
      post-dilatation need for rapid ventricular burst pacing

    <description>Stroke, defined as new neurological deficit with corresponding change on CT scan of brain, is a self reported event following TAVI. All centres performing TAVI in the United Kingdom are required to report this to the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) registry which is being analysed in this study</description>
