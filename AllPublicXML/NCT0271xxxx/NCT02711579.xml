  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the purposes of this study are to evaluate the acute electrophysiological response in brain
      cortex to single oral dose of celecoxib (400mg once) in healthy volunteer and the
      electrophysiological alteration in brain cortex by long-term treatment of celecoxib (200mg
      twice-daily for 7 days) in healthy volunteer

      Inflammatory response is considered as defense mechanism against physical or infectious
      insults and also prevails within the central nervous system. Following certain kinds of brain
      injuries (i.e trauma, ischemia, hypoxia and seizure), innate immunity and subsequent adaptive
      immunity subserve the robust inflammatory cascades, leading to excitatory synaptic networks.
      Cellular elements, such as neuron, microglia as well as inflammatory molecules
      (cyclooxygenase2, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, etc) play essential roles in
      enhancing this process.

      In line with these, compelling evidences in animal studies in epilepsy field indicate that
      celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) has anticonvulsant actions, although its mechanisms are not fully
      understood. Thus, oral administration of Celecoxib in human has a high potential to suppress
      the neuronal excitability. As a milestone for the big picture, current study is going to
      prove the changes of cortical excitability evoked by transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) and
      electroencephalographic properties revealed by EEG in healthy volunteer, given that power
      spectral analysis of EEG and several parameters of TMS , can detect the small changes of
      neuronal activities by celecoxib.
