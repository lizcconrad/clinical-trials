  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using radiation therapy can help to
      control the cancer after the disease has gotten worse after receiving immunotherapy.

      This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA approved and
      commercially available methods. It is considered investigational to use radiation therapy in
      patients whose disease has gotten worse after receiving immunotherapy.

      The study doctor can explain how radiation therapy is designed to work.

      Up to 150 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups and Radiation Therapy:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive radiation
      therapy. The radiation oncologist will decide what type of radiation you receive. Depending
      on the type of radiation that is chosen for you, you may receive radiation anywhere between 4
      days to 3 weeks. The study doctor will discuss what type of radiation you will have and how
      often you will receive it. You may be receiving sub-therapeutic doses of radiation.

      Within 7 days before you begin radiation therapy, you will have radiation simulation to plan
      radiation treatment. During radiation simulation, you will go through the motions of
      receiving radiation (though you will not receive radiation) to help you understand the
      radiation process. This will also help the doctor know where to &quot;aim&quot; the radiation when you
      receive radiation. This may take up to 1 hour.

      Study Visits:

      At start of your radiation therapy and then every 4-12 weeks while you are on study:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan. You will not have these scans the day after
           you receive radiation therapy.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive radiation for up to 3 weeks. However, you will continue to have study visits
      every 4-12 weeks. You will continue having study visits unless the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the follow-up visits
      for 1 year.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 30 days after the study stops or you decide to withdraw from the study, you will have a
      physical exam and you will be asked about any side effects you may have and if you have had a
      change in medication. If you cannot come to MD Anderson for this visit, a member of the study
      staff will call you. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      Follow-Up:

      About every 12 weeks for up to 1 year, you will be asked about any side effects you may have
      had and your medical history will be recorded. If you cannot come to MD Anderson for this
      visit, a member of the study staff will call you. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      After 1 year of follow up, you will continue to have follow-up as part of your standard of
      care (collecting information about any side effects you may have and your medical history).
      If the follow-up is at another hospital, the information about your medical history, physical
      exam, lab tests, PET, MRI, or CT scans will be sent to MD Anderson for review.

    <description>Radiation treatment utilized in this trial consists of standard doses to 50 Gy in 4 fractions with stereotactic radiation or 60-70 Gy in 10 fractions (6-7 Gy/fraction,) or 20-30 Gy in 5 fractions or 20-30 Gy in 5 fractions or 30-45 Gy in 10-15 fractions with conventional external beam radiation.
Low dose radiation allowed on the other tumors. This will consist of a single dose of radiation on the last day of higher dose of radiation in which the primary tumor is being treated. This low dose radiation will use a range of doses (from 200cGy-30cGy).
Patients may receive additional radiation therapy consisting of either stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or conventionally fractionated radiation after the 2nd imaging evaluation as long as at least stable disease is noted.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer

          2. Progressive disease via RECIST 1.1 on prior study or standard of care therapy
             utilizing an immunotherapy agent OR a clinical status that requires salvage radiation

          3. Be within 6 months (+/-1 week) between last dose of an immunotherapy agent and study
             enrollment. *a. Patients may continue with maintenance immunotherapy as part of
             standard of care therapy while receiving radiation.

          4. Have at least one site of metastatic disease amenable to radiation. All lesions
             amenable to radiation may be irradiated at the discretion of treating Radiation
             Oncologist, depending on the location, size and number of lesions.

          5. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          6. Be &gt;/= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          7. Have a performance status of 0-2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             performance scale.

          8. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 28 days prior to first fraction of radiation. *Note: If the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required.

          9. We will allow prior radiation to other sites, with no washout period, prior to study
             entry as long as the high dose regions of the prior and proposed radiation fields do
             not overlap.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other rheumatologic disease which in
             the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy.

          2. Has had prior radiation therapy within the past 3 months where the high dose area of
             the prior radiation would overlap with the high dose area of the intended radiation
             based on the judgment of the treating radiation oncologist.

          3. Has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a
             previous treatment. *Note: Subjects with permanent &lt;/= Grade 2 toxicities (e.g.
             neuropathy) or toxicities corrected through routine medical management (e.g. thyroid
             replacement for hypothyroidism) are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for
             the study. **Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered
             adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to
             starting therapy. ***Note: Subjects with asymptomatic &lt;/= Grade 2 laboratory or
             dermatologic abnormalities are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the
             study pending the judgment of the treating radiation oncologist.

          4. Has an active infection requiring intravenous systemic therapy or hospital admission.

          5. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          6. Is pregnant or expecting to conceive or within the projected duration of the trial,
             starting with the screening visit through 60 days after the last fraction of
             radiation.
