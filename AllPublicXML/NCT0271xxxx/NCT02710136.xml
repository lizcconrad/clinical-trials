      This research is being done to look at the body's response to cockroach extract, an allergen,
      when sprayed into the nose. The spraying of the cockroach extract into the participant's nose
      is called Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of a intranasal cockroach extract given to participants with asthma.

      This is a multi‐center, open label pilot study to assess the safety and determine the
      feasibility of cockroach nasal allergen challenge in children with asthma. This pilot study
      will occur in two phases:

        -  Phase 1 will enroll 10 cockroach sensitive adults with asthma who will undergo a nasal
           allergen challenge with increasing doses of cockroach allergen. Phase 1 will consist of
           two parts, Phase 1a and Phase 1b. In Phase 1a, participants will undergo a nasal
           allergen challenge. In Phase 1b, participants will undergo a repeat nasal allergen
           challenge to assess reproducibility of the NAC with cockroach allergen in a population
           with asthma. The data from Phase 1a will be used to identify a range of doses that is
           safe and elicits a threshold of nasal symptoms (TNSS ≥8).

        -  Phase 2 will enroll 25 cockroach sensitive children with asthma ages 8‐14 years who will
           undergo a nasal allergen challenge using the dose range identified in Phase 1a.

      Study mandated procedures include: blood draws (venipuncture); pulmonary function testing
      (PFTs); nasal allergen challenge (NAC); allergen skin testing; and peak expiratory flow.
