  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PATHway system is designed to help patients remain physically active and maintain a good
      cardiovascular health. It proposes a novel approach that aims to empower patients to
      self-manage their CVD, set within a collaborative care context with health professionals.
      This will be achieved via a patient-centric holistic approach that specifically addresses the
      above barriers. It involves an internet-enabled and sensor-based home exercise platform. It
      is represented by several modules with an exercise module as the core component which will
      provide individualized rehabilitation programs that use regular, socially inclusive exercise
      sessions as the basis upon which to provide a personalized, comprehensive lifestyle
      intervention program (managing exercise, smoking, diet, stress, alcohol use etc.) to enable
      patients to both better understand and deal with their own condition and to lead a healthier
      lifestyle in general.

      The goal of this trial is to assess the acceptability, short-term effectiveness on lifestyle
      and health related physical fitness and cost-effectiveness of the PATHway intervention in
      patients with CVD in a single blind multicentre pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT).

    <description>Patients allocated to the PATHway intervention will be given a 4 week run-in period as an outpatient to get acquainted with the system. During this run-in period, the PATHway system will also be installed in each participant's home. They will be provided with a training manual and a quick set up guide for getting started with PATHway in the home.
After this 4 week run-in period, the PATHway system will be set up for each individual patient including a patient specific exercise prescription. The patient will then exercise with the PATHway platform for 6 months.</description>
