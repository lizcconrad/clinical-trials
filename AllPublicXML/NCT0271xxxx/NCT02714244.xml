  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic function may be evaluated by different measurements on transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE). They include mitral inflow velocities obtained by pulsed-wave doppler
      (PW) : peak early diastolic velocity (E) and late diastolic velocity (A). Mitral annulus
      velocities, early diastolic (e') and late diastolic (a') are obtained by tissue doppler
      imaging (TDI). The ratio E/e' reflects left ventricular filling pressure and, as such, might
      be a predictor of fluid responsiveness.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of the mitral valve E/e' ratio for
      fluid responsiveness among patients undergoing coronary bypass graft surgery. Fluid
      responsiveness being defined as an increase in stroke volume of ≥ 15%.

      After induction of anesthesia, patients will have their diastolic function evaluated by means
      of E/e' and other measures. They will then be administered an intravenous bolus of 500 mL of
      Lactate Ringer® along with passive leg raising (PLR). Stroke volume and fluid responsiveness
      will be assessed by the thermodilution method (Swan-Ganz catheter) and the FloTrac® device.
      Fluid responders will be compared to non-responders to evaluate the relationship between E/e'
      ratio and fluid responsiveness.
