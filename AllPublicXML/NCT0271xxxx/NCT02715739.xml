      Research question Is there a difference in the mortality prediction performance of two ICISS
      approaches for trauma patients admitted to hospitals in urban India?

      Study design The investigators will conduct a retrospective registry based study.

      Setting The data that will be used is from a prospective cohort study named towards improved
      trauma care outcomes in India (TITCO). It was collected from four public university hospitals
      in India between October 2013 and January 2015. The hospitals are in Mumbai, Delhi and
      Kolkata. The two centers in Mumbai were King Edward Memorial Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak
      Municipal General Hospital. The one in Delhi was Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center and
      the one in Kolkata was the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research and Seth
      Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital.

      The data was collected by one trained project officer at each hospital, working eight-hour
      shifts with a rotating schedule between day, evening and night shifts. Data from patients
      admitted outside of the shift hours was collected retrospectively within days of arrival to
      hospital. The patients were followed until discharge, death or to a maximum of 30 days. If
      discharged, the patients were considered to be alive at 30 days. There was no follow-up after
      patient discharge or after the 30 days.

      Source and method of participant selection Project officers included consecutive patients
      that presented to participating hospitals. Patients were included either by direct
      observation during the project officers' shifts or by retrospective data extraction from
      patient records.

      Data sources/ measurement Patient mortality data was extracted from patient records, as was
      data on all covariates. If covariate data was missing in records an attempt was made to
      retrieve this data from the patient or patient relatives. The injury data was extracted from
      patient records, including imaging reports and intraoperative findings. Protocols from
      post-mortem examinations were not available. Injuries will be coded using ICD-10. The SRR for
      an ICD-code will be calculated by dividing the number of fatal outcomes for each ICD-code by
      the total number of patients with that ICD-code. This results in a number from 0 to 1 that is
      interpreted as the patient survival ratio.

      For example, if 65 out of 100 patients with a given ICD-code survived the SRR for that code
      would be 0,65. That would mean 65% of the patients with that ICD code survived. In this
      study, the SRRs used for ICISS calculations were taken from a publicly available SRR-set
      calculated from the TITCO dataset (TO BE RELEASED). The ICISS for each patient will then be
      calculated using two different approaches. The cICISS will be calculated as the product of
      all of the patient's SRRs. The swiICISS will be equal to the patient's lowest SRR. Both ICISS
      methods result in a number that ranges from 0 to 1 that should be interpreted as the patient
      specific probability of survival.

      Bias The project officers were trained by project management. They were not involved in
      patient care and only acquired data by observing hospital staff, using patient records or
      from patient relatives. All project officers had at least a health science master's degree
      and were continuously supervised by project management. Injury coders will be blinded to
      patient demographics and mortality data during the conversion from free-text injuries to
      ICD-codes and will be trained prior to the ICD-10 coding using the World Health Organization
      (WHO) ICD-10 online training module. They will gain access to the injury dataset first after
      reaching 80% agreement in several samples of 50 injuries compared to an external coder.

      Study size The sample size calculation is based on published recommendations on effective
      sample sizes needed to validate prediction models. These recommendations are based on
      simulations of the sample sizes needed to detect statistically significant differences in
      predictive performance measures between two scores setting the power to 80% and the
      significance level to 5%. Hence, the required sample size was calculated to include the most
      recent 200 consecutive events, i.e. patients who died within 24 hours, and all non-events
      enrolled during the same time period. Mortality within 24 hours for was used for the sample
      size calculation as the investigators wanted the study to be powered for secondary outcomes
      also.

      Quantitative variables All quantitative variables will be analyzed as continuous.

      Statistical methods and analyses The investigators will use R for all statistical analyses.
      Predictive performance will be assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration.
      Discrimination will be assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating
      characteristics curve (AUROCC) and calibration will be assessed by comparing observed and
      predicted outcomes visually in a calibration plot and statistically by calculating the
      calibration slope. Confidence intervals for predictive performance measures will be estimated
      using a bootstrap approach (15).

      Overlapping confidence intervals will be interpreted as evidence of lack of a statistically
      significant difference. Parametric and non-parametric exact tests will be used as
      appropriate, with 95% confidence intervals and a 5% significance level. The main analysis
      will be a complete case analysis, in which observations with missing values in any of the
      following variables will be excluded: time of arrival, age, sex, mechanism of injury,
      transfer status, and outcome variables. Observations with no injuries reported will be
      assigned ICISS scores of 1 and for each observation the final ICISS scores will be calculated
      based only on SRRs for ICD-codes that occur at least ten times in the published SRR-set used
      in this study.

      The published SRR-set includes SRRs based on both mortality within 30 days, henceforth
      referred to as SRR-30D, and SRRs based on mortality within 24 hours, henceforth referred to
      as SRR-24H. The investigators will use these SRRs to calculate cICISS and swiICISS for each
      patient, henceforth referred to as cICISS-30D, cICISS-24H, swiICISS-30D and swiICISS-24H.
      Finally, the investigators will assess and compare the performance of cICISS-30D and
      swiICISS-30D in predicting mortality within 30 days and within 24 hours, and repeat this
      analysis for cICISS-24H and swiICISS-24H.

      Sensitivity analyses Four sensitivity analyses will be conducted. In the first sensitivity
      analysis the investigators will only include observations with complete outcome data, however
      missing values in covariates were allowed. In the second sensitivity analysis the
      investigators will exclude observations without any reported injury. In the third sensitivity
      analysis the investigators calculated cICISS and swiICISS based on all available SRRs,
      regardless of how frequently the corresponding ICD-10 codes occurred in the dataset. Finally,
      the investigators calculated the two ICISS scores for each patient based only on unique
      ICD-10 codes. In other words, each ICD-10 code was only allowed to contribute with one SRR to
      the ICISS scores even if it occurred more than once in the same patient.
