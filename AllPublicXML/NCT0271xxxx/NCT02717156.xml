  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab
      work in treating patients with urothelial (bladder) cancer that has spread from the primary
      site to other places in the body or has come back and does not respond to certain
      chemotherapy drugs. Combinations of biological substances in recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion
      protein may be able to carry tumor-killing substances directly to urothelial cancer cells.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells
      to grow and spread. Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab together
      may be a better treatment for patients with urothelial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of using pembrolizumab-recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein
      (sEphB4-HSA) combination in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

      II. To measure the overall survival (OS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the progression-free survival (PFS). II. To measure the objective response rate
      (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1),
      programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2) and EPH receptor B4 (EphB4) expression by tumor
      cells (TC) as well as immune cells (IC)- macrophages and T cells- in tumor tissue and
      correlate them with ORR, PFS and OS.

      II. To examine the tumor tissue T cell frequency (counts), tumor tissue T cell clonality
      using T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, and peripheral blood T cell clonality, pre-treatment
      and post-treatment and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS.

      III. To measure the phenotype of lymphocytes and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), in
      pre and post-treatment blood samples and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS; an extra blood
      sample for future studies will also be collected and banked.

      IV. To examine peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for enumeration and molecular
      analysis in pre and post-treatment blood samples, and correlate these with ORR, PFS and OS.

      V. To collect and bank tumor tissue. VI. To examine the role of adding positron emission
      tomography (PET) to a contrast computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of response to
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15 and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6-12
      weeks.
