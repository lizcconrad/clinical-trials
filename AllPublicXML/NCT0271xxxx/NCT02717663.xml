  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop adaptive (AI) and micro-incentive (MI) interventions
      and test them against static (SI) and delayed-incentive (DI) interventions in a 4-arm
      randomized factorial trial to increase MVPA adoption and maintenance among inactive adults.
      Using neighborhood walkability and socioeconomic status, participants will be recruited from
      four neighborhood types: &quot;high walkable/high SES,&quot; &quot;high walkable/low SES,&quot; &quot;low
      walkable/high SES,&quot; and &quot;low walkable/low SES.&quot; We will evaluate synergistic or antagonistic
      effects of interventions and neighborhood factors on MVPA adoption by 12 months and
      maintenance by 24 months.
