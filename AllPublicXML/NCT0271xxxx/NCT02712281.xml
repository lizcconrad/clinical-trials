    <textblock>
      The Autism Managing Eating Aversions and Limited variety (MEAL) Plan is a group-based parent
      training intervention designed to assist parents in increasing the variety of foods eaten in
      children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The goal of the Autism MEAL Plan is to include
      specific techniques to manage mealtime behavioral challenges and introduce new foods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Autism Managing Eating Aversions and Limited variety (MEAL) Plan is a structured
      parent-mediated, group-based intervention to reduce mealtime disruptive behavior, expand
      dietary diversity and reduce parental stress associated with moderate food selectivity in
      young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

      Children ages 3-8 with a diagnosis of ASD who present with moderate food selectivity and
      associated problem behavior will be screened for inclusion in the study. Following consent
      and screening procedures, parents of eligible children will be assigned to a group-based
      parent training (Autism MEAL plan) or group-based parent education. Each parent will receive
      1.5 hours of intervention per week for 10 weeks by a masters or doctoral level clinician.

      Data will be collected on parental compliance with the Autism MEAL plan and the food
      acceptance of the child as well as nutritional intake, and refusal behaviors. Child
      participants will also be included in parent-child dyad in-vivo feedback sessions. Parents
      assigned to parent education will be able to cross-over to receive the Autism MEAL Plan
      following completion of post-study measures.

      The first aim of the study is to finalize the Autism MEAL Plan materials (e.g., role-play
      activities, activity sheets and video examples). This includes standardizing therapist
      scripts in line with the revised curriculum and creating new video examples that coincide
      with practice worksheets. Home recording (e.g., personal camera phone) to document and
      present home meal data will also be added to the curriculum.

      The second aim is to evaluate the feasibility of the Autism MEAL Plan versus parent education
      in 40 children (20 per treatment assignment) with ASD and moderate feeding problems.

      The final study aim is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the Autism MEAL Plan in
      expanding food diversity, decreasing disruptive behavior and reducing parental stress
      compared to Parent Education. Methods of evaluating this aim include direct observation,
      parent ratings of behavior, food intake and stress, as well as blinded clinician ratings,
      height, weight and BMI.

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale measure of overall change of Parent Target Problems (the child's two most pressing problems at screening, as reported by parents), using scores from the Clinical Global Impressions - Severity scale (CGI-S). Scores range from 1 (Very Much Improved) through 4 (Unchanged) to 7 (Very Much Worse).</description>

    <description>A 154-item parent-rating of food selectivity. It includes seven food categories (fruits, vegetables, proteins, starches, dairy, miscellaneous/snack, combination foods. The food selectivity score = the number of foods reported as &quot;never&quot; consumed divided by 154 X 100. We will also derive a food acceptance score = the number of food items endorsed as accepted divided by 154 X 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in nutritional intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of follow-up (up to 18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional intake will be assessed by parents recording the child's daily intake on a food diary for 3 days prior to the Baseline, Week 10, Week 14, and Week 18 visits. A nutritionist (blind to treatment assignment) will tally the child's intake of selected vitamins and nutrients (vitamins A, C, D, and E, zinc, calcium, iron, fiber, fat, protein, carbohydrates, and total energy [kcal]) to determine the overall level of each micro- and macro-nutrient. The total number of nutrient deficiencies will be determined using cut points. The evaluation of change in nutritional status will be assessed by averaging the levels of each nutrient across groups.</description>

    <description>The Autism MEAL plan includes education on feeding issues and behavior management, and specific strategies to expand dietary diversity. Each parent receives 1.5 hours of intervention per week for 10 weeks by a masters or doctoral level clinician. The first three sessions focus on understanding feeding problems and behavior management strategies in children with ASD.The next seven sessions include child-specific feeding interventions, based on parent-report and home data collection of child meal time behavior. To promote application of new skills, homework accompanies each lesson.
