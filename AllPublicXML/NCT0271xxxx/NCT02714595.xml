      This study is designed to provide evidence of efficacy of S-649266 in the treatment of
      serious infections in adult patients with either hospital-acquired pneumonia
      (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP),
      complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), or bloodstream infections (BSI)/sepsis caused by
      carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.

          5. Patients with infection requiring &gt; 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment (eg, bone and
             joint infection, endocarditis)

          6. Patients with cystic fibrosis or moderate to severe bronchiectasis

          7. Patients in refractory septic shock defined as persistent hypotension despite adequate
             fluid resuscitation or despite vasopressive therapy at the time of Randomization

             carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative infection for a continuous duration of more than 24
             hours in cUTI, or 36 hours in HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI/sepsis during the 72 hours leading
             to Randomization

         12. Patients with any condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the study data
