      In this project, we derive survival risk ratios (SRR) based on International Classification
      of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) injury codes to validate the ICD Injury Severity Score (ICISS)
      in data from four public university hospitals in India.

      Introduction

      In 2013 trauma was estimated to cause 4,8 million deaths, which is more than HIV/AIDS,
      tuberculosis, malaria and maternal conditions combined (1). Ninety per cent of these deaths
      occur in lower-middle income countries (LMIC) and an estimated two million lives could be
      saved annually by improved quality of care (2,3). India is considered a lower-middle income
      country with over 1 million annual trauma deaths (1). In 2020 trauma is estimated to be the
      third leading cause of death in the country (4). Hence, efforts to strengthen trauma care in
      India are urgently needed.

      Trauma patients constitute a heterogeneous population, making trauma research and outcome
      comparison over time and between contexts difficult but important (5). Accounting for factors
      such as selection bias, difference in care and case mix is crucial for correct conclusions
      (6,7).To enable this several tools or scores have been developed including the Injury
      Severity Score (ISS) and the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) (8,9). The use of these
      scores as part of quality improvement programmes has been associated with improved trauma
      care (10).

      In ISS and TRISS the severity assigned to each injury is based on expert consensus. In
      contrast, the international classification of disease (ICD) injury severity score (ICISS) was
      developed using a more data driven approach (9,11). This score is based on survival risk
      ratios assigned to ICD injury codes to estimate an individual patient's probability of
      survival. According to a recent systematic review ICISS outperforms ISS derived methods (12),
      but so far almost all research on ICISS is from high income countries. Therefore, our
      research question is, does an Indian version of ICISS predict mortality in four public
      hospitals in urban India?

      Study design

      We will conduct a retrospective registry based study to derive and temporally validate a new
      version of ICISS.

      Setting

      We will use data from an ongoing prospective cohort study called Towards Improved Trauma Care
      Outcomes (TITCO) in India that started in four public university hospitals across urban
      India. The four centres are Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in Mumbai, King Edward
      Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center in Delhi, and the
      Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research and Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial
      Hospital in Kolkata. The data used in this study was collected between October 2013 and
      January 2015.

      Trained project officers conducted all data collection. The project officers had a health
      master's degree or higher education. They worked eight hours a day and rotated between day,
      evening and night shifts. There was one project officer for each hospital. The project
      officers where continuously supervised and trained by project management. Patients were
      followed up until discharge, death or 30 days, whichever came first.

      Source and method of participant selection

      Project officers included all consecutive patients that fitted the eligibility criteria. Data
      for patients admitted during the project officers' shifts were collected using a combination
      of direct observation and extraction from patient records. Data for patients admitted outside
      of their shifts was collected retrospectively from patient records within days of patient
      arrival. All patients discharged before 30 days where considered alive at 30 days.

      Data sources/measurements

      Data on covariates were extracted from patient records or from the patients or their
      accompanying relatives. Injuries were also extracted from patient records, including imaging
      reports and operation notes and were then coded using ICD-10. We will calculate the SRR for
      to each unique ICD-10 code using SRR=A/(A+B), where A denotes the number of surviving
      patients with a specific ICD-code and B is the number of non-surviving patients with the same
      specific ICD-code. The calculated SRR gets a value between zero and one. One represents 100%
      survival and zero represents 0% survival. We will calculate the final ICISS score for each
      patient as the product of all individual SRRs. Hence, ICISS also ranges from 0 to 1 and
      should be interpreted as the patient's probability of survival. This method is commonly
      referred to as the conventional ICISS.

      Bias

      The personal collecting the data were observers and did not take part in the actual care.
      During the conversion from injuries in free text to ICD-10 codes the coders will be blinded
      to patient demographics and outcomes. ICD-10 coding will be done after completing World
      Health Organization (WHO) ICD-10 online training module and after achieving over 80%
      agreement in several samples of 50 injuries compared to an external coder.

      Study size

      We will use all available data from TITCO and create a temporal split sample, using the
      earlier data for derivation and the most recent data for validation. These two samples are
      henceforth referred to as the derivation sample and validation sample respectively. We will
      first estimate the required sample size of the validation sample to include the most recent
      200 consecutive events, i.e. patients who died within 24 hours, and all non-events enrolled
      during the same time period.

      We use mortality within 24 hours for our sample size calculation as we want the study to be
      powered for secondary outcomes also. This effective sample size will allow us to detect a
      significant difference in discrimination and calibration of ICISS between derivation and
      calibration samples at 80% power and a 5% significance level. We will include all remaining
      patients in the derivation sample.

      Quantitative variables

      We will analyse all quantitative variables as continuous.

      Statistical methods and analyses

      The derivation and validation of ICISS will be conducted as two separate steps, described
      below. We will use R for all statistical analyses. We will assess predictive performance in
      terms of discrimination and calibration. Discrimination will be assessed by calculating the
      area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) and calibration will be
      assessed by comparing observed and predicted outcomes visually in a calibration plot and
      statistically by calculating the calibration slope. Confidence intervals for predictive
      performance measures will be estimated using a bootstrap approach.

      We interpret overlapping confidence intervals as evidence of lack of a significant
      difference. Parametric and non-parametric exact tests will be used as appropriate, with 95%
      confidence intervals and a 5% significance level. Our main analysis will be a complete case
      analysis, in which we exclude observations with missing values in any of the following
      variables: age, sex, mechanism of injury, transfer status, and outcome. Observations with no
      injuries reported will be assigned an ICISS of 1 and for each observation the final ICISS
      will be calculated based only on SRR for ICD-codes that occurred in at least 10 observations
      in the derivation sample.

      Derivation

      We will derive SRR in the derivation sample for each of the outcomes and used them to
      calculate ICISS for each patient. In other words, we will calculate one set of SRR for
      mortality within 30 days, henceforth referred to as SRR-30D, and one set of SRR for mortality
      within 24 hours, henceforth referred to as SRR-24H. We will then calculate two ICISS for each
      patient. We will use similar denotation to refer to these ICISS, i.e. ICISS-30D and
      ICISS-24H. Finally, we will assess the performance of ICISS-30D in predicting mortality
      within 30 days and within 24 hours, and repeated this analysis for ICISS-24H.

      Validation

      We will use the SRR-30D and SRR-24H that we derive in the derivation sample to calculate
      ICISS-30D and ICISS-24H in the validation sample. We will then assess the performance of
      ICISS-30D in predicting mortality within 30 days and within 24 hours, and the performance of
      ICISS-24H in predicting mortality within 30 days and within 24 hours. Finally, the
      performance of each model in the validation sample will be compared with the same model's
      performance in the derivation sample.

      Sensitivity analyses

      We will conduct four sensitivity analyses. In the first sensitivity analysis we will include
      observations with missing values in covariates but with complete outcome data. In the second
      sensitivity analysis we exclude observations without any reported injury. In the third
      sensitivity analysis we will calculate ICISS based on all available SRR, regardless of how
      frequently the corresponding ICD-10 codes occurr in the dataset. Finally, we will calculate
      ICISS for each patient based only on unique ICD-10 codes, in other words, each ICD-10 code
      will only be allowed to contribute one SRR to ICISS even if it occurrs more than once in the
      same patient.
