      alone and in combination with chemotherapy.

      This will be a 3-arm, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized biomarker trial in patients
      with advanced, treatment-naive NSCLC. Patients will receive 1 of 3 possible cohorts as per
      investigator's discretion. Patients with non-squamous histology may receive any of the 3
      cohorts; patients with squamous histology may receive either cohorts 1 and 2.

      Somatic mutations leading to cancer are related to endogenous or exogenous DNA damaging
      processes. The resultant mutations can be separated into two categories - (i) mutations that
      provide selective advantage for clonal expansion and (ii) mutations that do not result in
      growth advantage [12]. The latter have been termed passenger mutations, while the former are
      referred to as driver mutations. It is widely believed that the number of driver mutations in
      a cancer sample is limited to a handful, usually two or more but less than ten [13]. In
      contrast, the genome of a cancer can harbour more than a million somatic mutations [14] most
      of which are considered to be passengers.

      Several studies have shown that the passenger mutations may not be oncogenic drivers but may
      be of importance in adaptive immune resistance of a tumor. In particular the relevant
      mutations are likely to be the nonsynonymous exonic mutations in tumors; these may give rise
      to novel proteins that differ from their wild type counterparts and are immunogenically more
      relevant (reviewed in [10]). The study will explore if there is a relationship between the
      genetic mutations and the success of pembrolizumab.
