  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study will compare measurements made with Necklace device for stroke volume/cardiac output
      with values from a FDA-approved reference device. The gold standard that will be used is
      Cardiac MRI. Subjects will be measured with both the Necklace, reference device, and the
      Cardiac MRI. Values calculated by the Cardiac MRI analysis will be compared with the
      reference device and the Necklace.

      reference device and the Necklace.

      The Cardiac MRI will be received ~1-4 days after the measurement is completed. The data will
      be compared with data collected from the Necklace and the reference device during the study.
