      The purposes of this study are (1) to determine whether child nutrition-focused adoption
      encouragement messages focused on Quality Protein Maize (QPM) and the availability of small
      quantities of QPM seed can be effective at increasing QPM adoption and health outcomes for
      young children, and (2) to determine whether consumption encouragement messages and
      techniques (e.g., containers for earmarking) can be effective at increasing QPM targeting to
      and health outcomes for young children.

    <description>Households in the Adoption Encouragement Treatment group were visited between March and April 2015 and offered &quot;child nutrition focused&quot; adoption encouragement. Both the male household head and the primary female caregiver were invited to attend these meetings (though the household head is the primary target), where the nutritional benefits of Quality Protein Maize (QPM) adoption for children were emphasized along with the agronomic properties. In addition, the fact that only small amounts of QPM are necessary to nourish children was highlighted and small seed bag sizes were offered. During the adoption encouragement visit, we offered the option to order up to three 2 kg bags of QPM for free.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving the Adoption Encouragement Treatment, households in the Consumption Encouragement Treatment group received additional information, targeted to the caregiver, and tools for separating Quality Protein Maize and targeting it to young children in the household in August 2015. They will additionally receive further guidance in February 2016.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Households with at least one child in the 6-35 month age range in August 2015, who had at
        least one household member attend a field day demonstrating Quality Protein Maize, and who
        provided informed consent for participation and data collection were eligible for
        inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Households in the study areas that do not have a member who attends a field day
        demonstrating Quality Protein Maize or who do not have a child in the appropriate age range
        are excluded from the study. Furthermore, households where the mother or children did not
        intend on staying in the region for the study duration (until the completion of the endline
        survey) were excluded from the study. Finally, we excluded participants who do not have
        access to land for crop cultivation.
