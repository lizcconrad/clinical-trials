      This study aims to detect serum metabolite changes, as well as other health indicators with
      the intervention of air purifiers on a randomized, crossover, double-blind trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized double-blind crossover trial among 60 healthy
      college students in Shanghai, China from November to December, 2015. These students lived in
      dormitories that were randomized into two groups and alternated the use of true or sham air
      purifiers for 9 consecutive days with a 2-week wash-out interval. All participants and
      research staffs were blinded to the group assignment. All participants were required to stay
      in their dormitory with the windows/doors closed for at least 50% of the time on weekdays and
      for 80% on weekends throughout the 9-day intervention period. All interventions started at 7
      a.m. to avoid issues related to diurnal variation. Health endpoints, including blood
      pressure, fractional exhaled nitric oxide were evaluated and biological samples such as
      morning urine, fast blood and buccal cells were collected at baseline and immediately after
      the completion of each intervention period.

          <title>Real Air Purification</title>
          <description>Participants in this group received an intervention of true air purifiers placed in the center of the room.
Real Air Purification: The 17 dormitory rooms and their residents were randomized into two groups: the intervention and control group. The intervention group went through a 9-day intervention with an air purifier placed in the center of the room. All rooms in this group used the same qualified air purifiers (model KJEA200e, 3M), and all participants were required to stay in their dormitory rooms as much as possible with the windows/doors closed throughout intervention period. All participants and research staffs were blinded to the group assignment.</description>

          <description>Participants in this group received an intervention of sham air purifiers, which were under the same conditions as the true purifiers except the filter gauze in them were removed.
Sham Air Purification: This group went through a 9-day intervention with a sham air purifier (with its filter gauze removed) placed in the center of the room. All rooms used the same air purifiers (model KJEA200e, 3M) as the intervention group, except the filter gauze was removed. During the study period all participants were required to stay in their dormitory rooms as much as possible with the windows/doors closed. All participants and research staffs were blinded to the group assignment.</description>
