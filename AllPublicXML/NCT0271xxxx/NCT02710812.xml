      The proposed study is an observational, prospective, multicenter study of patients undergoing
      neoadjuvant therapy for medium-low rectal cancer.

      Recently the investigators have published the findings of a multicenter Italian phase II
      study showing that the rate of local recurrence, with a 3 year follow-up, is less than 5% in
      patients with baseline T2-3 mid-low rectal cancer who, after preoperative chemoradiotherapy
      (pCRT), showed a major clinical response and underwent a transanal local excision. Based on
      these results, an organ-sparing approach for patients showing a major clinical response is
      feasible without reducing the good results obtained with the standard treatment. While a
      phase III trial is the best way to compare the standard treatment with the organ-sparing
      approach (local excision or wait-and-see) it is impracticable and likely unethical. An
      observational study is therefore one of the best way to evaluate the impact that an
      organ-sparing approach may have on oncological outcomes, quality of life, and bowel function
      for patients with rectal cancer who, after a pCRT, show a clinical major/complete response.

      This phase II trial is designed to test the hypothesis that conservative treatments, in
      patients with low-mid rectal cancer who undergo a major or complete clinical response after
      neoadjuvant treatment, will be safe and effective compared to standard surgery.

      The investigators will compare rectum-sparing approaches to standard surgery, firstly in
      terms of rate of organ preservation at 2 years. Additionally they will compare survival
      outcomes (DFS, OS), stoma rates, clinical and tumor factors related to pathological complete
      response, correlation between major and complete clinical response.

      To add value, the investigators will measure QoL in patients treated with rectum-sparing
      approaches in comparison to patients treated with standard surgery (TME or abdomino-perineal
      amputation).

      Rectum-sparing approach can be considered clinically acceptable if percentage of conservation
      of the rectum at two years is not less than 50%.

      The collected data on 164 patients who underwent &quot;rectum-sparing&quot; allow to test the
      hypothesis that the rectum is preserved in 60% of patients with 80% power (exact binomial
      test for proportions, alpha = 5 %, 1 tail) and the study will be considered positive if it
      obtains a frequency of conservation of the rectum of not less than 87 cases.

      The analysis results will be reported in accordance with STROBE guidelines (von Elm et al.,
      2008). For all analyzes, continuous variables are described using the mean and standard
      deviation of position and appropriate measures when appropriate. Categorical variables will
      be described using the contingency tables.

      Introduction and rationale Neoadjuvant therapy, especially preoperative chemoradiotherapy
      (pCRT) and short-course radiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME), is the
      standard of treatment for mid-low rectal cancer. This approach significantly reduces the rate
      of local recurrence compared with surgery alone, with post-operative radiochemotherapy or
      with long-course radiotherapy alone.

      Concerning the indication to neoadjuvant treatment and its regimen, there is still a wide
      discrepancy in the literature. Based on the dutch TME trial, showing a low rate of local
      recurrence in patients treated with short-course radiotherapy (RT) compared to TME alone, the
      neoadjuvant therapy indication for rectal cancer was RT short-course alone. Meanwhile, with
      German trial publication, the indication for rectal cancer treatment, up to 15 cm from anal
      verge, was combination between hyperfractionated RT and 5-fluorouracil based chemotherapy
      (CT). Two subsequent trials (Polish trial and Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group trial)
      showed that RT short-course alone and CRT with hyperfractionated RT have similar oncological
      outcomes. Thus, in recent years there has been an increasing interest in the administration
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy at therapeutic doses and not only radiosensitizers. Regimens are
      basically as follows: induction regimen and consolidation regimen. In the first case, CT
      precedes pCRT, while in consolidation regimen CT follows pCRT. The rationale for this
      strategy is that, currently, the mortality of rectal cancer comes from distant metastases
      and, given that only a full dose chemotherapy can prevent the occurrence of distant
      recurrence, the rationale for having chemotherapy as early as possible and in as many
      patients is feasible (patient compliance performing adjuvant chemotherapy is low, often for
      complications arising from surgery). More recently, studies have been published on the use of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone and is currently underway in the US the PROSPECT trial
      evaluating the possibility of using the only neoadjuvant chemotherapy in selected cases
      instead of the classic CRT. For many reasons (enrolment of patients in clinical trials,
      refusal of patients to perform treatments considered standard and toxicity from radio and/or
      chemotherapy) is not uncommon in clinical practice to observe patients who performed
      unconventional treatments and not provided by any national or international guideline.

      Positive and negative consequences of neoadjuvant treatment Neoadjuvant treatment followed by
      TME involve a high percentage of side effects associated with surgical complications both
      early and late, the toxicity associated with radiation or chemotherapy and alteration of
      bowel function, sexual, fecal continence and thus the quality of life (QoL). Among the
      advantages of neoadjuvant therapy, particularly the treatment associated CRT, it is notable
      that in 15-20% of cases have the disappearance of the primary tumor, or a pathologic complete
      response (pCR). Also lengthening the interval between pRT and/or CT and surgery is associated
      with an increased rate of pCR, therefore, unlike traditional 4-6 week intervals between the
      end of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, currently there is tendency to perform surgery after
      8-10 weeks, or even after 12 weeks. In patients with a pCR after neoadjuvant therapy, it have
      been showed a better outcome in long term than those who have a residual disease.

      Rationale behind the rectum-sparing approach In order to avoid the morbidity and functional
      sequelae associated with neoadjuvant therapy followed by TME and based on excellent outcomes
      seen in patients with a pCR, it has been proposed that, in patients with a major clinical
      (mCR) or complete (cCR) response, you can opt for a conservative approach that includes
      preservation of the rectum. During recent years we are seeing a growing interest in these
      conservative approaches, as demonstrated by the increasing number of publications on this new
      therapeutic strategy that includes observation (&quot;wait and see&quot; policy) and local excision.

      Local excision. LE is considered essentially an excisional biopsy and the decision to observe
      the patient (only follow-up) or run a TME after LE depends on the histologic features.
      Patients with no neoplasia (pCR) or with minimal residual disease (ypT1 with tumor regression
      grade &lt;3 margins and free) are followed with close follow-up. In the remaining cases it opts
      for a subsequent intervention of TME. Studies concerning LE after neoadjuvant treatment are
      numerous with the principal lack is to be retrospective, with a low number and definition is
      not always clear and concordant for mCR and cCR. In addition, all these studies include
      patients who can not be subjected to radical surgery due to medical comorbidities or who
      reject the radical surgical treatment, especially when it is expected the final packaging of
      a stoma. More recently were published prospective studies both phase 2 and phase 3 that have
      consistently shown that LE is a feasible approach with oncological results comparable to the
      standard approach.

      Among these studies, it is worth highlighting the presence of a multicenter Italian Phase 2
      (Pucciarelli et al, 2013). The authors have shown that the rate of local recurrence, with a
      median follow-up of 3 years, is less than 5% in patients with cancer of the rectum medium-low
      cT2-3 that, after pRT and/or CT, have reported a major clinical response and were then
      subjected to LE. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Padua and later by the
      ethics committees of the other three participating centers. The indications to LE of this new
      trials are the same as in the previous study.

      Wait-and-see. This second approach was designed and developed in Brazil, but it is widely
      spread throughout the world.

      Compared to EL, this approach avoids the entire operation and consequently complications
      related to LE. However, while LE appears indicated in all patients with cCR and mCR,
      wait-and-see approach is required when there is a cCR. The reason for the different
      indication is that the probability that there is a correlation between cCR and pCR is very
      high; unlike the correlation between mCR and pCR it is much lower. As shown by scientific
      papers published on this topic (Smith et al,...), there is a risk of about 20% that a
      response considered complete it is actually not. Non-operated patients should therefore
      undergo a strict follow-up in the course of which, in case there is a recurrence of disease
      (recurrence), you run the TME rescue. Even for this approach they have been published many
      studies that have shown on one hand that wait-and-see approach is safe in patients who
      achieve a cCR after neoadjuvant therapy; on the other hand, if disease persists, surgery,
      defined &quot;rescue surgery&quot;, leads, in any case, to local control and percentage of OS and DFS
      completely similar to traditional treatment.

      As things stand, there are no studies comparing the two conservative options. The difference
      between them, based on the results published, are related to the indications: in case of LE,
      patients are included both with mCR and cCR, whereas wait-and-see approach includes only cCR
      patients.

      This phase II trial is designed to test the hypothesis that conservative treatments, in
      patients with low-mid rectal cancer who undergo a major or complete clinical response after
      neoadjuvant treatment, will be safe and effective compared to standard surgery.

      Patients will enrol into trial if they will show mCR or cCR at restaging after 7-8 weeks from
      the end of RT and/or CT; if the response is confirmed at second restaging (11-12 weeks), the
      patient will be eligible for conservative treatments. If the response is poor after
      neoadjuvant therapy, seen at first or after second restaging, it is fully recommended to
      undergo standard surgical treatment.

      The investigators will compare rectum-sparing approaches to standard surgery, firstly, in
      terms of rate of organ preservation at 2 years. Additionally, they will compare survival
      outcomes (DFS, OS), stoma rates, clinical and tumor factors related to pathological complete
      response, correlation between major and complete clinical response.

      To add value, the investigators will measure quality of life (QoL) in patients treated with
      rectum-sparing approaches in comparison to patients treated with standard surgery (TME or
      abdomino-perineal amputation).

      The investigators' recent pubblication (Pucciarelli et al, 2013) and experience provide the
      basis for producing a new multicenter observational trial that can add important information
      to rectum-sparing approaches in locally advanced rectal cancer patients, highlighting the
      relationship between neoadjuvant treatment, clinical response and conservative surgical
      approaches.

      Study Design The proposed study is an observational, prospective, multicenter study of
      patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for medium-low rectal cancer.

      The investigators opted for an observational study since the Phase 2 study has been completed
      and Phase 3 studies are objectively, as many Authors report, difficult to perform patients
      enrollment.

      Since this is an observational study that has the aim to evaluate the effectiveness of
      conservative approaches after neoadjuvant therapy in terms of capacity preservation of organ,
      they were not given directions on the type of radio and/or chemotherapy treatment. Patients
      will be enrolled in the study only when patients are candidates (as shown in the studies
      published on the subject) to a conservative approach. The &quot;registration&quot; of all patients is
      only meant to evaluate how many patients are potentially candidates for conservative
      treatment who are undergoing neoadjuvant treatment (secondary endpoint of study). The
      collection of data concerning the staging of the tumor and basal schemes neoadjuvant therapy
      aims to identify what type of cancer and what type of neoadjuvant therapy are associated with
      a higher number of pathological complete responses (secondary endpoint). Finally, for
      patients who show a cCR, is leaving the ability to run both LE and wait-and-see approach, as
      the current state, there are no data indicating which option is best in terms of both
      oncological results and rate of organ preservation.

      Study aims

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the rate of organ preservation at 2 years
      in patients with rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy followed by conservative
      treatment (LE and wait-and-see). Secondary, the study seeks to:

        1. Determine the rate of overall survival (OS), disease-free (DFS) and relapse-free local
           recurrence at 2, 3, and 5 years after initiation of treatment;

        2. Determine the rate of patients without stoma at 2 and at 5 years;

        3. Determine the clinical and tumor factors related to treatment and associated with a
           pathologic complete response (pCR) of the primary tumor;

        4. Determine the rate of pCR in patients who are treated with LE and with conventional
           surgery (TME);

        5. Determine the correlation between major or complete clinical response and pCR;

        6. Determine the morbidity and mortality after neoadjuvant therapy and conservative
           approach or TME;

        7. Determine the percentage of patients undergoing conservative treatment on total patients
           running pRT and/or CT;

        8. Evaluate the impact of the type of treatment on the ability to perform a preoperative
           treatment rectum-sparing;

        9. Evaluate the impact of surgical approach on bowel function, fecal continence and quality
           of life (QoL)

      Clinical Evaluation and Staging Clinical and pathological primary Tumor, regional Nodes,
      Metastasis (TNM) stages are determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
      7th Edition and for histological grade of adenocarcinoma according to World Health
      Organization (WHO).

      It will be a staging baseline (before any treatment). Patients candidates for pRT and/or CT
      will be recorded. After the end of pRT and/or CT patients will restage at 7-8 weeks. If there
      is no evidence of response to therapy, it will proceed to surgery standard (TME), while for
      patients who show mCR or cCR, there is a second restaging after 11-12 weeks after the end of
      pRT and/or CT. At the end of this second restaging, the patient will be enrolled in the
      rectum-sparing protocol if it shows a mCR or cCR, otherwise it will be a candidate for
      conventional surgery (TME).

      Basal clinical staging will be baseline standard for all patients with rectal cancer:

        1. digital rectal examination;

        2. proctoscopy with rigid endoscope and complete colonoscopy (when it is not executable
           because the lesion is stenosis, we recommend a double contrast barium enema or colon CT
           or colonoscopy within 6 months after surgery);

        3. pelvic MRI for locoregional staging. If this can not be performed (eg. claustrophobia),
           it will be accepted pelvic CT or endorectal ultrasound. Lymph nodes with a diameter &gt;
           0.5 cm along the short axis will be considered metastatic;

        4. chest-abdominal CT for evaluation of distant metastases;

        5. carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) determination;

        6. compiling questionnaires (QoL, bowel function, fecal continence).

      1st Re-Staging after pRT and/or CT (after 7-8 weeks from the end of radiotherapy):

        1. Digital rectal examination;

        2. Proctoscopy;

        3. chest-abdominal CT;

        4. pelvic MRI: if there is evidence of mCR or cCR and the absence of lymph node metastasis
           on MRI, the patient will be restaged after 11-12 week of the completion of the pRT
           and/or CT and then treated with rectum sparing approach.

      If there is no evidence of mCR or cCR, program surgery (TME) immediately.

      2nd Re-staging after pRT and/or CT (after 11-12 weeks from the end of radiotherapy):

        1. digital rectal examination;

        2. Proctoscopy;

        3. pelvic MRI (optional);

        4. acquisition of informed consent;

        5. Compile questionnaires (QoL, bowel function, fecal continence) optional. If you confirm
           mCR or cCR, the patient undergoes sparing rectum treatment.

      Functional and quality of life assessment As part of the study, they will also be considered
      bowel function, QoL and fecal continence. Participation in this ancillary study will be
      voluntary and will cover only those centers that have the ability to manage
      distribution/collection of the questionnaires.

      Functional assessment:

      1. MSKCC bowel function instrument.

      Quality of life assessment:

        1. EORTC QLQ - C30;

        2. EORTC QLQ - CR29;

        3. Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale (FIQL).

      Surgical treatment and histopathological exam

      Rectal resection with TME This will be carried out according to standard techniques using the
      open or laparoscopic approach and includes both anterior resection and abdominoperineal
      rectal resection (Miles procedure).

      Local excision This can be done both with traditional technique and with endoscopic technique
      (TEM, TAMIS, etc.).

      The rectum is prepared using standard procedures such as TME approach including prophylactic
      antibiotics.

      For endoscopic techniques it is generally required general anaesthesia, while for LE with a
      traditional technique is sufficient regional anaesthesia. The patient is positioned in the
      prone position, lithotomic or side depending on the location of the tumor. Regardless of the
      technique performed, the following principles should be respected:

        1. A gross margin of at least 0.5 cm;

        2. full-thickness excision including mucosa, submucosa, muscle and peri-rectal fat;

        3. determination of the specimen on the support by pins at the edges in order to facilitate
           the interpretation of histological pathologist.

      The breach on the rectal wall can be closed crosswise with absorbable sutures or it can be
      left open.

      Histological examination

      Histological examination must include at least the following information:

        1. ypT;

        2. Tumor regression grade (TRG) according to the classification of Mandard (see Annex E).

      If there is persistence of cancer, at least the following should be described:

        1. state of margins;

        2. Degree of cellular differentiation;

        3. Presence of lymphatic or vascular invasion.

      Follow-up Follow-up will be strict, but in any case fall within the patterns of follow-up
      provided by current national guidelines (see guidelines AIOM follow-up in rectal cancer).

      Follow-up after LE or wait- and-see

      Patients will be visited every 3 months during the first two years, and then every 6 months
      in the following three years. For each check, it will be performed:

        1. digital rectal examination;

        2. Proctoscopy;

        3. CEA and routine blood chemistry;

        4. MRI every 6 months to 5 years;

        5. chest -abdominal CT (annually unless another clinical indication);

        6. Colonoscopy (at 1 year, if negative at 3 years, if still negative at 5 years);

        7. Compile questionnaires (QoL, bowel function, fecal continence) optional 6 and 12 months
           after surgery.

      Recurrence definition

      Recurrences will be distinguished in:

        -  Local: recurrence in the pelvis, intraluminal or extraluminal;

        -  Distance: relapse in any other venue. The diagnosis of recurrence will be determined
           based on clinical, radiological images or biopsy.

      Sample size Rectum-sparing approach can be considered clinically acceptable if percentage of
      conservation of the rectum at two years is not less than 50%.

      The collected data on 164 patients who underwent &quot;rectum-sparing&quot; allow to test the
      hypothesis that the rectum is preserved in 60% of patients with 80% power (exact binomial
      test for proportions, alpha = 5 %, 1 tail) and the study will be considered positive if it
      obtains a frequency of conservation of the rectum of not less than 87 cases.

      Statistical analysis The analysis results will be reported in accordance with STROBE
      guidelines (von Elm et al , 2008). For all analyzes, continuous variables are described using
      the mean and standard deviation of position and appropriate measures when appropriate.
      Categorical variables will be described using the contingency tables.

      Primary endpoint analysis The main analysis will cover the estimated percentage of
      conservation of the rectum at two years in patients with rectal cancer after pRT and/or CT
      and &quot;rectum-sparing&quot; treatment.

      The percentage of conservation of the rectum will be estimated by the ratio between the
      number of patients with preservation of the rectum at two years and the total number of
      patients subjected to local excision or wait- and-see, and reported with 95 % confidence
      interval.

      Analysis of secondary endpoints Secondary analyzes will cover the evaluation of time in the
      events of death, disease and local recurrence, the description of preoperative treatment,
      morbidity and frequency of patients without stoma and their association with type of surgery,
      correlation between mCR or cCR and the pCR, the association between clinical factors and
      preoperative treatment and surgical and pCR and the impact of the type of surgical treatment
      on intestinal function, fecal continence and quality of life.

      Survival it defines as the time from the date of registration to the event date. In the
      absence of the event will be considered the date of the last visit. It will be considered
      events death, local recurrence (recurrence in the pelvis: intraluminal or extraluminal) and
      distant recurrence (recurrence in any other place). Recurrence diagnosis will be determined
      based on clinical, radiological images or biopsy.

      Survival will be estimated with Kaplan-Meier test. The results will be expressed in terms of
      survival rates at 2, 3 and 5 years with its 95 % confidence interval. It will also be used a
      Cox model to estimate the risk of event in the groups of &quot;rectum-sparing&quot; compared to
      conventional surgery with its 95 % confidence interval.

      The frequencies of different treatments administered preoperative, morbidity and packaging of
      a stoma at 2 and 5 years will be described in terms of percentages and reported with 95 %
      confidence interval; their association with the type of surgical treatment will be tested by
      the chi-square test.

      The correlation between mCR or cCR and the pCR will be evaluated by estimating the Kappa
      statistics, which expresses the correlation between the two methods is not due to chance. The
      results will be expressed with confidence intervals at 95% of bootstrap.

      The analysis of factors associated with pCR use a multivariate logistic regression model. It
      will be used as explanatory variables of clinical information-medical history, the type of
      preoperative treatment and the type of surgery (TME, LE).

      The scales of the questionnaires on intestinal function, fecal continence and quality of life
      will be built using the standard procedures given in the reference manuals. Mean scores and
      standard deviations are estimated for each administration of the questionnaires and reported
      with 95% confidence interval. The trend during the study period will be analyzed using a
      generalized linear mixed model with a gamma distribution.

    <description>MSKCC Bowel Function Instrument (Temple et al., 2005). The questionnaire consists of 18 items that include three subscales (frequency, dietary and urgency/soiling), four individual items of clinical significance ranging (incomplete emptying after a bowel movement, a second bowel movement within 15 min, knowing the difference between gas and bowel movement, inability to control the passage of flatus), and one total score obtained by the sum for all 18 items. Responses to individual items are given on a 5-point Likert scale with the first item (daily frequency of bowel movements) response divided into quintiles. Higher scores indicate better bowel function. The questionnaire has been translated and validated for Italian-speaking patients (Zotti et al., 2011).</description>

    <description>FIQL (Rockwood et al., 2000). The questionnaire measures specific quality of life issues expected to affect patients with faecal incontinence. This instrument is composed of 29 items within four domains: lifestyle issues, coping/behaviour, depression/self-perception and embarrassment. The scores range from a minimum score of 1 to a maximum of 4, for all of the scales. The Italian version of the questionnaire has been validated by Altomare et al. (2004).</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 (Aaronson et al., 1993). The questionnaire assesses health status and quality of life of cancer patients using 30 items grouped in one global scale, five multi-item functioning scales (physical, role, social, emotional, and cognitive functions), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain) and six single symptom items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial impact). The items are scored on a four-point Likert scale with higher scores indicating a better level of functioning or a higher level of symptoms. The validity and reliability of the Italian versions of the questionnaire have been established (Apolone et al., 1998).</description>

        All patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer and have a major or complete
        clinical response.

        Definitions:

        Major clinical response (mCR) is defined as the absence of:

        • palpable mass at digital rectal exploration, pathological lymph nodes (&gt; 5 mm in diameter
        along short axis) to pelvic MRI, deep or shallow ulcers &gt; 2 cm in diameter at rectoscopy;

        Clinical complete response (cCR) is defined as the absence of:

        • palpable mass at digital rectal exploration, pathological lymph nodes (&gt; 5 mm in diameter
        along the short axis) to the pelvic MRI, any endoscopic lesion (a flat scar is considered
        as absence of endoscopic lesions).

          2. ypT1 but with a TRG degree &lt; 3 and with a differentiation degree of G1-2;

          3. histologically margins not involved.

        LE will be considered as excessive handling and patients will be advised to undergo TME if
        histological assessment will document the presence of cancer with at least one of the
        following characteristics:

          1. ypT ≥ 2;

          2. Positive margins;
