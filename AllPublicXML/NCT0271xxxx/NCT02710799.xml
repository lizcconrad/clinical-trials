      Rio Grande do Sul state's referral list for endocrinology evaluation in specialized care is
      highly overloaded. There is currently a referral protocol to select patients how should be
      referred. It will be evaluated if a intervention of telephone-based teleconsultations
      provided by the TelessaúdeRS to the primary care physicians can provide additional benefits.
      TelessaúdeRS is a telehealth program from the University of Rio Grande do Sul. This will be
      evaluated in a cluster randomized clinical trial.

    <description>The teleconsultations will be performed by medical doctors, mostly family physicians, but also internists and endocrinologists. The teleconsultations will follow a structured format to discuss some topics on the disease and access the relevant information (based on the state's protocols). The doubts from the primary care physician will be addressed.</description>
