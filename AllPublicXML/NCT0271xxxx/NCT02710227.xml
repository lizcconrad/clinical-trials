      Individuals with hepatic cirrhosis (n=50) and healthy controls (n=30) were recruited. Sleep
      quality, sleep timing parameters and circadian preference were evaluated using the Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Sleep Timing Questionnaire (STQ) and The Composite Scale for
      Morningness (CSM) respectively

    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis of the liver is a chronic, diffuse, degenerative disease in which the parenchyma
      deteriorates, the lobules are infiltrated with fat and structurally altered, dense
      perilobular connective tissue forms and often areas of regeneration develop. These
      regeneration nodules have a reduced blood supply resulting in impaired liver function [1] and
      [2]. Factors that are taken into account to determine the severity of cirrhosis include serum
      albumin, prothrombin concentration, serum bilirubin, ascites and encephalopathy. A point
      system known as the Child's-pough-Turcotte score has been designed to determine the severity
      of cirrhosis. Depending on the total score, patients are classified as class A (early
      cirrhosis) through class C (advanced cirrhosis) [3].

      A disturbance of sleep is recognized as one of the early signs of hepatic encephalopathy.
      Reversal of sleep rhythm, drowziness and lethargy are classic signs of this disease. Sleep
      disturbance and excessive daytime somnolence are common in patients with cirrhosis. It was
      estimated that up to 70% of individuals with cirrhosis (regardless of etiology) experience
      sleep disturbances [4]. Difficulty falling asleep and a shift in sleep schedule toward the
      latter part of the night, which might be result in daytime sleepiness, are commonly reported
      findings in patients with hepatic cirrhosis without encephalopathy [4].

      Individuals with hepatic cirrhosis (n=50) and healthy controls (n=30) were recruited. Sleep
      quality, sleep timing parameters and circadian preference were evaluated using the Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Sleep Timing Questionnaire (STQ) and The Composite Scale for
      Morningness (CSM) respectively
