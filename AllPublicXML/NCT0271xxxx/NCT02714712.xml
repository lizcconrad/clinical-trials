    <textblock>
      The scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI) is a receptor for high-density lipoproteins
      (HDL) and one of entry factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV). The investigators aimed to
      examine the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the SCARB1 gene, which
      encodes SR-BI, with virologic responses to pegylated interferon-based treatment in Asian
      chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.

      1. Purpose of study: To examine the impacts of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
           relevant to SR-BI on CHC patients.

        2. Study Design To enroll 400 CHC patients during a 3-year period

        3. Specify objectives of study when collecting extra specimen from participants Collect
           blood samples for genomic DNA to examine the SR-BI gene polymorphisms.

        4. Expected Endpoints of Treatment Sustained virologic response (SVR) means undetectable
           serum HCV RNA levels 24 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy.

      All enrolled subjects were genotyped for the SNPs of the SCARB1 gene and IL28B gene. All
      their blood specimens were collected into EDTA tubes. Human genomic DNA was extracted by
      standard protocols with blood RBC lysis, cell lysis, DNA binding, wash and elution. Extracted
      DNA normalized to 50 ng/µl was obtained. DNA quality was assessed by calculating the
      absorbance ratio OD260 nm/280 nm using NanoDrop model ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington,
      DE, USA). The SNP was genotyped by using the ABI TaqMan allelic discrimination kit and the
      ABI7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
