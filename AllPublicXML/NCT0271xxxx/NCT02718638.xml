  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress and inflammation are cardiovascular risk factors in patients with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Nuclear transcription factors play roles
      in the coordinated expression of genes involved in inflammation, such as nuclear factor Kappa
      B (NFkB) that increase the cytokines synthesis and Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
      2 (Nrf2) that increase the transcription of genes encoding enzymes of phase II detoxifying
      and antioxidant enzymes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of resistance
      exercise program on the expression of transcription factors Nrf2 and NF-kB in HD patients.

      This study included 44 patients on regular HD program which 25 patients (54.5% women, age
      45.7 ± 15.2 years and time on dialysis, 71.2 ± 45.5 months) composed the exercise group and
      19 patients (61.5% women, age 42.5 ± 13.5 years and time on dialysis, 70.1 ± 49.9 months) the
      control group. The exercise program was performed during HD sessions, 3 times a week (36
      exercises sessions). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and processed
      for expression of Nrf2, NF-kB and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) by quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction. Antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase-CAT and
      glutathione peroxidase-GPx), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and nitric oxide
      (NO) products were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

    <description>Physical exercises were performed during HD sessions, at second hour of HD, three times per week for 3 months (36 sessions). The patients remained seated while performing the exercises that were performed in both lower limbs. Ankle-cuffs and elastic bands (Theraband®, Akron-OH, USA) were used for performed the exercises. The physical exercises consisted of four different exercises and they were administered by a physical therapist following the adapted protocol.</description>

    <description>Physical exercises were performed during HD sessions, at second hour of HD, three times per week for 3 months. The first exercise was knee extension from 90° to 0°. The patient remained in the 0° position for 5 seconds (an isometric contraction) and then returned to the starting position (90º). 2) The second exercise consisted of a triple flexion followed by extension of the lower limbs. The patient flexed the thigh, knee and ankle (elastic band placed at the level of the metacarpals) followed by a double extension of the thigh and knee. 3) In a co-isometric contraction, the patient performed a leg extension against the ankle-cuff resistance (located under the distal third of the leg at the level of the malleolus) for 10 seconds. 4) The patient performed a unilateral hip joint flexion of the lower limb with the knee extended by rising to their functional limit.</description>
