  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this pilot study is to investigate the association between testosterone
      deficiency and the presence of abnormalities in the function of the autonomic nervous system.
      If such association exists, then we will investigate the effect of testosterone replacement
      therapy on correcting these abnormalities.

      The investigators will recruit 40 men between the ages of 40 to 80-years-old with low
      testosterone. Participants will be selected among those males referred to the Texas Tech
      University Health Sciences Center's (TTUHSC's) Internal Medicine Endocrinology Division
      outpatient clinic for the study and management of testosterone deficiency and to the TTUHSC
      Urology Department for diagnosis and management of prostate cancer that will result in
      testosterone deficiency due to surgical or pharmacological castration.

      After recruitment, patients will have an initial standard clinical visit where aspects such
      as fatigue and anxiety will be investigated, followed by a full battery of autonomic testing
      (tilt table, heart rate response to deep breathing, Valsalva, and the Quantitative Sudomotor
      Axon Reflex Test (QSART).

      Those patients with an initial diagnosis of testosterone deficiency will be initiated on
      testosterone replacement (intramuscular or skin routes) as standard of care, followed by a
      second visit in three (3) months--after normalization of serum testosterone levels--to
      evaluate changes in anxiety and fatigue level, and to repeat the cardiovascular autonomic
      function test.

      Those patients with primary diagnosis of prostate cancer and normal serum testosterone levels
      will be evaluated a second time after confirmation of low testosterone, as described above.
      Standard questionnaires will be used to evaluate fatigue and anxiety. The autonomic testing
      of the heart will include tilt table (tilt the patient 70 degree by special designed table)
      and heart rate response to deep breathing, and Valsalva maneuver. Descriptive statistics will
      be compared between before and after treatment using different statistical methods.

        Two groups will be recruited with 20 men in each group:

        Group 1 will include 20 men between the ages of 40 to 80-years-old with symptoms and
        biochemical parameters of low testosterone.

        Group 2 will include 20 men between the ages of 40 to 80-years-old with prostate cancer and
        normal serum testosterone that will be treated with surgical or pharmacological castration,
        as following standard of care at Urology Division, resulting in testosterone deficiency.
