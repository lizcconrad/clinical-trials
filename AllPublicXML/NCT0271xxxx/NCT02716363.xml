      Current guidelines recommend the use of rotational atherectomy (RA) for preparation of
      heavily calcified or severely fibrotic lesions that cannot be crossed by a balloon or
      adequately dilated before planned stenting (bailout situations). RA emerged in the 1990s as
      one of several tools to treat luminal obstruction via physical removal of plaque. Although
      initially explored as an alternative to balloon angioplasty, RA has shown favorable acute
      results in facilitating stent delivery and adequate expansion, particularly those affected by
      heavy calcification.Drug-eluting stents (DES) have substantially reduced re-stenosis rates in
      randomized clinical trials evaluating simple de novo coronary artery lesions and have also
      shown favorable results when implanted in complex lesions and patients, but higher event
      rates are observed when treating such subsets compared with simple lesions even with newer
      generation DES. However, there are limited data on evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
      RA followed by DES implantation for heavily calcified lesions in contemporary practice.
      Recent randomized controlled trial shows that RA before paclitaxel eluting stent implantation
      as first generation DES was not superior to paclitaxel eluting stent implantation without
      prior RA in reducing the primary endpoint of in-stent late luminal loss at 9 months,
      indicating that RA does not increase the efficacy of DES in patients with moderate to severe
      calcified lesions. However, there were only 15 (12.5%) crossovers from standard therapy to
      rotablation because of failure of balloon or stent delivery or suboptimal balloon expansion
      despite the use of a noncompliant balloon. Accordingly, procedural and fluoroscopy times were
      longer in the elective RA and procedural complications occurred equally in both elective RA
      and bailout RA. These findings might cause by a substantial portion of enrolled population
      have moderate calcified lesions, but not severe calcified lesions. In particular,
      everolimus-eluting stent (EES) as newer generation DES could act synergistically in heavily
      calcified lesions as RA could avert stent coating damage and EES could effectively suppress
      neointimal proliferation. Therefore, we compare in-hospital and long-term efficacy or safety
      of elective RA versus bailout RA and low-volume operator versus high-volume operator in
      patients with severe calcified lesions treated with EES.
