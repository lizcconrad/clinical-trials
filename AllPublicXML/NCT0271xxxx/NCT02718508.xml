    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to test feasibility and acceptability of an e-parenting skills
      intervention with parents of injured adolescent alcohol users (12-17 years old) as compared
      to standard care at three pediatric trauma centers. To examine these questions, the
      investigators will randomly assign adolescent and parent dyads (up to 75) to one of two
      groups. One group will continue to receive the institutional standard care of a brief alcohol
      intervention delivered by clinical staff to the adolescent with no parenting skills
      intervention. The second group will continue to receive the same institutional standard care
      plus the parent will receive an e-parenting skills intervention consisting of: the online
      parent training program, Parenting Wisely(PW), plus text messaging and a web-based message
      board. Study participants will be injured adolescents, 12-17 years old, admitted to the
      inpatient service of the trauma center, and with a positive CRAFFT (mnemonic acronym of first
      letters of key words in the screening tool) screen for alcohol use. Adolescents' alcohol use
      will be measured at study enrollment and at 3 and 6 months after discharge. Adolescents'
      alcohol related negative consequences will be measured at study enrollment for the 6 months
      prior to hospitalization and again at 6 months after hospital discharge. Parenting skills
      will also be assessed at 3 and 6 months.

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to test the feasibility and acceptability of an e-parenting skills
      intervention at three pediatric trauma centers. The investigators will randomize up to 75
      dyads of injured adolescents (12-17 years old) who screen positive for alcohol use and their
      parent to receive either standard trauma center care (a brief intervention with the
      adolescent) or standard trauma center care (a brief intervention with the adolescent) plus an
      e-parenting skills intervention consisting of a computerized intervention for parent skill
      building, a series of text messages and a web-based message board. The primary aim of this
      study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting the e-parenting
      intervention protocol across three pediatric trauma centers in preparation for a larger fully
      power trial. The central hypothesis for our future fully powered randomized control trial is
      that adolescents whose parents receive the e-parenting skills intervention will decrease
      their alcohol use and alcohol-related negative consequences over the 6 months following the
      intervention more than adolescents who receive only standard trauma center care. Therefore, a
      secondary aim of this proposal is to calculate a preliminary effect size that could be used,
      along with other relevant data, such as the acceptability data and findings in the
      literature, to calculate sample size in a future fully powered randomized control trial. The
      investigators will also examine adolescent's conjoint use of marijuana. This project advances
      translational research in collecting preliminary data on an e-parenting skills intervention
      that can be easily adopted with high fidelity across pediatric trauma centers. Its findings
      have the potential to directly impact best clinical practices for intervening with alcohol
      using injured adolescents
