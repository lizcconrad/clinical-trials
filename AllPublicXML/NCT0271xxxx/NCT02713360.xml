  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that there is a significant difference in anxiety scores between
      intervention and usual care group after intervention.

      The aim of this randomised trial is (I) to determine the type of anxiety in ICD patients and
      (ii) to investigate the effect of screening followed by randomisation to intervention with
      consultations based on cognitive therapeutic principals to reduce anxiety in patients with
      ICD or usual care.

      Screen-ICD is an investigator-initiated randomised clinical superiority trial with blinded
      outcome assessment, including two university hospitals, with 1:1 randomisation to cognitive
      therapy plus usual care or usual care alone.

      The intervention: all patients receive usual care. Patients in the intervention group will
      receive an intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy. The intervention consists of
      three steps: 1. The intervention begins with a consultation with a nurse aiming at uncovering
      anxiety using the Hamilton anxiety scale and exploring how life with an ICD is perceived, 2.
      Based on the pre-specified protocols for each type of anxiety, cognitive therapy is provided
      and 3. After each session participants are asked to fill out the HADS questionnaire. When the
      patient scores below the cut-off value two times in a row, sessions will end. Each patient
      can have a maximum of 15 sessions.

    <measure>Primary outcome is anxiety measured by HADS.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is a 14 item questionnaire that assesses anxiety and depression level in medical ill persons who are not admitted in psychiatric wards.
Scores of 0 to 7 for either subscale are regarded as normal and scores of 8 to 10 suggest the presence of a mood disorder. Scores of 11 and above suggest probable presence of a mood disorder.</description>

    <measure>Becks Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Becks Anxiety Inventory is a brief self-reported measure of anxiety with a focus on somatic symptoms of anxiety and was developed as a measure to discriminate between anxiety and depression. Respondents indicated how much each symptom has bothered them during the past week on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). The BAI score ranges from 0-63.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Anxiety Scale is a clinical interview rating scale of the psychic (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic (physical complaints related to anxiety) aspects of anxiety. The scale consists of 14 clinical symptoms that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (very severe).</description>

    <description>The questionnaire measures health-related quality of life in patients with ischemic heart disease, specifically angina, myocardial infarction or ischemic heart failure. The questionnaire consists of 14 items and provides two subscales; a 10-item physical subscale and a 4-item emotional subscale which are scored from 0 to 3.</description>
