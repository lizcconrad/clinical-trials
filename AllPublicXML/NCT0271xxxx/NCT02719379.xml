  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) from the Centers for Disease Control
      (CDC) recommends that children (6-18 years) and adults (≥19 years old) with chronic lung
      condition such as asthma or cigarette smoking be vaccinated with Pneumococcal vaccine
      (PPSV23). The purpose of this study is to increase awareness of vaccination to late
      adolescents with asthma and smokers (social aspect of study), and to recommend vaccination
      (which is the clinical aspect). Individuals who agree to receiving vaccine will be enrolled
      in research to determine whether late adolescents with and without asthma (smokers) have
      distinctive pneumococcal vaccine response patterns and whether such patterns are associated
      with subsequent variance in asthma outcomes.

    <description>19-20 year old asthmatics who agree to participate in study will have serum collected for analysis. PPSV23 vaccine [Pneumonococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine 23-valent (PPSV-23)] will be offered per the ACIP/CDC guidelines. Those who agree to receive the vaccine will have a second draw for serum 4-6 weeks post vaccination for immunization response. They will also be follow up after 1 year to assess for asthma control and outcomes. This arm will additionally allow for comparison of asthma outcomes and vaccine response</description>

    <description>Once the accrual for the experimental arm is met, 19-20 year old asthmatics who wish to participate in study will have serum collected for analysis. PPSV23 vaccine [Pneumonococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine 23-valent (PPSV-23)] will be offered per the ACIP/CDC guidelines. This arm will allow for study of baseline vaccine titers to pneumococcus in asthmatics at same time increase the vaccine uptake in the community.</description>
