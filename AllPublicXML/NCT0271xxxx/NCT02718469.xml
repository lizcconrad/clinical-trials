      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of the Zaire Ebola vaccine and the
      strength of the immune response.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ebola Zaire is a filovirus that has caused devastating epidemics of hemorrhagic fever in
      South Africa. Research is underway to create a safe and effective vaccine to protect against
      Ebola disease, especially for the military and health care workers. Promising animal studies
      with this vaccine indicate safety and immunogenicity, and the vaccine platform used to
      deliver the Ebola protein antigen has been successful in creating a safe and protective
      immune response in people. Note that only one Ebola protein is used in this vaccine; since
      the entire intact Ebola virus is required for infection, it is impossible to get Ebola
      disease from this vaccine.

      The study targets enrollment of 39 healthy adults. These participants are divided into 3
      groups that will be administered one of three dose levels of the vaccine (low, medium, high).
      The study participants will receive two doses of vaccine: one on day 1 and the second on day
      28 (1 month). Three participants at each dose level will act as controls and receive a
      placebo instead of the active vaccine. A total of 13 visits to the clinic are required over a
      period of 26 weeks. The total study is expected to take 9 months.
