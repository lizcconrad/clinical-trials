      Families with a patient with schizophrenia and the patient are randomly assigned to receive
      either a 3 session psychoeducation program, or no psychoeducation. Other treatment for
      schizophrenia and other mental illness are provided as usual. The psychoeducation program
      focuses on: (a) explaining schizophrenia as a medical, biological illness, (b) the prognosis
      for schizophrenia (e.g., that it is possible to lead a normal life), and (c) what the family
      and patient can do to maximize the outcome.
