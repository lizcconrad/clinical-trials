  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In high-risk patients, it is now recommended to guide the intraoperative volume replacement
      via the stroke volume.

      Today, the most commonly used technique for estimating the stroke volume is the arterial
      waveform analysis in the radial artery. This technique has the disadvantage of being invasive
      and increasing the time dedicated to anesthesia during the surgery.

      The future is the non-invasive monitoring of stroke volume. Thus, Edwards Life Science has
      developed a continuous monitoring technology and non-invasive arterial pressure, cardiac
      output and stroke volume using a digital sensor (ClearSight®). The continuous monitoring of
      blood pressure by this technique was validated in cardiothoracic surgery but studies about
      monitoring cardiac output or stroke volume are inconclusive and contradictory.

      The objective of this study is to compare the use of non-invasive monitoring of stroke volume
      by Clearsight® with the arterial waveform analysis in the radial artery by Pulsioflex® in
      major surgery.
