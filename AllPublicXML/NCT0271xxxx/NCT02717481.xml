      Examine a new method based on fusion between ultrasound (US) and previous
      ultrasound/computerized tomography(US/CT) studies to evaluate the size of abdominal aneurysm
      and measure the changes over time and following invasive repair procedure.

      Selection test for assessing aortic aneurysm is CT angio, it performed after injection of
      contrast material and allows a complete demonstration of the blood vessels. This test exposes
      the patient to ionizing radiation and the injection of iodine contrast medium. Repeated tests
      pose a risk of developing a malignancy in the future due to the use of ionizing radiation and
      risk of renal impairment and allergic reactions due to the injection of contrast material.
      Ultrasound is another test that enables the detection and evaluation of aortic aneurysm.
      Patients with a known diagnosis of aortic aneurysm detected on CT are required to continuous
      monitoring in light of its growth over time and the risk of rupture.

      Using Co-registration over the US device will enable to conduct a US directed aorta
      examination, which uses the information produced from the CT as a &quot;roadmap&quot; for detection and
      localization of the aneurysm. That can theoretically improve detection capabilities and
      characteristics of the aneurysm and outcomes of the invasive treatment.
