  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide, and most cases are
      inoperable because of late presentation and underlying cirrhosis. It represents the fifth
      most common tumor in the world and the third most frequent cause of mortality amongst
      patients with cancer.

      Due to the worldwide difficulties in finding liver for transplantation, hepatic resection
      (HR) represents the main stay of curative treatment for patients with HCC. Transcatheter
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used as alternative treatments for unresectable
      HCC or for patients not eligible to be operated on .

      TACE also could be an adjuvant therapy for resectable HCC patients after hepatectomy, which
      could prevent recurrence and improve long-term survival .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thromboembolism is a well-recognised complication of malignant disease. Clinical
      manifestations vary from venous thromboembolism to disseminated intravascular coagulation and
      arterial embolism. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is most commonly observed in
      patients with haematological malignant disorders and those with wide spread metastatic
      cancer, whereas arterial embolism is most commonly observed in patients undergoing
      chemotherapy and in those with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis .

      The goals of using antithrombotic therapy with TACE in HCC are to minimize mortality and to
      improve survival rate without provoking excessive bleeding.
