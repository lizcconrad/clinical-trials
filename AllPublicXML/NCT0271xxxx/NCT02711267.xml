  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this clinical study is to investigate the ability of dermal open flow
      microperfusion to assess bioequivalence and non-bioequivalence of acyclovir formulations in
      the skin of healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, open label, exploratory research study to evaluate the BE of
      already marketed formulations of acyclovir in dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) in healthy
      volunteers using dOFM. The study will be conducted at the Clinical Research Center at the
      Medical University Graz. dOFM represents the most reliable way to sample interstitial fluid
      from skin, since it provides diluted but otherwise unchanged dermal interstitial fluid. To
      assess BE and non-BE, we have designed the experiments in such a way that each subject can
      serve as its own control. Each subject will have two sets of BE and non-BE pairs in parallel.
      This study is designed to test dOFM, a new sampling method that allows measurement of skin
      penetration. Measurement of skin penetration enables the reduction of the impact of
      inter-subject variability and therefore decreases the number of subjects needed to achieve
      statistical significance.

    <description>6 subjects will be included in this study, each with 3 application sites on the arm and 3 on the leg. 2 dOFM probes (OFM Probe) will be implanted per site resulting in 12 dOFM probes per subject (operated by OFM pump). On each the arm and the leg the proximal and distal site of the 3 adjacent sites will be treated by 5% Zovirax® cream. The central site on arm and leg will be left untreated in order to test a potential lateral carry-over of acyclovir from one application site to the other. Blood samples will be taken to test for uptake into the blood stream and redistribution to other application sites.</description>

    <description>6 subjects will be included in this study, each with 3 application sites on the arm and 3 on the leg. 2 dOFM probes will be implanted per site resulting in 12 dOFM probes per subject. Different topical 5% acyclovir formulations currently available on the market will be tested. One application site on the arm and one on the leg will be used for U.S. Zovirax® cream 5% application. The remaining two application sites on the arm and the remaining 2 on the leg will be used to randomly administer two of the remaining formulations (5% Aciclostad cream, 5% Aciclovir cream 1A Pharma, 5% Zovirax® cream (Austria), 5% Zovirax Cold Sore Cream) according to an application pattern.</description>
