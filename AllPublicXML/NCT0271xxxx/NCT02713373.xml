    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of cetuximab when given together
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread from the
      primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot
      be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetixumab and pembrolizumab, may block
      tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      II. To estimate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate of patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      III. To examine the adverse event profile of combining pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the PFS of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
      pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      II. To determine the objective response rate by immune-related response criteria (irRC) of
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      III. To examine the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated
      with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify tumor and peripheral blood biomarkers of response and/or resistance to the study
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes on day 1, 8, and 15 (as
      monotherapy for cycle 1 only) and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may continue pembrolizumab treatment for up to 1 year if they experience
      disease progression.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

          -  Has known active hepatitis B (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or
             hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] is
             detected); testing not required

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy (note:
             seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and shingles are not allowed)

          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to starting study treatment

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator
