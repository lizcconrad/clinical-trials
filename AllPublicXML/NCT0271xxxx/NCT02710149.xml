      The main purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of CD20-targeted chimeric
      antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of B cell malignancies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anti-CD20 antibody has been broadly used in the treatment of B cell malignancies and
      exhibited good clinical outcomes. The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown exellent therapeutic
      efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, patients
      treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 mutation. Other targets aimed CAR-T
      is in need. Therefore we constructed CD20-targeted CAR-T cells and hope to start a
      clinicaltrial to explore the therapeutic effect of CD20-targeted CAR-T cells in the treatment
      of B cell malignancies.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. CD20-expressing B cell malignancy must be assured and must be relapsed or refractory
             disease after at least one standard chemotherapy and one salvage regimen. According to
             current traditional therapies, there must be no available alternative curative
             therapies and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant
             (SCT), have refused SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits SCT at this time.

          2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS.

          3. CD20 expression of the malignant cells must be detected by immunohistochemistry or by
             flow cytometry. In general immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph node biopsies,
             flow cytometry will be used for peripheral blood and bone marrow samples.

          4. Gender is not limited, age from 14 years to 75 years.

          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.

          6. Patients are expected to survive for more than 3 months by their physicians at the
             time of enrollment.

          7. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell
             dose based on dosage cohorts.

          8. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic
             symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy:

             CNS 1, defined as absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin
             preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL
             WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts, or &gt; 5/uL WBCs but negative by
             Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3 with marrow disease who has failed salvage systemic
             and intensive IT chemotherapy (and therefore not eligible for radiation)

          9. Patients with isolated CNS relapse will be eligible if they have previously been
             treated with cranial radiation (at least 1800 cGy).

         10. Ability to give informed consent.

         11. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects on the fetus.

         12. Cardiac function: Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40% by
             MUGA or cardiac MRI, or fractional shortening greater than or equal to 28% by ECHO or

         13. Renal function: Creatinine level of peripheral blood is required no greater than
             133umol/L.

             no evidence of active GVHD and no longer taking immunosuppressive agents for at least
             30 days prior to enrollment.

         15. Patients volunteer to participate in the research.

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for participation in the
        study:

          1. Patients are evaluated below 60 scores with KPS.

          2. Evident signs suggesting that patients are potentially allergic to cytokines.

          3. Frequent infection history and recent infection is uncontrolled.

          4. Patients with concomitant genetic syndrome: patients with Down syndrome, Fanconi
