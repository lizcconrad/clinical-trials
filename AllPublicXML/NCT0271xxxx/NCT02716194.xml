      1. To assess tolerability and safety of BAX 826 after a single infusion in previously
           treated patients (PTPs) with severe hemophilia A

        2. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of BAX 826 compared to ADVATE

        3. To evaluate immunogenicity of polysialic acid linked to Factor VIII (FVIII)
