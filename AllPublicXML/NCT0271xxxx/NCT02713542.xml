             weeks.

          3. The subject has documented radiographs evidence of Osteoarthritis (OA) in the
             tibio-femoral or patella-femoral compartment of the target knee (Kellgren-Lawrence
             Grades II-III), using radiographs performed within 24 weeks of screening.

          4. The subject has a WOMAC pain score of at least 8 out of 20 and at least moderate pain
             (a score of 2) for at least 2 questions on activities

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Grade I and IV on the knee Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale

          2. Subject has clinically 3+ effusion of the target knee (stroke test grading system).

          3. Subject has significant (&gt; 10‚Å∞) valgus or varus deformities as evidenced by standard
