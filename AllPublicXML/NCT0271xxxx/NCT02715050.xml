  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of phototherapy has been widely studied by some research groups. The
      investigators know that there are positive results with light application to improve muscle
      performance and delay fatigue. However, there are few studies showing its´ effects on
      muscular training. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of phototherapy
      applied at different times during 12 weeks of strength training. For such, 48 volunteers,
      healthy male, from 18 to 35 years old were recruited to perform a strength training protocol
      for the anterior muscle of the thigh development. Volunteers performed the training protocol
      three times a week for 12 weeks. There were assessed isometric peak torque in isokinetic
      dynamometer, concentric peak torque, 1-repetition maximum test in the leg extension and leg
      press machines and bilateral thigh perimetry.

      This is a clinical, randomized, controlled placebo and double-blind study. Forty-eight
      participants performed muscular training protocol. Subjects practiced a protocol training
      with 60% of the load followed by 80% of the load, measured through 1-repetition maximum test,
      in all sessions of the training protocol. The training protocol consisted in performing 3
      sets of 7 repetitions with 60% of 1-RM, and 4 set of 7 repetitions with 80% of 1-RM. This
      protocol was performed in every sessions, three times a week, employing leg press and leg
      extension machines.

      Phototherapy, active or placebo, were applied in 6 different points of anterior muscle of the
      thigh before and after each training session. Only one investigator, that did not participate
      in any phase of the assessments and trainings sessions, knew about what program is active or
      placebo in phototherapy device. Randomisation carried out by a simple drawing of lots (A, B,
      C, or D) in the first visit. The phototherapy unit emitted the same sound regardless of the
      program used, active or placebo. Either strength training lasted 12 weeks and assessments
      were performed at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. There were evaluated maximal voluntary
      contraction (MVC), concentric torque, bilateral thigh perimetry and 1-repetition maximum test
      (1-RM).
