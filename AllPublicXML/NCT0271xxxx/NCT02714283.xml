  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide patients and their physicians with greater
      understanding of the risks and benefits of commonly used therapies for treatment of non-CF
      bronchiectasis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-CF bronchiectasis is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that is closely linked to
      pulmonary NTM disease. Both are rare but rising in incidence and disproportionately affect
      the elderly and women. Therapy of non-CF bronchiectasis aims to reduce inflammation via
      either ICS-induced immunosuppression or antibiotic-associated immunomodulation and/or
      suppression of pathogenic organisms. Both strategies, pursued long-term alone or some cases
      concomitantly, have inherent risks, and the relative risks and benefits of these differential
      approaches are poorly studied to date. Ultimately, our study will provide patients and their
      physicians with greater understanding of the risks and benefits of these therapeutic choices.

    <description>Complete national 2006-2014 Medicare data from Part A, B and D will be obtained from CMS. We will use bronchiectasis ICD-9 codes 494.0 and 494.1 to identify patients with bronchiectasis within Medicare. From this identified bronchiectasis cohort, we will exclude patients with cystic fibrosis (ICD-9 codes 277.00-277.09), HIV infection (042), and a history of organ transplant (V42.0, V42.1, V42.6, V42.7, V42.8).</description>
