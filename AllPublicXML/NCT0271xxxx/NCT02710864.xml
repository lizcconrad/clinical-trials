      The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the incidence of congenital CMV
      infection in neonates, and assess the concordance of detecting congenital cytomegalovirus
      (CMV) infection in neonatal saliva and urine samples.

      This Cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit neonates less than 14 days old delivered
      in Maternal and Child Health Hospitals (MCHHs) of Xinmi City, Jiaxian County, Zhongmu County
      and Huli District Xiamen City, in China, from June 2015 to June 2016. The aim of this study
      is to enroll ~1800 neonates, and collect their saliva and urine samples which will be tested
      the CMV DNA by using real-time PCR.
