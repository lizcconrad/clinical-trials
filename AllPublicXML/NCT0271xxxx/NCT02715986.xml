  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a non-pharmacological treatment used in resistant
      depression whose effectiveness has been demonstrated. However, the brain mechanisms
      underlying this therapeutic effect remain unclear. Many animal studies show a neurotrophic
      action of ECT on the hippocampus: increased neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, proliferation of
      glial cells. In addition, functional imaging of &quot;resting state&quot; type have shown, among
      depressed patients after ECT, increased functional connectivity . These results were
      reinforced by the recent work of Perrin (2012). In view of this a priori contradictory, it
      seems appropriate to continue research neuroanatomical correlates subtending neurofunctional
      processes responsible at the same time improving the clinical depressive. The investigators
      suggest using an original technique never used in this type of population: Functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or multimodal structural-functional. This method will allow
      us to study the impact of ECT on brain structures involved in major depressive disorder:
      hippocampus.
