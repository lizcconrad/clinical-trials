    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the effects, meaning and significance of a
      person-centred and thriving promoting model for residential aged care in Australia, Norway
      and Sweden. More specifically, the following research questions will be explored:

        1. Can a person-centred and thriving promoting care model increase residents' thriving, and
           have a positive impact on residents' perception of the caring environment?

        2. Can a person-centred and thriving promoting care model increase relatives' satisfaction
           with care, and have a positive impact on their experience of visiting their relative,
           and perception of the caring environment?

        3. Can a person-centred and thriving promoting care model increase staff's job
           satisfaction, decrease stress of conscience, and have a positive impact on their
           perception of the caring environment and person-centred care?

        4. What meaning and significance do relatives and staff ascribe to the intervention? The
           study is designed as a multi-centre, controlled group before-after design with
           participating sites in Victoria (Australia), Oslo (Norway) and Västerbotten (Sweden).
           Two residential aged care facilities at each site will be allocated to either
           intervention or control, in total three intervention and three control facilities
           divided over the three sites.

      Care staff at the intervention facilities will participate in a 12-month education on how to
      integrate aspects of person-centredness, thriving and a caring environment into daily care
      practice. Participating staff will work together with their colleagues and members from the
      research group to create a reflective and creative learning environment that builds on and
      develops the staff members' clinical experience and skills, and combines it with theoretical
      and research-based knowledge.

      At the control facilities, care staff will participate in a 2-hour lecture on the theoretical
      and philosophical foundations of person-centredness, thriving and a caring environment, and
      then continue with practice without further involvement from the research team.

      Evaluation data will be collected by study specific questionnaires before the education
      starts, immediately after the education and at a 6-month follow-up. In addition, focus group
      interviews and individual interviews will be conducted with a selection of staff members and
      relatives at the intervention facilities to explore meaning and significance of the
      intervention.
