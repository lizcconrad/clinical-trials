  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to triple by
      2050. Compared to the general population, Veterans have a greater risk of AD, likely in part
      due to their increased incidence of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder,
      depression, and other vascular-related health issues. Based on available data, 423,000 new
      cases of AD are anticipated in Veterans by 2020. Thus, the discovery of effective therapies
      to prevent or delay the onset of AD in Veterans is critical. The goal of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of a purified form of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) called icosapent ethyl (IPE), on improving brain blood flow, spinal fluid markers of AD
      pathology, and cognitive performance in middle-aged, cognitively-healthy Veterans with
      increased risk of AD. If IPE delays the onset of AD by even 5 years, the incidence of AD
      would be reduced by 50% in this population and could have a profound effect on Veteran
      quality of life and healthcare costs.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study is a proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      parallel-group clinical trial assessing the efficacy of 18 months of icosapent ethyl (IPE)
      therapy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cognitive
      biomarkers for AD in 150 cognitively-healthy Veterans ages 50-75 years with increased risk
      for developing AD due to parental history of the disease and increased prevalence of
      apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele. The overarching goal of this trial is to assess whether
      icosapent ethyl beneficially affects intermediate physiological measures associated with
      onset of AD in order to evaluate whether larger, multi-site, longer-duration Alzheimer's
      prevention trials are warranted to assess more definitive clinical outcomes. The proposed
      study aims to: 1) investigate the effects of 18 months of IPE vs. placebo on regional
      cerebral blood flow as measured by arterial spin-labeling MRI; 2) determine the impact of 18
      months of IPE vs. placebo on CSF biomarkers of AD pathology; and 3) evaluate the effects of
      18 months of IPE vs. placebo on cognitive performance.
