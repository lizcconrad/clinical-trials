  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rate is high among liver transplant patients, while
      treatment measures are limited. This study plans to recruit 10 patients with Hepatitis B
      virus (HBV) related HCC who underwent liver transplantation and are confirmed to have
      recurrent HCC. The objective of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and
      effectiveness of the HBV specific T cell receptor (HBV/TCR) redirected T cell in the target
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single armed and open labelled trial in patients with recurrent HBV related HCC
      after liver transplantation. For patients who successfully match TCR histocompatibility locus
      antigen (HLA) restriction, escalating doses of HBV/TCR expressing autologous T cells will be
      infused. Tests will be done to confirmed safety and efficacy during treatment, followed by
      one month immediate observation period for safety and a long-term follow up period up to five
      years for efficacy.
