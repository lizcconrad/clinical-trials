  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic goals in the management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) are the
      control of symptoms and tumor growth control in order to improve patient survival.

      In recent years, data from two phase III studies with targeted therapies, sunitinib and
      everolimus, have broadened the possibilities for treatment of patients with neuroendocrine
      tumors of the pancreas.

      Unfortunately, patients progress and development of new active drugs and evaluating the best
      treatment approach is decisive.

      Given the lack of data comparing the activity of different treatment strategies, final
      decisions are based on medical experience and consensus of experts. In this context,
      different questions are still unanswered, as which is the best sequence of treatment and if
      all patients can benefit from all available drugs.

      Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors are highly vascularized tumors in which cells may be
      dependent on this pathway for growth throughout the entire history of the tumor and in which
      inhibition of this pathway is crucial. On the other hand, this aspect has not been endorsed
      by the population of patients with pNET who have previously failed treatment with sunitinib.

      In this scenario the investigators will assess retreatment with sunitinib to evaluate the
      activity of this drug in the context of therapeutic rescue in patients with metastatic pNET.
