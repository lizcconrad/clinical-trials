    <textblock>
      The goal of clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of use of health-connected devices and
      of an Internet-based Intensive follow-up on physical activity recovery during the 6-month
      period after bariatric surgery in obese patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90 patients with morbid obesity, having recently benefited from an act of bariatric surgery
      will be recruited for clinical trial if they meet the inclusion and no inclusion criteria.
      This is a single-center, open, controlled, randomized, 2 parallel-groups:

        -  &quot;Mobility Coaching&quot; group

        -  &quot;Diet Coaching&quot; group

      The &quot;Diet Coaching&quot; group will be the &quot;control group&quot; of &quot;Mobility Coaching&quot; group and vice
      versa.

      Patients in both groups will be equipped with a connected-scale and a wristwatch equipped
      with a pedometer connected. The online tools available to patients will be used to motivate
      patients to progress and alert the coaches and the medical team in case of difficulties to
      achieve the objectives.

    <description>The intensive follow-up for the patients of &quot;Mobility Coaching &quot; arm will consist on a monthly remote coaching of 20 to 30 minutes led by a &quot;Mobility&quot; coach. The web platform allows self-administration of a questionnaire to establish patient's diagnosis of mobility to enable personalized coaching. The web platform can also track the parameters collected by connected devices (pedometer and connected scale), organize appointments with patients and ensure the traceability of exchanges with patients. A smartphone application tracks different modes of locomotion used.</description>
