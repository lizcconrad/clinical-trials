         22. The participant has abnormal laboratory values that suggest a clinically significant
             underlying disease at the assessment prior to the initial injection of study vaccine,
             or the participant has the following lab abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) more than 3 times the upper limits of normal.
