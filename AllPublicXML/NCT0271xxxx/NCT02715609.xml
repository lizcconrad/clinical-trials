    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a multi-institutional, phase I/II study of disulfiram (DSF) for
      patients with presumed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) based on magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) or biopsy, including administration before surgery and during adjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy. Patients will be treated with 3 days of preoperative DSF/copper (Cu) prior
      to their surgery (or biopsy), which will be followed by collection of blood and tumor samples
      during surgery for analysis of drug uptake. After the surgery, patients will receive standard
      radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) with the addition of concurrent DSF/Cu.

    <time_frame>Estimated to be 2 years and 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DSF is defined as the dose level at which 20% of the cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within 18 weeks from start of RT (or 12 weeks from the end of RT if there is a delay in RT). MTD is assessed from the first dose of DSF in combination with TMZ and RT; patients will not be assessed for DLT during the pre-surgery period when they are receiving the lead-in doses of DSF.
A DLT is defined as a clinically significant adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications/TMZ which occurs within 18 weeks following the first dose of DSF with RT+TMZ (corresponding to approximately 6 weeks during RT and 12 weeks after RT)</description>

          -  Treatment with the following medications are contraindicated with DSF when taken
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of DSF + Cu: metronidazole, isoniazid,
             dronabinol, carbocisteine, lopinavir, paraldehyde, ritonavir, sertaline, tindazole,
             tixanidine, atazanavir. (Note: the following medications are not contraindicated but
             should be cautioned if taking concurrently with DSF: warfarin, phenytoin,
             theophylline, chlorzoxazone, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam. If the patient is taking
             warfarin, INR should be monitored closely. If the patient has to remain on phenytoin,
             its serum concentration and response should be monitored closely.

          -  Active or severe hepatic, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular disease, including
             myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment, New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled
