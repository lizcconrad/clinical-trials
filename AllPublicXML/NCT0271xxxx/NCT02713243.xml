  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether LJN452 improves the symptoms of bile acid
      diarrhea and to assess its safety and tolerability profile in patients with primary bile acid
      diarrhea (pBAD) to guide decision-making regarding further clinical development in this
      indication.
