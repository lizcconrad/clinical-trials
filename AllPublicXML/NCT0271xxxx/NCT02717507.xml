  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well low-dose carvedilol works in preventing
      heart failure in cancer survivors exposed to high dose anthracyclines for management of
      childhood cancer. Patients who received high-dose anthracycline chemotherapy are at a much
      greater risk for developing heart failure compared to survivors who didn't get any
      anthracycline chemotherapy. Heart failure happens when the heart muscle has been weakened and
      can't pump blood as well as it should. Carvedilol may help lower the risk of cardiovascular
      complications.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of a two-year course of low-dose carvedilol on surrogate
      echocardiographic indices of heart failure (HF) risk, including: Left ventricular (LV)
      posterior wall thickness-dimension ratio (LV T-D); LV systolic and diastolic function, and
      afterload; Natriuretic peptides, troponins, and galectin-3.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish safety and tolerability of this two-year course of low-dose carvedilol,
      assessing both objective measures (hepatic function) and patient reported outcomes.

      II. To examine the modifying effect of demographic, clinical, and molecular characteristics
      on the risk: benefit ratio from this two-year carvedilol intervention.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the long-term efficacy of carvedilol in preventing cardiomyopathy and/or heart
      failure in high-risk childhood cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive low-dose carvedilol orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID)
      for 24 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD or BID for 24 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.

    <description>Z-scores appropriately transformed to normality as necessary. The analysis will be conducted accounting for correlation among repeated measurements within individuals.
