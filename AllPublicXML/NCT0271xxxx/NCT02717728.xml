  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no standard of care or best practice for managing post-operative pain for
      patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. Perioperative pain with these procedures can be
      substantial. It has been shown that up to 90% of patients in the Post-anesthesia care unit
      (PACU) following hip arthroscopy report pain scores of 7/10. Poor pain management following
      hip fracture surgery directly results in increased time spent in high cost health care areas
      and delayed time to ambulation. Continuous regional anesthesia following hip arthroplasty has
      been shown to reduce narcotic consumption and related side-effects (reduction of
      post-operative pain, delirium, and length of stay).

      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a fascia iliaca nerve block
      in reducing post-operative pain within the first 24 hours following hip arthroscopy.
      Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of the drug ropivacaine will be studied via laboratory
      analysis of blood samples. Ultimately, the objective of this research is to develop a
      standard of care or best practice for the management of post-operative pain following hip
      arthroscopy. This study will include the entire age range of patients who are seen for hip
      arthroscopy at Boston Children's Hospital, for which there is a 35 year age limit. Both sexes
      will be included in the study.

      The study design will be real catheter versus a sham catheter(control). All subjects will
      receive general anesthesia. The catheters (real or sham) will be administered after the
      induction of general anesthesia and before the beginning of the surgery until 24 hours after
      recorded PACU admittance time. The anesthesia team placing the block will not be blinded. The
      orthopaedic surgeon (Dr. Yen) and all evaluators will be blinded to the absence or presence
      of a real catheter. In the case of a sham catheter, the anesthesia team will rig a pump to
      look like it is dispensing local anesthesia.

      To determine the pharmacokinetics of ropivicaine during standard fascia iliaca block,
      following induction of general anesthesia, a large bore IV catheter will be inserted for the
      purpose of blood draws (all patients).

      This study will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study. All patients who
      are scheduled to undergo a hip arthroscopy with Dr. Yen who meet the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be approached and informed consent and assent when indicated would be
      obtained.Attending surgeon, anesthesia care team, PACU nursing staff, inpatient ward nursing
      staff and evaluators will be blinded to study group. Regional Anesthesia team and pharmacy
      staff will be not blinded to assignment of patient group but will have no additional contact
      with patient after provision of sham or actual perineural catheter. the study design will be
      real catheter versus a sham catheter, or control. All subjects will receive general
      anesthesia. The catheters (real or sham) will be administered after the induction of general
      anesthesia and before the beginning of the surgery until 24 hours after recorded PACU
      admittance time. The anesthesia team placing the block will not be blinded. The orthopaedic
      surgeon (Dr. Yen) and all evaluators will be blinded to the absence or presence of a real
      catheter. In the case of a sham catheter, the anesthesia team will rig a pump to look like it
      is dispensing local anesthesia.

           All patients will remain in the hospital for a minimum of 24 hours following surgery per
           Dr. Yen's normal hip arthroscopy standard of care. A blinded observer will record pain
           scores at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours postoperatively.
           Pain scores will be measures at rest by an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging
           from 0-10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst pain imaginable. All patients should
           complete the study and have measurements at each time point. Patient demographics
           including age and gender as well as surgical characteristics including length of
           surgery, estimated blood loss, and surgery type will be recorded.

           Blinded observers will also record the time until patients require additional morphine,
           the amount of morphine consumed at each time it was requested, and whether the patient
           reported nausea or experienced vomiting within the first 24 hours post-operatively.

        5. PACU a) Time 0 = PACU arrival time b) Pain scores: i. Obtained by trained, blinded nurse
           observers ii. Recorded per policy with minimum evaluation every 15 minutes iii. Recorded
           using 11 point numeric rating scale (NRS) 1. 0 = no pain; 10 = severe pain c) PCA

           for NRS &gt; 7 v. continuous hourly infusion = 0

        6. Inpatient Wards

             1. Nurses will evaluate pain per usual practice. Documented minimum every 4 hours. i.
                pain scores &gt;7, nurse will administer: nurse rescue bolus via PCA ii. No dermatome
                test to prevent the introduction of bias by inadvertently un-blinding subjects.
