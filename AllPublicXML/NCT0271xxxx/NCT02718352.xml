  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many buprenorphine treatment programs do not have services dedicated to adolescents and young
      adults. As a precursor to developing and evaluating an adolescent and young adult
      buprenorphine treatment program at APT Foundation Inc, we propose to conduct a 1 year
      prospective study of 16 to 25 year old treatment-seeking individuals enrolled in the APT
      Adolescent and Young Adult Suboxone Program
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will consent to in-person assessments and monthly chart reviews. We anticipate
      that the results from this study will inform the development of future services targeted
      towards adolescents and young adults with opioid dependence.
