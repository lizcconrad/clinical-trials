    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology from Jan 2016 to
      Jan 2018 at Institute of Liver &amp; Biliary Sciences, New Delhi. Study group will comprise of
      patients with acute liver failure (ALF) who have no option for liver transplant (due to any
      reason) or have contraindications for liver transplant or have no prospective living donor
      and will be assessed for enrollment in the trial.
