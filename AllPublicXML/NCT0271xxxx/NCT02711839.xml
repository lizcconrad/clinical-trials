    <textblock>
      In order to response the increasing of aging population cause losing ability that need
      long-care needs, the project entitled &quot;10-year long-term care program&quot; from Executive Yuan in
      2007 is carried out to assist economically disadvantaged and disabled elderly to acquire
      daily nutrition. Therefore, the long-term care resident's nutritional status got more
      attention than before. Out of control in blood glucose will not only increase bed sores and
      urinary tract infection in tube feeding residents but also rise medical expenditures. The
      nutritional status of long-term care institutions, anyang homes and nursing home are
      generally bad in nutrition management due to high cost of nutritional supplements from
      foreign imports that cause the burden of families. In this study, we will recruit diabetic
      subjects that divide into white sweet potato group (experimental group) and commercial
      formula group (control group) by using randomized, parallel and open clinical study through
      tube feeding in sixty days.

      All subjects will be evaluated the blood sugar and clinical nutrition assessment such as
      postural measurement, urine test and blood biomarker examination.
