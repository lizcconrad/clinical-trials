                  study (SP848, EP0034, or other pediatric study); OR,

               2. Prescription lacosamide (RxL) subject: Subject is currently receiving prescribed
                  oral LCM from commercial supply (eg, VIMPAT) as adjunctive or monotherapy; OR,

               3. Initiating intravenous lacosamide (IIL) subject: Subject is not currently
                  receiving LCM and will receive intravenous (iv) LCM as adjunctive treatment in
                  EP0060. Initiation of LCM monotherapy is not permitted in IIL subjects.

          -  Subject is an OLL or RxL subject and meets both of the following criteria:

               1. Subject has been administered LCM for the treatment of epilepsy for at least 2
                  weeks prior to Screening; AND,

               2. Subject has been administered (OLL) or prescribed (RxL) oral LCM at a dose of
                  2mg/kg/day to 12mg/kg/day (for subjects &lt;50kg) or 100mg/day to 600mg/day (for
                  subjects &gt;=50kg). Open-label study drug LCM (OLL) or prescribed oral LCM dose
                  (RxL) must be stable for at least 3 days prior to first LCM infusion; OR,

          -  Subject is an ILL subject and is on a stable dosage regimen of at least 1
             antiepileptic drug (AED). The daily dosage regimen of concomitant AED therapy must be
             kept constant for a period of at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.
