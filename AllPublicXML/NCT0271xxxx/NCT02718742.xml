      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
      maintenance therapy works after cisplatin-based chemotherapy and surgery in treating patients
      with high-risk bladder cancer. Maintenance therapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation, can help keep cancer from coming back after it has disappeared
      following initial chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in patients with high risk
      urothelial carcinoma treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by
      curative intent cystectomy receiving maintenance therapy with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS), time to progression and duration of response in
      patients treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative intent
      cystectomy receiving maintenance therapy with nab-paclitaxel.

      II. To evaluate the adverse events associated with use of single agent nab-paclitaxel
      (AbraxaneÂ®) in patients with high risk urothelial carcinoma receiving maintenance therapy
      III. To evaluate Health Related Quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by the European
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Care (EORTC) QLQ-C30.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in high risk patients with
      urothelial carcinoma prior to initiation of maintenance therapy (baseline) and after
      nab-paclitaxel exposure (at cycles 2, 4).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

    <description>The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated using the approach of Duffy and Santner. Additionally, if some patients are lost to follow-up not having been observed for at least 6 months, an estimate and confidence interval for the 6-month progression-free survival rate incorporating censoring will be computed using the method of Kaplan-Meier (1958).</description>
