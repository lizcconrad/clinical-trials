  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal vascular malformation (GIVM), which is an important cause of acute or
      chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, consequently is in dire of effective treatment. The
      investigators' previous study first confirmed thalidomide treatment of GIVM bleeding was safe
      and effective. This trial intends to investigate the efficiency of endoscopic intervention to
      the hemorrhage due to GIVM. What more, the research tends to suggest standardizing clinical
      paths for small bowel bleeding due to GIVM.

      This multi-institutional clinical trial investigates the efficacy of endoscopic intervention
      to the recurrent small intestinal hemorrhage due to GIVM. Patients with recurrent bleeding
      (&gt;2 times for one year) will undergo balloon assisted enteroscopy and be treated with
      endoscopic therapy if necessary. The hierarchical primary endpoints were the difference in
      yearly Bleeding times, followed (if significant) by the difference in Blood Transfusions,
      Total Transfused Red Cell Requirements, yearly bleeding Episodes, Bleeding Duration, yearly
      average Hemoglobin (Hb) level, hospitalization and iron requirement. The study will be done
      at 10 centers in China.

    <description>Patients with recurrent bleeding (&gt;2 times for one year) will undergo balloon assisted enteroscopy and be treated with endoscopic therapy if necessary. Currently available endoscopic modalities are argon laser, bipolar electrocoagulation (BiCAP), band ligation, cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation and argon plasma coagulation (APC). Among these options, APC is the most promising.</description>
