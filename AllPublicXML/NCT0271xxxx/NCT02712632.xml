      The GoDARTS study will encompass all patients, with diabetes, aged 16 and upwards who meet
      the planned inclusion criteria. The study aims to investigate biomarkers associated with
      diabetes progression, therapeutic response, diabetes complications and related traits, and
      specifically to investigate mechanisms of action and response to metformin. The study will
      specifically target patients who have been diagnosed within the past 2 years and follow up
      will be by linkage to electronic health record data. Up to 6,000 patients will be recruited
      into the study over a period of 2-3 years with a primary aim to identify 1000 of these
      patients who should be suitable to be started on metformin therapy.

      Most patients will undergo a single screening visit lasting approximately 20 minutes
      conducted on an outpatient basis. Patients commenced on metformin therapy will need to attend
      a second clinic visit to be carried out between 4-6 months after initiation of metformin
      therapy.

      Up to 9 health boards will be approached regarding participating in the study, and it is
      estimated that between 4-6 diabetes patients will be recruited into the study each week, at
      each site.

      All screened patients will provide consent for data linkage and longitudinal follow up and
      their samples and data will be used to supplement the SHARE/SDRN bioresource. The collection
      into the resource will be managed by the co-ordinating centre study team based at the
      University of Dundee/NHS Tayside. The resource will be hosted by the Tayside Biorepository
      and access to samples and data will be managed by the Tayside Biorepository on behalf of the
      whole of Scotland.

      This GoDARTS-Scotland proposal aims to investigate biomarkers associated with diabetes
      progression, therapeutic response, diabetes complications and related traits, and
      specifically to investigate mechanisms of action and response to metformin. GoDARTS-Scotland
      will specifically target the patient group who have been diagnosed with diabetes in the
      previous 2 years and follow up will be by linkage to electronic health record data.

      The study will, for the most part, involve a single study visit lasting approximately 20
      minutes. Informed consent will be obtained before any study procedures are carried out.

      In addition, those patients who are not on metformin will undergo more comprehensive sampling
      and a second visit, between four to six months, after initiation of metformin. As current
      guidelines suggest all patients who are newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes should be
      treated with metformin the investigator will ask the patient and General Practitioner to
      consider initiation of metformin, although this is a clinical decision that will be made by
      the GP. Between four to six months after commencement of Metformin the patient will be asked
      to return to the clinic for a second visit where additional samples and measures will be
      taken.

      The investigator plans to recruit patients aged 16 and upwards with a diagnosis of diabetes
      from several Scottish Health Boards.

      The Resource will be hosted by the Tayside Biorepository which is part of the East of
      Scotland Tissue Bank. Access to samples and data will be managed by the Tayside Biorepository
      on behalf of the whole of Scotland. All initial requests for access will be made to the
      Tayside Biorepository Access Committee who will manage the process and send requests for
      access to data to the relevant access committees.

      All eligible patients will be recruited into this study from February 2016 until January 2019
      and this will allow any necessary follow up visits to take place.

      At visit 1 blood samples will be collected for DNA and RNA extraction. Urine samples will be
      collected to measure for biomarkers. Stool samples will be collected to measure for
      microbiota. (Stool samples will only be collected from those patients who are initiated on
      metformin therapy during the study period.

      For those patients who are commenced on metformin therapy during the study a second study
      visit is required where all blood, urine and stool samples will be repeated.
