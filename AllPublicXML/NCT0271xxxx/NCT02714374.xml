  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the investigational product GL-ONC1.
      GL-ONC1, a vaccinia virus, has been genetically modified for use as a potential anti-cancer
      drug to destroy cancer cells. Vaccinia virus has been used successfully in the past as
      smallpox vaccine in millions of people worldwide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase 1b dose escalation study evaluating the safety
      and effect of the oncolytic virus GL-ONC1 administered intravenously, with or without
      eculizumab, prior to surgery in patients with advanced solid organ tumors.

      GL-ONC1 is a genetically engineered oncolytic vaccinia virus, which disrupts nonessential
      genes and expression of the foreign gene expression. Evidence suggest that GL-ONC1 is able to
      infect tumor tissue and kill tumor cells.

      The goals of this study are to evaluate the safety of GL-ONC1 and to assess the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile of GL-ONC1 in vivo.
