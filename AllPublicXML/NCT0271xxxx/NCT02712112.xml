  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent preclinical study has suggested a potential possibility that imatinib might promote
      tumor growth in the presence of secondary resistance mutations [10]. This result imply that
      intermittent dosing schedule of imatinib rechallenge might be better than continuous dosing
      schedule in terms of controlling tumors harboring secondary resistance mutations. In
      addition, in these heavily pretreated patients, even mild grade of toxicity may significantly
      impair quality of life, and intermittent dosing schedule may have an advantage in this
      context. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that intermittent dosing schedule of imatinib
      rechallenge might be feasible and effective in patients with TKI-refractory GISTs. This study
      will assess the feasibility of intermittent imatinib dosing schedule in patients with GISTs
      who had failures from both imatinib and sunitinib.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to an imatinib arm with either intermittent or continuous
      dosing schedule with a ratio of 1:1 by using a computer-based system. Imatinib will be
      administered at a dose of 400 mg/day, once a day with food, in the form of 100-mg tablets.
      Patients assigned to the continuous dosing arm will receive imatinib without off-schedule,
      and those assigned to the intermittent dosing arm will received imatinib with one-week
      on/one-week off dosing schedule. Four weeks of study treatment is considered as one cycle for
      both continuous and intermittent dosing schedules.

      In both arms, the imatinib treatment beyond multiple progressions defined by RECIST version
      1.1 is permitted, unless treating physician decided that there is no clinical benefit with
      imatinib. Imatinib will be discontinued when unacceptable toxicity or patient's withdrawal of
      consent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 19 years and older

          -  Patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST which has been histologically confirmed
             by the detection of CD117 on immunohistochemical staining or genetically confirmed by
             the detection of mutation in KIT or PDGFRα genes on direct sequencing of tumor DNA.

          -  Prior clinical benefit from 1st line imatinib defined as CR, PR, or SD at 6 months
             after the start of 1st line imatinib

          -  Patients whose disease has progressed with at least both prior imatinib (400mg/day)
             and sunitinib therapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 ~ 3

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as defined by platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L and neutrophils ≥
             1.5 x 109/L

             aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x ULN in the absence
             of liver metastases, or &lt; 5 x UNL in the presence of liver metastases.

          -  Expected life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks in the absence of any intervention
