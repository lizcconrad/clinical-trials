    <textblock>
      Phase 2 study designed to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of Faldaprevir
      and TD-6450 alone or in combination with other antivirals for a 12-week treatment duration in
      treatment-naïve participants with genotype 1b hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

      A study to evaluate the safety and effect of treatment with experimental antiviral drugs
      alone or in combination with ribavirin in treatment-naïve participants with genotype 1b
      hepatitis C infection. The study will test the safety and anti-viral activity of two regimens
      administered for a duration of 12 weeks. Secondary objectives of this study are to determine
      the pharmacokinetics of the study drugs when co-administered, and to evaluate HCV RNA
      kinetics during treatment.
