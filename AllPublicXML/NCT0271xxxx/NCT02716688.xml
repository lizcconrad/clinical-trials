      To investigate the efficacy and toxicity of S-1 with concurrent radiotherapy in older
      patients with esophageal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older patients with esophageal cancer have been correlated with poor prognosis because of
      having little chance to receive aggressive local therapy, including concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy. In this phase II trial, the efficacy and toxicity of S-1 with concurrent
      radiotherapy will be investigated in this setting.

    <description>Radiotherapy will be delivered with a daily fraction of 1.8-2.0Gy to a total dose of 54-60Gy. Preplanned concurrent S-1 (70mg/m²/day) will be administered on Day 1 for 14 days, every 3 weeks. After CCRT, maintenance S-1 will be given up to four cycles.</description>

    <description>S-1 will be administered orally twice daily for 14 days at a dose of 70 mg/m2/day with concurrent radiotherapy for 2 cycles. Patients who showed a response greater than that of stable disease underwent additional S-1 until disease progression, serious adverse events, or patient refusal up to six cycles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cytologically or histologically confirmed esophageal carcinoma;

          2. ECOG performance status: 0-1;

          3. No treatments prior to enrollment;

          4. At least one measurable lesion on CT, MRI or esophageal barium exam;

          5. Normal functions of heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow;

          6. Blood exams qualified for chemotherapy, which included hemoglobulin ≥9 g/dl,
             neutrophil ≥1.5×109/L and platelet (PLT) ≥100×109/L, creatinine ≤1.5 UNL;

          7. Informed consent signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatments of chemotherapy or irradiation;

          2. Poor bone marrow, liver and kidney functions, which would make chemotherapy
             intolerable;

          3. Contraindication for irradiation: complete obstruction of esophagus, deep esophageal
             ulcer, fistula to mediastinum, or haematemesis;

          4. Participating in other clinical trials;

          5. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to: active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities;

          6. The subject has had another active malignancy within the past five years except for
             cervical cancer in site, in situ carcinoma of the bladder or non-melanoma carcinoma of
             the skin.
