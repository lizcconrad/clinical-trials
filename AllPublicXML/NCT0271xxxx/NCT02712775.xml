  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is the sole therapy for end-stage liver diseases and acute liver
      failure in children and adults. However, use of this life-saving technique is limited due to
      a severe shortage of donor livers. The number of transplants currently performed is
      approximately one-third of the number needed to accommodate the more than 16,000 patients
      awaiting an organ in the US. Over 20% of patients on the liver transplant waiting list die
      prior to transplantation due to organ shortages. The median waiting time in 2011 was over 300
      days. Poor immediate graft function and primary non function (PNF) are clinically significant
      events, especially in recipients of marginal livers (elderly donors, extended cold storage
      time, or steatosis). PNF has dramatic effects on patient morbidity and mortality,
      necessitating prolonged and expensive stays in intensive care units, and re-transplantation
      is the only life-saving therapy in patients with failing liver grafts due to PNF. This
      further exerts greater burden on the already scarce donor organ pool. Furthermore, biliary
      strictures and ischemic cholangiopathy, as a result of severe ischemia reperfusion injury,
      cause prolonged hospital stay, long-term complications, and increased costs. Targeted
      treatments, such as the one proposed in this application, will reduce the need for
      re-transplantation, reduce biliary injury, and potentially increase the number of donor
      organs available.

      Liver transplantation is the sole therapy for end-stage liver diseases in children and
      adults. However, use of this life-saving technique is limited due to a severe shortage of
      donor livers and, consequently, over 1500 patients/year on waiting lists die prior to
      transplantation due to organ shortages. Also, poor immediate graft function remains a
      persistent problem especially in recipients of marginal livers, and biliary strictures
      evolving from reperfusion injury cause prolonged hospital stay, increased health care costs,
      and increased mortality. Furthermore, hepatic cold storage and reperfusion in transplantation
      settings cause mitochondrial dysfunction in liver cells, which constitutes a great risk for
      primary nonfunction and initial poor function after liver transplantation. The tetracycline
      derivative minocycline is a safe and widely used antibiotic that possesses cytoprotective
      effects through prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction in a variety of disease models.
      Recently, we showed that minocycline also protects against graft dysfunction and failure
      after orthotopic rat liver transplantation and against cell death after ischemia-reperfusion
      to cultured rat hepatocytes. Minocycline treatment specifically prevented mitochondrial
      dysfunction and increased graft and animal survival by blocking necrotic and apoptotic death
      pathways. Clinical studies indicating severe deterioration of mitochondrial function in
      livers during preservation provide a strong impetus to investigate minocycline as an
      effective agent to decrease injury and improve graft function after human clinical
      transplantation.
