      Osteopathic care impact on postoperative pain assessed by osteopathic session, evaluated by
      EVENDOL scale surgery on children with congenital heart disease

    <textblock>
      The management of pain in children after cardiac surgery is the key to ensure a better
      comfort and fast home return.

      Aside drugs and psychology or physical therapy, no other alternative is proposed in the
      medico-surgical unit of pediatric cardiology at the Necker hospital.

      Following a feasibility study within the department, osteopathic care showed significant pain
      reduction in postoperative surgery assessed through the EVENDOL scale.

      The goal was mainly to improve mobility restricted areas due to the operation, and so help to
      reduce post-operative pain.

      Investigators propose to continue the assessment of the overall osteopathic taking care of
      the child after heart surgery while retaining EVENDOL scale as primary endpoint. Population
      will include children from the age of 5 days to less than 7 years old.

    <description>The treatment begins, if possible, on the body part of the child whose osteopathic score is the highest , with the least elasticity and mobility. Then the other restricted joints will be treated. The set of techniques will be carried out after palpation and appropriate tensioning. The various actions will be carried out on the tissues and joints who have been particularly affected by the operation.
When a joint or tissue has a restricted mobility in a direction or a specific movement, it will require appropriate and gently manual correction, in order to reduce and improve its functionality.</description>

    <description>The simulated treatment also begins with the body part of the child whose osteopathic score is the highest. Then the other restricted joints will be treated. The set of techniques will be carried out with the same investments as the tests , with a superficial palpatory agreement and without tensioning so that the restricted articulation or tissue will not be corrected</description>
