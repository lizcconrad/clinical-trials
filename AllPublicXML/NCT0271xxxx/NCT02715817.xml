      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the use the Nintendo Wii® (NW) and
      conventional therapeutic exercises in the rehabilitation of balance and gait of the
      post-stroke patients and the impact on quality of life.

      This Randomised clinical trial (RCT) has longitudinal and prospective feature, held at the
      Neurosciences Clinic located at the Clinic Professor Francisco Magalhães Neto the HUPES
      Complex / Federal University of Bahia from June 2015 until June 2017.

      In the initial evaluation were obtained by a trained examiner and blinded to the allocation
      of participants, all personal data of all patients, as well as evaluations of balance, gait,
      and quality of life through specific validated scales:

        1. Berg Balance Scale (BBS);

        2. Tinetti Gait Scale (TGS)

        3. Quality of Life Scale Specific for stroke (QLSSS) ;

      The investigators employ a program of conventional therapeutic exercises and virtual
      rehabilitation with NW, for a period of two months, with sessions two times a week for 50
      minutes (a total of 16 sessions).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>BBS</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale that allows a functional assessment of the balance of the performance. It is based on 14 common items of everyday life, graduated from 0 to 4 points, reaching 56 points maximum score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TGS</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 12-point instrument of observational analysis of gait ability. The count for each exercise ranges from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 2, with a lower score indicating a poorer physical ability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>QLSSS</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QLSS was developed to measure the quality of life of patients with stroke sequela.It contains 49 items arranged into 12 fields, and the score for each item ranges from 1 to 5 points and the total score can range from 49 to 245, so that the lower the score, the greater the degree of dependence and difficult to perform tasks, which indicates a worse perception of quality of life.</description>

    <description>A virtual rehabilitation program (G0) based on the use of the NW for a period of two months, with sessions two times a week for 50 minutes (a total of 16 sessions).All treatment groups prior to perform the study interventions,stretches of upper and lower limbs for 10 minutes.
The G0 treatment program consists of the following protocols: a) protocol 1 games (Balance Bubble Plus and Tennis); b) protocol 2 games (Rhythm Parade and Boxing).</description>

    <description>A program of conventional therapeutic exercises (G1) for a period of two months, with sessions two times a week for 50 minutes (a total of 16 sessions).All treatment groups prior to perform the study interventions,stretches of upper and lower limbs for 10 minutes. The G1 treatment program consists of the following protocols: a) protocol 1: 30 minutes of upper limb PNF diagonal exercise (flexion-abduction-external rotation and extension-abduction-internal rotation), and 10 minutes of scapula PNF diagonal exercise (anterior and posterior elevation); b) protocol 2: 20 minutes of lower limb PNF diagonal exercise (flexion-abduction-external rotation and flexion-abduction-internal rotation),10 minutes of pelvis PNF diagonal exercise (anterior and posterior depression), and 10 minutes gait cycle training;</description>
