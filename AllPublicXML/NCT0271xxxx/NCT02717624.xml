          -  Agreement to use highly effective forms of contraception during the study and for 90
             days after the last dose of ACP 196, 120 days after the last dose of bendamustine, or

          -  Treatment Naive MCL patients requiring treatment with no exposure to prior therapies.
             Relapsed/Refractory patients defined as disease relapsed or been refractory to ≥ 1
             prior therapies for MCL and requiring further treatment. Patient who discontinued any
             prior treatment for MCL for tolerability reasons can also be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or untreated symptomatic
             arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of

             Association Functional Classification.Exception: Subjects with controlled,
             asymptomatic atrial fibrillation during screening are allowed to enroll on study

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function,
             resection of the stomach, extensive small bowel resection that is likely to affect
             absorption, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease, partial or complete bowel
             obstruction, or gastric restrictions and bariatric surgery, such as gastric bypass

          -  Uncontrolled active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection (defined as
             exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement,
             despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment), or intravenous anti-infective
             treatment within 2 weeks before first dose of study drug

          -  Breastfeeding or pregnant

          -  Concurrent participation in another therapeutic clinical trial.
