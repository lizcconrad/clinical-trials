    <textblock>
      This phase I pilot trial studies the side effects of stereotactic radiosurgery and nivolumab
      in treating patients with newly diagnosed melanoma that has spread to the brain or spine.
      Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high
      dose of radiation directly to the tumor to more precisely target the cancer. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as nivolumab may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together with nivolumab may be a better treatment
      for melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety profile of stereotactic radiosurgery with nivolumab in combination to
      treat patients with newly diagnosed melanoma brain or spinal metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate local control rate in brain and spine. II. To estimate systematic control
      rate. III. To estimate progression-free survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore peripheral blood immune response during and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients then undergo
      stereotactic radiosurgery on day 8 per standard of care. Courses with nivolumab repeats every
      14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 10 weeks, and
      then every 3 months thereafter.
