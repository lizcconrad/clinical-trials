      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between glutamate and related
      brain chemicals and treatment response to clozapine in patients with treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia.

      This study will be a prospective proton spectroscopy (1H-MRS) study designed to compare the
      levels of glutamate, glutamine, glx, and glutathione in age- and gender- matched patients
      with poor response to clozapine (URS), patients with good response to clozapine (non-URS),
      and healthy controls. Participants with schizophrenia who fail to respond to optimal
      treatment with at least two different non-clozapine antipsychotics (i.e. treatment-resistant
      schizophrenia [TRS]) and who are starting clozapine as part of their clinical care will be
      recruited. A sample of healthy controls will also be recruited. Participants with TRS will
      have two 1H-MRS scans. The 1H-MRS scan will be performed within 1 week and 12 weeks after
      clozapine initiation. Clinical assessments will be performed within 1 week of each 1H-MRS
      scan and after 6 weeks of clozapine treatment. Cognitive assessments will also be performed
      within 1 week of 1H-MRS scans. Healthy controls will also undergo two 1H-MRS scans with a
      12-week interval. Cognitive assessments will also be performed within 1 week of 1H-MRS scans.

        Participants with schizophrenia who fail to respond to optimal treatment with at least two
        different non-clozapine antipsychotics (i.e. treatment-resistant schizophrenia [TRS]) and
        are starting clozapine will be recruited. A sample of healthy controls will also be
        recruited.

        Inclusion Criteria for Participants with TRS:

          -  DSM-IV/SCID diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder,
             or psychotic disorder NOS.

          -  Age 18 years or older at time of scanning

          -  History of failure to respond to at least two previous sequential antipsychotic
             treatments different to clozapine, each attaining a chlorpromazine daily dose of≥ 400
             mg for a duration ≥ 6 consecutive weeks.Long-acting antipsychotic treatment will not
             be allowed during the last trial prior to clozapine in order to avoid residual
             concentrations or effects.Failure of treatment will be defined by a Clinical Global
             Impression Severity (CGI-Severity) score of ≥4 and score of ≥4 on 2 Positive and
             Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive symptom items. The CGI-Severity or Global
             Assessment of Functioning (GAF) will be completed retrospectively based on information
             provided by the participant, participant's psychiatrist, medical chart, or other
             sources of available collateral information.
