  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown relationship between exercise intensity and improvement
      cardiometabolic health such as body composition, endothelial function, blood pressure and
      blood lipids. It has been suggested that high intensity interval training and also strength
      or resistance training generate positive effects on metabolic risk factors, nevertheless the
      comparison between both types of training and their combination has not yet provided
      conclusive evidence. Also, it has been shown that dietary restriction has similar or more
      positive effects that exercise alone and the effect is greater when it is combined with
      exercise. For these reasons, it is necessary to clarify which type of training, in
      combination with a dietary restriction, is more effective to improve cardiometabolic health

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that high intensity interval, resistance training or combined
      training would result in similar improvements in cardiometabolic health as compared to the
      usual clinical care in a cohort of sedentary overweight (age 30-50 years old).
