      The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and effectivity of pelvic organ prolapse
      (POP) surgery. In this multi center study the population consists of POP operations done in
      Finland year 2015.The study is prospective and validated questionnaires are used to measure

      Patients awaiting for surgical procedure for a symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are
      recruited for the study. The recruiting is done in 41 hospitals in Finland, at gynecological
      outpatient clinics. Participants are given information of the study and give a written
      approval to join the study. Participants are asked to fill in questionnaires, that measure
      the quality of life. Three validated questionnaires are used: Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory
      PFDI-20, Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire PISQ-12 and
      health-related quality of life instrument 15D. These questionnaires are sent to participants
      6 months, 2 and 5 years after the surgical treatment. The participants are also asked to
      report adverse effects related to the treatment and their satisfaction to the treatment.
      Information about the surgical procedure (i.e. type and duration of the procedure, blood
      loss, antibiotic and thrombosis prophylaxis) by the operating doctors. Both immediate and
      delayed treatment-related adverse effects are also reported by the doctors. Data is partly
      collected by questionnaires filled in internet. All the collected data is protected by high
      security and coded before analyses. Permission of protocol used in this study is given by the
      Ethical Committee of University of Eastern Finland and Finnish National Institute for Health
      and Welfare.
