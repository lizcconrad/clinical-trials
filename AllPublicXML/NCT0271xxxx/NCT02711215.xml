  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) raise serotonin (5-HT) in the synaptic cleft
      and are the current first line of pharmacological antidepressive treatment. Yet, there is a
      missing link between this first molecular step in their mechanism of action and observed
      clinical improvement. We have determined to establish a framework combining genuine molecular
      and functional imaging, i.e. hybrid pharmaco-PET/MR imaging, of the human serotonergic system
      in order to predict antidepressant treatment response.

      Objectives:

        1. To predict antidepressant treatment response from data obtained using hybrid PET/MR with
           acute pharmacological challenge.

        2. To discriminate healthy from depressed subjects using this paradigm.

        3. To establish models connecting regional changes in occupancy of serotonin transporters
           (5-HTT) following citalopram infusion, with changes in brain activation and connectivity
           of major resting-state hub networks.

      Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over mono-center study.

      Materials and methods:

      40 major depressed (MDD) and 40 healthy subjects will undergo 2 PET/MR scans on a 3T SIEMENS
      mMR Biograph scanner: 1. challenge with citalopram 8mg 2. placebo (saline). After structural
      imaging, functional MRI will be continuously acquired. [11C]DASB will be applied using a
      bolus + constant infusion paradigm to probe 5-HTT binding potentials and monitor 5-HTT
      occupancy with drug challenge, applied after 70min, in a single session. Scanning will be
      terminated 80min after challenge. MDD patients will receive subsequent escitalopram treatment
      with repeated evaluation of response for 3 months.
