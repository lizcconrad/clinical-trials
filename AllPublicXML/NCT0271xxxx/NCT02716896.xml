  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the standard treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer is the complete removal of
      bladder and adjacent organs, such as prostate or ovaries. Radical cystectomy is fraught with
      complications and risk of death. The researchers hope to learn if chemoradiation (i.e. using
      chemotherapy and radiation), also an acceptable treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer,
      can be used a good alternative therapy option.

      Currently the standard treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer is the complete removal of
      bladder and adjacent organs, such as prostate or ovaries. Such procedure is highly invasive
      and undesirable for some patients.

      The researchers hope to learn if chemoradiation, using chemotherapy and radiation, can be a
      good alternative therapy option. Chemoradiation therapy is also currently considered an
      acceptable clinical approach but is typically used for treatment in patients with muscle
      invasive bladder cancer who have other medical issues that might cause complications during
      or after undergoing surgery. Disease free survival at 5 years is better for those who had
      their bladder removed, but overall survival rates for chemoradiation therapy patients are
      comparable between the two approaches.

    <description>In brief, radical cystectomy is the removal of the entire bladder, nearby lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy), part of the urethra, and nearby organs that may contain cancer cells. In men the prostate, the seminal vesicles, and part of the vas deferens are also removed. In women the cervix, the uterus, the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, and part of the vagina are also removed. Participants in this group may also undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to the surgery. The decision for specific chemotherapy regimen is based on numerous variables such as participant's comorbidities, GFR, participant's preference, and availability of chemotherapeutic regimen.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Radiation and Chemoradiation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Those randomized to this group will undergo systematic chemotherapy and radiation. In brief, participants will receive 33-36 daily fractions of radiation therapy 5 days a week. Concurrently, radiosensitizing chemotherapy involves either cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or mitomycin C (MMC) plus 5-FU. Other concurrent chemotherapy regimens utilized include paclitaxel and gemcitabine. The decision for specific chemotherapy regimen is based on numerous variables such as participant's comorbidities, GFR, participant's preference, availability of chemotherapeutic regimen.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically (histologically) proven diagnosis of primary carcinoma of the bladder
             (transitional cell cancer) within 8 weeks of registration. Operable patients whose
             tumors are primary carcinomas of the bladder and exhibit histologic evidence of
             muscularis propria invasion and are AJCC clinical stages T2-T4a, Nx or N0, M0

          -  If radiologic evaluation of a lymph node is interpreted as &quot;positive&quot;, this must be
             evaluated further either by lymphadenectomy or percutaneous needle biopsy. Patients
             with histologically or cytologically confirmed node metastases or any other metastases
             will not be eligible.

          -  Patients must have an adequately functioning bladder after thorough evaluation by an
             urologist and have undergone as thorough a transurethral resection of the bladder
             tumor as is judged safely possible.

          -  Patients must be considered able to tolerate systemic chemotherapy combined with
             pelvic radiation therapy, and a radical cystectomy by the joint agreement of the
             participating Urologist, Radiation Oncologist, and Medical Oncologist.

          -  History and physical examination including weight, performance status, and body
             surface area within 8 weeks prior to study registration

          -  Zubrod Performance Status 0-2

          -  Age ≥ 18;

          -  CBC/differential obtained no more than 4 weeks prior to registration on study, with
             adequate bone marrow function defined as follows:

               1. WBC ≥ 4000/ml

               2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3;

               3. Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3;

               4. Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 mg/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to
                  achieve Hgb ≥ 10.0 g/dl is acceptable.);

          -  Serum creatinine of 1.5 mg% or less; serum bilirubin of 2.0 mg% or less; creatinine
             clearance of 60 ml/min or greater no more than 4 weeks prior to registration; Note:
             Calculated creatinine clearance is permissible. If the creatinine clearance is &gt; 60
             ml/min, then a serum creatinine of up to 1.8 mg% is allowable at the discretion of the
             principle investigator;

          -  Serum pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential, ≤ 72 hours prior
             to study entry; women of childbearing potential and male participants must practice
             adequate contraception.

          -  Patient must be able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable and unwilling to provide informed consent

          -  Evidence of distant metastases or histologically or cytologically proven lymph node
             metastases

          -  Previous systemic chemotherapy (for any cancer) or pelvic radiation therapy

          -  A prior or concurrent malignancy of any other site or histology unless the patient has
             been disease-free for ≥ 5 years except for non-melanoma skin cancer and/or stage T1a
             prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix

          -  Patients judged not to be candidates for radical cystectomy; patients with pN+ or T4b
             disease are considered to have unresectable disease

             as an aminoglycoside)

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

          -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the
             last 6 months;

          -  Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months;

          -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of

          -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition;
             note,however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need
             to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments
             involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific
             requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients.

          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic.

          -  Is pregnant; women of childbearing potential and male participants unwilling to
             practice adequate contraception.
