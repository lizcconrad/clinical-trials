      Backgroung: Various agents are used to reduce post-operative complications associated with
      palatal donor site surgery for free gingival graft (FGG) harvesting. This study was conducted
      to evaluate the effects of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on palatal wound healing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      125 patients with isolated recessions were treated. The connective tissue graft was obtained
      by the de-epithelialization of a free gingival graft in both groups. Three different
      hemostatic treatments were randomized; PRF with cyanoacrilate adhesive (PRF group, n:42),
      cyanoacrilate adhesive alone (BC group, n:42) and sterile wet gauze compression (WG group,
      n:41). Immediate and delayed bleeding, pain, epithelialization, feeding habits and sensation
      scores were recorded for different time points.
