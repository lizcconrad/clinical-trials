  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the direct anterior approach and the direct lateral
      approach in primary total hip arthroplasty, regarding the postoperative function and pain,
      complications, radiological finds (X-ray), postoperative hemorrhage, markers for muscle
      damage (i.e creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase(LDH/LD) , aspartate
      aminotransferase(AST), C-reactive protein (CRP),Troponin and Myoglobin) or other clinical
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomised controlled clinical trial and follow-up study comparing
      primary total hip arthroplasty performed either through a direct anterior approach or a
      lateral approach. At our hospital(i.e. Emergency County Hospital Cluj-Napoca), the lateral
      transgluteal approach was standard for more than 40 years. Starting 2008,the minimally
      invasive anterior approach was gradually implemented with the aim to facilitate early
      rehabilitation and improve functional results. Reduced blood loss, earlier functional
      recovery, low dislocation rates and shorter stays in hospital have been attributed to the
      muscle-sparing properties of the anterior approach.

    <description>The postoperative rate of improvement in functional outcome, measured by the Harris Hip Score (HHS). The HHS was developed to assess the results of hip surgery and is intended to evaluate pain, function, range of motion and absence of deformity, with a range of possible outcomes from 0 to 100(&lt;70 Poor ;70 - 79 Fair; 80-89 Good; 90 -100 Excellent). The objective is to assess the dynamics of patient clinical recovery comparing functional outcome using HHS at predetermined follow-up visits and pre-op.</description>

    <measure>Functional outcome using the Oxford Hip Score Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative,and at follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford hip score (OHS) is a joint specific outcome measure tool designed to assess disability in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR).The OHS is a patient-centred questionnaire that is designed to assess functional ability, and pain from the patient's perspective. It is a short, twelve-item questionnaire. Each item has five response categories, given a score of between 1-5 (low disability to high disability). Scoring involves summating the total for each item to produce a final score between 12-60, with a higher score indicating greater disability The objective is to assess the dynamics of patient clinical recovery comparing the OHS at predetermined follow-up visits and pre-op.</description>

    <time_frame>preoperative,and at follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Survey consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.The eight sections are: vitality,physical, functioning,bodily pain,general health perceptions,physical role functioning,emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.The objective is to assess the dynamics of patient clinical recovery comparing the SF-36 survey at predetermined follow-up visits and pre-op.</description>

    <description>Performance-based measures such as the 20 meters timed walk (20MTW) Test quantify performance with tasks mimicking activities of daily living, as opposed to relying on individuals perception of performance.Hence, they may provide a more objective measure of functional capacity. The test consists in timing the patient while walking a distance of 20 meters(66feet).</description>

    <description>Creatine kinase (CK) — also known as creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or phospho-creatine kinase — is an enzyme expressed by various damaged tissues.

    <description>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH or LD) is an enzyme found in nearly all living cells.LDH is expressed extensively in body tissues, such as blood cells and heart muscle. Because it is released during tissue damage, it is a marker of common injuries and disease such as surgical muscle damage. Baseline value is acquired before surgery. LDH is measured daily, the first post-op week,in the morning, to avoid physiological circadian variations.</description>

    <description>The procedure begins by positioning the patient supine on a normal table . Both feet are draped separately to assist with dislocating and proximal femural shaft exposure.The surgical incision begins 2-4 cm lateral to the anterior superior iliac spine of the pelvis . It is then carried distally and laterally for about 8-12 cm. After protecting the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, the fascia overlying the tensor fascia latae (TFL) is incised, and a plane is then developed between the TFL and sartorius. After coagulating the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery, a capsulectomy is performed. Placement of the final acetabular component is facilitated by the use of an offset inserter handle.
Femoral preparation begins by placing the operative limb in a position of extension, adduction and external rotation to improve the accessibility of the proximal femur.
Once the final implants are in situ, the hip is reduced and assessed.</description>

    <description>The procedure begins by positioning the patient in the supine decubitus position.
A longitudinal incision is made extending 3-5 cm proximal and about 5-8 cm distal to the tip of the greater trochanter . The fascia is split at the interval between the TFL and gluteus. The tendon and muscle fibres of the gluteus medius are then visualized and split . The gluteus minimus and joint capsule are split. The surgeon then dislocates the femoral head, and performs a femoral neck osteotomy.
The acetabulum is prepared .Soft tissue landmarks and reamer positioning relative to the floor are used to verify acetabular version and inclination.
When preparing the proximal femur, the hip is adducted and externally rotated, with the knee flexed. The femural stem is then press-fitted. Once the final implants are in situ and the hip is reduced, the stability of the construct is assessed.</description>
