      Real-world data on the effects of a fixed-dose combination Long-acting beta agonists +
      long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LABA+LAMA) therapy with tiotropium and olodaterol
      administered in a single device, in COPD patients who need treatment with two long-acting
      bronchodilators, is not available. This is a self-controlled study design enrolling consented
      COPD patients who will be treated with Spiolto Respimat according to the approved Summary of
      Product Characteristics (SmPC).

          3. Patients diagnosed with COPD and requiring long-acting dual bronchodilation (LAMA +
             LABA) treatment according to approved Spiolto Respimat Summary of Product
             Characteristics (SmPC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Global

          3. Patients continuing LABA-ICS (inhaled corticosteroid) treatment should not be
             additionally treated with Spiolto Respimat in order to avoid a double dosing of
             long-acting beta-agonists
