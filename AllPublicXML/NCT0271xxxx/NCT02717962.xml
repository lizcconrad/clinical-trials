    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2, single arm, biomarker-driven study is to determine if treatment
      of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) unmethylated recurrent glioblastoma with
      VAL-083 improves overall survival (OS), compared to historical control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by a dismal prognosis, with a median overall
      survival of 6-9 months. While a standard of care is established for the initial treatment of
      GBM - radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy - management of
      recurrent disease remains suboptimal. Treatment options include repeat surgery,
      re-irradiation, or chemotherapy (including experimental targeted therapies, biologic agents,
      and immunotherapies). Only a minority of patients has response to these treatments, and the
      resultant benefits in progression-free and overall survival are on the order of weeks to
      months.

      Prognosis and response to therapy are known to be better in patients with a methylated MGMT
      promoter gene. Epigenetic silencing of MGMT by promoter methylation is an important factor in
      predicting outcome for patients with GBM treated with temozolomide. Approximately 66% of GBM
      tumors are MGMT unmethylated (high expression of MGMT), which through a MGMT repair
      mechanism, confers resistance to temozolomide, the standard chemotherapy treatment of GBM.

      VAL-083, Dianhydrogalactitol (DAG), unlike temozolomide, is demonstrated to be active
      independent of MGMT resistance mechanisms, in vitro. Thus, it may provide a treatment option
      for those patients that are considered likely to be poor responders to temozolomide.

      This is a non-comparative, single arm, biomarker-driven study with VAL-083. Forty-eight (48)
      eligible patients will receive VAL-083 at 40 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, and 3, for up to 12,
      21-day treatment cycles or until they fulfill one of the criteria for study discontinuation
      (disease progression, death, intolerable toxicities, investigator's judgment, or withdrawal
      of consent). Disease status will be evaluated with clinical and MRI evaluation every other
      21-day cycle, while the patient is receiving VAL-083 treatment, and then approximately every
      42 ± 7 days while remaining on study. Symptom burden will be evaluated using the MD Anderson
      Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) completed by patients at baseline and at the time of
      each imaging evaluation.

      Interval medical histories, targeted physical exams, neurologic evaluations, complete blood
      counts, and other laboratory and safety assessments will be performed approximately every
      21-days. Blood samples will be taken at Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose, 15 ± 5 min, 30 ± 5 min, 60 ±
      10 min, 120 ± 10 min, 240 ± 15 min, and 360 ± 15 min after the end of the of iv infusion with
      VAL-083 to determine the PK profile and dose-exposure relationship of VAL-083.

      Toxicity will be evaluated and documented using the NCI CTCAE version 4.

      This study will take approximately 32 months to enroll.

             assessment demonstrates transformation to GBM (first diagnosis of secondary GBM).

          -  Patients must have radiographic evidence of recurrent/progressive GBM after prior
             therapy (biopsy or resection and chemoradiation); 1st recurrence of GBM only, per

             certified testing at MD Anderson, prior to registration. If initial MGMT testing
             obtained at an outside institution, MGMT status must be centrally retested at MD
             Anderson.

          -  Patients must have Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &gt; 60% (i.e., 70, 80, 90 or 100).

             elapsed from the time of any major surgery, including craniotomy/tumor resection.
             Patients must have recovered from all surgery-related toxicities to Grade 1 or less.

          -  Patients must ≥ 12 weeks from radiotherapy, to minimize the potential for magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) changes related to treatment (pseudo progression) that might
             be misdiagnosed as true progression of disease, unless the patient fulfills criteria
             for early progressive disease by RANO.

          -  Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal high-dose radiation is allowed, but at
             least 2 weeks must have elapsed from the time of treatment, and the patient must have
             subsequent histologic documentation of recurrence, unless the recurrence is a new
             lesion outside the irradiated field.

          -  Patients having prior therapy with Laser Induced Thermal Therapy (LITT) is allowed,
             but at least 21 days must have elapsed from last LITT, with recovery from all
             LITT-related toxicities to Grade 1 or less and subsequent histologic documentation of
             recurrence

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks from last dose of chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have a predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow and organ function.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, and
             laboratory tests and accessible for follow-up.

          -  If the patient has been using the Optune™ device, it will be discontinued before
             initiating treatment with either study medication, and per inclusion criterion listed
             above, the patient must have recovered from all treatment-related toxicities to Grade
             1 or less.

          -  Pregnancy restrictions - Women of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG

             including ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, serious cardiac
             arrhythmia requiring medication, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients with a known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during
             treatment
