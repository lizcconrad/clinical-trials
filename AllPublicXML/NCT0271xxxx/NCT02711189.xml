      Background:

      Oxytocin is a naturally occurring substance in the body. Studies show that oxytocin may
      affect how the body responds to alcohol. Researchers believe oxytocin may be a possible
      treatment for alcoholism.

      Objective:

      To test whether the hormone oxytocin affects the brain reward system. To see if it affects
      how people respond to alcohol and other rewarding things in life like food and seeing loved
      ones.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 21-55 who have an alcohol use disorder.

      Design:

      Participants will have two 6-day inpatient study visits. They will have:

        -  Study medication or placebo given twice daily as a nasal spray.

        -  Height and weight measured.

        -  Medical history.

        -  Blood and urine tests.

        -  Breath tested for alcohol.

        -  Electrocardiogram.

        -  An alcohol administration session. In a bar-like room, where participants will consume
           four alcoholic drinks.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong
           magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder.
           A device called a coil will be placed over their head. Participants will complete tasks
           on a computer screen.

        -  In another alcohol session. they will drink an alcoholic beverage then answer questions.
           Participants will get a tab for eight more drinks ($3.00 per drink). They may drink any
           of the drinks or take the money. Participants will hold and smell a glass of water and
           their favorite alcoholic drink.

        -  Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored.

        -  Saliva samples will be collected

        -  Computer tasks and questionnaires.

      About one week after the end of visit 2, participants will return to clinic for a follow-up
      visit. Symptoms and side effects will be evaluated.

      Objective:

      There is compelling evidence to support that the neuropharmacology of oxytocin (OT) warrants
      further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for addiction. To that end, the link
      between OT and dopaminergic pathways, with respect to motivated behaviors such as drug and
      social reward, is important to establish as a mechanism. Although preliminary clinical
      findings suggest a role of OT to treat withdrawal in alcoholic individuals, there is no
      direct human evidence on the effects of OT administration on dopamine release. Additionally,
      there is no direct human evidence on the effects of OT on the subjective response to alcohol.
      There have been no studies investigating the differential effect, if any, of OT, on the
      neurobehavioral response to various rewarding stimuli including alcohol, food and social
      reward. We propose, therefore, to investigate whether intranasal administration of OT is able
      to significantly reduce subjective response to alcohol, alcohol cue-induced craving and
      self-administration, as well as to examine the neural response to social, alcohol and food
      stimuli.

      Study Population:

      32 (24 completers) males with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) as defined by DSM-5 and
      non-treatment seekers for AUD.

      Design:

      A within-subject, double-blind placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of
      intranasal OT on the response to alcohol challenge, cue reactivity and alcohol
      self-administration, and the neural response to rewarding stimuli. Outcome measures: a)
      effect of OT on subjective response to cumulative alcohol challenge, cue reactivity and
      alcohol self-administration; b) neurobehavioral response to social, alcohol and food stimuli.

      Outcome measures:

      A) effect of OT on subjective response to cumulative alcohol challenge, cue reactivity and
      alcohol self-administration; B) neurobehavioral response to social, alcohol and food stimuli.
