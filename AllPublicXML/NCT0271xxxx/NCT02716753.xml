  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All couples planned for IVF will be asked to participate. After information and received
      informed consent they will be randomized into two groups.

      At the time for ovum pick up during an IVF procedure either half of the amount of seminal
      plasma or the same amount of physiological NaCl solution will be installed around the
      external cervical opening in vagina. The syringe with seminal plasma or physiological NaCl
      solution will be prepared according to a prearranged randomization list by a technician.

      The success rate will be the number of diagnosed pregnancies and live births.

      All couples planned for IVF will be asked to participate. After information and received
      informed consent they will be randomized into two groups.

      At the time for ovum pick up during an IVF procedure either half of the amount of seminal
      plasma or the same amount of physiological NaCl solution will be installed around the
      external cervical opening in vagina.

      Normally we do not use the seminal plasma but now half of it will be installed and the other
      half analysed regarding a number of cytokines possibly involved in the immunological
      preparation of the female internal genitalia.

      The syringe with seminal plasma or physiological NaCl solution will be prepared according to
      a prearranged randomization list by a technician.
