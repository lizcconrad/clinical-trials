    <description>We conducted a study using an evaluation assessment survey to assess the impact of the AMBER support groups on quality of life parameters, compliance with treatment appointments, and patient/family support. After reviewing preliminary results, we identified several recurrent themes, such as the need for health information, discrepancies around the extent of family support and disease disclosure, and an overall satisfaction with the support groups. To further examine these themes, we are initiating a qualitative research study using an in-depth interview guide. A trained interviewer bilingual in Arabic and English will conduct 10-15 in-depth interviews, to saturation, with AMBER's support group participants over a 6 month period.</description>

    <description>The study involves a one-time qualitative assessment to explore key cultural influences on AMBER breast cancer survivors' health behavior. We will focus on self-efficacy in healthcare, coping with breast cancer, social networks of support, and culturally-sensitive support groups. The study investigator will administer questions from the structured interview guide, estimated to take 90 minutes.</description>
