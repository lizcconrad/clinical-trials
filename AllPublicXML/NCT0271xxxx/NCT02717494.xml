      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity,
      transplacental antibody transfer and interference with infant responses to childhood
      vaccination of maternal vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate 10-valent vaccine (PCV-10) or
      pneumococcal polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine (PPV-23) by comparison with placebo.

      This is a multi-center, Phase II, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women on Highly Active Antiretroviral
      Therapy (HAART) who are in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and of their infants.
      The study is designed to investigate the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity,
      transplacental antibody transfer and interference with infant responses to childhood
      vaccination of maternal vaccination with PCV-10 or PPV-23 by comparison with placebo.

      Mothers will be randomized to one of three arms and will receive PCV-10, PPV-23, or placebo
      in a blinded fashion. They will be followed for safety, immunogenicity and vaccine-specific
      anti-capsular pneumococcus (PNC) antibody persistence until 24 weeks post-delivery. Women who
      received placebo will be randomized to a second study step and will receive PCV-10 or PPV-23
      at 24 weeks post-delivery. Antibody responses to the vaccine administered 6 months postpartum
      will be measured. Women who received placebo but cannot be randomized to a second study step
      due to ongoing new pregnancy will be enrolled in a third study step and receive open label
      PCV-10 at the last study visit; no data will be collected on these women and they will not be
      followed after vaccine administration. All infants will receive PCV-10 vaccinations per local
      standard of care.

             the requirements of the protocol.

         15. Pregnancy complications (in the current pregnancy) such as pre-term labor, and
             pre-eclampsia or any other pregnancy related complication, which in the opinion of the

             temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F within 24 hours of entry except
             when, in the opinion of the physician, withholding the agent entails even greater
             risk.

          5. Use of anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy or has developed
             immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness (other than HIV-1 infection) or
