  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate local tolerability of the new
      Econazole/Benzydamine product, in comparison with the Econazole and Benzydamine stand-alone
      products and placebo. Pharmacokinetics of the study products after single and repeated
      applications once a day for 15 days, safety of the investigational products and comfort of
      use will also be evaluated as secondary objectives.
