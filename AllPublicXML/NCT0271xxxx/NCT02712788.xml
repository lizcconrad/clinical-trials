      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of adding Milrinone to the current
      standard treatment for cerebral vasospasm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of milrinone as an agent to treat cerebral
      vasospasm by adding it to standard therapy. This will take the form of a randomized,
      controlled trial in which patients will receive either standard hyperdynamic therapy or
      hyperdynamic therapy + milrinone. The hypothesis of this study is that good outcomes will be
      25% more common in the experimental (milrinone) group than the control (standard therapy)
      group.
