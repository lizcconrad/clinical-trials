  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 10 subjects will be dosed in each group with subjects randomized 8:2 to HL036 or
      placebo. Three of 10 subjects will be randomized to the sentinel dosing in each group. A
      safety data review as masking will be performed for 3days prior to the other subjects
      treatment. Treatment of high dose will proceed following a review of safety data from low
      dose.
