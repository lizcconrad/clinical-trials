  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major health problem that causes annually a million death worldwild. In the
      stress-vulnerability model, suicidal behavior (SB) results from the interaction between an
      individual's predisposition and stressful condition. We hypothesized that the sensitivity to
      social exclusion may represent a core component of the suicidal vulnerability Recent evidence
      also suggest that inflammatory mediators plays a critical role in SB. Furthermore, social
      stressors are particulary strong and specific triggers of inflammatory response.

      To sum up, patients carrying a suicidal vulnerability are expected to present greater
      responses to social rejection in terms of inflammatory activity and psychological pain.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the psychological and inflammatory responses to a social
      stressor validated, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) . We will also investigate the
      moderating effect of childhood abuse, attachment, trait rejection sensitivity and social
      isolation.

      In the second part of the study, we will also investigate the prospective association between
      inflammatory responses induces by laboratory paradigms of social rejection and the occurrence
      of social distress, suicidal ideation and psychological pain in response to social exclusion
      events in real life (using ecological momentary assessment).

      Over one year, we will recruit 140 female outpatients suffering from a major depressive
      episode with (n=70) and without any history of suicide attempt (n=70) from a specialized
      clinic for mood disorders and SB.

      First visit: clinical, biological and neuropsychological assessment Second visit: The TSST is
      a standardized laboratory psychosocial stress protocol that involves public speaking, role
      play, and mental arithmetic tasks in front of a panel of confederate judges. Blood samples
      will be obtained before the introduction to the TSST and immediately after and at + 30, + 60,
      + 90, and + 120 min. Self-ratings of emotional states, anxiety, anger and psychological pain
      will be completed at the same times.

      Third visit: Participants will be instructed to carry a smartphone with them for one week,
      and to record at each alarm signal daily life events, negative emotions, psychological pain,
      suicidal ideas, and specific attributions to these events. Participants will be signalled
      five times a day during the period. Subjects will be contacted by telephone halfway through
      the assessment period to monitor and encourage compliance.

    <description>For the TSST the participants are instructed to imagine having applied for their &quot;dream job&quot; and that they are now invited to a job interview. Three successive phases: (1) A preparation period (3 min), (2) a free speech: explain why you are the best candidate for the job (5 min), (3) a mental arithmetic complex task (5 min). The two tasks (task 2 and 3) are performed in front of a selection committee, three persons dressed in white lab coats, acting in a reserved manner and providing no facial or verbal feedback. Additionally, participants are told that they are video-taped and told that their performance will be evaluated. (in fact, there is no video-tape, just a false camera). After the TSST, patients have to answer to a questionnaire on their smartphone, 5 times a day during 7 days.</description>
