  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective observational study that will capture detailed information
      about the treatment and long term outcomes of 450 patients with PNI resulting from upper
      extremity trauma. The study will focus on a young adult population to include individuals
      ages 18-65. Patients with PNI will be recruited during the hospitalization for initial
      treatment of the upper extremity injury. Additional patients may be identified during clinic
      visits for on-going treatment of upper extremity injuries as nerve injuries evolve or upon
      referral from outside physicians. However, all eligible nerve injuries must be treated within
      6 months of the initial upper extremity trauma. Outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6, 12, 18 and
      24 months following diagnosis of the nerve injury. All assessments will take place in the
      clinic and will include a patient interview and a brief exam to evaluate sensory and motor
      function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages 18-65

          2. Sustained a peripheral nerve injury (including iatrogenic injuries and partial nerve
             injuries) resulting from upper extremity trauma meeting the following criteria:

               1. Involves injury or dysfunction to motor, or motor and sensory function of the
                  axillary, radial, median, ulnar, or musculocutaneous nerve with injury localized
                  distal to the brachial plexus cord level and proximal to the distal flexion
                  crease of the wrist

               2. Involves a &quot;mixed&quot; nerve segment (i.e. involves a location of any of the above
                  specified nerves that can be expected to have both sensory and motor axons
                  present) but does not include sensory only distal terminations of the same
                  nerves.

          3. Receiving surgical treatment (i.e. exploration, neurolysis, repair or reconstruction,
             nerve or tendon transfer) within 6 months of the initial injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Injuries to the brachial plexus roots, trunks, divisions and cords

          2. Injuries to the nerves distal to the distal flexion crease of the wrist

          3. Injuries that involve a distal extension of the parent nerve that is considered
             sensory only (superficial radial nerve, lateral ante brachial cutaneous nerve, etc)

          4. Previous motor or sensory deficit prior to injury (e.g. resulting from trauma, stroke,
             muscular, neurologic, neuromuscular disorder, etc.)

          5. Documented psychiatric disorder that limits ability to consent and maintain follow-up

          6. Unable to speak either English or Spanish

          7. Severe problems with maintaining follow up (e.g patients who are prisoners or homeless
             at time of injury or who are intellectually challenged without adequate family
             support).
