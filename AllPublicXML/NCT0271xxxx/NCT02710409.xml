  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is an acute respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses. There are three types
      of the virus including A, B and C. Both type A and type B viruses can cause acute febrile
      respiratory tract infection, characterized by sudden fever, headache, muscle pain, cough,
      sore throat, nasal congestion and general malaise. The main transmission of influenza is
      through those highly contagious aerosol droplets containing influenza virus passed from
      infected people to susceptible population. Each year in the fall and winter infection of
      influenza is widespread in various age groups, with high incidence rate. Although influenza
      is generally a self-limiting disease, but in children, the elderly (especially those above 65
      years old and those with chronic heart, lung, kidney, liver, blood or metabolic diseases such
      as diabetes or other certain diseases) and those with poor immunity function, influenza can
      easily lead to serious flu complications such as pneumonia, resulting in severe increase of
      morbidity and mortality.

      In order to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a quadrivalent influenza vaccine produced
      by Jiangsu Jindike Biotechnology Co., Ltd. a phase III clinical trial is planned to conduct
      in healthy Chinese subjects aged 3 years and older.

    <description>Immunogenicity outcomes were assessed in serum samples by Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. The lowest dilution used in the assay is 1/10. Seroconversion was defined as either a pre-vaccination HAI titer &lt; 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and ≥ four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer.</description>
