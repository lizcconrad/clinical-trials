      This is a Phase I, FIH, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of AZD4831 after single
      (Part 1) and multiple (Part 2) ascending doses in healthy male subjects. The study will be
      conducted at a single study center with a planned number of subjects of up to 125 healthy
      males, aged 18 to 50 years.
