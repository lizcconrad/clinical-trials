    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of multiple doses of MK-1439 (doravirine) on the
      pharmacokinetics of methadone in participants requiring methadone maintenance therapy. The
      primary hypothesis is that the Area Under the Concentration-Time curve to 24 hours (AUC0-24)
      of (R)-methadone is similar when a maintenance regimen of methadone is administered with or
      without multiple daily doses of MK-1439.
