  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study proposes adding BMP-2 (INFUSE), an anabolic agent, at the surgical site of
      TPA repair in children with NF1, compared to a control group of patients treated surgically
      without BMP-2. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1) to determine if use of an
      osteogenic agent (BMP-2) at the time of surgical repair of TPA in NF1 patients will result in
      improved bone healing; 2) to document safety of BMP-2 in a pediatric NF1 population; and 3)
      to collect, process, and preserve biologic specimens at the time of surgery for future
      studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized study will be performed by a multi-center group of the NF Consortium. A total of
      54 patients will be randomized for treatment with or without INFUSE Bone Graft at the time of
      surgical repair. For all patients, a standard surgical procedure will be used, including:
      resection of pseudarthrosis tissue; placement of a rigid intramedullary rod; and placement of
      autogenous bone graft from iliac crest. For patients in the BMP group, the INFUSE device
      containing BMP-2 will in addition be applied intraoperatively to the osteotomy site. Fracture
      union will be determined by scoring of radiographs (RUST score) for cortical bone fusion and
      callus formation at the osteotomy site. RUST score at 12 months post-surgery will be the
      primary outcome measure to determine efficacy. Secondary measures will include determination
      of time to healing (months); quality of life measures; functional walking measures; and
      incidence of refracture after surgery. This study, once successfully completed, will
      determine if use of INFUSE Bone Graft improves healing of tibial pseudarthrosis in NF1 and
      will document safety issues. Regardless of results, the better performing of the two groups
      (control or BMP) will be able to serve as a much-needed control arm for future studies of
      additional targeted therapeutic agents for NF1-related bone disease. An international working
      group of orthopaedic surgeons and NF specialists has been formed and is committed to
      successful completion of this trial.
