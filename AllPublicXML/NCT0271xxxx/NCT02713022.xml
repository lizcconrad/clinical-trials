  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to find a better way to predict the risk of having fatty tissue
      inflammation by using a different approach to finding out body fat composition. In this
      study, the investigators want to estimate the body fat composition using a DEXA scan. DEXA
      stands for dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. It is the standard and established test to
      determine bone mineral density (how strong the bones are) to diagnose osteoporosis. This test
      can also be used to determine the body composition including percent body fat and lean mass.
      The investigators will compare the participants DEXA scan results for body fat composition to
      the inflammation found in the breast tissue from the mastectomy to see if there is a
      relationship. If successful, this may help us predict which patients may be at risk for
      breast cancer in the future. In addition, the investigators will compare the participants
      DEXA scan results for body fat composition and inflammation found in the fat tissue from the
      mastectomy or prostatectomy to the level of exercise activity as measured by a short
      questionnaire to see if there is a relationship. The investigators will also measure the
      participants waist to hip ratio.

      Finally, at the time the participant has blood drawn for their standard presurgical testing,
      the investigators will also test the blood for prediabetes using a blood test called
      hemoglocin A1c. The investigators will also measure for the participants waist to hip ratio,
      and a Hgb A1c blood drawn will be take at the time of presurgical testing. If not feasible,
      Hgb A1c can be drawn at a separate visit prior to the DEXA scan. If successful, this may help
      us predict which patients may be at risk for breast cancer in the future.

        This study is open to patients undergoing prophylactic or therapeutic mastectomy or radical
        prostatectomy at MSKCC.

        Patients will be identified and recruited from the Breast Service at and Plastics and
        Reconstructive Surgery Clinics MSKCC and approached at the time of initial surgical
        consultation.
