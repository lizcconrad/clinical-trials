      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of STW5 Iberogast, over a 28-day
      period, for the treatment of constipation in parkinsonian patients suffering from
      gastrointestinal disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal disorders are the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease
      (PD). They affect the entire intestinal tract and include excess saliva stasis (70% of
      patients), dysphagia (52%), gastroparesis (34-45%), and constipation. Gastroparesis
      participates in dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Constipation, as defined by the international
      standards criteria of Rome III, is present in 59% of PD patients and leads to functional
      impairment in 70% of patients. The mechanism underlying constipation is multifactorial and
      may include slow transit and defecation disorders secondary to anorectal dysfunction. Bowel
      disorders are present in the early stage of the disease and usually precede the onset of
      motor symptoms. They may result from lesions of the enteric nervous system, of the autonomic
      nervous system, and from probable alterations in gastrointestinal motility controlled by the
      central nervous system. The STW5 (Iberogast, Steigerwald, Germany) is a herbal agent composed
      of nine plant extracts, with prokinetic, antispasmodic, prosecretory, anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant properties. These properties have been demonstrated in animals and in human
      pathology, in the treatment of dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. It is the only
      phytotherapeutic agent which efficacy was demonstrated by randomized double-blind trials in
      these indications. In PD, the STW5 could improve constipation due to its prokinetic effects
      of the prosecretory enteric neurons. It could also improve dyspepsia and abdominal pain by
      its antispasmodic properties. We propose to study the efficacy and the safety of STW5 on
      bowel dysfunction in parkinsonian patients, especially on constipation.
