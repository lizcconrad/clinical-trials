      Randomized controlled trial comparing a technique for buried intramedullary k-wire fixation
      to plate and screw fixation for unstable extra-articular metacarpal fractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metacarpal fractures are a common injury to the hand. Most fractures occur due to direct
      force from either a axial load to the dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal joint or low energy
      fall onto an outstretched hand. Many of these fractures can be treated closed with a closed
      reduction and splinting however, some displaced or angulated fractures require open reduction
      and internal fixation. Many fixation techniques have been used, however to the investigators
      knowledge, no one has prospectively randomized patients to compare plate and screw fixation
      with buried intramedullary k-wire fixation.

      The purpose of this study is to compare Plate and screw and buried intramedullary fixation,
      using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire as the primary
      outcome measured. Secondary outcomes will include total active motion, complications, cost,
      reoperation rate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has an unstable extra-articular metacarpal fracture that meets operative
             indications

          -  Informed consent is obtained from the patient or proxy

          -  Male or female who are 16 years of age or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If the patients range of motion was decreased prior to injury (previous upper
             extremity injury, osteoarthritis, etc.)

          -  Pathological Fracture

          -  Greater than 21 days from fracture to definitive open reduction and internal fixation

          -  If contamination or wounds from open fractures do not permit standardized buried
             intramedullary fixation or plate and screw fixation

          -  Highly comminuted diaphyseal fractures

          -  Articular fractures

          -  Multiple fractures involving bones other than another metacarpal in the same upper
             extremity

          -  The patient had a previous upper extremity injury that has limited hand function or
             finger range of motion
