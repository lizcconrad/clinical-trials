  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to characterize the effects of ethanol and cannabinoids
      on simulated driving and related cognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the effects of oral ethanol (target BAC of ~0.04g/dl; equivalent to consuming
      approximately 2 drinks over 1 hour) and vaporized cannabis (~450 mg cannabis plant material
      at a THC concentration of ~1.7%; roughly equivalent to smoking approximately 1/4 of a
      marijuana cigarette, or &quot;joint&quot;) on driving.
