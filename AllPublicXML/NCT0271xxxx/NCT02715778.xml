    <textblock>
      Although the last decade has brought major advances with respect to our knowledge of certain
      risks associated with fetal exposure to psychiatric medications, critical information
      regarding the long-term neurobehavioral impact of fetal exposure is lacking. With a
      prevalence rate of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use across pregnancy in
      Western countries noted to be as high as 5-8%, this study aims to close the gap in knowledge
      regarding long-term neurobehavioral sequelae of in utero exposure to this class of
      antidepressants. Importantly, the assessment of the impact of antenatal psychotropic
      medication use must be conducted with an appreciation of the potential direct and indirect
      effects of maternal psychiatric illness during pregnancy and throughout childhood. The
      outcomes of this study will help to inform the care of reproductive age women treated with
      psychiatric medications as they, along with the clinicians prescribing for them, weigh the
      relative risks of using these agents during pregnancy.

      Neuropsychological evaluation of older children than previously studied with histories of
      fetal exposure to antidepressants and maternal depression during pregnancy is needed and may
      inform whether a signal for neural disruption exists following fetal selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure. Identification of genetic factors which may afford
      resilience or particular vulnerability to fetal exposure to antidepressants is a logical
      component of this translational initiative designed to answer the proposed research question.

      Because of the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-based
      drugs has the influence excitatory/inhibitory balance and to shift critical periods, there is
      reason to believe that some aspects of brain development may also be altered. To this end,
      this project aims to &quot;scan&quot; a variety of brain functions that include memory, attention, and
      executive functions; in addition, it will also examine the extent to which face and speech
      processing are altered in the target sample.

      This study will assess older children ages 6-17 with histories of fetal exposure to
      antidepressants and/or maternal depression during pregnancy. It will evaluate child behavior
      based on maternal report and utilize neuropsychological evaluation to inform whether a signal
      for neural disruption exists following fetal SSRI or depression exposure. The
      neuropsychological assessments will be paired with an analysis of genetic factors which may
      afford resilience or particular vulnerability to fetal exposure to antidepressants.

      This study leverages unique patient resources with respect to children of mothers with well
      documented histories of SSRI exposure who have been prospectively followed across pregnancy.
      The multidisciplinary collaboration between the lead investigator, Dr. Lee S. Cohen of the
      Center for Women's Mental Health (CWMH), and the Laboratories of Cognitive Neuroscience,
      Boston Children's Hospital (Dr. Charles Nelson), the Department of Molecular and Cellular
      Biology, and the Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General
      Hospital (Dr. Jordan Smoller) is a remarkable opportunity to better understand the effects of
      maternal antidepressant exposure during pregnancy on neuropsychological development of
      children.

        This study will be composed of two components: a maternal assessment based at Massachusetts
        General Hospital (MGH) and a child evaluation based at Boston Children's Hospital. Mother
        and child pairs may elect to complete both components of the study. If either participant
        does not want the child to take part in the research, the maternal component may be
        completed alone. Similarly, the child may enroll in the research study without the
        enrollment of the mother with parental consent.

        Women who are interested and eligible for the study may choose to complete the study
        in-person at MGH or to be evaluated remotely by a phone interview and set of online
        surveys. All child subjects must participate in an in-person visit at Boston Children's
        Hospital.
