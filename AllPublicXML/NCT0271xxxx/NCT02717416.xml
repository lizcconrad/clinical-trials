    <textblock>
      Acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH) is a common condition that leads to hospital
      admission, and has significant associated morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly.
      The most common causes of acute UGIH are nonvariceal. Although up 70% of non-variceal bleeds
      settle with conservative measures, endoscopic therapy is the established method for treating
      those bleeds for which this is not sufficient. Despite advances and increased expertise in
      managing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the associated mortality of up to 15% has remained
      unchanged for several years.

      EndoClot is a novel topical hemostatic powder approved for use in non-variceal upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding. This study examines its efficacy for endoscopic hemostasis in
      non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized
      study.

      Patients with upper GI bleeding who need endoscopic hemostasis will be enrolled in this
      study. When there is a upper GI bleeding with active bleeding or stigmata on the lesions,
      endoscopic hemostasis will be done.

      After randomization, patients in both group will undergo endoscopic hemostasis with
      epinephrine injection therapy. In the study group, Endo-clot will be applied after
      epinephrine injection therapy. In the control group, hemoclip will be applied after
      epinephrine injection therapy. The efficacy of Endo-Clot and hemoclip will be compared.
