  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Characterizing the nature and severity of tinnitus in individuals presents a particular
      challenge. The nature of the sound (loudness and pitch) is not necessarily indicative of the
      effect on quality of life. Different methods are used to measure each parameter. Loudness is
      measured using a technique called &quot;minimum masking,&quot; in which the subject is presented with a
      broadband white noise and asked to adjust the loudness level until they can no longer hear
      their tinnitus. Severity of tinnitus is commonly characterized using two questionnaires: the
      Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). These
      questionnaires assess the perceived severity of the tinnitus and the effect on everyday
      activities and quality of life. A visual analog scale (a scale from 0-10) is used as a
      general subjective measurement of tinnitus severity. In the first part of this study, we will
      measure each of these parameters over a series of sessions to establish a baseline
      variability for each individual.

      The second part will look at the influence of context-specific visual information on auditory
      perception. This involves watching silent videos of a person speaking, with and without an
      additional tone designed to match the subject's tinnitus. The effect of this audiovisual
      feedback on the subject's perception of tinnitus will be assessed using a subjective rating
      scale and the minimum masking task.

      This study is not specifically seeking to treat tinnitus, but is designed to investigate
      various parameters that can alter the tinnitus percept. Findings from this study will help
      identify parameters that can be more effective at decreasing or fully suppressing the
      tinnitus percept that will be systematically explored in a follow-up study.

             English

          -  Willing and able to understand and comply with all study-related procedures

          -  Will not start any new tinnitus treatment during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history of other ear or brain disorders

          -  Pregnant or currently breast-feeding (we need to give all female subjects a pregnancy
             test because pregnant females and unborn children require extra protection for their
             safety)

          -  Any handicap that prevents the subject from reliably performing the tests, such as
             blindness.
