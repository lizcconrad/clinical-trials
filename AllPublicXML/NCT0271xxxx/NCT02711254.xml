  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate improvement in pain and function following
      implantation of a new device, called the Phantom Knee System, in patients needing unloading
      of the medial compartment of the knee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, first in human (FIH) study. Patients will be
      asked to participate in the study and follow up for a 24 month period following implantation
      of the study device.
