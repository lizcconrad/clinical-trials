  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, the investigators plan to expand the knowledge of Positron Emission
      Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) reliability by assessing the repeatability of
      fludeoxyglucose (FDG) standardized uptake values (SUV) measurements, as well as apparent
      diffusion coefficients (ADC) measurements, in a broad population of patients with malignant
      solid tumors.
