    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Overall sPGA (0,1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The overall sPGA is the physician's global assessment of the participant's psoriasis (Ps) lesions at a given time point. Plaques were assessed for induration, erythema, and scaling, and an overall rating of psoriasis severity was given using the anchors of 0 = clear, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, 5 = very severe.

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least a 3 Point Improvement in Genital Psoriasis Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Item Within the Genital Psoriasis Symptom Scale (GPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>GPSS is a participant-administered assessment of 8 symptoms: itch, pain, discomfort, stinging, burning, redness, scaling, and cracking. Each respondent was asked to answer the questions based on the psoriasis symptoms in his or her genital area. The overall severity for each individual genital psoriasis symptom is indicated by selecting the number from an Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of 0 to 10 that best describes the worst level of each symptom in the genital area in the past 24 hours, where 0 (= no severity) and 10 (worst imaginable severity).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Whose Frequency of Sexual Activity is Never or Rarely Limited by Genital Psoriasis, Utilizing the Genital Psoriasis Sexual Frequency Questionnaire (SFQ) Item 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SFQ is a participant reported outcome measure to evaluate the impact of genital psoriasis symptoms on sexual frequency. It consists of 2 items that assess the impact of genital psoriasis symptoms on the frequency of sexual activity. Respondents were asked to answer the questions based on their psoriasis symptoms in the genital area. Item 2 assesses how often genital psoriasis symptoms limited the frequency of sexual activity with the following response options: 0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always.
*The SFQ is also referred to as the GenPs-SFQ (genital psoriasis sexual frequency questionnaire).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Whose Frequency of Avoiding Sexual Activity is Either Never or Rarely Limited by Genital Psoriasis in the Sexual Activity Avoidance Subscale Score of the Genital Psoriasis Sexual Impact Scale (GPSIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>GPSIS is a participant reported outcome measure to evaluate the impact of genital psoriasis symptoms on sexual activity.
The GPSIS Sexual Activity Avoidance Subscale includes 2 items:
Item 1 asks whether the participant has been sexually active in the past week. (No due to other reasons = 1, No due to genital Ps = 5) Item 2 asks how often the participant avoided sexual activity in the past week due to Genital Psoriasis. (Never = 1, rarely = 2, Sometimes = 3, Often = 4)</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, participant-administered, 10 question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains: 1) Symptoms and feelings 2) Daily activities 3) Leisure 4) Work and school 5) Personal relationships 6) Treatment.
Response categories include:
0 = not at all; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much; &quot;not relevant&quot; responses scored as &quot;0&quot; and total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate poor quality of life.
Least Square (LS) Mean was calculated using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) model with treatment, baseline body surface area (BSA) category, baseline value, visit, treatment-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed effects.</description>

Each respondent was asked to answer the questions based on the psoriasis symptoms in his or her genital area. The overall severity for each individual genital psoriasis symptom is indicated by selecting the number from an Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of 0 to 10 that best describes the worst level of each symptom in the genital area in the past 24 hours, where 0 (= no severity) and 10 (worst imaginable severity).</description>

Response categories include:
0 = not at all; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much; “not relevant” responses scored as “0” and total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate poor quality of life.
Least Square (LS) Mean was calculated using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) model with treatment, baseline body surface area (BSA) category, baseline value, visit, treatment-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed effects.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a participant-reported outcome measure evaluating a participant's health status. It comprises 36 items covering 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and general health. Items are answered on Likert scales of varying lengths. Items from 8 domains contribute to the PCS. The summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better levels of function and/or better health.
Least Squares Mean (LS Mean) was calculated using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, baseline BSA category, &amp; baseline value and modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF) imputation method.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>

        <description>GPSS is a participant's-administered assessment of 8 symptoms: itch, pain, discomfort, stinging, burning, redness, scaling, and cracking. Each respondent was asked to answer the questions based on the psoriasis symptoms in his or her genital area. The overall severity for each individual genital psoriasis symptom is indicated by selecting the number from an Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of 0 to 10 that best describes the worst level of each symptom in the genital area in the past 24 hours, where 0 (no severity) and 10 (worst imaginable severity). total score ranges from 0 (no severity) - 80 (worst imaginable severity) LS Mean was calculated using MMRM model with treatment, baseline BSA category, baseline value, visit, treatment-by-visit, and baseline value-by-visit interactions as fixed effects.</description>
