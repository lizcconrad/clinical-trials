      A Phase 1b/2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of HBI-8000 in Combination with
      Nivolumab in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Including Melanoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma
      (RCC), and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

      The primary objective of this study is:

      -To evaluate the safety and tolerability of HBI-8000 when combined with a standard dose and
      regimen of nivolumab, to determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2
      Dose (RP2D) and to evaluate frequency and severity of toxicities of this combination
      treatment

      The secondary objectives of this study include:

        -  To explore the efficacy of study treatment as measured by Objective Response Rate (ORR),
           Disease Control Rate (DCR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Duration of Response (DoR),
           Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in all subjects treated at RP2D

        -  To obtain pharmacokinetics of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered in combination
           with nivolumab administered once every two weeks (Phase 1b all sites; Phase 2 selected
           sites)

        -  To characterize the effect of HBI-8000 on the electrocardiogram QT corrected (QTc)
           interval (Phase 1b only)

      Exploratory:

      -To investigate the kinetics and extent of histone acetylation in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) at the RP2D of HBI-8000 (Phase 2 only)

      Dose Escalation (Phase 1b) will include up to 18 subjects, followed by Cohort Expansion
      (Phase 2) including up to 20 subjects per tumor indication at MTD and/or RP2D (including
      those treated in Phase 1b).

      HBI-8000 tablets will be administered at 20, 30, 40 mg/dose, orally twice a week until MTD or

      Nivolumab: 240 mg intravenous infusions every 2 weeks. A treatment cycle consists of 28 days.
      Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
