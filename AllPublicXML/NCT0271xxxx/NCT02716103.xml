      In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate bone marrow and blood samples and treatment
      responses to see if Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) (as described below), can be used as a
      predictive method of response to treatment in amyloidosis.

      Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a concept that has gained significant value as a prognostic
      predictor and has become an emerging constituent of complete response (CR) reassessment in
      multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Studies in MM have demonstrated that up to 30% of patients
      achieving a CR after high-dose therapy will still have detectable MRD in the bone marrow as
      measured by standard-sensitivity flow cytometry or by molecular assays. Virtually every study
      examining MRD in MM has reported that among patients achieving a CR, those who were MRD
      negative (MRD-) had a significantly superior progression-free survival, with some studies
      reporting superior overall survival.

      As amyloidosis is a disease that is very similar to multiple myeloma, the investigators wish
      to evaluate the concept in this disease.

    <description>Bone marrow collection and peripheral blood collection from ten patients with untreated AL amyloidosis will be evaluated to determine feasibility of isolating a plasma cell clone. An additional three teaspoons of bone marrow and 4 teaspoons of blood will be collected at the time of standard blood draw and bone marrow biopsy before receiving any treatment. There will be no extra procedures or visits specifically for this research.</description>

    <description>If feasibility is determined with initial cohort, bone marrow collection and peripheral blood collection from 20 patients with untreated AL amyloidosis who are scheduled to undergo antineoplastic therapy will be evaluated to isolate a plasma cell clone. An additional 3 teaspoons of bone marrow and 4 teaspoons of blood will be collected at the time of standard blood draw and bone marrow biopsy before receiving therapy. For those who complete therapy and achieve complete response or very good partial response, subsequent samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood will be sent for minimal residual disease detection (based on the previously identified cancer clone) at 6 to 12 months post treatment.</description>
