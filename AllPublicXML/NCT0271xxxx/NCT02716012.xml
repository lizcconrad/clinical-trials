  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First in Human study of a new single agent (MTL-CEBPA) in patients with advanced
      cancer of the liver. The study is in two parts: dose escalation followed by a dose expansion;
      both parts of the study will recruit advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients with
      cirrhosis. All participants will be refractory to or ineligible for loco-regional therapy
      including surgery, radiofrequency tumour ablation, transarterial chemoembolisation or
      sorafenib.

      MTL-CEBPA consists of a double stranded RNA formulated into a SMARTICLES® liposomal
      nanoparticle and is designed to activate the CEBPA gene.
