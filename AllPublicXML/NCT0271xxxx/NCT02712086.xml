      The main objective will be to evaluate the effect at 5 weeks of nutritional management
      associated with protein supplementation (adapted to the post-operative period) on the
      maintenance of lean body mass at the whole body in obese patients after a sleeve gastrectomy.

      Secondary objectives will assess protein intake, food safety, the effect of protein
      supplementation on body fat in the entire body and the metabolic rate and the impact on
      quality of life and post-operative joint pain.

      There is still no study evaluating the protein supplementation adapted patients after sleeve
      gastrectomy on maintaining lean body mass.
