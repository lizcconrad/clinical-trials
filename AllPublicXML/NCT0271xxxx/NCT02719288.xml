  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peroneal and Achilles tendon tears are common diseases that present challenges to surgeons
      due to tendon adhesion complications. Functional recovery is compromised by limiting
      post-operative range of motion, mobility, and can lead to considerable amount of
      post-operative pain for the patient.

      Amniotic membrane tissue has demonstrated clinical success as an anti-inflammatory and
      anti-scarring agent and promoting wound healing towards regeneration.

      Cryopreserved human amniotic membrane and umbilical cord (AM/UC) tissue in the form of
      CLARIX® CORD 1K has been used to treat over 5000 orthopedic patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that its use in peroneal and Achilles tendon surgical repair will enhance the
      overall functional recovery of the patient.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 18 years to 80 years of age

          2. Confirmed tendon pathology via MRI, if clinically necessary, with planned surgical
             repair that have failed conservative management (PT) for a minimum of 2 months for
             chronic and partial thickness tears; acute full thickness tears or tendon rupture
             immediately eligible.

          3. Willing to follow the instructions and complete the visits required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Psychologically unstable

          2. Acute infections that, in the opinion of the investigator, may complicate healing

          3. Currently receiving chemotherapy

          4. Systemic inflammatory arthritis or Rheumatoid arthritis

          5. Uncontrolled diabetes as measured by A1C&gt;12

          6. Bleeding disorders

          7. Unable to provide informed consent

          8. Has received oral or parenteral corticosteroids or cytotoxic agents for seven
             consecutive days in the period of 30 days before surgery OR has received a local
             steroid injection within 7 days of surgery

          9. Immunocompromised patients

         10. Active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer

         11. Untreated alcohol or substance abuse issues at the time of screening

         12. Pregnant women at the time of randomization

         13. Currently enrolled or participated in another investigational device, drug, or
             biological trial within 60 days of screening

         14. Allergy to amphotericin-B or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM).

         15. Will undergo significant concurrent procedures with the tendon procedures on the
             affected foot that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may complicate healing or
             alter the post-operative visit schedule
