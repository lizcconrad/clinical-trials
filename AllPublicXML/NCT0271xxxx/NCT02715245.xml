    <textblock>
      In this research, investigators pretent to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical,
      functional, psychological and social impact of an intervention model based on shared care
      between the Mobile Rehabilitation and Physical therapy team (MRPTT) and nurse case managers
      of Primary Care in a sample of patients with multiple chronic diseases (comorbidities) and
      their caregivers. A non-randomised controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Experimental group consisted of patients with multiple chronic diseases referred to
      services in the province of Almería that comply the inclusion criteria and their caregivers.
      Outcome measures: sex, age, location, primary caregiver, disabling process, number and type
      of categories including by multiple pathologies, personal history, assessment (physical and
      functional), Barthel Index, Lawton and Brody index, risk of falls, Scale Pfeiffer, social
      support, caregiver burden, hospital readmissions and length, technical aids. Quality of Life
      (SF-12) and degree of user satisfaction. Regarding the intervention: date of application,
      date of assessment, objectives, treatment / intervention techniques, number of sessions,
      staff time spent.

      Control Group: Patients with multiple diseases and their caregivers, belonging to health
      centers or areas where there is no figure nurse case manager or MRPTT. Registration
      information will consist of the same assessments, questionnaires and scales that are
      comparable to the experimental and control groups for analysis.

    <description>Procedure/Surgery: Home-based rehabilitation In the patient's home, the primarily applied treatment has been physical therapy, seeking to achieve the highest possible functionality and gait training. In more than 25% of cases, health education is conducted for families and caregivers. Thus, consistent with the patient's condition and their tolerance to activity and to exercise their self-care independently, rehabilitation interventions are activated that prevent sequelae derived from functional limitations.</description>
