      Despite advances in prenatal diagnosis and postnatal therapies, including extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO), inhaled nitric oxide therapy, and ventilator strategies that
      minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, morbidity and mortality rates for babies with
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) remain high. The survival relates to the degree of
      prenatal lung compression and the subsequent impairment of pulmonary function following
      delivery. Prenatal assessment by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging allows to estimate
      the severity by relating the circumference of the lung contralateral to the hernia to the
      fetal head circumference lung to head ratio (LHR) and by noting the degree of upward
      herniation of the liver. Based on the observed to expected lung to head ratio (O/E LHR),
      prenatally diagnosed congenital diaphragmatic hernia can be prognostically assessed. While
      overall survival of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is approximately 60%, an O/E LHR &lt;25% is
      associated with survival between 11-24%.

      The rationale for fetal therapy in severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia is to restore
      adequate lung growth for neonatal survival. Prenatal tracheal occlusion obstructs the normal
      egress of lung fluid during pulmonary development leading to increased lung tissue stretch,
      increased cell proliferation, and accelerated lung growth. European colleagues have developed
      intrauterine endoscopic techniques (fetoscopy) to position and remove endoluminal tracheal
      balloons in utero (fetoscopic endotracheal occlusion = FETO). Recently, the Belgium group
      published summary results of FETO showing an improved survival in 175 patients with isolated
      left CDH from 24% to 49%. Our goal with this pilot study is to study the feasibility of
      implementing FETO therapy in the most severe group of fetuses with left CDH (O/E LHR &lt; 30%).
      which will be considered in two subgroups. Those with and O/E LHR &lt;25% (severe group) and
      those with an O/E between 25 to &lt;30% (less severe group).

      Study Procedures The FETO feasibility study is an un-blinded non-randomized single arm pilot
      study being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

      Pregnant women will be screened for protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria and recruited.

      Comprehensive fetal evaluations will be completed at the Johns Hopkins Center for Fetal
      Therapy to confirm eligibility. This includes an ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, a
      fetal echocardiogram and fetal genetic studies to identify cases with isolated CDH. Once
      eligibility is confirmed, participation for FETO treatment will be offered. The voluntary
      nature of participation will be stressed throughout. Willingness and logistics of the
      participant to remain under supervision of the Center for Fetal Therapy at the Johns Hopkins
      Hospital, while the fetal airway is occluded will also be discussed in detail. Informed
      written consent will be obtained prior to any study related procedures.

      Study design Participants will undergo FETO with standardized preoperative, intraoperative,
      post-operative care, and delivery. The FETO will be timed between 27+0 to 29+6 weeks
      gestation for fetuses with an O/E LHR &lt;25% and between 30+0 to 31+6 weeks gestation for
      fetuses with an O/E LHR between 25% to &lt;30%. The procedure will be performed under local
      anesthesia with IV sedation or regional spinal/epidural (as done currently for shunts and
      laser procedures). Prophylactic tocolysis using indomethacin will begin preoperatively. Fetal
      analgesia and immobilization will consist of fentanyl, atropine and vecuronium. A 10 Fr
      cannula, 1.3 mm fetoscope within a 3.3 mm sheath (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), and a
      detachable balloon occlusion (BALTACCI-BDPE, Balt, Montmorency, France) system will be used.
      Participants will receive IV magnesium sulfate for breakthrough labor and may be discharged
      on oral nifedipine to treat post intervention contractions. Serial ultrasound measurements of
      lung volume and LHR will begin within 24-48 hours following surgery and continue weekly.
      Amniotic fluid level and membrane status will also be monitored at weekly intervals.
      Ultrasonography for fetal growth will be performed every 4 weeks.

      All discharged participants and their support person need to remain within 30 minutes of the
      surgery center until delivery to permit standardized postoperative management. The social
      worker at the Center for Fetal Therapy will serve as the participant advocate and assist
      families in identifying subsidized appropriate accommodation as required. Participants will
      be on modified bed rest for the first 2 weeks post discharge, but subsequently allowed to
      graduate to moderate activity if the uterus is quiescent. Postoperative surveillance of fetal
      well-being will be performed weekly beginning at 28 weeks.

      At 34+0 weeks to 34 + 6 weeks, participants will undergo removal of the tracheal balloon.
      Balloon retrieval can be either by in utero puncture by ultrasound-guided percutaneous
      needling or fetoscopic retrieval. Uncomplicated retrieval patients will be managed as an
      outpatient with weekly fetal monitoring until delivery. In the event there is a need for
      emergent balloon removal prior to 34 weeks due to the development of preterm labor,
      shortening of the cervix, preterm rupture of membranes, abnormally vigorous lung response, or
      development of fetal hydrops, delivery by EXIT or cesarean section will be performed. If
      percutaneous puncture of balloon is unsuccessful prior to delivery, immediate bronchoscopy
      and establishment of airway will be performed. Maternal corticosteroids (betamethasone 12 mg
      intramuscularly and repeated once at 24 hours) will be administered 48 hours prior to
      fetoscopic balloon removal (due to risks of preterm delivery associated with instrumentation)
      or for impending preterm delivery.

      Timing for induction of labor at 37 weeks to 39 weeks will depend upon favorable status of
      the cervix. Cesarean section will be based upon standard obstetrical indications. In regards
      to postnatal care, a resuscitation team from neonatology and pediatric surgery will be
      present at delivery. A standardized protocol will be utilized for postnatal care, using lung
      protection strategy.

      While the primary end-points of the study are the demonstration of the feasibility and safety
      of FETO and neonatal survival at discharge continued follow-up of children until age 2 is
      planned as the current standard of care. These follow-ups may include bronchoscopy, brain
      imaging, audiology exam, pulmonary function testing, chest radiograph and developmental
      assessment.

      Study duration and number of visits The feasibility study will be conducted at Johns Hopkins
      Hospital. Recruitment will stop when approximately 10 to 15 families (mother, father/partner
      and child) will be enrolled to produce 5 to 10 families available for evaluation. The study
      duration per mother and child will be up to 877 days, with up to 82 days screening, up to 55
      days in the intervention phase, and 744 days in delivery and follow-up.

      The following details the standard of care and research procedures at each phase of the
      study.

      Screening Visit Potential subjects (pregnant women) will be screened for protocol inclusion
      and exclusion criteria.

           expected outcomes and management options Once evaluation confirms eligibility, the
           family will be offered enrollment. Informed consent will be obtained prior to any study
           related procedures Research Procedures No study procedures will be performed prior to
           obtaining voluntary informed consent. The social worker designated for the Center for
           Fetal Therapy has experience in accompanying the care of patients with a wide range of
           fetal anomalies. The social worker will serve as the patient advocate in this study.

        -  Informed consent

        -  Description of study rationale and design

        -  Focused interview by the PI or designee to afford potential pregnant women the formal
           opportunity to examine what they have learned about the research study in the course of
           their evaluation and discuss how they feel about enrolling in the research study

        -  Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria

        -  Clearance for surgery by anesthesia and the obstetrical staff

      Study Procedures (following the screening visit) The study procedure phase includes FETO
      surgery, and removal of the balloon. FETO Surgery (all procedures are part of this research
      study)

        -  Participants with an O/E LHR 25% will have FETO completed at 27 weeks + 0 days to 29
           weeks + 6 days gestation.

        -  Participants with an O/E LHR 25 - &lt;30% will have FETO completed at 30 weeks + 0 days to
           31 weeks + 6 days gestation.

      The procedure will be completed under ultrasound guidance along with maternal IV sedation,
      local anesthesia, and prophylactic tocolysis using indomethacin for 48 hours. Fetal analgesia
      and immobilization will consist of fentanyl, atropine and vecuronium.

        -  A 10 Fr cannula, 1.2 mm fetoscope within a 3.0 mm sheath (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen,
           Germany), and a detachable balloon occlusion (BALTACCI-BDPE, Balt, Montmorency, France)
           system will be used.

        -  The expected hospital course is 23-48 hours; however, it is possible that the patient
           will be hospitalized for complications or preterm labor. The patient will then be
           discharged to a nearby accommodation.

        -  Assess possible adverse events

        -  Physical exam of the mother including weight, vital signs

        -  Laboratory tests

        -  Preparation for surgery

        -  Transvaginal ultrasound (within 24 hours of FETO balloon insertion procedure) It is
           standard of care to have all patients receiving fetal therapy that require delivery at
           Johns Hopkins Hospital transfer prenatal care to the Center for Fetal Therapy. For this
           study, pregnant woman will transfer care prior to the FETO procedure and social work
           will facilitate relocation to a radius of 30 minutes from Johns Hopkins Hospital while
           the balloon is in place and the fetus has an occluded airway. Pregnant women are
           expected to have a support person with them and will be instructed to travel by car or
           taxi directly to Johns Hopkins Hospital in the event of onset of labor or suspected
           preterm rupture of membranes.

        -  Physical exam, weight, vital signs

        -  Laboratory tests

        -  Assess possible adverse events

        -  Preparation for surgery

        -  Clearance for surgery by anesthesia and the obstetrical staff. Anesthesia regional
           (spinal or epidural) in preparation for possible emergent delivery.

        -  Maternal corticosteroids will be administered 48 hours prior to removal of balloon
           occlusion

        -  Tocolysis nifedipine 20 mg preoperatively and then every 6 hours for 48 hours.
           Breakthrough contractions treated with increased dose of nifedipine or Magnesium
           sulfate.

        -  Procedure - attempted percutaneous needle puncture followed by fetoscopic removal of
           balloon only if this is unsuccessful.

      Delivery Planned delivery will occur after 37 weeks. Timing for induction of labor at 37
      weeks 0 days to 39 weeks 0 days will depend upon favorable status of the cervix. Cesarean
      section will be based upon standard obstetrical indications.

      Standard of Care Procedures:

        -  For preterm labor before the balloon has been removed, pregnant woman will be admitted
           for tocolysis and attempt to prolong pregnancy.

        -  For preterm labor that cannot be controlled before balloon removal, delivery by Ex Utero
           Intrapartum Therapy (EXIT), if maternally safe, may be performed. Emergent EXIT
           algorithms are in place and are currently used for fetuses with obstructed airways.
           These algorithms will be activated for mothers presenting in labor prior to plan EXIT
           delivery at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

        -  For precipitous preterm labor or maternal indications when EXIT cannot be performed,
           cesarean delivery may be performed followed by immediate bronchoscopy and establishment
           of airway.

        -  Delivery

        -  Standard postnatal care Research Procedures

        -  Assess possible adverse events relating to FETO Follow-up Phase Follow-up will be

           to obtain information about the clinical course after the neonatal period will be
           obtained after birth.

      A resuscitation team from neonatology and pediatric surgery will be present at delivery. A
      standardized protocol will be utilized for postnatal care. Follow-up will may include
      bronchoscopy, brain imaging, audiology exams, pulmonary function testing, chest radiographs,
      and developmental assessment per the current standard of care for infants with CDH at Johns
      Hopkins Hospital.
