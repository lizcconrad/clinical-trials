      Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is an important cause of ischemic stroke. The
      occurrence of stroke caused by symptomatic ICAD is significantly different compared with
      asymptomatic ICAD (19% vs 3.5%), suggesting that plaque vulnerability may be responsible for
      the difference. Based on the previous high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging
      (HR-MRI) results, the investigators hypothesis that the feature of intracranial plaque
      enhancement is an important imaging biomarker of plaque instability, which is closely related
      to stroke. The investigators will establish the ICAD cohort and use HR-MRI to investigate the
      composition, morphology and the enhancement pattern of symptomatic ICAD plaques. These
      findings will correlate with biochemical markers, and stroke recurrence, in order to explore:

        1. plaque characteristics and the enhancement features between symptomatic ICAD and
           asymptomatic ICAD

        2. the relationship between plaque enhancement and the composition of plaques;

        3. relationship among enhancement features of symptomatic ICAD plaques, biomarkers with
           different clinical significance,

        4. evolution of enhancement features of symptomatic ICAD plaques under intensive medical
           therapy.

      The investigators aim to explore the correlation between vulnerable plaque stratification and
      clinical outcomes, to explore the value of vascular responses in the pathogenicity of ICAD
      vulnerable plaques, as well as to provide objective basis for the establishment of the
      evaluation criteria of intracranial atherosclerotic vulnerable plaques.

      Detailed description:

      Title: Vessel wall and Perfusion Imaging in Intracranial Atherosclerosis

      Design: This is an prospective study that will study the characteristics of intracranial
      atherosclerotic plaque and the enhancement features of symptomatic ICAD during a mean
      follow-up of 1 year in symptomatic or asymtomatic patients with moderate to severe stenosis
      of middle cerebral artery(MCA).

      In the WASID trail,patients with at least 70% stenosis of a major intracranial artery had an
      increased risk of recurrent stroke. However,The degree of stenosis is no longer the single
      predictor of vulnerable atherosclerotic lesions. Vulnerable plaques are closely associated
      with stroke recurrence.With the development of neurologic imaging, HR-MRI has unique ability
      to provide information on plaque compositions, plaque burden and vulnerable features. Several
      recent investigations suggest that enhancement of intracranial plaque is associated with
      recurrent stroke. However, no corhort study has been performed.

      This prospective, multicenter trail will be conducted in China. Based on the previous
      work,participants will be divided into two groups :symtomatic ICAD and asymtomatic ICAD.
      Neurological examination and clinical sera testing will be performed at baseline, 1 month, 3
      months, 6 months, and 12 months.The stroke incidence rate of asymptomatic ICAD and stroke
      recurrence rate of symptomatic ICAD will be recorded.

        Participants with significant MCA stenosis（≥50%）on TCD, MRA, and/or CTA together with one
        or more risk factors of atherosclerosis will be prospectively recruited. Symtomatic
        patients will be included if they had suffered from a recent transient ischemic attack or
        ischemic stroke(NHISS≤6) in the territory of the stenotic MCA. Asymptomatic patients will
        be included if they had no history of cerebrovascular events or a history of an ischemic
        event in a territory outside that the affected MCA.
