  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately, 40 to 50% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most frequent
      inflammatory arthritide, are non responders to the consensual 1st line of treatment :
      methotrexate. In these patients, it is well demonstrated that the addition of other
      immunomodulatory drug(s) often results in a significant improvement. However, the best option
      regarding the drug(s) to add remains unclear. Rheumatologists are currently used to adding a
      targeted biologic therapy, such as anti-TNFα, and more recently abatacept or tocilizumab.
      Triple therapy using 3 conventional disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs),
      methotrexate+salazopyrine+hydroxychloroquine could be an alternative option to biologics, all
      the more as they have a more favorable safety profile and a much lower cost. Uncertainty
      remains regarding the superiority of biologics on triple therapy in methotrexate insufficient
      responders (IR). Investigators decided to address this issue by performing a randomized
      controlled pragmatic trial.
