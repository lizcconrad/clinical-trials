  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be conducted to assess the following research questions in real-life
      conditions in France:

      What are the patient and disease characteristics, comorbidities and treatment history in NVAF
      patients initiating a new Anticoagulant (AC) treatment, according to treatment currently
      available and prescribed (apixaban, other NOACs, VKAs), and are the AC-naive patient profiles
      different from one treatment pattern to another when initiating a new AC treatment?

      What are the HCP's reasons for discontinuing the previous AC strategy for initiating and
      choosing the newly initiated AC treatment in NVAF patients?

      What are the conditions of newly-initiated apixaban prescriptions in NVAF patients:
      prescriber, proportion of naïve/experienced patients, daily dosage and number of daily doses?

          -  Diagnosed with non valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)

          -  Prescribed with a newly initiated AC treatment (apixaban, other NOACs or VKAs). Newly
             initiated AC treatment is defined as any AC treatment initiated within the past 3
             months, including day of enrolment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) due to reversible causes

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of VAF. The term VAF is used to imply that AF is related to
             rheumatic valvular disease (predominantly mitral stenosis) or prosthetic heart valves

          -  Patients participating in an ongoing clinical trial in AF
