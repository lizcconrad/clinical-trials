    <textblock>
      CX5461 is a new type of drug for many types of cancer, particularly cancers that cannot
      easily repair damage to their cells. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may
      cause cancer cells to die. CX5461 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been
      studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better
      results than standard treatment.

      The purpose of the first phase of this study (phase I) is to find the dose of a new therapy,
      CX5461, that can be tolerated without causing very severe side effects and to see what
      effects the study drug has this cancer. Participants are given CX5461 and are watched very
      closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe.
      If serious side effects are seen in patients at the first dose level, doses of CX5461 may be
      lowered in subsequent patients. If the side effects are not serious, then more participants
      are asked to join this study and are given higher doses. This will continue until a dose is
      found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be
      given.

      The purpose of the second phase of this study (phase II) is to find out what effects a new
      drug, CX5461, has on you and your breast cancer.

        - Tumour Type Phase I: Patients must have histologically/and or cytologically confirmed
        solid malignancy that is advanced/metastatic/recurrent or unresectable and for which no
        curative therapy exists.

        Phase II: Patients must have metastatic/recurrent/locally advanced/unresectable triple
        negative breast cancer or must have BRCA1/2 or HRD germline or somatic aberrations (known,
        or documented during screening).

          -  All patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from primary
             or metastatic tumour) available and must have provided informed consent for the
             release of the block. All patients in phase II must also have provided informed
             consent for a whole blood sample.

          -  At least 6 patients in each cohort in Phase II (HRD known prior to enrollment or
             detected during pre-enrollment screening) must also have provided informed consent for
             and be willing to undergo a tumour and skin biopsy prior to treatment (after
             registration) and after cycle 2 day 8. Note: During accrual to this portion of the
             study, it may be necessary to restrict accrual to patients who are suitable for, and
             have consented to, tumour and skin biopsies.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

        for low-dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy after consultation with CCTG. Concurrent
        radiotherapy is not permitted.

        Surgery:

        Previous surgery is permitted provided that a minimum of 28 days (4 weeks) have elapsed
        between any major surgery and date of registration, and that wound healing has occurred.
