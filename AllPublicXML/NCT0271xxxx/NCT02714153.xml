      To evaluate the use of an occlusion balloon (Bridge™ Occlusion Balloon, Spectranetics) within
      the Superior Vena Cava in lead extraction patients.

      This study will evaluate the use of an occlusion balloon (Bridge™ Occlusion Balloon,
      Spectranetics) within the Superior Vena Cava in lead extraction patients. This will be
      performed in a non-emergent setting to allow for evaluation of how best to integrate this new
      technology into the investigators clinical practice. The study will focus on the effect of
      the Bridge balloon on the patient preparation clinical workflow, ease of
      insertion/positioning/deployment, and the ability to recognize proper inflation and vein
      sealing under fluoroscopy. Understanding these factors will help build a more robust clinical
      workflow with the goal of better patient outcomes in the case of an Superior Vena Cava
      injury. The images and data generated during this study can help in dissemination of the
      practical use knowledge to fellow lead extractors.

    <measure>Degree of Occlusion Achieved</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>After Bridge Balloon deployment and inflation, the degree of blood vessel occlusion will be reported. Measurements will be calculated from fluoroscopic images (using x-ray machine) and venograms (images with injection of contrast agent).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of Bridge Balloon Deployment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Time will be calculated in seconds starting from opening the Bridge Balloon Package up to full balloon deployment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Changes in Heart Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate (in beat per minute) will be collected at 5 points: baseline, after guidewire insertion, at the time of balloon inflation, immediately post deflation and 5 minutes post deflation (all during the procedure itself). This outcome will be reported at the end of the study as if there were any unacceptable or no unacceptable changes in the hemodynamics over the course of the 12 month period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Changes in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure in mmHg will be collected at 5 points: baseline, after guidewire insertion, at the time of balloon inflation, immediately post deflation and 5 minutes post deflation (all during the procedure itself). This outcome will be reported at the end of the study as as if there were any unacceptable or no unacceptable changes in the hemodynamics over the course of the 12 month period..</description>

    <description>SPO2 will be collected at 5 points: baseline, after guidewire insertion, at the time of balloon inflation, immediately post deflation and 5 minutes post deflation (all during the procedure itself). This outcome will be reported at the end of the study as if there were any unacceptable or no unacceptable changes in the hemodynamics over the course of the 12 month period..</description>
