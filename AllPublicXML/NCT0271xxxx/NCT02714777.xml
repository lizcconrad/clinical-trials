  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the ANESPEDIA study is to describe in a pediatric population (aged from 4 to
      8 years old) receiving elective surgery, the impact of general anesthesia on autonomic
      nervous system and their kinetics of early postoperative course (24 hours).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some physiological factors such as sport activity or pathological as sepsis, certain chronic
      diseases or diabetes are known to modulate the overall autonomic activity and the intrinsic
      capacity of the individual to regulate its sympathovagal balance. These influences can alter
      the physiological autonomic balance sometimes with positive consequences on the Cardiac
      frequency-breathing control, blood pressure adjustment depending on the position of the
      individual, on the status of blood volume, but sometimes deleterious with bad regulation of
      sinus cardiac activity and respiration rate.

      General anesthesia is recognized as one of the factors that can modify more or less
      sustainable the sympathovagal autonomic balance. While many studies described the effects of
      anesthesia on the autonomic nervous system, most data are done in adult subjects. For the
      child who sees intrinsically autonomic physiological changes related to its maturative
      status, assessment of the impact of anesthesia in the pediatric population in per and
      postoperative was never realized.
