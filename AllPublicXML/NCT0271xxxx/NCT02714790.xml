      Study purpose is to assess the prognostic role of Minimal Residual Disease (defined as
      medullary expression of WT1 gene), performed at Baseline and during treatment according to
      clinical practice. MRD results will be relate to treatment outcome and survival analysis
      variables (Overall Survival, Disease Free Survival, Cumulative Incidence of Relapse)
