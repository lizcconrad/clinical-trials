      The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of participants fulfilling criteria
      for symptomatic remission following a transition to 12 months treatment with flexible-dose
      paliperidone palmitate 3 month formulation (PP3M) in participants with schizophrenia
      previously adequately treated with paliperidone palmitate 1 month formulation (PP1M) for at
      least 4 months.

      This is an international, multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study designed to
      estimate remission rates and assess treatment response, tolerability, and patterns of use of
      Paliperidone Palmitate 3-Month Formulation (PP3M) in a diverse population of participants
      with schizophrenia. The study will consist of a screening phase (Day -7 to Day 1), a 52-week,
      open-label, flexible-dose PP3M treatment phase and a follow up safety assessment 3 months
      (+/-14 days) after the month 12 visit or early discontinuation. Participants' Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale to assess the neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self). The PANSS provides a total score and scores for 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items), each item scored on a scale of 1 (absent), 2 (minimal), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (moderately severe), 6 (severe) and 7 (extreme). The total score ranges from 30 to 210 and higher score indicates greater severity. Symptomatic remission is defined as achieving intensity level of mild or moderate on PANSS scale by all 8 items as the determinants for symptomatic remission: delusions, unusual thought content, hallucinatory behavior, conceptual disorganization, mannerisms/posturing, blunted affect, social withdrawal, lack of spontaneity.</description>
