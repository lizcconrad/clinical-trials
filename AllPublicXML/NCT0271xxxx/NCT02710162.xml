  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with th Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are at high risk for swallowing impairment
      (dysphagia) which leads to malnutrition, decreased pulmonary health, aspiration and
      aspiration pneumonia. These sequelae necessitate timely identification of at risk individuals
      to ensure optimal management of oral intake and pulmonary function. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the discriminant ability of several non-invasive screening tools at detecting
      swallowing impairment in individuals with ALS.

    <textblock>
      This research study is being performed to determine how accurate different screening tools or
      tests are at identifying swallowing problems associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
      (ALS).

      As a participant one evaluation will be performed at the University of Florida Swallowing
      Systems Core laboratory located at Shands Hospital, Gainesville will take place. This will
      take approximately two-hours. During this evaluation an videofluoroscopy (X-ray of
      swallowing), cough tests, tongue function test and questionnaires will be completed.

    <measure>The IOPI will be used to measure Lingual strength and endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa Oral Pressure Instrument device will measure the peak performance of lingual strength a via the action of a bulb placed on the hard palate. To assess maximum anterior isometric pressure, the bulb will be placed on the roof of the mouth and the participant will raise his or her tongue to apply pressure to this bulb and then quickly release the tongue back into a neutral position. This repetitive tongue movement will be performed three times and values will be recorded.</description>

After inhaling to total lung capacity, the participant will place his or her lips around the mouthpiece and blow out as forcefully as possible. A flanged rubber mouthpiece will be used to overcome the inability of some individuals to create tight lip seal due to facial muscle weakness. Three trials will be performed and the patients highest maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) used.</description>
