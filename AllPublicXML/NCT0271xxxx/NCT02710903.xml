    <textblock>
      A maximum of 220 subjects with a minimum of 25 years will be recruited and examined for this
      1-7 visit, up to 35 days research study: Subjects will be genotyped to identify variants of
      the interleukin-29 (IL29) and interleukin-28B (IL28B) genes and placed in one of the 4
      groups: 50 subjects with dominant allelic variants with healthy periodontium, 50 subjects
      with dominant allelic variants with periodontitis, 50 subjects with IL29 (rs30461) or any of
      IL28B (rs11083519; rs8105790; rs8099917) single nucleotide polymorphism's (SNP) variants and
      healthy periodontium, and 50 subjects with IL29 (rs30461) or any of IL28B (rs11083519;
      rs8105790; rs8099917) SNP variants and periodontitis. Visits will consist of outpatient
      procedures including oral examinations, oral prophylaxis or periodontal scaling and root
      planing, collection of gingival crevicular fluid, dental plaque, saliva, and blood samples.
      Analysis will include salivary DNA isolation and pyrosequencing to determine IL29 and IL28B
      genotype, mediator analysis of gingival crevicular fluid, dendritic cell differentiation and
      inflammatory mediator analysis, and whole-genome shotgun sequencing plaque analysis. Clinical
      outcomes will include measurements of periodontal disease progression and inflammation, such
      as clinical attachment level (CAL), pocket depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival
      index (GI), and plaque index (PI).

      Primary Objective: To determine the impact of IL29 and IL28B SNP variants on periodontal
      disease expression and local inflammatory response during stent-induced biofilm overgrowth.

      Secondary Objective: To evaluate in vitro the impact of IL29 and IL28B SNP variants on
      cell-mediated, innate inflammatory response.

    <description>Customized stents will be fabricated for each subject. Stents will be fabricated to resemble an acrylic mouth-guard but extended to cover approximately 2mm over gingival margins. Stents will form a seal and rest on the gingiva, but will be relieved on the tooth and tissue side except for the occlusal surfaces to avoid disturbing plaque or gingival tissues. Acrylic stents will abstained from brushing and flossing teeth in one maxillary and one mandibular posterior sextant during a three- week period. Patients will be monitored for safety every week and after the induction of experimental biofilm overgrowth through 21 days</description>
