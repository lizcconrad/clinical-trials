      Participants who are scheduled to have an endo bronchial ultrasound (EBUS) trans bronchial
      needle aspiration (TBNA) will provide additional samples. These samples will then be sent to
      Imperial College London to see whether a cell line can be grown.

      If growth is successful then the samples will be returned to our pathology department to see
      if grading is possible and then to compare these results with the previous diagnostic
      samples.

      The cell line samples will not be used for patient diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obtaining adequate pathological specimen is essential in the diagnosis of cancer. Ultrasound
      guided sampling through endo bronchial ultrasound (EBUS) trans bronchial needle aspiration
      (TBNA) has emerged as a safe and accurate technique in the diagnosis and staging of lung
      cancer but subtyping and/or genotyping of TBNA samples obtained by convex probe EBUS has long
      been considered to be limited by the lack of tissue architecture in these small tissue
      samples. The performance of small tissue samples in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      subtyping has been proven to be accurate in modern pathology practice adopting cell blocks
      and immunohistochemistry (IHC), reducing the NSCLC not otherwise specified rate for needle
      aspiration samples to 8-23%. It has also shown recently a promising result in work up of
      mediastinal lymphadenopathy when lymphoma is suspected.

      It is thought that at times EBUS TBNA sample is still inadequate for further essential
      testing for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose and enhancing the yield is possibly by cell
      culture will not only be useful for diagnosing lung cancer and lymphoma but also will provide
      material for future research study.

      We have therefore developed a research proposal in collaboration with scientists at the
      biomedical research laboratory at Imperial College London, who have excellent record in basic
      scientific research and currently involved in similar research on cell culture for other type
      of diseases.
