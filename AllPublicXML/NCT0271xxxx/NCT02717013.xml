  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effects of supplementing beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB)
      on body composition and strength changes during weight loss. When overweight and obese
      persons lose weight, and in particular in conjunction with dietary restrictions, muscle, bone
      mass, and muscle strength are also lost. HMB has been shown to preserve muscle mass and
      strength, and it is thought that HMB may also preserve muscle, bone, and strength during
      weight-loss.

      Forty obese men (BMI 35-40 kg/m2,18-40 years of age) will be randomly assigned to one of four
      treatment interventions: 1) Calorie restricted; 2) Calorie restricted and HMB supplemented;
      3) No calorie restriction; and 4) No calorie restriction and HMB-supplemented. Over the 8
      week interventional period the calorie restricted group is expected to lose 3-5% of initial
      body weight. Anthropometric measures will be taken weekly, and dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) body composition and strength will be measured before and after 8-weeks
      of intervention. Blood and urine will be collected and analyzed at 0, 4, and 8 weeks.
      Additionally Dietary records and questionnaires concerning quality of life will be
      administered, and activity will be assessed using questionnaires and pedometers. Muscle
      biopsies will be taken before and after the 8-week study.
