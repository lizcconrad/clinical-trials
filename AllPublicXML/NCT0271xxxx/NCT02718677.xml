  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This NIS aims to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of ReFacto AF in the Standard
      Prophylaxis Treatment of children with severe hemophilia A in Romania
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving standard prophylaxis treatment with ReFacto AF as determined by the
      inclusion criteria will be included in the study. During this observational study, patients
      diagnosed with severe hemophilia A, and starting or continuing prophylaxis with ReFacto AF as
      per local standard clinical care, will be observed for 12 months. Patients who received
      prophylaxis with another FVIII product and are scheduled to switch to ReFacto AF prophylaxis
      can also be enrolled. Physician decision to initiate or to continue ReFacto AF prophylaxis
      therapy will be independent and it will precede subjects' inclusion in the study. Also the
      physician decision to switch the prophylaxis with another FVIII product to ReFacto AF will be
      independent and it will precede subjects' inclusion in the study. Detailed information on
      hemophilia A history and previous hemophilia treatments will be collected at Baseline. The
      number of bleedings and their treatment, status of joints and the quality of life will be
      assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after ReFacto AF prophylaxis initiation.

      ReFacto AF dosing and treatment duration are at the discretion of the investigator in
      accordance with local clinical practice and local labeling. All clinical or laboratory
      assessments in this study will be conducted as per current medical practice in management of
      hemophilia A without any study related procedures.
