  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to search for, in vitro, elements associated with
      IgG-dependent monocyte activation (signaling pathway activation, expression of pro-coagulant
      and pro-inflammatory factors) and to describe their prevalence in female patients with a
      history of proximal venous thromboembolism (proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary
      embolism) compared to control women.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study include to compare the IgG-dependent monocyte
      activation profiles as a function of laboratory thrombophilia parameters. Essentially: Is
      IgG-dependent cell activation associated with the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies
      (or their subtypes?), or do these profiles indicate something beyond the nosology of
      anti-phospholipid syndrome?

    <description>The following will be taken into account: Six signaling pathways (Protein kinase B, extracellular-signal-regulated kinases, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, Mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), increases in the expression of tissue factor, and 5 pro-inflammatory factors (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, Interleukin-1 beta, Interleukin 8). A pathway will be considered as &quot;activated&quot; or an expression profile as &quot;increased&quot; when the observed value is superior to the 95% confidence interval determined using healthy volunteer values. A patient is considered as having an activation profile if at least one of the above pathways or expressions is considered as activated / increased.</description>

    <description>Patients will correspond to cases of proximal venous thromboembolism. They will be recruited during consultations conducted for the chronic management of a history of proximal venous thromboembolism or thrombophilia following a recent history of proximal venous thromboembolism. Venous thromboembolism, outside of acute phase episodes, has good symptom stability over time; no difference is to be expected between patients with a chronic history of proximal venous thromboembolism and new patients coming in for a checkup. Note that these patients may or may not have a history of placental vascular disease.
