    <textblock>
      A specific aim is to determine if Indocyanine Green (ICG) administered pre-operatively, then
      imaged intraoperatively using our camera will aid in the identification of suspected central
      nervous system (CNS) tumors. A secondary aim is to understand if the use of ICG during
      surgery correlates to MR imaging findings including elevated Cho/Cr ratio, rCBV, Ktrans and
      contrast enhancement.
