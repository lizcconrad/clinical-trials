      Lipidome and microbiome analysis in subjects with acne on doxycycline. Investigators will
      look at the skin lipidome, blood lipidome, gut micro biome and skin micro biome.

      Investigators will look at the changes between acne subjects and control participants, but
      also the changes that occur after the use of antibiotics and how this is altered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will look at acne subjects, and controls.

      We will look at four things

        1. skin lipidome

        2. skin microbiome

        3. gut microbiome

        4. blood lipidome

      Investigators will assess this in acne participants before and after doxycycline and compare
      them to controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 15 and older

          -  Subjects/parents/legal guardian is able to read and comprehend study procedure and
             consent forms.

          -  Have already been prescribed Doxycycline by their physician for acne or to be eligible
             to be prescribed Doxycycline for acne

          -  Have acne that is diagnosed by a board certified dermatologist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those who have received systemic antibiotics within four weeks of starting the study.

          -  Those who have received systemic isotretinoin within six weeks of starting the study.

          -  Those with seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, or polycystic ovary syndrome

          -  Those who are pregnant, prisoners or cognitively impaired.

          -  Those subjects who are currently using proton pump inhibits (as studies have shown
             this may impact the gut microbiome) (4)

          -  Those who have a BMI greater than &gt;30 kg/m2, as studies have shown a reduction in the
             variability of intestinal microbes within this population (5).

          -  Those who have initiated or changed brand of oral contraceptive pill within 4 weeks of
             starting the study.

          -  Those who have autoimmune disorders as this group has been shown to have an altered
             microbiome (6)

          -  Those who have diabetes (6), immunodeficiencies (7), inflammatory bowel disease (6),
             hypercholesterolemia, as these groups have been shown to have altered gut microbiomes

          -  Those who have taken oral probiotic supplements (8) within 4 weeks of starting the
             study

          -  Given the nature of the instructions that need to be adhered to for accurate
             collection of samples and this data, non-English speaking individuals will be excluded
             from this pilot study.

          -  Allergies to the tetracycline group of antibiotics
