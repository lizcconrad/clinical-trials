  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an active treatment, extended access study open solely to those subjects who have
      successfully completed the Core and Repeat Dosing portions of the MT-3724_NHL_001_US clinical
      study and who, in the investigator's judgment, (i) have not had progressive disease while on
      MT-3724 treatment (i.e.; have shown a complete or partial response or stable disease), (ii)
      have experienced no clinical or laboratory toxicities that would contraindicate further
      MT-3724 dosing and (iii) have no acceptable and better alternative treatment available to
      them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each treatment cycle will consist of 6 doses of MT-3724 to be administered over 12 days
      followed by at least 9 days of observation but longer intervals between dosing cycles will be
      allowed at the investigator's discretion (e.g., 6 doses of MT-2734 over 12 days followed by
      16 days observation). Subjects in this extension study may continue to receive up to 6
      additional cycles in the absence of clear disease progression or toxicity. If a subject
      achieves complete remission, two additional cycles will be attempted, after which dosing may
      be suspended prior to completion of the maximum 6 cycles.

      In accordance with CFR Title 21, Part 312.315, Subpart I (Expanded Access to Investigational
      Drugs for Treatment Use for Intermediate-size Populations) this study will be submitted to
      the MT-2724 IND (# 121918) for FDA review and approval. Prior to enrolling a subject in this
      study each investigator who elects to participate in this study is responsible to (i) obtain
      local institutional review board (IRB) approval for this study and its associated informed
      consent form, (ii) review each potential study candidate's eligibility with the sponsor and
      (iii) obtain each potential subject's signed, local IRB approved informed consent form for
      this study prior to performing any study related activities.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects must be adequately informed of all study procedures and fully
             consent to participation as demonstrated by signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Eligible subjects must require treatment for their NHL and have:

               -  tolerated MT-3724 throughout the MT-3724_NHL_001_US Phase I/Ib study (Core and
                  Repeat Dosing),

               -  successfully completed the Core and Repeat Dosing portions of MT-3724_NHL_001_US
                  Phase I/Ib study as defined by that protocol,

               -  received no other treatment for their NHL since enrollment in the
                  MT-3724_NHL_001_US Phase I/Ib study,

               -  maintained stable disease or better throughout that study and

               -  been assessed by the investigator to have no other acceptable and better
                  treatment options available to them. The investigator must document in the
                  potential subject's medical record that there are no other approved treatment
                  options available and/or appropriate for the potential subject or that the
                  potential subject has declined any other approved treatment options that me be
                  available to them.

          -  Potential subjects must continue to meet the diagnostic criteria for B-Cell NHL that
             allowed them to be eligible for the MT-3724_NHL_001_US Phase I/Ib study.

          -  Potential subjects must have received all approved therapies known to provide clinical
             benefit for their disease subtype and for which they are eligible or must have refused
             these treatment options prior to consideration for continued compassionate use
             treatment with MT-3724 through enrollment in this protocol. In the case of subjects
             who have lymphomas for which high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
             transplantation (HD-ASCT) is considered a standard curative therapy, eligibility for
             MT-3724 compassionate use requires that the subject's disease relapsed after HD-ASCT,
             that the subject is not eligible for HD ASCT, or that the subject has refused HD-ASCT.

          -  Potential subjects with known central nervous system (CNS) metastases may be enrolled
             if they:

               -  have previously been treated with radiotherapy for their CNS disease,

               -  do not require chronic steroid therapy,

               -  have had computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain within 1
                  month of this study's entry that showed stable disease and

               -  have no neurological symptoms (excluding Grade 1 or 2 neuropathy).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt; 3

          -  Potential subjects should have measurable disease (any tumor mass of at least 1.5 cm)
             which has been documented to not have progressed during the MT-3724_NHL_001_US Phase
             I/Ib study and which can be followed during extended treatment for possible new
             disease progression.

          -  Potential subjects must be at least 9 days past their last course of MT-3724 treatment
             and have recovered from any side effects attributed to MT-3724 to at least Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v. 4.03; Appendix 4) Grade 2 prior to
             initiating additional cycles of MT-3724 through this compassionate use protocol.

             CTCAE grading should not be enrolled.

                  thrombocytopenia must be secondary to bone marrow infiltration by tumor and not
                  secondary to increased platelet consumption or the effect of previous marrow
                  suppressing treatment or infection.)

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless due to Gilbert's

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min (either measured
                  or estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula).

          -  Potential patients with a history of another cancer other than basal cell carcinoma or
             cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical cancer in situ) may not be enrolled
             unless it is documented that their previous cancer was treated, they have been disease
             free for five or more years prior to starting this study and they are in their
             doctor's judgment at less than 30% risk of relapse of this previous malignancy.

          -  Patients with a peripheral blood total lymphocyte count of higher than 25,000/mm3 may
