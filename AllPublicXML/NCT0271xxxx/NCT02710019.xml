    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Back to Reality series video games -
      Harry's Journey, Harry's Journal, and Pathways to care map - are effective at educating
      homeless and street involved youth, registered at the Youth Services Good Shepherd Hamilton,
      about the emotional, social, and psychiatric sequel of problematic underage substance use.
      The objectives of the video games are to promote early detection and awareness of mental
      health and substance use problems among youth.

      This project examines the use of video game technology to help youth gain awareness of
      symptoms and problems associated with hazardous substance use. By playing the Back to Reality
      video games, youths may absorb knowledge about where and how to access community care for
      symptoms associated with psychosis and problematic cannabis use. The purpose of this study is
      to pilot test the effectiveness of the Back to Reality series at improving awareness of the
      social and emotional implications of underage substance use. Recognizing and overcoming
      hazardous substance use is essential for youth to develop positive self-identities and to
      flourish socially and academically. Improving mental health literacy may help youth to become
      better-informed consumers.

      This study involves a randomized single blind controlled trial of video games along with a
      post-intervention mixed method design. The results will be assessed using quantitative
      questionnaires and qualitative interviews. The qualitative interview assesses the
      participants understanding of potential emotional, social, and psychiatric manifestations of
      excessive marijuana use during youth.
