  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Study is to select a dose and assess the safety and tolerability of
      INCB057643 as a monotherapy (Part 1 and Part 2) and in combination with standard-of-care
      (SOC) agents (Part 3 and Part 4) for subjects with advanced malignancies.

      Part 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose of INCB057643 and/or a tolerated dose that
      demonstrates sufficient pharmacologic activity. Part 2 will further evaluate the safety,
      preliminary efficacy, PK, and PD of the dose(s) selected in Part 1 in select tumor types
      including solid tumors, lymphomas and other hematologic malignancies. Part 3 will determine
      the tolerated dose of INCB057643 in combination with select SOC agents; and assess the safety
      and tolerability of the combination therapy in select advanced solid tumors and hematologic
      malignancies. Part 4 will further evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, PK, and PD of
      the selected dose combination from Part 3 in 4 specific advanced solid tumor and hematologic
      malignancies.
