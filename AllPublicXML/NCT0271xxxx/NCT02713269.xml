    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if combining thermal ablation (using
      a laser to heat tumor tissue in order to shrink the tumor size) and spine stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SSRS--a method for giving radiation) can help control cancer that has spread to
      the spine.

      SSRS Simulation:

      If you are eligible and agree to take part in this study, you will have a computed tomography
      (CT) simulation. A simulation is like a planning session for your SSRS. For this, a bag
      filled with small foam beads is formed to your body and then the air is vacuumed out. This
      creates a mold that you will lie in so that the doctors can plan the radiation treatment that
      you will receive. This mold will then be used to keep you from moving during SSRS. If the
      study doctor thinks it is needed, a meshed plastic mask will also be used to fit to your head
      and neck area to help accuracy during SSRS. If a mask is used, you will still be able to
      breathe normally.

      Thermal Ablation:

      You will then have the thermal ablation procedure. Thermal ablation heats the tumor tissue
      using a laser, and this helps to shrink the tumor by destroying tumor cells. This procedure
      will be performed while you are under general anesthesia. You will sign a separate consent
      for thermal ablation that explains the details of the procedure and its risks.

      When you are on the operating table, images will be taken of the compressed area and
      transferred to a computer. This will be used to help guide the laser.

      This procedure should last about 6 hours. After that, you will be admitted to the hospital.

      Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery:

      Within 2 weeks after thermal ablation, you will have SSRS. You will lie in the mold and/or
      mask that was made for you during the simulation. Radiation treatment will last up to 2
      hours. Multiple images will be used to make sure you are in the right position before you
      receive treatment. The procedure itself usually takes less than 30 minutes. After treatment,
      you will be free to leave the clinic. You will sign a separate consent for this procedure
      that explains the risks.

      Follow-Up:

      You will have follow-up visits at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and then every 6 months after that.
      At each follow-up visit:

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  You will complete the same 3 questionnaires from screening.

        -  You will have an MRI of the spine to check the status of disease.

      If you are unable to return for follow-up visits, you will be called and asked about your
      medical history and will complete the 3 questionnaires over the phone. This call should take
      about 20 minutes each time at the schedule above.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your active participation in this study will be over after you complete the follow-up
      visits/calls.

      This is an investigational study. Thermal ablation is FDA approved for treatment of soft
      tissue tumors. SSRS is delivered using established and commercially available methods, to
      patients with cancer that has spread to the spine. The combination of thermal ablation and
      SSRS to treat cancer that has spread to the spine with tumor in the spinal canal is
      investigational.

      Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age.

          2. Histologic diagnosis of solid malignant tumor (not one of the more radiosensitive
             histologic subtypes, see Exclusion Criteria), including but not limited to non-small
             cell lung cancer, breast, prostate, renal cell, melanoma, gastrointestinal, sarcoma,
             thyroid, head and neck primary, and unknown primary tumors.

          3. Quantification of the degree of epidural spinal cord compression as grade 1C, 2, or 3
             by MRI, with and without contrast sequences. Axial T2 sequence is encouraged but not
             required.

          4. The vertebral body site to be treated must be located from T2-T12.

          5. No more than 3 contiguous or discontiguous vertebral levels involved with metastasis
             in the spine to be irradiated in a single session or 3 sessions.

          6. Motor strength &gt;/=4 out of 5 in extremity or extremities affected by the level of the
             spinal cord compression (see section 4 for grading method).

          7. ECOG performance status &lt;/=2 or Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;/=50

          8. Life expectancy &gt;3 months.

          9. Inoperable disease because of patient refusal, neurosurgical evaluation, or any other
             medical reasons.

         10. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) before study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately.

         11. Prior conventional radiation to the same site is allowed as long as there is a greater
             than 3 months interval.

         12. All patients must sign informed consent forms verifying that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the rules and policies of MD
             Anderson Cancer Center. The only acceptable consent form is one approved by the MD
             Anderson institutional review board.

         13. Patients who do not have other options of treatment, based on consensus recommendation
             of the multidisciplinary spine SRS (SSRS) tumor board. Patients will have an
             appropriate medical oncologist for their disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary tumors of radiosensitive histology (lymphoma, multiple myeloma, small cell
             carcinoma, germ cell tumors), as conventional radiation is likely to be effective in
             such cases.

          2. Prior conventional irradiation of the spine site and level to be treated with an
             interval shorter than 3 months.

          3. Lesions located outside of the spinal segments of T2 to T12.

          4. Prior surgery to the same levels of spine.

          5. Inability to lie flat on a treatment table for &gt;60 minutes.

          6. Unable to undergo MRI of the spine

          7. Pregnancy (because radiation has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects).

          8. Frank cord compression or cord compression from bone components or configuration and
             acute neurological deficits (defined as motor strength &lt;4/5 in extremity or
             extremities affected by the level of the spinal cord compression).
