  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced rehabilitation programs are based on new therapies and treatment combinations to
      reduce the length of hospitalization, duration of postoperative convalescence, morbidity, but
      also the overall cost of care. The operating stress and hypercatabolic conditions surrounding
      the surgery are sources of complications. In this enhanced rehabilitation approach, the
      principle is to fight through a series of actions against this surgical stress. Several North
      American studies, Chinese, Scandinavian or Batavian have shown the feasibility and the
      interest of enhanced perioperative rehabilitation in liver surgery. Nevertheless, there is
      not until now French data concerning the assessment of enhanced rehabilitation in liver
      surgery. The main objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of the
      implementation of a multimodal management program after liver surgery in a French university
      center compared to conventional care. Secondary objectives of the study are to compare an
      enhanced rehabilitation program in liver surgery versus conventional treatment in terms of
      morbidity and mortality in the immediate postoperative period and until day 90, length of
      hospital stay, blood loss and the delay to bowel mobility recovery. Compliance to the program
      in both groups will also be evaluated.

    <description>The evaluation of time to functional recovery is scored once a day. A patient is fully functionally recovered when all of the following criteria are satisfied:
adequate pain control with oral analgesia: Post-operative pain is rated by the numeric rating scale. Nurses ask patients the intensity of their current pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). To satisfy this criterion, patient must rate their pain between 0 to 3 with only oral analgesics.
restoration of mobility to an independent level We decided to use the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale for rated the difference between preoperative and postoperative mobility level. To satisfy this criterion, patient must have the same score in postoperative.
absence of intravenous fluid administration for at least 24 hours.
ability to eat solid foods well tolerated for at least 24 hours to satisfy this criterion.
