  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NNZ-2566 is safe and well tolerated in the
      treatment of Rett syndrome in children and adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting females. The disorder is
      characterized by apparent normal development in early infancy (6-18 months), followed by a
      period of regression with onset of systemic and neurological signs. The CNS symptoms of Rett
      syndrome include learning disability, autism symptomatology and epilepsy and these can be
      severe and highly debilitating. Affected individuals also show signs of autonomic
      dysfunction, reflected in cardiovascular and respiratory abnormalities. There is no currently
      effective treatment for Rett syndrome.

      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability and blood pharmacokinetics of treatment
      with oral administration of NNZ-2566 at 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg BID, or placebo BID,
      in children and adolescent females with Rett syndrome. The study also will also investigate
      measures of efficacy and biomarkers during treatment.
