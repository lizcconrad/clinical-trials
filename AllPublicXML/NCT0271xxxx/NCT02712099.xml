      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of the 3 D TUI view in diagnosis of
      morbidly adherent placenta in comparison to 2D grayscale, color Doppler and intraoperative
      findings.

      -  This is a prospective study which will include 50 patients who will be selected from the
           outpatient and inpatient obstetric Ain Shams university maternity hospital.

        -  All patients will undergo the following :

             1. History taking

             2. Clinical examination.

             3. For each patient, the whole placenta will be scanned in a systematic fashion using
                both 2D grayscale and 2D power Doppler ultrasound then displayed by 3D TUI to
                determine whether those patients suspected of having advanced invasive
                placentation.

The slices can be generated either along the initial or any other reconstructed plane of the region of interest (ROI) in intervals of 0.5 - to 5 mm segments. Slice thickness will be adjusted as necessary for each individual case. The most informative image among the multiple images will be displayed with the use of CrossXBeam, a postprocessing tool that allows one to enhance tissue and border differentiation, leading to sharper depiction of the tissue margins</description>

Intraoperative:
Delivery of the fetus through the placenta.

• All patients will undergo the following : For each patient, the whole placenta will be scanned in a systematic fashion using both 2D grayscale and 2D power Doppler ultrasound then displayed by 3D TUI to determine whether those patients suspected of having advanced invasive placentation.
Intraoperative:
Delivery of the fetus through the placenta.
15 minutes for spontaneous separation of the placenta were waited, if easily separated hot packs then rapid closure of the uterus in 2 layers.

The slices can be generated either along the initial or any other reconstructed plane of the region of interest (ROI) in intervals of 0.5 - to 5 mm segments. Slice thickness will be adjusted as necessary for each individual case. The most informative image among the multiple images will be displayed with the use of CrossXBeam, a postprocessing tool that allows one to enhance tissue and border differentiation, leading to sharper depiction of the tissue margins</description>

          <title>Women With Placenta Previa Who Had Easily Placenta Delivery</title>
          <description>This is a prospective study which will include 50 patients who will be selected from the outpatient and inpatient obstetric Ain Shams university maternity hospital.
• All patients will undergo the following : For each patient, the whole placenta will be scanned in a systematic fashion using both 2D grayscale and 2D power Doppler ultrasound then displayed by 3D TUI to determine whether those patients suspected of having advanced invasive placentation.
Intraoperative:
Delivery of the fetus through the placenta.
15 minutes for spontaneous separation of the placenta were waited, if easily separated hot packs then rapid closure of the uterus in 2 layers.

When not separated easily manual removal was done, with uterotonics, together with uterine massage.
