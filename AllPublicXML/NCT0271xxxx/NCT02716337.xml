  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of postnatal growth failure in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants is
      of utmost importance. Standard fortification is the most commonly used supplementation
      practice but it does not consider the native variability of human milk. Data on efficacy and
      safety of prolonged target fortification are scarce. The investigators performed a
      prospective interventional study in VLBW preterm infants, exclusively fed with human milk, to
      test efficacy and metabolic safety of target fortification in these preterm infants.

      The prevention of postnatal growth failure in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants is
      of utmost importance. Fortified human milk is the goal for preterm infants' nutrition.
      Standard fortification is the most commonly used and safe supplementation practice but it
      does not consider the native variability of human milk. Data on efficacy and safety of
      prolonged target fortification are scarce. Prospective interventional study was conducted in
      VLBW preterm infants, exclusively fed with human milk. Twenty-four hour collected pools of
      human milk were analyzed and targeted human milk fortification was performed during
      hospitalization. Weekly growth and daily growth velocity were compared with that of an
      historical group of VLBW preterm infants that had received standard fortified human milk.
      Osmolality, metabolic and gastrointestinal tolerance were monitored.
