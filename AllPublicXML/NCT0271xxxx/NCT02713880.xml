      Development of a new MS-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis of
      Transthyretin-Related Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy from plasma. Testing for clinical
      robustness, specificity and long-term stability of the biomarker.

      Diseases of diverse etiology can be correlated to the term &quot;polyneuropathy&quot;(PNP). The
      pathogenesis may be of inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, toxic or hereditary nature.
      Careful clinical and electrodiagnostic assessment, with attention to the pattern of
      involvement and the types of nerve fibers most affected, narrows the differential diagnosis
      and helps to focus the laboratory evaluation. Beside the frequent genetic etiologies in PNP
      (pmp22, MFN2) one cause of a polyneuropathy may be a hereditary amyloidosis. This term
      describes the accumulation of misfolded protein in the interstitial space. The abnormal
      accumulation of β-fibrils can be detected histologically by Congo pink staining. Aside from
      acquired amyloidotic neuropathies (e.g. PNP caused by AL-amyloidosis there are also
      hereditary amyloidotic neuropathies.

      These have been described as endemic in Sweden, Portugal or Japan. More recent studies
      provided evidence for the presence of hereditary amyloidotic neuropathies amongst the German
      population and that they are currently underdiagnosed. The most common form of the hereditary
      familial amyloidotic neuropathy (FAP) is the Transthyretin-related FAP, however two other
      amyloidogenic proteins have been described: Apolipoprotein A-I and Gelsolin. The TTR-FAP is
      an autosomal dominant disease, the exact prevalence of which is unknown but estimated to be
      around 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 in the normal population. By limiting the study population to
      patients with PNP of unknown etiology it should be possible to gain evidence for the
      prevalence of the disease in Germany by investigating fewer patients.

      While the diagnosis of the amyloidotic neuropathy can be conducted histologically, a
      molecular genetic approach is necessary to diagnose TTR-FAP. Even though more than 100 point
      mutations are known to cause the disease, the most common amino acid change is V30M.

      The mutation in the TTR gene causes the destabilization of the physiologically tetrameric
      protein. Usually transthyretin consists of four identical monomeric subunits and binds the
      thyroxin circulating in the blood plasma. The monomeric subunits exhibit a pronounced β-sheet
      structure which leads to the accumulation of unsoluble β-fibrils when they are destabilised
      as in TTR-FAP.

      This accumulation of misfolded TTR can lead to three phenotypes known as

        -  cardiac TTR amyloidosis,

        -  leptomeningeal TTR amyloidosis and the

        -  TTR-FAP.

      The TTR-FAP has a very heterogeneous phenotype which can manifest starting at the age of 18
      and may lead to death within 10 years. The symptoms can be categorized in three groups:

      Dysfunction of peripheral nerves:

        -  Dissociated anesthesia

        -  Muscle paresis and atrophy

        -  Dysaesthesia and paraesthesia

        -  Reduced skin temperature

        -  Coldness

        -  Hoarseness

      Autonomic dysfunction:

        -  Dysuria

        -  Diarrhea

        -  Constipation

        -  Orthostatic dysregulation

        -  Erectile dysfunction

        -  Nausea Constitutional conditions

        -  Anemia

        -  Weight loss

        -  Arrhythmia

        -  Edema

        -  Acroparaesthesia The currently available therapeutic approaches are either liver
           transplantation (as the liver mainly produces transthyretin this is a feasible approach)
           or as of more recently also a TTR-tetramer stabilizing agent (Tafamidis). Tafamidis
           (Vyndaqel®) gained the European approval under &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;in November
           2011 for treating FAP in adults with a symptomatic polyneuropathy.In light of the
           potential therapy of this very rare disease this study aims to determine the prevalence
           of TTR-FAP in a selected, clinical subpopulation. New methods, like mass-spectrometry
           give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic alterations in the blood (plasma)
           of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future the disease earlier, with a
           higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify
           and validate a new biochemical marker from the plasma of the affected patients helping
           to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and thereby with an earlier treatment.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry 7, 5 ml
      EDTA blood or a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis of
      aTransthyretin-Related Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy in those patients where up to the
      enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done, sequencing of a
      Transthyretin-Related Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy will be done.

      The analyses are done in the Centogene AG Schillingallee 68 D-18057 Rostock Germany
