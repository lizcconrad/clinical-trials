      This is an evaluation of pilot program, Programa Cresça com Seu Filho (PCCSF) which is
      publically funded and, developed in a partnership between the Ministry of Health (MoH) of
      Brazil and the municipal government of Fortaleza. The program targets low-income mothers of
      children 0 to 2.5 years old, living in low-income neighborhoods in Fortaleza Brazil. The home
      visits are carried out by community health workers (CHW), who currently work for the Ministry
      of Health as part of the program Programa Saúde da Família. The CHWs will be trained on the
      PCCSF curriculum in order to provide 1-hour visits with the early stimulation package during
      two years. The PCCSF home visiting program is planned to begin implementation the week of
      March 15, 2016 for half of the community health workers and April 15, 2016 for the other
      half.
