  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During rectal or complex digestive surgery with multiple digestive resections and
      anastomosis, the creation of enterostomy is a common procedure. In France, it is estimated
      that 20000 patients have an ileostomy and 16000 new digestive stomas are formed each year
      with approximately 30% of enterostomy. Enterostomy might sometimes give high-output not
      controlled with usual medical treatment (e.g loperamide ± codeine) and exposes the patients
      to important hydro-electrolytic loss leading to a risk for dehydration, electrolyte
      abnormalities and acute renal failure. This risk implies parenteral correction which may
      extend hospital stay and delay home return.

      Somatostatin analogues (octreotide, lanreotide and pasireotide) could reduce digestive
      secretions and decrease digestive peristalsis. Nevertheless, somatostatin analogues are not
      routinely used for the treatment of patients with high-output enterostomy and their efficacy
      in the indication (off-label) was only tested in small case series. Pasireotide (SOM230,
      SIGNIFOR®) is currently indicated for the treatment of patients with Cushing's disease for
      whom surgery is not an option or for whom surgery has failed.

      As the efficacity of pasireotide in patients with high-output enterostomy refractory to usual
      medical treatment associated with an oral fluid restriction has never been demonstrated
      before, there is a need to perform a pilot, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial evaluating its impact on reduction of the effluent volume.
