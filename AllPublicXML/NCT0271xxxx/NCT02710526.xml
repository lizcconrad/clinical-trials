      This is a phase II, open label, randomized, two treatment group study designed to evaluate
      the steady state pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine following repeated
      subcutaneous administrations of CAM2038 weekly at different injection sites and to evaluate
      the steady state pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine after repeated
      subcutaneous administration of CAM2038 monthly in opioid dependent subjects with a history of
      chronic non cancer pain. The study will involve three phases: Screening, Treatment, and
      Follow up.
