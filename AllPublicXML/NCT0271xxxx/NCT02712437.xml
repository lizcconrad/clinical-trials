  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with early stage breast cancer may experience difficulty falling asleep or staying
      asleep. If this occurs for more than 4 weeks, these participants may have chronic insomnia.
      Chronic insomnia can lead to difficulty coping with stress, changes in mood, increased use of
      medications for sleep and an overall decrease in quality of life.

      The investigators have developed an internet-based website that is designed to help people
      manage symptoms typically experienced by breast cancer survivors, including insomnia,
      fatigue, pain and overall poor quality of life. The investigators want to learn whether this
      type of treatment can reduce chronic insomnia and improve the way subjects feel using both
      questionnaires and a special form of a wrist watch. This information may help the
      investigators better manage sleep difficulties in subjects who experience these symptoms
      after diagnosis of their breast cancer.

    <description>Participants who have received treatment for early stage breast cancer and who experience chronic insomnia as assessed by difficulty sleeping for &gt;30 days with an insomnia severity index score of &gt;14. Participants will complete baseline symptom questionnaires and actigraphy, then complete an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program (PROSPECT) for 6 weeks. Participants will then repeat questionnaires and actigraphy at 6 weeks and questionnaires at 12 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>PROSPECT</intervention_name>
    <description>PROSPECT is an internet-based exercise and behavioral symptom management program developed for patients who experience long-term side effects from cancer treatment. The cancer-specific symptom management intervention is intended as a self-management adjunct to improve cancer- and treatment-related symptoms, including insomnia, through non-pharmacologic approaches.</description>
