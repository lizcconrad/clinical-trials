      The sponsor raise the hypothesis that inhibition of immune PD-1+/- CTLA-4 check-point(s)
      would delay tumor progression in patients with unresectable MPM, experiencing disease
      progression after one or two lines of chemotherapy including at least first-line with
      pemetrexed and platinum, without altering significantly the quality of life of patients.

             2004; Therasse 2006).

          9. Previous treatment by 1 or 2 systemic chemotherapy lines (1 line of chemotherapy
             considered if the patient received ≥2 cycles of this chemotherapy), including at least
             one line with pemetrexed in combination with platinum agent (i.e. &quot;gold standard
             chemotherapy in MPM; triplet including bevacizumab also accepted)

         10. Written informed consent

             limit of normal) except subjects with documented Gilbert's syndrome (≤ 5 × ULN) or
             liver metastasis, who must have a baseline total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL

         12. Recovered from all toxicities associated with prior treatment, to acceptable baseline
             status, or a National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (NCI CTCAE v4.0) Grade of 0 or 1, except for toxicities not considered a safety risk,
             such as alopecia or vitiligo

         13. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male
             partner must use a highly effective method of contraception for 28 days prior to the
             first dose of investigational product, and must agree to continue using such
             precautions for 6 months after the final dose of investigational product; cessation of
             contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.
             Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable
             methods of contraception. They must also refrain from egg cell donation for 6 months
             after the final dose of investigational product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are
             sexually active with women of childbearing potential will be instructed to adhere to

             permitted to enroll.

          9. Active or history of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, diverticulitis, colitis,

               -  known prior history of active tuberculosis-disease;

               -  known acute or chronic B or C hepatitis by serological evaluation. Patients with
                  serological sequelae of hepatitis (antibodies test serologically positive for
                  virus) without hepatitis could be included.

               -  known Human immunodeficiency virus infection.

         11. Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint
             pathways

         12. The last dose of prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (with the exception of
             palliative radiotherapy) was received less than 3 weeks prior to randomization
