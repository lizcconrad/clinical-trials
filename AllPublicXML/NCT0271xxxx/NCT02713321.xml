  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is common in the United States; about 1 in 10 people have the disease.
      Diabetes can cause devastating health events, such as hospitalizations, kidney failure,
      blindness, amputation, heart attack, stroke, painful nerve damage (neuropathy), and death.
      There are many barriers for patients with diabetes that get in the way of controlling risk
      factors, following recommendations, and getting the care they need from the health system to
      help prevent these complications; this is especially true for those with other health
      problems too. Those living in poverty and racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have
      complications from diabetes, and less likely to get recommended care from health systems. In
      order to improve care and outcomes for people with complex medical problems, several states
      have started the Medicaid Health Home (HH) program, including New York State (NYS) in 2012.
      This program is for people with two or more chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and
      heart disease, people with HIV, and people with a serious mental health condition. HHs are
      meant to manage and coordinate care, by helping health care providers, social service
      agencies, community-based organizations, and health insurance plans work together. Similar
      programs have been shown, on a smaller scale, to improve some results for patients with
      diabetes, such as lab tests indicating level of diabetes control. Studies have not yet looked
      at how a large program like HHs impacts the way healthcare is delivered and impacts the
      health events that matter most to patients with diabetes. Also, few studies include
      stakeholders on the research team, even though they stand to benefit the most from such
      programs, and have the experience needed as patients, clinicians, advocates, and
      administrators to guide efforts. The investigators have gathered a research team that
      includes scientific investigators along with a diverse group of partners, including patients,
      clinicians, and program administrators. The investigators plan to use two data sources that
      show what happens to individual patients over time: 1) NYS Medicaid insurance data 2) the New
      York City-Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN). The NYC-CDRN has identified a group of
      patients with diabetes from 7 large health systems; it has also developed a system for
      putting together the same set of information for each patient, and removing any identifying
      information. The investigator will look at patients who have diabetes and are part of a HH
      and study what happened to them over time. The investigator will also look at a comparison
      group of patients who are very similar to the HH patients, but they did not join a HH, and
      follow them over time. The investigator will then compare these two groups to each other. The
      investigator will look at the quality of healthcare they received and their health outcomes.
      The investigator will focus on health outcomes that are meaningful to patients. This study
      can provide important knowledge about the effects of the HH program on patients with
      diabetes.

        The study population includes patients with data in the New York City Clinical Data
        Research Network (NYC-CDRN). The NYC-CDRN brings together 22 organizations, including 7
        independent health systems (Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons,
        Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Mount Sinai Health
        System and the Icahn School of Medicine, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York
        University Langone Medical Center and New York University School of Medicine, Weill Cornell
        Medical College, and the Clinical Directors Network). This data network includes
        longitudinal data from both inpatient and outpatient facilities from throughout New York
        City.
