  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) remains the number one cause of perinatal mortality in many
      countries, including the United States. In singleton gestations a short cervical length (CL)
      on transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) has been shown to be a good predictor of SPTB.

      The cervical pessary is a silicone device that has been used to prevent SPTB. The efficacy of
      cervical pessary has been assessed in several populations including singletons with short CL,
      unselected twins, twins with a short CL, and triplet pregnancies. Several randomized clinical
      trials (RCTs) have been published, and several are ongoing. However, no consensus on the use
      of cervical pessary in pregnancy or guidelines for management have been assessed.
