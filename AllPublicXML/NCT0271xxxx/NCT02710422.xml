  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of dehydrated human amnionic membrane allograft improves erectile function recovery
      (as measured by (Sexual History Inventory for Men (SHIM) score) at 12 months after robotic
      assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) compared to a control group with no allograft.

      This is a phase 2 prospective randomized trial investigating the impact of amniotic membrane
      placement over the neurovascular bundles after bilateral nerve sparing robot assisted radical
      prostatectomy on potency. The study will have a control arm that will follow standard of care
      surgery, without placement of any membranes. 70 men will be allocated to each arm.

      Randomization of study patients will be done in equal proportion to Arm I (membrane
      placement) and Arm II (no membrane placement, standard of care surgery) using a permuted
      block design stratified by baseline SHIM score (&lt;17 vs. &gt;=17), and use of ANY erectile aids
      (Yes vs. No) in the last 3 months.

      Patients will be followed up every three months (+/- 1 month) for a total of one year. This
      follow up schedule meets the current standard of care after radical prostatectomy. At each
      follow up a serum PSA will be assessed for recurrence on prostate cancer. To investigate
      primary and secondary endpoints a self-reported validated questionnaire will be provided
      assessing measures of potency. Finally, the use of pads for urinary leakage will be assessed
      at each time point. After the first year, there will be annual follow up with PSA
      measurements and an assessment of any secondary therapies for 5 years.
