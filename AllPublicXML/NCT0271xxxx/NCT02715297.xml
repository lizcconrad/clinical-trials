  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center randomized controlled phase II trial will investigate the impact of
      stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy to the resection cavity of complete resected recurrent
      glioblastoma on progression free survival. As secondary endpoints, overall survival, safety
      and toxicity as well as early response criteria on MRI, quality of life and neurocognitive
      function will be assessed. Chemotherapy will not be part of the protocol, however, additional
      treatment will be possible upon investigators best choice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma is, beside of its abundance in clinical practice,
      still under discussion. Patients presenting with recurrent disease are therefore treated
      within individual concepts, largely based on small prospective trials, retrospective
      evaluations or case reports. Therefore, the treatment ranges from best supportive care over
      primary systemic treatments towards local therapies such as radiotherapy or surgical
      resection. Even if there might be a large selection bias, local therapies with or without
      concomitant or adjuvant chemotherapy seem to promise the largest prognostic benefit. Whether
      the combination of surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy improves survival, as it does
      within the primary situation, is unknown.

      The result of surgical resection might have an impact as well. Several case reports,
      retrospective evaluations and prospective studies have also included patients with remaining
      gross tumor after maximum save resection. In these trials, radiotherapy was associated with
      improvements in progression free as well as overall survival. Therefore, the influence of
      neuroimaging on prognosis is currently evaluated within the GLIA-A trial. Furthermore,
      stereotactic radiotherapy with or without an experimental systemic therapy is currently
      investigated within another multicenter randomized trial (NOA-12).

      Whether patients might benefit from a postoperative radiotherapy of the resection cavity
      after complete extirpation of all macroscopic tumor is key question of this protocol.

      To answer this question, the considered standard of care after complete resection, namely
      observation with or without adjuvant systemic therapy, will be compared to a postoperative
      normofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy towards the resection cavity within an open
      label, randomized trial. The prescribed total dose will be 46 Gy in 2 Gy fractions of 36 Gy
      in 3 Gy fractions depending on the treatment volume.

      Concerning safety, side effects will be monitored prospectively. Safety parameters will be
      compared between both arms of the study. Furthermore, measures for quality of life,
      neurocognitive function as well as neuroimaging features will be evaluated prospectively.

Stable disease: Remission of the solid tumor/contrast-enhancing lesion on CT or MRI of less than 50% or progression of the solid tumor/contrast-enhancing lesion on CT or MRI of less than 25%, without increase in steroid medication of worsening of the neurologic status
Progression: Increase in solid tumor/contrast-enhancing lesion of 25% or more or development of a new lesion</description>

For assessment of learning, early and intermediate recall, the German version of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) as well as the Regensburger Wortflüssigkeits-Test (RWT) will be used. Cognitive flexibility, speed as well as attention will be tested by the Trail-Making-Test. The tests at 6 and at 12 months will be compared to the result of the baseline measure as well as to each other.</description>
