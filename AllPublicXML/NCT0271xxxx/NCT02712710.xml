      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of functional knee brace in the
      subjects with medial compartment knee OA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 subjects with symptomatic medial compartment knee OA, with grade 2 to 4 on Kellgren and
      Lawrence scale, and showing willing to wear a functional knee brace will be recruited into
      this study. Another 20 subjects with comparable body height, weight, and sex will be served
      as a control group. All of the subjects received 4 weeks' rehabilitation treatment (3 times a
      week). VAS pain score, WOMAC index, and SF-36 will be evaluated before the treatment, and 1
      month, and 3 months after the start of treatment. Patients' satisfaction will be evaluated at
      1 month, and 3 months after start of treatment. Patients' compliance and any adverse events
      due to wearing of the functional knee brace will also be reported. A 2-by-3, 2-way
      mixed-model analysis of variance, which had 1 between-subject factor (group: knee brace + PT
      and PT only) and 1 within subject factor (evaluation time:T0, T1, T2) , was performed.
      Pair-wise comparisons between groups were performed using an independent t test (if in normal
      distribution) or Mann-Whitney U test (if not in normal distribution). Investigators
      hypothesize that addition of a functional knee brace would improve rehabilitation outcome in
      subjects with knee OA.

    <description>To the severity of the pain patients experience pain in itself to make a quantitative expression, assessment methods as follows: a horizontal line 10 cm in length, with zero as the most left office, on behalf of completely pain-free; the far right of the line can imagine the most severe pain, subjects were at rest and walking, according to their degree of sense of pain marked on the straight line. Reliability of this scale up to 0.94.</description>

    <measure>WOMAC index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC Index) is the most commonly used assessment study of knee osteoarthritis by functional scales, including pain, stiffness and function of physical activity and other three items. You can use the record score VAS (visual analog scale) or scale from 0 to 4 five scale. A total of 24 projects, of which pain part 5 projects, while the stiffness and joint function. 2 and 17 projects each. The total score of 100 points, higher scores indicate worse situation. WOMAC for assessing knee osteoarthritis has good reliability and validity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire that evaluates the quality of life. It is composed of 8 subscales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each subscale has a score range of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better health status.Patient's evaluation of the treatment effect. Patient's evaluation of the treatment effect consists of the answer to one question: &quot;Is the treatment effective?&quot; scored on a Likert scale (very effective=1, effective=2, not effective=3, worse=4, much worse=5).</description>
