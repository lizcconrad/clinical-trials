      The purpose of this study is to determine if AC-1204 is safe and tolerated in subjects with
      ALS. The reason why the investigator wants to use AC-1204 in patients with ALS is to
      determine if, by taking AC-1204, the body will make substances called ketone bodies. Further,
      if AC-1204 is well tolerated, the investigators want to change the amount the participant
      takes, to determine if the amount of ketone bodies in the blood increase in accordance with
      increases in the amount of AC-1204 the participant takes. The investigators want to do this
      study because when the investigators gave AC-1204 to mice with ALS, findings suggest the
      disease course is altered for the better and that the cause of this change is due to the
      presence of ketones in the blood. If AC-1204 can be proven to be safe and able to cause
      ketones to increase in the blood, the investigators will likely do subsequent studies to
      determine if the presence of ketone bodies will slow or stop the progression of the disease.
      However, this study is not designed to determine if AC-1204 will stop or slow the progression
      of ALS. It is designed to only determine if patients with ALS can tolerate AC-1204, if ketone
      bodies are produced and if the amount of ketone bodies produced increases with increasing
      dose.
