    <textblock>
      SARC021C is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, continuation study designed to provide
      access to TH-302 for patients currently receiving and benefiting from single agent TH-302
      therapy as part of the Phase III TH-CR-406/SARC021 study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to provide continuation therapy with TH-302 to patients with soft
      tissue sarcomas who obtained response or stabilization of disease with prior treatment on
      TH-CR-406/SARC021 protocol. After written informed consent has been obtained and eligibility
      has been established, patients will receive the study drug as part of the continuation study.
      Patients will receive treatment on study as long as they have clinical benefit and do not
      experience unacceptable toxicity.
