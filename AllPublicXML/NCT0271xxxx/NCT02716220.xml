             have to be de novo lesions.

          7. Reference vessel diameter between 2.7-3.8 mm by visual estimation, depending on the
             scaffold size used.

          8. Target lesion length by visual estimation, assisted by QCA: &lt; 21 mm, depending on the
             scaffold size used.

             diabetes mellitus)

         21. Proximal or distal to the target lesion located stenosis that might require future
             revascularization or impede run off detected during diagnostic angiography

         22. Life expectancy less than 1 year, or other co-morbidities (e.g. Sepsis, Apoplexy or
             TIA within 6 months prior to the study procedure) (Co-morbidities definitions will be
             left to the discretion of the Study Investigators)

         23. Planned surgery or dental surgical procedure within 6 months after index procedure
