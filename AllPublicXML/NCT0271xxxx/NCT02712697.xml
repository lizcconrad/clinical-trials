      The present study was designed to identify the efficacy and safety of Integrative Medicine by
      joint oral steroid medicine on liver-kidney yin deficiency, severe IgA nephropathy.
      Furthermore, search for potential diagnostic predictor in IgA Nephropathy by Proteomics and
      Metabolomics. Combined with TCM Syndrome research, the investigators will clarify targets or
      mechanisms of herbal treatment. Eventually, to form a more clinically appropriate
      standardized combination treatment of severe IgA nephropathy.
