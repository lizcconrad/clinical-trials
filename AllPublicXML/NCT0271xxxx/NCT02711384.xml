      Introduction: Sevoflurane is the most volatile anesthetic used during CPB. In addition to the
      cardioprotective effect, Sevoflurane also promotes reduction in systemic vascular resistance
      and also an important role in anesthesia maintenance during surgery, preventing patients
      awaken in the intraoperative. To avoid the awakening during surgery, assessment of the level
      of consciousness through the bispectral index (BIS) has been the most common method used by
      anesthesiologists. During cardiac surgery the most critical moment may be the patient is
      awaken during the warm up phase of CPB. The monitoring of this phase with the BIS has become
      efficient as to alert the anesthetist that the patient may be waking up.

      Aims: The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the ideal minimum dose of
      sevoflurane (ED 95) that 95% of patients undergoing anesthesia during CPB in cardiac surgery
      have no intraoperative awareness.

      Methodology: Dixon's up-and-down technique is a commonly used method to define MAC (27-30).
      The anesthetic concentration applied to the first patient is estimated by clinical
      experience. If there BIS values below 50, the concentration of inhalational anesthetic in
      subsequent patient is decreased by 20%. If the BIS show values greater than or equal to 50
      for a period ≥ 1 minute steadily, the concentration is increased by 20% in the next patient.
      In each series of patients, the pairs of independent cross in order measurements are
      identified. Logistic regression is used to determine the ideal minimum dose of sevoflurane
      (ED 95) that 95% of patients undergoing anesthesia during CPB in cardiac surgery have no
      intraoperative awareness.

      Introduction Some studies showed evidence of cardio-protection and reduction in mortality due
      to the use of volatile agents during cardiac surgery. (1) These findings seems to be
      associated when the volatile agents are used during all the surgical procedure, including the
      period of CPB. (2) Sevoflurane is the most volatile anesthetic used during CPB. In addition
      to the cardioprotective effect, Sevoflurane also promotes reduction in systemic vascular
      resistance (4.5) and also an important role in anesthesia maintenance during surgery,
      preventing patients awaken in the intraoperative (6.7). To avoid the awakening during
      surgery, assessment of the level of consciousness through the bispectral index (BIS) has been
      the most common method used by anesthesiologists. During cardiac surgery the most critical
      moment may be the patient is awaken during the warm up phase of CPB. The monitoring of this
      phase with the BIS has become efficient as to alert the anesthetist that the patient may be
      waking up. (3) In addition, several studies have been trying to find what is the ideal
      minimum dose of inhaled anesthetics that 95% of patients do not awaken during some surgical
      procedures (ED 95). (8-25). However, there are no studies that demonstrate what is the ideal
      minimum dose of inhaled anesthetics used during CPB in cardiac surgery, so patients do not
      have any conscience at this stage. Case we have this information, even when it is not
      possible to monitor the level of consciousness using the BIS, the risk for patients to awaken
      during the intraoperative period, especially the CEC, would become significantly reduced.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the ideal minimum dose of sevoflurane (ED
      95) that 95% of patients undergoing anesthesia during CPB in cardiac surgery have no
      intraoperative awareness. Secondary endpoints include neurocognitive assessment using the
      Mini Mental Test; Intraoperative assessment of memory; time of endotracheal intubation (OTI);
      length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU); and hospital stay.

      Methodology

      Selection and randomization of patients Upon approval by the Research Ethics Committee of the
      Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology (IDPC), eligible patients will be addressed by the
      researcher for the study. All patients participating in this study must sign a consent form.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients with physical status ASA II to III undergoing first elective cardiac surgery for
      mitral and / or tricuspid valve with cardiopulmonary bypass undergoing general anesthesia;

      Exclusion criteria:

      Patients with contraindications to the study drugs; Reoperations cardiac surgery; History of
      psychiatric or neurological disease, drug abuse, or drugs known to affect the central nervous
      system; Pregnancy; Emergency procedures; Neuraxial blockade;

      Anesthetic technique The techniques used for anesthesia, surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass
      follow the practice routine of the institution. Patients will receive 5 mg of Midazolam IM as
      Preanesthetic medication 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia. Routine monitoring will
      include electrocardiogram five derivations and pulse oximetry. Before induction of
      anesthesia, a radial artery catheter will be inserted along with the monitoring BIS (BIS
      Vista ™; Covidien). Anesthesia is induced with 0.3 µg/kg sufentanil and 0.2-0.3 mg/kg
      etomidate based on the physical condition of the patient. Muscle relaxation is obtained using
      0.1 mg/kg pancuronium. After tracheal intubation, a central venous catheter is inserted into
      the subclavian vein. The temperature of the patient will be monitored by a thermometer in the
      esophagus. Anesthesia will be maintained with bolus Sufentanil according to the patient's
      need and Sevoflurane to 1 MAC expired fraction. Mechanical ventilation will be maintained at
      Drager apparatus (Primus model) with the following parameters: tidal volume of 8 ml/kg,
      respiratory rate 12 ipm, PEEP of 5 cm H2O in ventilation mode controlled volume. Before the
      insertion of the aortic cannula, patients will be anti-coagulated with heparin (400 units /
      kg) and subjected to a muscular relaxation with 0.05 mg/kg pancuronium.

      CPB circuit The CPB circuit contains a roller pump, and a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator
      microporous polypropylene (PPL), with a rigid venous reservoir. The bypass circuit will be
      prepared using 1,400 ml of saline solution 0.9%, 100 ml Albumin 20% and 5,000 units of
      Heparin. After heparinization, the surgeon will make cannulation of the aorta artery followed
      by cannulation of veins upper and lower Cavas, respectively. During CPB, the patient's
      temperature is maintained at 35 ° C with the valve replacement procedure performed with
      intermittent cross-clamping. The pH-stat system for analysis of blood gases is utililizado to
      control the acid-base balance in all patients. The target blood flow during cardiopulmonary
      bypass would be 2.4 liters / min / m2 and is increased to 3.2 liters / min / m2 in order to
      maintain the central venous oxygen saturation above 75%. The activated clotting time will be
      at least 480 s during the infusion. The fresh gas flow rate in the supply of gas to the
      oxygenator will be adapted by the perfusionist to maintain arterial carbon dioxide from 30 to
      35 mmHg. The concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture delivered to the oxygenator will be
      30-80% depending on the partial pressure of arterial oxygen at a partial pressure of oxygen
      above the target of 80 mmHg measured at oxygenated blood flow.

      During CPB, including the rewarming phase of the patient (normothermia time - temperature
      ranging from 36 to 37.5 ° C), end tidal sevoflurane concentration will be maintained in
      accordance with the preview-set value by Up-and-Down method Dixon studied for each patient.
      During this period will be evaluated BIS value constantly. During CPB, no intravenous
      anesthetic drug will be used until it is needed with the BIS values ≥ 50 for a period ≥ 1
      minute.

      After rewarming, the surgeon will proceed to remove air from the cardiac cavities and ending
      CPB. Reversal of Heparin will be conducted with Protamine (reversal of 80% of the heparin
      dose).

      Dixon's up-and-down technique Dixon's up-and-down technique is a commonly used method to
      define MAC (27-30). The anesthetic concentration applied to the first patient is estimated by
      clinical experience. If there BIS values below 50, the concentration of inhalational
      anesthetic in subsequent patient is decreased by 20%. If the BIS show values greater than or
      equal to 50 for a period ≥ 1 minute steadily, the concentration is increased by 20% in the
      next patient. In each series of patients, the pairs of independent cross in order
      measurements are identified. A pair of cross consists of two consecutive patients where there
      is a BIS value below 50 in the first but not the second patient, or vice versa. Each patient
      was considered only for one single cross-over pair in order to assure independent test data.
      Six independent cross-over pairs and +/- 10 changes in direction are required to obtain
      reliable results (26).

      Statistical analysis

      Logistic regression is used to determine the ideal minimum dose of sevoflurane (ED 95) that
      95% of patients undergoing anesthesia during CPB in cardiac surgery have no intraoperative
      awareness. The level of consciousness will be evaluated maintaining the value of the
      bispectral index (BIS) below 50 during CPB. The probability of BS (p) is modelled in terms of
      log odds by a linear function of the independent explanatory variable 'measured
      concentration' X by a logistic regression:

      log [p/(1-p)] = A + B x X

      where A (intercept) and B (regression slope) are the model parameters. The solution of 0,95 =
      exp (A + B x X) / [1 + exp (A + B x X)] results in the MAC value estimation. To quantify
      uncertainty of the MAC values, 95% percentile bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) were used.
      Statistical evaluation and figures were performed using R (R Development Core Team,
      http://www.r-project.org/percentile) e IBM SPSS.
