  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of different
      formulations of GSK Biologicals' influenza candidate vaccine GSK1557484A, in children 6-35
      months of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safety and immunogenicity of different formulations administered as a 2-dose schedule in
      children 6-35 months of age will be evaluated. In addition, the quality of the 2-dose priming
      will be assessed through the anamnestic response elicited by an antigen challenge
      (unadjuvanted H5N1) administered 12 months later. The persistence of the immune response
      approximately 12 months (Day 385) after dose 2 will also be evaluated.

      Subjects from each group will be enrolled into the CMI sub-cohort comprising of approximately
      100 subjects. Within the participating country(ies), these subjects will be enrolled in only
      selected/qualified sites.

             assessments have been performed.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine; a history of anaphylactic-type reaction to consumption of eggs; or a
             history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.

          -  Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make
             intramuscular injection unsafe.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during
             the period starting six months prior to the first vaccine. For corticosteroids, this
             will mean a dose of prednisone or equivalent of &gt; 2 mg/kg/day of body weight or ≥ 20
             mg/day (for persons who weigh ≥ 10 kg). Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  Major congenital defects.
