  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study examining the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intranasal oxytocin
      as a novel treatment in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS). This study will utilize a randomized,
      placebo-controlled design for 12 weeks (phase 1), followed by an open-label extension for 12
      weeks (phase 2). The purpose is to evaluate the effect of intranasal oxytocin on impairments
      in attention, social memory, socialization, language, and repetitive behaviors.

    <measure>Visual Paired Comparison (VPC) Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scale at week 12 as compared to baseline. The subject is initially presented with a target for familiarization and the familiar target is then paired with a novel target. Recognition is indexed by a novelty score derived from the percentage of time looking at the novel stimulus vs. the familiar stimulus.</description>

    <measure>Gap-Overlap Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>One of three computerized eye tracking tasks to measure attention. three computer screens are set up side by side. A stimulus initially appears on the central screen, and once the participant orients to that stimulus, another stimulus will appear on one of the lateral screens. In the &quot;gap&quot; condition, the central stimulus will disappear before the peripheral stimulus appears. In the &quot;overlap&quot; condition, the central stimulus will remain on the screen while the peripheral stimulus appears. In both conditions, reaction times of the participant's eye movements (saccadic reaction time) from the central stimulus to the peripheral stimulus will be measured.</description>

    <description>The first phase of the study will follow a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Participants randomized to the experimental group will receive intranasal oxytocin in doses of 24 IU, two times daily, for a total of 48 IU. Doses may be reduced by 8 IU/day if safety concerns emerge. During the second phase of the study, all participants will receive oxytocin, in identical doses.</description>
