    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study to investigate the
      pharmacodynamics(24 hour gastric pH) and the safety between repeated doses of CDFR0209 and
      Losec in Healthy Male Volunteers

      Eligibility for participation of this study was determined from demographic information,
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
      within 4 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study were
      admitted to the Clinical Trial Center of Ajou University Medical Center on the 2 day before
      dosing (Day -2).

      On Day -1 around 8 AM, ambulatory intragastric pH recording was performed using ZepHr® pH
      Monitoring System (Sandhill Scientific, Inc., Highlands Ranch, CO, USA) without dosing for 24
      hours.

      On Day 1, subjects was dosed Losec 40 mg or CDFR0209 (Omeprazole 40 mg &amp; sodium bicarbonate
      1,100 mg) around 8 AM and ambulatory intragastric pH recording was continued upto 24 hours
      after dosing.

      From Day 2 ~ 6, subjects were dosed Losec 40 mg or CDFR0209 around 8 AM. On Day 7, subjects
      was dosed Losec 40 mg or CDFR0209 (Omeprazole 40 mg &amp; sodium bicarbonate 1,100 mg) around 8
      AM and ambulatory intragastric pH recording was performed upto 24 hours after dosing.

      After 14 days of washout period, subjects was dosed Losec 40 mg or CDFR0209 by crossover
      manner and ambulatory intragastric pH recording was performed.
