  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a complex disease with a cluster of risk factors and clinical
      features, which includes central or abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, impaired
      glucose regulation, hyperinsulinemia, high blood pressure, and concomitance of
      pro-inflammatory cytokine and insulin resistance. Glucomannan (GM) is a water-soluble dietary
      fiber derived from the root of Amorphophallus konjac that can improve blood sugar, blood fat
      concentration, and weight management, and has other health benefits.The purposes of this
      study are going to investigate the effects of KGM noodle (KGN) as stable food to MS and
      diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The KGN diet was composed of well-cooked noodle with 2 g of KGM in a dosage of 200 g/piece
      twice daily to substitute the daily carbohydrate for 4 weeks, with a 2-week washout period
      between alternative diets. All 33 subjects received two servings of either GMNs or PNs (400
      g) per day, which replaced the main carbohydrate in two daily meals for 4 weeks. After a
      2-week washout period, the subjects received the other type of noodle for 4 weeks. The body
      weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile, as well as serum
      vitamin A, E, Î²-carotene and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CPR) were measured by
      HPCL.
