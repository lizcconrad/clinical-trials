      The study will evaluate interventions to improve engagement in HIV care following HIV
      diagnosis through a voluntary counseling and testing program. The specific aims are to (1)
      determine if a VCT-based intervention of CD4 count testing, alone or in combination with peer
      counseling, improves linkage to HIV/AIDS care; (2) assess the impact of the intervention on
      ART initiation. The study will recruit 450 HIV-positive individuals from VCTs and randomize a
      third to standard counseling and referral, a third to receive CD4 testing at the VCT with
      results return by phone after 1 weeks, and a third to receive the same CD4 testing combined
      with peer counseling. These combined investigations will create a comprehensive understanding
      of obstacles to appropriate HIV/AIDS care and result in new interventions to achieve
      measurable outcomes in applied settings.
