      This study aimed to evaluate effectiveness of initial limb rehabilitation compare therapy
      took place within 48h with therapy took place after 48h for patients with stroke (modified
      Rankin Scale Score 3-4).

      Early rehabilitation after stroke is thought to contribute to the effects of stroke-unit
      care. However, time of initial rehabilitation therapy is poorly defined and not underpinned
      by strong evidence in patients with stroke (modified Rankin Scale Score 3-4). The
      investigators do this parallel-group, single-blind, randomized controlled trial in shengjing
      hospital of China Medical University. Participants (aged≥18 years) with ischaemic or
      haemorrhagic stroke, first or recurrent, who meet physiological criteria are randomly
      assigned (1:1), to receive usual stroke therapy. Treatment with recombinant tissue
      plasminogen activator is allowed. Randomisation is stratified by study site and stroke
      severity. The primary outcome was a outcome 3 months after stroke, defined as a modified
      Rankin Scale score of 3-4. The investigators do analysis on an intention-to-treat basis.
