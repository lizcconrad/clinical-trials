  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and subject and investigator
      satisfaction of 2 different injection volumes of Dysport in the glabellar lines.

        1. To determine the proportion of composite responders (based on blinded evaluator and
           subject assessments) who achieve at least a 1-point reduction from baseline in glabellar
           line severity score (GLSS) at maximum frown line on Day 30.

        2. To assess the GLSS, at maximum frown and at rest, by live assessment at all visits.

        3. To evaluate the onset of effect on appearance of glabellar lines starting at the Day 2
           visit (subject and blinded evaluator).

        4. To assess the subject's satisfaction with the treatment.

        5. To evaluate investigator satisfaction of treatment outcome.

        6. To evaluate subject psychological well-being.

        7. To evaluate subject age appraisal.

        8. To evaluate all adverse events during the course of the study.
