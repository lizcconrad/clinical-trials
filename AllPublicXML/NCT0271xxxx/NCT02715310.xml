      In order to estimate the effect of fluid management in regard to postoperative complications
      this observatory study will document every kind of fluid intervention peri- and
      intraoperatively.

      The extend of mass transfusions is known to correlate with postoperative complications.
      However, also crystalloid and colloidal infusions are under suspicion to cause postoperative
      complications. This study will capture any kind of fluid intervention perioperatively as well
      as intraoperatively. Intraoperative fluid management will be documented and matched with the
      operation steps respectively. The extend of fluid therapy will be correlated with general
      postoperative complications and especially with the survival of microvascular transplants.

      For this purpose, there will be four questionaires. After informed consent, the first
      questionaire will cover the patient's history, risk factors and previous operations. The
      second questionaire will cover intraoperative fluid management, documented with the actual
      operation step. Furthermore, it will also intraoperative complications, cardiovascular-active
      medication. For closer monitoring, data from Picco will also be included. The third
      questionaire will be complete in the ICU covering similar content as the second questionaire.
      The last questionaire will cover the patient's progress on the general ward. Fluid management
      and tube feeding, as well as general postoperative complication and flap specific
      complications will be noted.

      This study aims for 50-80 patients.
