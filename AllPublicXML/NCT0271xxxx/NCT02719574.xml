  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of FT-2102 as a single
      agent or in combination with azacitidine or cytarabine. The Phase 1 stage of the study is
      split into 2 distinct parts: a dose escalation part, which will utilize an open-label design
      of FT-2102 (single agent) and FT-2102 + azacitidine (combination agent) administered via one
      or more intermittent dosing schedules followed by a dose expansion part. The dose expansion
      part will enroll patients in up to 5 expansion cohorts, exploring single-agent FT-2102
      activity as well as combination activity with azacitidine or cytarabine. Following the
      completion of Phase 1, Phase 2 will begin enrollment. Patients will be enrolled across 6
      different cohorts, examining the effect of FT-2102 (as a single agent) and FT-2102 +
      azacitidine (combination) on various AML/MDS disease states.
