  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral expressions, such as agitation and aggression, affect up to 90% of persons with
      dementia and are a major source of patient and caregiver distress, nursing home placement,
      anti-psychotic medication use, restraints, and increased health care costs. The purpose of
      the research study is to investigate whether reducing pain reduces behavioral expressions of
      Alzheimer's disease (agitation and aggression).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research study will investigate if routine analgesic use will reduce behavioral
      expressions of dementia and pain in older adults with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.
      Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design, the investigators
      will compare effects of a routine acetaminophen intervention (650 mg administered routinely
      by mouth three times per day for 4 weeks) to those of routine placebo (methylcellulose), also
      given for 4 weeks. The maximum dose to be administered will be 1,950 mg per 24 hours, which
      is below the current FDA recommendations (maximum dose of 3,000 mg/day).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either treatment or placebo group. The initial
      treatment phase will last for 4 weeks. At the end of the first 4 weeks, the treatment will be
      reversed after a 3 day washout period. During the 2nd intervention period, the study drug
      will be reversed (those receiving acetaminophen will receive the placebo drug and vice
      versa). The second treatment phase will last for 4 weeks. At the end of 2nd treatment phase,
      all study treatments will be discontinued

    <measure>Mobilization-Observation-Behaviour-Intensity-Dementia Pain Scale (MOBID-2) will be used for changes between the groups at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MOBID-2 is a two-part, observational pain behavior measure. Part 1 assesses pain related to the musculoskeletal system (the most common cause of pain in older adults) during a set of standardized, guided movements during morning care (5 items). Part 2 assesses pain that might originate from internal organs, head, and skin and is monitored over time (5 items). If a pain behavior is detected, pain intensity is rated using a 0-10 numerical rating scale.</description>

    <measure>Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) will be used for changes between the groups at baseline, weeks 2,4, 6 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CMAI is a 29-item instrument designed to measure the frequency with which persons with dementia display agitation and other behavioral disturbances. The measure consists of 4 subscales that measure aggressive behavior (hitting, scratching, cursing), physical non-aggressive behavior (pacing, restlessness, disrobing), verbally agitated behavior (complaining, repetitive questions, negativism) and hiding/hoarding. Item frequency is scored on a 1 to 7 scale, with (1) = never, (2) = &lt; once per week, (3) once or twice per week, (4) several times per week, (5) once or twice per day, (6) several times per day, or (7) several times per hour. Total scores range from 29-203.</description>
