  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of a multicomponent intervention,
      applied during one scholar semester, on body composition, strength, flexibility,
      cardiorespiratory fitness, lipid and metabolic profile, and body image of students from sixth
      to ninth grade. This is a non-randomized controlled design. Approximately 568 schoolchildren
      of grades sixth through ninth were recruited from 2 public secondary schools in
      Florianópolis, Brazil. The main component of the intervention entitled &quot;MEXA-SE&quot; (move
      yourself) consisted of the implementation of three physical education classes per week with
      aerobic exercises, strength and flexibility activities. In addition, play activities in
      school recess, and educational activities on physical activity, sedentary behaviour, eating
      habits and body image were performed. Data collection was performed before and immediately
      after 14 weeks of intervention. The primary outcomes included the body composition, strength,
      flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, lipid and metabolic profile, and body image. Other
      variables included were: physical activity level, sedentary behaviour, and blood pressure
      level. Other components of the lifestyle (e.g., eating habits), psychological (e.g.,
      self-rated health) also were evaluated in the participants. Descriptive analysis, two-way
      ANOVA for mixed models and ANCOVA will be applied for within and between comparison groups,
      if the premises of this test are met. The level of significance for the study was 5% for
      two-tailed tests.

    <description>MEXA-SE (move yourself) was structured into three main components: A) Physical fitness: The first component was to increase time in moderate to vigorous physical activity during Physical Education lessons. There were also prompts to help students to engage in increased physical activity during school recess; B) Eating habits: The second component consisted of six sessions (45 minutes per session) designed to promote reflection and positive changes in eating habits and health care (to improve knowledge and eating habits), conducted by nutritionist; C) Body image: The third component was composed of 3 sessions (45 minutes per session) focused on body image satisfaction (&quot;Espelho, espelho meu&quot;: School based Intervention) conducted by Physical Education researcher.</description>

    <description>Behavioral: &quot;Espelho, espelho meu&quot;: School based intervention on body image. Body image is worked in four 45 minutes sessions, conducted with a frequency of once a week by a researcher. The topics covered in these sessions refer to: Beauty Standards (media influence and formation of body image), individual qualities (individual and classmates qualities) and selfesteem. These meetings will be held through video, lecture, dynamics, photo sessions and preparation of posters.</description>
