  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates topical loperamide 5% gel in reducing pain during repeat finger lancing
      (finger stick) in healthy adults. Half of participants received 5% loperamide gel applied to
      their fingertip prior to their second lance and the other half received the gel only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lancing the finger and heel to obtain capillary blood for specimen collection and diagnostic
      testing is a painful and tissue damaging procedure. With each lance, there is direct splicing
      of capillaries along with free nerve endings resulting in an immediate localized pain
      response and hyperalgesia from the release of pain producing substances. Opioid agonists
      (morphine, fentanyl, loperamide) have demonstrated significant analgesia when locally
      injected or topically applied to a site of inflammation/injury in animal models.

      Loperamide, a piperdine derivative with a structure similar to the synthetic opioid
      meperidine, has strong affinity for Mu opioid receptors. It was approved by the FDA in 1969
      as an anti-diarrheal agent with Mu opioid activity mimicked the constipating effects of other
      opioids, but with markedly reduced CNS effects due to its affinity for p-glycoprotein,
      preventing crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) under normal circumstances.

      This prospective, double-blind, repeated measures, randomized investigational new drug trial
      used loperamide developed as a topical gel in 34 adult participants to determine its
      analgesic effects during repeat finger lancing. The investigators also assessed for any local
      skin reaction to the gel application and for any constipation or abdominal cramping which
      might be evidence of systemic absorption and Mu opioid agonist activity on the gut.

      This study would be applicable for use in 28.9 million adults who are diabetic and require
      finger lancing for blood glucose monitoring and the high risk newborn population who require
      repeat heel lancing for specimen collection.

Sensitivity questions adapted from the pain quality assessment scale, please tell us how sensitive your fingerstick site has been to light touch or clothing rubbing against it over the past day (0=non-sensitive; 1-sensitive); Please tell us how tender your fingerstick site is when something has pressed against it in the past day (0=not tender and 1=tender)</description>

    <description>Participants received 5% loperamide gel (0.2gm equivalent to 10 mg) applied following a single surgilance to the 5th digit. The loperamide gel was applied 10 minutes following the first lance, rubbed in for one minute within an 8 mm mold surrounding the lance site. The mold was removed and the gel was covered with a transparent occlusive dressing and left in place for 30 minutes. The forearm was also swabbed with the loperamide gel which was left in place for 30 minutes. The placebo gel contained the same ingredients without the loperamide. The loperamide gel formulation includes: Loperamide 5%, Propylene Glycol; Ethanol (190 proof USP); Ethyl acetate; and Klucel HF 1%.</description>
