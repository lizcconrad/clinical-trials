    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the hypoallergenicity of a new thickened extensively
      hydrolyzed formula, in infants with confirmed cow's milk protein allergy assessed through a
      double blind placebo controlled food challenge, followed by a 3-month open feeding period.
