    <textblock>
      A staging system was defined based on morphological extent of disease (stage I to stage IV
      for primary disease, and stage R for recurrent disease). Specific surgical technique was used
      for each stage. Demographics, perioperative data, short-term and long-term outcomes were
      evaluated according to the disease stage.

      The collected data of patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of pilonidal sinus
      disease prior to June 2011 were analyzed. Following this analysis, a staging system was
      defined based on morphological extent of disease (stage I to stage IV for primary disease,
      and stage R for recurrent disease). Specific surgical technique was used for each stage.
      &quot;Pit-picking&quot; technique was performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis in stage
      I and stage IIa patients. For stage IIb and stage III patients, the Bascom Cleft Lift
      /modified Bascom Cleft Lift techniques were performed. For stage IV patients, the rhomboid
      excision with the Limberg flap technique was used. Demographics, perioperative data,
      short-term and long-term outcomes were evaluated according to the disease stage.

    <description>Complications were classified as infection (superficial or deep), collection (seroma or hematoma), wound dehiscence (partial or complete), or anesthesia-related complications. complications will be reviewed from time of surgery to the end of healing. percentage of participants with any wound complication will be evaluated as patients with complication.</description>

    <intervention_name>pit-picking technique</intervention_name>
    <description>midline pits were excised removing a minimal amount of tissue (with a margin of skin of &lt;1 mm). Incision of 1-2 cm in length was performed parallel to the most convenient side of the midline to be curetted of the chronic abscess cavity. All infected granulation tissue and hair were removed. After establishing hemostasis, the area of the excised midline pits was approximated by absorbable sutures.</description>

    <intervention_name>Bascom Cleft Lift</intervention_name>
    <description>The upper end of the incision was made 1-2 cm lateral to the midline on the more affected side and this was continued vertically over a distance of 1-2 mm from the midline pits. The lower end was fashioned from the midline in a V-shape in order to prevent a dog-ear deformity. The skin on this side of the natal cleft was then elevated and excised. The skin on the opposite side was undermined to the distance required to allow primary closure of the defect away from the midline without tension. Sinus tissue and its extensions were excised. The incision was then closed subcuticularly by absorbable polyglecaprone (3-0), after which a few interrupted mattress polyglecaprone (3-0) buttress sutures were also inserted.</description>

    <description>The area to be excised was mapped on the skin in a rhomboid form, and the flap was designed. The skin incision was deepened to the postsacral fascia. The flap was fully mobilized and transposed medially to fill the defect without tension. The wound was closed in two layers: the subcutaneous tissue with absorbable (2/0 polyglactin) sutures and the skin with nonabsorbable (3/0 polypropylene) interrupted mattress suture</description>
