      The primary purpose of the study is to compare the rate of hospitalization associated with
      psychotic relapse in participants with schizophrenia treated one year before with oral
      antipsychotics and one year after with long acting injectable atypical antipsychotics.

      This is a retrospective (take a look back at events that already have taken place),
      observational, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study) study to review medical records of adults with a diagnosis of
      Schizophrenia during the time period from 01 January 2009 through 31-December-2013 (only for
      Mexican population). Data will be collected from clinical practice. The medical records of
      participants will be screened and eligible participants data will be collected. The period of
      observation will span from 12 months before initial Long Acting Injectable (LAI) use and in
      12 months after the initial LAIs use. The rate of hospitalization will be primarily
      evaluated.

    <description>This is an observational study. Data will be collected from the medical records of participants diagnosed with schizophrenia and who had been on oral antipsychotics for at least one year and thereafter have been switched to Long Acting Injectable atypical antipsychotics for at least one year.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Out-Patients with the main diagnosis of schizophrenia with Diagnostic and Statistical
             Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-4 criteria)

          -  Only clinical records with complete information during the 2 years period selected for
             data analysis will be included

          -  Participants treated with oral antipsychotics then switched to Long Acting Injectable
             (LAI) due to poor adherence, lack of efficacy (no significant symptom reduction,
             judged by physician, at maximum recommended dose of an antipsychotic for 6 weeks), or
             participants choice, (Excluding for the Brazil population, when the switch has not
             been clearly justified or the switch has not been done during hospitalization)

          -  Being regularly treated with LAI atypical antipsychotics for at least 1 year after the
             initial use of LAI atypical antipsychotics

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with refractory schizophrenia (RS)

          -  Participants that started LAI treatment as in-patients and patients that switched to
             LAI during hospitalization (only for Mexican population).
