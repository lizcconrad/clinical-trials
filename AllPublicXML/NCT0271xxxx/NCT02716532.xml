      This study will be targeting patients suffering from acute brain injury (ABI), including
      those with severe trauma brain injury (sTBI) and those with aneurysmal sub arachnoid
      hemorrhage (aSAH).

      This clinical study is an open-label, non-randomized, single-center, exploratory metabolic
      study.

      The primary objective is to determine changes from baseline (before enteral administration of
      Peptamen AF) in plasma and brain extracellular levels of MCFAs and Ketone bodies in sTBI
      patients upon Peptamen AF nutritional support.
