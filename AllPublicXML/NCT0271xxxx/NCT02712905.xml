  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study of INCB059872 in subjects with
      advanced malignancies. The study will be conducted in 4 parts. Part 1 (mono therapy dose
      escalation) will determine the recommended dose(s) of INCB059872 for dose expansion, based on
      maximum tolerated dose and/or a tolerated pharmacologically active dose. Part 2 (dose
      expansion) will further determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD of the
      selected monotherapy dose(s) in AML/MDS, SCLC, myelofibrosis, Ewing sarcoma, and poorly
      differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Part 3 will determine the recommended dose(s) of
      INCB059872 in combination with azacitadine and all-trans retinoic acid in AML and in
      combination with nivolumab in SCLC. Part 4 will further determine the safety, tolerability,
      efficacy, PK, and PD of the selected combination dose(s) in Part 3.
