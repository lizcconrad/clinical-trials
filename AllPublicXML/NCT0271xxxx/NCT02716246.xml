      Self-complementary adeno-associated virus serotype 9 carrying the human SGSH gene under the
      control of a U1a promoter (scAAV9.U1a.hSGSH) will be delivered one time through a venous
      catheter inserted into a peripheral limb vein. The vector will be delivered undiluted over 5
      to 50 minutes, under light to moderate sedation as needed. Dosing volume will be
      approximately 0.5 to 3 mL/kg, depending on final vector product concentration and subject
      cohort. A tapering course of prophylactic enteral prednisone or prednisolone will be
      administered

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 6 months old or greater

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of MPS IIIA by either of two methods:

          -  No detectable or significantly reduced* SGSH enzyme activity by leukocyte or
             fibroblast assay.

          -  Genomic DNA analysis demonstrating homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
             the SGSH gene

          -  Clinical history or examination features of neurologic dysfunction

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to participate in the clinical evaluation as determined by PI

          -  Identification of two nonsense or null variants on genetic testing of the SGSH gene,
             as judged by the principal investigator

          -  Has evidence of an attenuated phenotype of MPS IIIA, as judged by the principal
             investigator

          -  Presence of a concomitant medical condition that precludes lumbar puncture or use of
             anesthetics

          -  Inability to be safely sedated in the opinion of the clinical anesthesiologist

          -  Active viral infection based on clinical observations

          -  Concomitant illness or requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of
             the PI creates unnecessary risks for gene transfer

          -  Subjects with anti-AAV9 antibody titers ≥ 1:100 as determined by ELISA binding
             immunoassay

          -  Serology consistent with exposure to HIV, or serology consistent with active hepatitis
             B or C infection

          -  Bleeding disorder or any other medical condition or circumstance in which a lumbar
             puncture (for collection of CSF) is contraindicated according to local institutional
             policy

          -  Visual or hearing impairment sufficient to preclude cooperation with
             neurodevelopmental testing

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder, due to the requirement for multiple MRI examinations as
             part of the study protocol. Subjects who are stable on anticonvulsive medications may
             be included

          -  Any item (braces, etc.) which would exclude the patient from being able to undergo MRI
             according to local institutional policy

          -  Any other situation that would exclude the patient from undergoing any other procedure
             required in this study

          -  Patients with cardiomyopathy or significant congenital heart abnormalities

          -  The presence of significant non-MPS IlIA related CNS impairment or behavioral
             disturbances that would confound the scientific rigor or interpretation of results of
             the study

          -  Abnormal laboratory values Grade 2 or higher as defined in CTCAE v4.0 for GGT, total
             bilirubin, creatinine, hemoglobin, WBC count, platelet count, PT and aPTT

          -  Female participant who is pregnant or demonstrates a positive urine or bhCG result at
             screening assessment (if applicable).

               -  Due to the nature of enzyme activity testing, normal ranges and reported units
                  vary from lab to lab. Many laboratories utilize control samples rather than
                  normal ranges, to account for the influence of small day-to-day fluctuations in
                  the laboratory environment.

               -  For the purposes of invitation to a screening visit, we will accept
                  &quot;significantly reduced&quot; results as those interpreted as such by any clinical
                  laboratory approved to perform this diagnostic test.

        For uniformity of data for analysis, and confirmation of accurate diagnosis before gene
        transfer, subjects who consent to complete the screening visit will have their blood drawn
        for confirmatory enzyme activity level to be performed by Greenwood Genetics Center
        Biochemical Laboratory. Subjects must have an enzyme activity level considered to be in the
        affected range by Greenwood Genetic Center Biochemical Laboratory to proceed within the
        study.
