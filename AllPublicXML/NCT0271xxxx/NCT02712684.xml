    <textblock>
      In men who require a prostate biopsy does a multi-parametric ultrasound based diagnostic
      strategy compared to a multi-parametric MRI based diagnostic strategy lead to similar
      detection of clinically significant prostate cancer?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who require prostate biopsy will be approached and consented to enter this study.
      Participants will all undergo pre-biopsy mp-MRI and mp-USS of the prostate. Only men with
      positive scans will undergo prostate biopsy. The order in which lesions discovered on mp-MRI
      or on mp-USS are sampled will be randomised. All biopsies will be taken via the transperineal
      route in a single procedure. Comparison will be drawn between biopsy results of lesions
      detected by mp-USS with those lesions detected by mp-MRI. Consideration will be given as to
      whether a lesion detected by one imaging modality is the same abnormality as one detected by
      the other imaging modality, in the same patient. Analysis will be carried out at both the
      level of the lesion and the whole prostate. Men without suspicious lesions on either imaging
      modality will not proceed to biopsy.

    <description>The investigators aim to test the hypothesis that multiparametric ultrasound is able to detect clinically significant prostate cancer with an accuracy that is similar to multiparametric MRI. Multi-parametric ultrasound uses different types of ultrasound images to visualise different aspects of the tissue. In other words, the standard grey-scale images shows the gross anatomy, Power Doppler and Contrast enhanced Ultrasound image blood supply (cancers have more blood supply), and Real-Time Elastography images the density of tissue (cancers are more dense).</description>

        Men at or referred to the participating centres who may require a prostate biopsy.
        Referrals will be screened and potential participants contacted by telephone, post or
        email. These men will be given the patient information sheet at least 24 hours before their
        clinic visit, allowing adequate time to consider their desire for involvement
