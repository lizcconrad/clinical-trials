  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if bladder cancer patients can follow a diet and
      exercise program during treatment and whether the program will improve results of their
      treatment.

      This study will examine the effects of a carbohydrate restricted (CR) diet in bladder cancer
      patients with diabetes. The goal of this pilot study is to determine if the CR diet and
      exercise routine are feasible for this patient population to follow.

      Participants in this study will receive meals tailored to their specific needs. A registered
      dietitian will work with them to establish guidelines for the meals and to follow their
      progress throughout the study.

      Participants will be asked to be in this study for up to 12 months. A participant will be
      asked to make a total of 16 in-person visits over the course of 12 months.
