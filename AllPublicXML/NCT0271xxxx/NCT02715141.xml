      Rationale: Since January 2014 the Dutch screening programme for bowel cancer has been
      implemented. Screening will increase the demand for surveillance. Although patients in whom
      adenomas have been removed are at increased risk of progressing to cancer, solid evidence on
      the reduction of death from CRC through the current colonoscopy-based surveillance is
      lacking. Furthermore, colonoscopy-based surveillance leads to high logistic demands, high
      individual burden and high costs. Therefore, there is need for new surveillance strategies.
      Stool-based molecular testing (Cologuard®, consisting of a stool DNA test and an
      immunochemical assay for human hemoglobin) or Faecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT) may serve
      as an alternative for colonoscopy surveillance.

      The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of an established molecular stool test
      (Cologuard®) and FIT to colonoscopy for detection of advanced adenomas or CRC (advanced
      neoplasia) in a surveillance population. These outcomes will be used to model various
      strategies of stool-based molecular surveillance to inform health policy decisions.

      BACKGROUND: Since January 2014 the Dutch screening programme for colorectal carcinoma (CRC)
      has been implemented. Screening will increase the demand for surveillance. However, solid
      evidence on the reduction of death from CRC through the current colonoscopy-based
      surveillance is lacking. Furthermore, colonoscopy-based surveillance leads to high logistic
      demands, high patient burden and high costs. Therefore, there is need for new surveillance
      strategies. Stool-based molecular testing (Cologuard®) or Faecal Immunochemical Testing (FIT)
      may serve as an alternative for colonoscopy surveillance.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To compare the accuracy of an established molecular stool test (Cologuard®) and FIT to
           colonoscopy for detection of advanced adenomas or CRC (advanced neoplasia) in a
           surveillance population.

        2. To model various strategies of stool-based molecular surveillance to inform health
           policy decisions.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational cross-sectional cohort study,
      individuals aged 50-75 years that are scheduled for surveillance colonoscopy will be invited
      to participate. They are asked to collect a whole-stool sample prior to the surveillance
      colonoscopy. The sample will be used to test for the presence of molecular stool markers. The
      results of the molecular stool test and FIT will be compared to the colonoscopy findings.

      EXPECTED RESULTS: Frequent surveillance using stool-based molecular testing is more
      cost-effective than the current colonoscopy-based surveillance.

    <time_frame>Analysis will be performed during the study and approximately 1 year after end of study</time_frame>
    <description>A challenge associated with the use of molecular markers is to find a panel of markers that represents the heterogeneity of the tumour. Therefore it is of interest to analyse whether the markers included in the Cologuard are present in the tissue of resected polyps.</description>

    <measure>presence of previously identified progression biomarker on resected tissue samples of polyps</measure>
    <time_frame>Analysis will be performed during the study and approximately 1 year after end of study</time_frame>
    <description>The identification of biomarkers involved in the progression from colorectal adenoma to carcinoma (progression biomarkers) could aid better risk-stratification of adenomas and thereby decrease over-diagnosis and over-treatment . As a secondary objective we will therefore analyse previously identified progression biomarkers in the tissue samples of polyps obtained during colonoscopy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects in the age group 50-75 years. The lower age limit is set at 50 years because
             of the high probability of familiar predisposition when advanced neoplasm is present
             in a younger age group.26 The upper age limit of 75 years is in correspondence with
             the recommended stop-age for surveillance according to the current guideline.9

          -  Subjects with an indication for surveillance colonoscopy according to the previous
             guideline ('Follow up after polypectomy', 2002; summarized in 2008) or current
             ('Colonoscopy Surveillance', 2013) guideline. This includes subjects with a history of
             CRC or polypectomy, as well as subjects under surveillance for familial colorectal
             carcinoma (FCC).

          -  Subjects who have sufficient comprehension of the Dutch language.

          -  Subjects who have given their informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

          -  Subjects with Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated FAP
             (AFAP), MUTYH associated polyposis (MAP) and serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS)

          -  Subjects with a previous colonoscopy &lt; 6 months (rescopy)

          -  Subjects with proctocolectomy

          -  Subjects with life expectancy &lt; 3 years
