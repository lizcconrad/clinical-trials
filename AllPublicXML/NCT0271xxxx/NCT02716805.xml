  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of checkpoint therapy, tremelimumab and
      durvalumab, administered to subjects with multiple myeloma who are at high risk for relapse.
      Checkpoint therapy will be administered prior to and for 2 cycles post autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT). This will be followed by up to 6 additional monthly cycles of durvalumab
      alone.

    <measure>Assessment of Safety and Tolerability of the regimens using Dose Limiting Toxicity criteria.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of safety and tolerability of the regimens will be performed by the internal data safety monitoring panel on an ongoing basis, based on data review and regular conference calls with the Investigators.
