  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attentional control, or individuals' ability to choose which stimuli in the environment they
      attend to and which they ignore, declines with older age. Studies from the past two decades
      suggest that mindfulness meditative practice, such as a standardized mindfulness based stress
      reduction programs, may increase the efficiency of attention networks.To date, the majority
      of studies that have related mindfulness meditation practice to attentional control have been
      based on retrospective self-reported mindfulness or cross-sectional measurement in
      experienced meditators. More recent experimental studies using pre-post training designs have
      shown that meditation-naïve individuals can experience attentional improvement with
      mindfulness intervention. This study seeks to elucidate the time course and process by which
      such attentional improvements might be achieved.

      This research study investigates change in attentional control as participants progress
      through an 8-week mindfulness-inspired training (MIT) intervention, and has two specific
      aims: 1) to determine the time course of change in attentional components such as cognitive
      control and sustained attention as a consequence of MIT; attention will be measured weekly
      for 3 weeks before, 3 weeks after, and during 8 weeks of MIT. 2) To investigate the extent to
      which change in attentional performance is coupled/correlated with markers of emotion
      regulation, perceived mindfulness, and perceived mind wandering.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a 14-week research study exploring week to week changes in attentional control
      and selected time-varying covariates. The study will involve comparison of two groups of
      adults aged 65 and older. Half the participants (n=20) will be randomized to received eight
      weeks of mindfulness-inspired training, while the other half (n=20) are not.

      Groups will be compared in the amount of change experienced in measures of attentional
      control. In addition, the association between changes in emotion regulation, perceived
      mindfulness, and perceived mind wandering with changes in attentional control will be
      examined, as well as whether this association differs between persons who did and did not
      receive mindfulness-inspired training. Measurement will include both paper-and-pencil and
      computer-administered tests.

    <description>The continuous performance task is a computer-administered test that requires participants to respond to a certain type of stimulus (white five pointed star) but to withhold a response to other stimuli. Score is the number of correct responses.</description>

    <description>This task set is computerized and consists of 1) a single arithmetic task, 2) a single auditory tone task, and 3) a dual task where participants are challenged to simultaneously keep track of auditory tones and complete arithmetic problems. The order in which participants must complete these tasks will be randomized. Score is the number of correct additions plus the number of correct tone detections.</description>

    <description>Between other attention tasks, computer-administered questions will appear regarding participant self-rated focus and mind wandering at the present moment or during the previous task. Score is a Likert-type scale response from the following scale: 1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = almost always, 4 = always</description>

    <description>The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) will be computer administered. It is a psychological measurement to explore mindfulness. It is based on five independently developed mindfulness questionnaires that are bound together in a factor analytic study. The questionnaire consists of 39 items. The five facets are: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience. Score is the average response over 39 items on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1=never, 2=rarely, 3=sometimes, 4=often, 5=very often/always)</description>

    <description>Eight weekly group MIT sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, along with a ½ day Mindfulness Retreat at the end of the training period, will include 1) a psychoeducational component, 2) formal exercises in the form of guided practice mentioned above, and 3) thoughtful exploration of ideas and questions. Formal MIT training will follow 21 guided pre-recorded meditative Moving Picture Experts Group Layer-3 Audio (MP3) tracks from the authors for use in class and at home, promoting both fidelity to the model and uniformity in intervention across training groups. MIT activities in the protocol include mindful breathing, eating, walking, and various other practices well documented in the literature to promote mindfulness. Participants will be asked to practice MIT on their own time, and to log this.</description>
