      Gilbert syndrome is a mild genetic liver disorder in which the body cannot properly process
      bilirubin, a yellowish waste product that is formed when old or worn out red blood cells are
      broken down (hemolysis). Individuals with Gilbert syndrome have elevated levels of bilirubin
      (hyperbilirubinemia), because they have a reduced level of a specific liver enzyme required
      for elimination of bilirubin. Most affected individuals have no symptoms (asymptomatic) or
      may only exhibit mild yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes
      (jaundice). Jaundice may not be apparent until adolescence. Bilirubin levels may increase
      following stress, exertion, dehydration alcohol consumption, fasting, and/or infection. In
      some individuals, jaundice may only be apparent when triggered by one of these conditions.
      Gilbert syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

      Although Gilbert syndrome may become apparent shortly after birth, it may not be recognized
      for many years. Episodes of mild jaundice may appear in young adults and is more common in
      males than females. Frequently, episodes of jaundice are overlooked. Gilbert syndrome is
      associated with fluctuating levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). Bilirubin
      levels may increase with stress, strain, dehydration, fasting, infection or exposure to cold.
      In many individuals, jaundice is only evident when one of these triggers raises the bilirubin
      levels.

      Some affected individuals have reported vague, unspecific symptoms including fatigue,
      weakness and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea.

      Gilbert syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Genetic diseases are
      determined by the combination of genes for a particular trait that are on the chromosomes
      received from the father and the mother.

      Gilbert syndrome is caused by mutations to the UGT1A1 gene located on the long arm (q) of
      chromosome 2 (2q37). Chromosomes, which are present in the nucleus of human cells, carry the
      genetic information for each individual.

      The UGT1A1 gene contains instructions for creating (encoding) a liver enzyme known as uridine
      disphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 (UGT1A1). This enzyme is required for the conversion
      (conjugation) and subsequent excretion of bilirubin from the body. Mild jaundice associated
      with Gilbert syndrome occurs due to reduced amounts of this enzyme, which results in the
      accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin is an orange-yellow bile
      pigment that is mainly a byproduct of the natural breakdown (degeneration) of red blood cells
      (hemolysis). Bilirubin circulates in the liquid portion of the blood (plasma) bound to a
      protein called albumin; this is called unconjugated bilirubin, which does not dissolve in
      water (water-insoluble). Normally, this unconjugated bilirubin is taken up by the liver cells
      and, with the help of the UGT1A1 enzyme, is converted to form water-soluble bilirubin
      glucuronides (conjugated bilirubin), which are then excreted in the bile. The bile is stored
      in the gall bladder and, when called upon, passes into the common bile duct and then into the
      upper portion of the small intestine (duodenum) and aids in digestion. Most bilirubin is
      eliminated from the body in the feces.

      Individuals with Gilbert syndrome retain approximately one third of the normal UGT1A1 enzyme
      activity and are able to conjugate enough bilirubin to prevent symptoms from developing.
      However, in some cases, especially when an affected individual is fasting, dehydrated or not
      feeling well, mild jaundice may develop.

      Gilbert syndrome is diagnosed more often in males than females. New methods, like
      mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic alterations in the
      blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future the disease earlier,
      with a higher sensitivity and specificity.

      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry is a dry
      blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis in those patients where up
      to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done, sequencing will be done. The
      analyses are done in the Albrecht-Kossel-Institute for Neuroregeneration (AKos), POB 100 888,
