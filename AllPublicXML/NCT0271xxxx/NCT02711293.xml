  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by community health workers (CHWs) has the
      potential to reduce key barriers to ART care retention. The aim of this study is to determine
      whether CHW-led home delivery of ART for patients who are stable on ART combined with
      facility-based care for those not stable on ART is non-inferior to the standard of care
      (facility-based care for all ART patients) in achieving and maintaining virological
      suppression. The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of ART patients (regardless
      of whether they were clinically stable on ART at enrollment) who are in viral failure at the
      end of the study period. The non-inferiority design applies only to this primary endpoint.
      The margin of non-inferiority was set at a Risk Ratio (comparing intervention to control) of
      1.45. This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial set in Dar es Salaam. The unit of
      randomization is a healthcare facility with its surrounding neighborhoods (the 'catchment
      area'). We matched all 48 healthcare facilities offering ART services and having affiliated
      public-sector CHWs in Dar es Salaam into pairs (stratified by district) based on having a
      similar number of patients currently on ART. In each pair, one cluster was randomized to the
      intervention and one to the control arm. The intervention consists of home visits by CHWs to
      provide counseling and deliver ART to patients who are stable on ART, while the control is
      the standard of care (facility-based ART care and CHW home visits at least every three months
      without ART home delivery). In addition, within each study arm, half of the healthcare
      facilities were randomized to enhanced CHW-led nutrition counseling and half to standard
      counseling.

Clinically stable on ART was defined as 1) taking ART for at least six months, 2) having had a CD4-cell count &gt;350 cells/μL or a suppressed viral load at six or more months after ART initiation, and 3) the patient's most current CD4-cell count must have been &gt;350 cells/μL or the most current viral load must have shown viral suppression, with the last measurement not taken more than 12 months ago.</description>
