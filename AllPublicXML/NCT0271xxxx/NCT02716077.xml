    <textblock>
      Adult patients with histologically proven melanoma who will be treated with pembrolizumab
      will undergo FDG PET/CT scan as an early evaluation of response to therapy. Changes in FDG
      uptake will be correlated with lab and pathology results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients, at least 18 years of age

          -  History of histologically confirmed melanoma as assessed per medical record review.

          -  Eligible for the trial UPCC #01615, &quot;A Phase Ib Tissue Collection Study of
             Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Subjects with Resectable Advanced Melanoma.&quot;

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding at the time of screening will not be
             eligible for this study. Female participants of child-bearing potential will have a
             urine or serum pregnancy test at the time of the screening visit.

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of the investigator or
             treating physician.

          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the
             study.

          -  Ineligible for the trial UPCC #01615, &quot;A Phase Ib Tissue Collection Study of
             Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Subjects with Resectable Advanced Melanoma.&quot;

          -  Only individuals (aged 18 or over) who can understand and give informed consent will
             be eligible to participate in this study. Individuals who are considered to be
             mentally disabled will not be recruited for this study. All subjects must be able to
             give informed consent. We will not be using specific methods to assess decisional
             capacity. Economically disadvantaged persons will not be vulnerable to undue
             influence, as this study offers no compensation. All individuals will be told that
             their choice regarding study participation will in no way change their access to
             clinical care. This should negate any undue influence or coercion. Children, fetuses,
             neonates, or prisoners are not included in this research study.
