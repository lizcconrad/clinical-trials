      This study was designed to observe the cerebral state obtained via wavelet analysis
      (HXD-I,Beijing Easymonitor Technology Co.Ltd, China) and evaluate the emotion in various
      states in anesthesiologist and surgeon. And we also explore the association between the
      characteristic of cerebral state and the emotion.

      and pregnant woman. A group and S group completed emotional self-perceived questionnaire and
      then observe the characteristic of cerebral state via cerebral state monitor. They also
