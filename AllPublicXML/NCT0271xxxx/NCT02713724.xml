      This study investigates whether an individualized exercise program, including a personal
      trainer, can improve cardiovascular status quantified with ultrasound to assess coronary flow
      reserve and other non-invasive techniques. The subjects in the study will be divided into two
      groups; one group will have a personalized exercise- and nutrition program and the other
      group will have acess to a gym membership, but no personal trainer.

      Coronary heart disease is one of our most common diseases that causes significant morbidity
      and mortality. Because the risk of serious cardiovascular events, such as myocardial
      infarction and death, is evident in this patient population, it is of utmost importance to
      develop diagnostic methods to identify patients at risk. The most appropriate diagnostic
      methods are those that are safe to implement for both patient and physician, but also
      accessible and cost-efficient.

      By using non-invasive techniques such as ultrasound, coronary artery function can be examined
      as coronary flow reserve (CFR). In the platform of non-invasive techniques used by the
      investigators for examinations of cardiovascular status, other methods are included, such as
      measurement of intima-media thickness in the carotid and radial arteries. The investigators
      goal is to compare the group with the personalized program with its placebo, and to compare
      the two study-groups with each other, to investigate whether the personalized program
      provides greater health benefits.
