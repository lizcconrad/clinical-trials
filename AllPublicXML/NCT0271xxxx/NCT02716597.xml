  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of albumin in sepsis has been controversial for decades. Although hypoalbuminemia
      has been associated with worse outcomes in sepsis, definitive evidence does not exist that
      replacing albumin in these patients improves outcomes. However, subgroup analyses from large
      clinical trials indicate that albumin may reduce mortality in septic shock, and in
      particular, may reduce the time a patient requires vasopressor support. Given this
      background, we are conducting this study to evaluate the role of albumin replacement in the
      patient with resolving septic shock to determine if albumin administration reduces the time a
      patient requires vasopressor support, reduces the time required for central line, and
      ultimately whether any potential benefit in terms of reduction of vasopressor support is
      associated with ICU length of stay and other outcomes. The approach is unique from larger
      trials of albumin in that it is a septic shock study geared at a particular phenotype of the
      patient in septic shock and evaluating a specific intervention at a specific time point in
      the course of septic shock.
