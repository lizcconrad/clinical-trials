      This is a phase Ib study designed to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of
      Alisertib and MLN0128 in patients with advanced solid tumors with an expansion cohort in
      patients with previously treated metastatic TNBC.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combination of Alisertib and MLN0128 in patients
