  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy in MS patients has proven benefits on mobility, mood, motor function and
      quality of life. While the beneficial effects of exercise on cardiovascular and
      musculoskeletal function are well known, there has recently been increased focus on the
      positive effects of exercise on brain structure and function. The goal of this study is to
      determine whether exercise can promote beneficial changes in brain function in MS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, disabling neurologic disease characterized by damage to
      myelin and axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Current therapy for MS primarily
      consists of immunomodulatory drugs aimed at preventing future CNS injury; no treatments are
      currently available to repair existing damage, and symptomatic treatments to improve
      neurological function are quite limited. Rehabilitation approaches, such as exercise, have
      long been a staple of MS therapy. Exercise therapy in MS patients has proven benefits on
      mobility, mood, motor function and quality of life. While the beneficial effects of exercise
      on cardiovascular and musculoskeletal function are well known, there has recently been
      increased focus on the positive effects of exercise on brain structure and function. The
      overall aim of this proposal is to determine whether exercise can promote beneficial changes
      in brain function in MS patients. The investigator's central hypothesis is that
      cardiovascular exercise alters both brain structure and brain function in MS patients, and
      that these changes can be identified and monitored via imaging techniques that evaluate
      regional brain volumes and functional connectivity. When brain activity measured at one area
      fluctuates in a coherent manner with that recorded in a different area, those brain regions
      are considered to be functionally connected. Using resting-state magnetoencephalography
      (MEG), the investigator's laboratory has demonstrated that these patterns of correlated brain
      activity are abnormal in MS patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MS by revised McDonald criteria

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-6.0, inclusive.

          -  Able to understand the consent process, and the use of the wristband activity tracker.

          -  Sedentary by self-report (answers no to the question: &quot;Do you exercise regularly?&quot;

          -  Willing to make sincere effort to comply with the study objective of increasing their
             physical activity as much as possible (with goal of at least 100% increase) and to
             maintain that increased activity level for six months (if randomized to the exercise
             group).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current serious medical condition which would likely limit subject's ability to
             achieve sustained increase in physical activity, or put them at risk for doing so in
             the investigators' opinion (e.g. significant cardiovascular or respiratory disease,
             cancer, cancer, orthopedic disease, etc)

          -  Subjects that have a central nervous system disorder (in addition to MS) that is not
             considered secondary to MS

          -  Subjects that have implanted metal, pacemaker, etc. that may interfere with the
             MEG/MRI scan or who are otherwise unable to complete the MEG/MRI scan procedure
             without sedation (e.g. due to claustrophobia, obesity)

          -  weight &gt; 300 pounds
