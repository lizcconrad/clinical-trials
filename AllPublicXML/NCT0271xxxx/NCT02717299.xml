    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the patient reported outcome measures of total knee
      replacement patients who received intra operative sensor guided technique for soft tissue
      balancing to a group of patients who receive surgeon guided soft tissue balancing.

      This study will compare a group of total knee arthroplasty patients who receive sensor
      guidance technology for soft tissue balancing intra operatively to a group of patients who
      receive surgeon guided soft tissue balancing. Patients will be randomized to either the
      experimental group with the sensor guided technology or the control group which is the
      surgeon guided technique and current standard of care. All patients will have the sensor
      placed intra operatively so that measurements can be captured and recorded however, the
      measurements for the patients who are not in the sensor guided group will not be revealed to
      the surgeon. The information will be gathered for post enrollment data analysis only. The
      patients measurements in the sensor guided group will be revealed to the surgeon and the
      surgeon will use this information in order to help guide soft tissue balancing for optimal
      alignment intra operatively. Patients will be followed for 1 year post operatively. Patient
      reported outcomes measures such as KSS, KOOS, PROMIS PF CAT, EQ-5D and UCLA activity will be
      collected preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Post-operative Likert
      scale patient satisfaction scores will also be collected. All outcomes will be scored and
      compared to determine significance.
