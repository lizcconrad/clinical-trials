    <textblock>
      AIMS: The project aims at investigating of the effects of three types of planning (individual
      planning, collaborative planning, and dyadic planning) on physical activity.The influence of
      three planning interventions are compared with an active control condition, including
      physical activity education.

      PARTICIPANTS: The effects of the interventions are evaluated among parent-child (aged 10-14)
      dyads, with a minimum of 50 dyads enrolled into the each arm of the trial (a total of 200
      dyads). The interventions consist of six planning sessions.

      DESIGN: The dyads are randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. The
      assessment of the main and secondary outcomes is conducted at the baseline, at 1 week after
      the first intervention session, at post-intervention (after six intervention sessions are
      completed), and at 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.

      OUTCOMES: Physical activity constitutes the main outcome, whereas health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL), body mass index, as well as the self-regulatory strategy called the use of
      planning (individual, dyadic and collaborative) are secondary outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individual planning (also known as implementation intentions or action and coping planning)
      is a regulatory strategy, which refers to making plans on when, where, and how to perform an
      intended behavior. In dyadic planning, a target person is setting plans together with a
      partner on when, where, and how the target person will individually engage in behavior
      change. The concept of dyadic planning differs from the conceptualization of collaborative
      plans, where two individuals make plans on how to enact a behavior together.

      The study will evaluate the effects of a short-term planning intervention. The intervention
      includes a total of six sessions: two face-to-face sessions with the experimenter (delivered
      over two weeks) and three sessions delivered over phone (over the following three weeks), one
      face-two-face session (delivered at one month after the third session delivered over the
      phone). The delivery has an individual format (the experimenter + the dyad). The total time
      from first to sixth session is 2 months. The setting for the interventions will include
      schools (school nurse office) or/and participant's home. The same format, schedule, delivery,
      and setting will be used for conducting active control group procedures.
