  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among robotic devices, Gloreha, with its compliant mechanical transmission, may represent an
      easily applied innovative solution to rehabilitation, because the hand can perform grasp and
      release activities wearing the device by mean of a flexible and light orthosis. Our objective
      on this research was to the robotic assisted motion and activity in additional to
      physiotherapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT), on stroke patients with hand paralysis.

      The investigators evaluated the effectiveness of a robotic-assisted motion and activity in
      additional to physiotherapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT), on stroke patients with hand
      paralysis. A randomized controlled trial. The experimental group received a passive
      mobilization of the hand through the robotic device Gloreha and control group received a PT
      and OT for 3 consecutive weeks (3 days/week) in addition to traditional rehabilitation.
      Outcomes included the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Ashworth
      Scale (MAS), Barthel index (BI), Motricity index (MI), short version of the Disabilities of
      the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (quickDASH), and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measurements. All
      measures were collected at baseline and end of the intervention (3 weeks).
