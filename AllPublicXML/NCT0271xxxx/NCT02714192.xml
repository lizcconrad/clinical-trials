      The purpose of the study was to determine if administration of an exercise stress test within
      the first ten days after a sports related concussion would delay or otherwise interfere with
      recovery. All participants were adolescents injured while playing sports. All concussions
      were confirmed by an experienced sports medicine physician before random assignment of the
      participant to receive the treadmill test to determine exercise intolerance or not.

      Recovery was defined as (a) return to asymptomatic state; (b) ability to exercise to
      exhaustion without exacerbation of symptoms and (c) confirmation of recovery by a physician
      who is blinded to the assignment and to results of exercise testing. Symptoms were self
      reported on a daily basis using an online data record.

      Regardless of recovery rate all participants were assessed at two weeks following their first
      clinic visit. At the second visit all subjects, regardless of group assignment were assessed
      on ImPACT, and the treadmill based exercise stress test. Individuals who were not recovered
      by the second visit were followed until recovered no matter how long that took.

      Analysis of data examined recovery rates of the two groups of adolescents to determine
      whether use of a exercise stress test early after concussion caused any adverse events or
      interfered in any way with recovery.

    <description>Participants received an standardized exercise stress test within 7 days of concussive injury. Stress test is stopped when participant experiences any exacerbation of symptoms. Heart rate at time of symptom exacerbation is referred to as the threshold heart rate (THR). Stress test is known as the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test.</description>
