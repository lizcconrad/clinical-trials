      To refine a novel intervention using a combination of a smart phone application with best
      practice psychotherapy for men who have presented to hospital with intentional self-harm. The
      outcome will be change in baseline of scores on a depression rating scale the PHQ-9 at six
      weeks. Moreover, the investigators will ask clinicians and participants about the
      acceptability of the intervention and the acceptability of using routine data sources as
      outcome measures. This will inform methods of recruitment for the larger cluster randomized
      controlled trial and the creation of a treatment manual.

    <textblock>
      Self-harm is defined as intentional self-poisoning or self-injury, whether or not there is
      evidence that the act was intended to result in death. In the past, the term used was
      'attempted suicide.' However, peoples' motives for harming themselves are highly variable, a
      person may have more than one motive and motivation is hard to assess. In line with usual
      public policy in health and social care, the investigators use the term 'self-harm'
      describing a behaviour - avoiding the word 'deliberate' because many service users or
      consumers dislike its connotations.

      In Ontario, the number of people who present to hospital emergency departments with self-harm
      is difficult to accurately assess, but the best estimate is about 30,000 each year. The most
      common form of self-harm seen in emergency departments (around 80% of episodes) is the
      intentional consumption of an excess of a medicinal or toxic product, whether or not there is
      evidence that the act was intended to result in death. Injuries, most commonly self-cutting,
      form 15-20% of episodes.

      Two-thirds of people attending emergency departments because of self-harm are under 35 years
      of age. They are high users of health and social care services. Self-harm has a strong
      association with suicide: 7 patients per 1000 (about 1%) die by suicide in the year after
      attending emergency departments with a non-fatal episode (60 times the general population
      risk), rising to as many as 30 patients per 1000 over the next 15 years. In a recent
      longitudinal study conducted at the University of Toronto, &quot;all-cause mortality following a
      first episode of self-poisoning was 1107 per 100,000 person-yearsâ€¦ [with] nearly half of all
      deaths being suicides, accidents or undetermined intent.&quot; About a quarter of suicides are
      preceded by a hospital visit due to non-fatal self-harm in the previous year. It is the major
      identifiable risk factor for suicide. Mortality from non-suicidal causes is also high, with
      significantly more than the expected numbers of deaths from natural causes and from
      accidents. Whilst four of ten people who present with self-harm are men, they form nearly two
      thirds of suicides after an episode and are far more likely than women to die of premature
      death from other causes. The premature deaths are greatly over-represented among young people
      and the life years lost to the community are many.

      Repetition of non-fatal self-harm stands at around 20% annually and is associated with much
      distress and many unresolved interpersonal problems. It is likely that any reduction in
      repetition of self-harm will be mirrored by a fall in subsequent suicides. The Canadian
      Association for Suicide Prevention blueprint for a National Suicide Prevention Strategy
      (CASP) has identified those who have presented to hospital with non-fatal self-harm as a high
      risk target group to reduce suicide.

      People attending emergency departments after self-harm receive a variable standard of care in
      Ontario. Many are not assessed for psychological needs, and the little psychological therapy
      available is not usually covered by Ontario Health Insurance (OHIP). Local data from
      hospitals in Ottawa show that only 4 out of 10 men who present with intentional self-harm are
      seen by a mental health professional. Few are offered an evidence-based treatment aimed at
      reducing their risk of suicide or repeated self-harm. At present, assessment for self-harm in
      adults in Ontario is highly variable and there is no standard protocol for therapy.
      Assessment of suicide risk is currently a Required Operating Practice for Canadian Hospital
      accreditation; however, individuals identified as at-risk for suicide rarely receive
      recommended care.

      Specialist services offer intensive and lengthy treatment for the minority of people who
      self-harm diagnosed with personality disorders, such as dialectical behavior therapy or
      mindfulness based therapy. The evidence for the effectiveness of these specialist therapies
      comes almost entirely from studies in women.

      The investigators have received funding for a multicentre cluster randomized trial from the
      Ontario Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) Support for People and Patient Oriented
      Research and Trials (SUPPORT) Unit funded by Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR)
      and the Ontario Ministries of Health and Research and Innovation (MRI) comparing the delivery
      of smart phone assisted problem solving therapy with treatment as usual in men who present
      with self-harm. The rationale for focusing on men is that most suicides are in men and
      previous trials have found that providing generic treatments to everyone does not work. The
      intervention will build on previous work by trying to extend the range and intensity of
      therapy. The investigators will do this by supplementing it with a sophisticated smart phone
      application that has already demonstrated its effectiveness in men with substance abuse
      disorders. The investigators will be offering an intervention specifically designed for men
      who self-harm, as they are hard to engage and are more likely than women to have substance
      abuse problems. However, before proceeding with the full trial, a pilot study will be
      implemented to refine the intervention and treatment manual, as well as to test the
      acceptability and feasibility of the intervention to clinicians and patients.

      The pilot study has two aims. The first is to refine a novel intervention using a combination
      of a smart phone application with best practice psychotherapy for men who have presented to
      hospital with intentional self-harm. The primary outcome will be the change from baseline in
      scores on a depression rating scale the PHQ-9 at six weeks. The second aim is to test
      acceptability. The investigators will ask clinicians and patients about the acceptability of
      the intervention and the acceptability of using routine data sources as outcome measures.
      This will inform methods of recruitment for the larger cluster randomized controlled trial.
      We will also create a treatment manual for problem solving therapy that incorporates the use
      of a smart phone application.
