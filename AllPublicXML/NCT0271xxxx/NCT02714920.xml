  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most frequent form of head and neck cancer. The
      therapeutic choice depends on the stage of the disease and the habits of the medical teams.
      Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used, alone or combined. However, none of the
      existing strategies has proven its superiority.

      Chemotherapy and radiotherapy induce DNA damages in the tumor cells. However, cells have the
      ability to induce DNA reparation, capable of causing treatment resistance. DNA reparation in
      non-tumor tissues can also explain the toxicity of cancer treatments.

      Investigation of DNA repair pathways involved in chemo- or radiation resistance could offer a
      good strategy for identifying biomarkers or indicators of treatment response. This study will
      explore the capacity of a comprehensive functional approach that addresses several pathways,
      based on the use of three innovative patented technologies, to classify the tumor response of
      HNSCC patients to treatments according to their DNA Repair Enzyme Signature.

      Our hypothesis is that taking into account various clinical parameters (e.g. patient and
      tumor characteristics), treatment strategy and measuring the DNA Repair Enzyme Signature
      would create patients' profiles and optimize their management.

    <time_frame>18 months after the end of the treatments (approximately 24 months after the beginning of the study)</time_frame>
    <description>Results of DNA Repair Enzyme biomarker profiles of tumor cells will be quantified before and during treatment with:
The excision/synthesis assay, as the incorporated fluorescence intensity;
The ODN (Oligonucleotide) assay, as the percentage of cleavage for the DNA target lesions;
The DSB (Double-strand breaks) Assay, as the incorporated fluorescence intensity.
The radio- or chemo-resistance will be defined as disease-free survival, i.e. absence of local or regional recurrence in irradiated tissue seen on CT-scan.
The different tumor and clinical settings will be determined with:
Patient and tumor characteristics, i.e. age, sex, etiological factors (tobacco, alcohol), localization and stage of the tumor, HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) status, p53 status;
Treatment strategy, i.e. all the treatments that will be administered to the patient and their sequence, including International Nonproprietary Name of the drugs and doses of chemo and/or radiotherapy</description>
