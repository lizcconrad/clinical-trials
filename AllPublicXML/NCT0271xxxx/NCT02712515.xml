      Essential tremor (ET) is among the most common movement disorders, and is the most prevalent
      tremor disorder. It is a progressive, degenerative brain disorder that results in
      increasingly debilitating tremor, and afflicts an estimated 7 million people in the US (2.2%
      of the population) and estimates from population studies worldwide range from 0.4% to 6.3%.
      ET is directly linked to progressive functional impairment, social embarrassment, and even
      depression. Intention (kinetic) tremor of the arms occurs in approximately half of ET
      patients, and is typically a slow tremor (~5-10Hz) that occurs at the end of a purposeful
      movement, and is insidiously progressive over many years. Based on direct and indirect
      neurophysiological studies, it has been suggested that a pathological synchronous oscillation
      in a neuronal network involving the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus, the
      premotor (PM), primary motor (M1) cortices, and the cerebellum, may result in the production
      of ET. In spite of the numerous therapeutic modalities available, 65% of those suffering from
      upper limb tremor report serious difficulties during their daily lives. Deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment option for those suffering from
      medically refractory ET. The accepted target for ET DBS therapy is the Vim thalamus. Vim
      projects to PM, M1, and supplementary motor areas (SMA) and receives afferents from the
      ipsilateral cerebellum. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings from Vim during
      stereotactic surgery have identified &quot;tremor cells&quot; that synchronously discharge with
      oscillatory muscle activity during tremor. Clinical and computational findings indicate that
      DBS suppresses tremor by masking these &quot;burst driver&quot; inputs to the thalamus. The overall
      goal is to investigate the neural signatures of tremor generation in the thalamocortical
      network by recording data during DBS implantation surgery. Investigators will record data
      from the macroelectrode implanted in the Vim for DBS therapy, and through an additional
      6-contact subdural cortical strip that will be placed on the hand motor cortical area
      temporarily through the same burr hole opened for the implantation of the DBS electrode.

      The research study goal is to advance the understanding of the mechanisms for essential
      tremor through brain recordings. The investigators will collect brain signals in persons with
      essential tremor undergoing neurosurgical treatment (deep brain stimulation implantation). By
      recording from the implanted electrodes for deep brain stimulation along with two other
      non-invasive intraoperative monitoring electrodes, the origins of tremor will be studied in
      the human motor network. Moreover, by performing recordings during deep brain stimulation
      delivery, the mechanisms in which deep brain stimulation modulates this network to suppress
      tremor will be investigated.

      During the standard of care DBS procedure neural recordings are performed as the participant
      is in a reclined position on the operating table. In addition to neural recordings it is
      standard to ask the patient to move their arms and legs during the procedure. An additional
      intraoperative monitoring subdural electrode strip, used in epilepsy and tumor surgeries to
      perform functional mapping, will be placed by the neurosurgeon after the DBS electrode is
      placed per the clinical need of the patient. In addition, the Ad-Tech Medical Instrumentation
      Corp. device will be used to test responses with wireless sensors placed on the participant's
      arms, which can record EMG activity. Brain signals will be recorded using the clinical FHC
      Guideline 4000+ system, which is capable of recording during stimulation. This additional
      testing will add approximately 30-45 minutes to the surgical time.
