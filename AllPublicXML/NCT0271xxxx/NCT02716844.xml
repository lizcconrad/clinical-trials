      Aim: Investigating the effects of Clinical Pilates Exercise on kinesiophobia, pain,
      functional status and quality of life of the patients diagnosed with osteoporosis.

      Method: 47 patients were assessed and randomly divided into 2 groups. Exercise group patients
      joined exercise program regularly that was held 3 times a week, 1 hour a day, during 6 weeks
      with physiotherapist. Control group patients continued their normal daily lives without any
      exercise. After 7 patients quit the study for various reasons, 40 women with primary
      osteoporosis (control group n=20, exercise group n= 20), completed the study and were
      assessed at the beginning and at the end of 6 weeks. As assesment' measurements Tampa
      Kinesiophobia Scale (TKS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Short Form McGill (SF-McGill), Pain
      Disability Index (PDI), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Berg Balance Test (BBT), Timed Up-
      Go Test (TUG), Chair Sit-Stand Test (CSST), Chair Sit and Reach Test (CSRT), Back Scratch
      Test (BST), Quality of life Questionnaire European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41),
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SLS) and Health
      Assesment Questionnaire (HAQ) were performed.

    <measure>Change in the level of fear and avoidance associated with movement assessed using the Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning and at the end of 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>40 osteoporosis patients filled Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale at the beginning and at the end of 6 weeks in order to measure the level of fear and avoidance associated with movement. If an individual receives a high score, according to the scale, this result indicates a high level of kinesiophobia . It has not a specific unit. There is not an adverse events in this test.</description>

The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current pain intensity. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks and recorded in centiemeters (cm).</description>

    <description>assesses the functional flexibility of the lower extremity in adult (23). Participant sits on the edge of a chair. One foot must remain flat on the floor. The other leg is extended forward with the knee straight, heel on the floor, and ankle bent at 90Â°. Patients place one hand on top of the other with tips of the middle fingers even. Patients keep the knee straight, and hold the reach for 2 seconds. If the fingertips touch the toes then the score is zero (0). If they do not touch, measure the distance between the fingers and the toes (a negative score/-), if they overlap, measure by how much (a positive score/+) and recorded in cm.</description>

    <description>Back Scratch Test (BST)(cm) evaluates the functional flexibility of the patient's upper extremity. Patients are asked to rotate their shoulder externally with palms facing their back. Their hand fingers extend while trying to reach the lowest point, the other arm internally rotates while trying to reach the highest point. Patients are asked their fingertips to be closer to each other. If finger tips do not touch each other, the distance between them is recorded in cm assumed as a negative score, if the fingertips touch each other, then the score is assumed as zero. If they overlap, it is recorded in cm taking as positive score. Three repetitions are performed consecutively and the best score was recorded.</description>
