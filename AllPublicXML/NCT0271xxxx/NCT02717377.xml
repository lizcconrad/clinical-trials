    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the effects of six 5 minute microbursts of physical activity
      spread across the day as compared to either a sedentary control condition or a single 30
      minute bout of moderate intensity physical activity on cognitive function, self-reported
      energy levels, aspects of eating behavior and measures of metabolic health. The primary
      hypotheses are:

        1. Hourly 5 minute bouts of moderate intensity exercise during the day will increase
           afternoon cognitive function as compared to a no exercise condition.

        2. Hourly 5 minute bouts of moderate intensity exercise during the day will increase
           afternoon cognitive function more than a single 30 minute AM bout.

      Secondary exploratory hypotheses include

        1. Hourly 5 minute bouts of moderate intensity exercise during the day will increase
           self-reported energy levels, reduce orexigenic appetitive measures and improve measures
           of metabolic health as compared to a no exercise condition.

        2. Hourly 5 minute bouts of moderate intensity exercise during the day will increase
           self-reported energy levels, reduce orexigenic appetitive measures and improve measures
           of metabolic health more than a single 30 minute AM bout.
