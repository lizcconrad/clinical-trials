  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with a low
      arousal threshold may wake up too early during a respiratory event, before upper airway
      muscles can be activated to achieve stable ventilation. Thus, strategies to manipulate the
      respiratory arousal threshold could potentially improve the quality of sleep and sleep
      disordered breathing. Agents that raise arousal threshold are therefore likely to benefit
      some patients with OSA. The overall goal of this project is to determine the importance of
      the arousal threshold in OSA, determine which patients might benefit from a raised arousal
      threshold, and test this hypothesis by using pharmacological manipulation of the arousal
      threshold to achieve this goal.

      This study is a randomized double-blinded crossover pilot study. The investigators will test
      whether Venlafaxine has important effects on the apnea hypopnea index. Venlafaxine is a
      serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for the treatment of depression and
      anxiety. Venlafaxine increases serum serotonin level, which may affect arousal threshold.
      Furthermore, higher serotonin level theoretically may improve muscle tone, including upper
      airway muscle. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that venlafaxine may decrease arousal
      threshold and improve muscle tone, leading to improvement of OSA.

      Eligible participants will undergo overnight polysomonography as described below and will
      receive either Venlafaxine(50 mg 2 hour prior to sleep) or placebo (in random order) followed
      roughly 7 days later with placebo or donepezil. This aim will allow us to test the impact of
      Venlafaxine on the apnea hypopnea index.

      The change in apnea hypopnea index will be compared in the Venlafaxine groups with the
      placebo group.

    <description>The Apnea hypopnea index is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The change from baseline in apnea hypopnea index after a single dose of Venlafaxine will be evaluated using overnight polysomnography. An apnea hypopnea index less than five events per hour is considered within normal limits.</description>
