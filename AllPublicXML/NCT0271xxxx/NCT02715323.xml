      Ocular surface disease, especially dry eye and scleritis, commonly affects patients with
      autoimmune diseases. Ocular surface immune cells are increased in autoimmune disease; however
      the full subset of immune cells activated is unknown. Recent experimental studies show that
      dendritic cells and T cells in the cornea are critically associated with corneal nerve
      innervation. Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) allows rapid non-invasive in vivo imaging of
      dendritic cells and corneal nerves. The investigators propose to investigate how ocular
      surface health, conjunctival immune cells and corneal nerve/dendritic cell morphology
      interact in 3 rheumatological conditions: Sjogren's syndrome (SS), Rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

      The preliminary flow cytometric studies show that various immune cells (eg: T cells, B cells,
      and dendritic cells) can be quantified using minimally invasive impression membranes
      (Eyeprim). Clinically, the research team is experienced in measuring features of ocular
      surface inflammation (conjunctival redness, tear breakup times) with Oculus keratograph5M.
      The investigators also aim to harvest conjunctival immune cells using impression cytology and
      quantify specific cell types with flow cytometry. Corneal nerve morphology and dendritic cell
      density and distribution will be assessed using CCM; in collaboration with the group who have
      pioneered this technique.

      The investigator anticipate that alterations in corneal nerve and dendritic cell parameters
      will correlate with immune activation/inflammation, deterioration of tear function and
      increased systemic severity of the rheumatological disease. In addition, the investigators
      hypothesize that the lower the corneal nerve density, the higher the number of corneal
      dendritic cells and conjunctival inflammatory cells. Studying these relationships may allow a
      better mechanistic understanding of local corneal and systemic immune activation and the
      development of a non-invasive ophthalmic surrogate marker of dendritic cell activation and
      nerve fibre loss to aid earlier diagnosis, risk stratification and the development of new

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

           1.1 General Introduction

           Ocular surface disease, especially dry eye and scleritis, commonly affects patients with
           autoimmune diseases. Ocular surface immune cells are increased in autoimmune disease;
           however the full subset of immune cells activated is unknown. Recent experimental
           studies show that dendritic cells and T cells in the cornea are critically associated
           with corneal nerve innervation. Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) allows rapid
           non-invasive in vivo imaging of dendritic cells and corneal nerves. The investigators
           propose to investigate how ocular surface health, conjunctival immune cells and corneal
           nerve/dendritic cell morphology interact in 3 rheumatological conditions: Sjogren's
           syndrome (SS), Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

           The preliminary flow cytometric studies show that various immune cells (eg: T cells, B
           cells, and dendritic cells) can be quantified using minimally invasive impression
           membranes (Eyeprim). Clinically, the research team is experienced in measuring features
           of ocular surface inflammation (conjunctival redness, tear breakup times) with Oculus
           keratograph5M. The investigators also aim to harvest conjunctival immune cells using
           impression cytology and quantify specific cell types with flow cytometry. Corneal nerve
           morphology and dendritic cell density and distribution will be assessed using CCM; in
           collaboration with the group who have pioneered this technique.

           Investigators anticipate that alterations in corneal nerve and dendritic cell parameters
           will correlate with immune activation/inflammation, deterioration of tear function and
           increased systemic severity of the rheumatological disease. In addition, the
           investigator hypothesize that the lower the corneal nerve density, the higher the number
           of corneal dendritic cells and conjunctival inflammatory cells. Studying these
           relationships may allow a better mechanistic understanding of local corneal and systemic
           immune activation and the development of a non-invasive ophthalmic surrogate marker of
           dendritic cell activation and nerve fibre loss to aid earlier diagnosis, risk
           stratification and the development of new therapies in our autoimmune patients with
           severe dry eye.

           1.2 Rational for the Study Purpose

           Dry eye, a type of chronic ocular surface inflammation, is highly prevalent and
           contributes to corneal blindness and imposes a severe health burden. Scleritis is ocular
           surface inflammatory disorder associated with mild to severe inflammation of the sclera
           with or without intraocular inflammation. Severe dry eye or scleritis is associated with
           autoimmune diseases like SS, RA, SLE, and other conditions. Current treatment of dry eye
           is often not effective enough (eg., cyclosporine) or causes adverse effects (eg.,
           corticosteroid-induced glaucoma). In autoimmune dry eye, there is immune-mediated damage
           to the ocular surface and the lacrimal gland. In various models of dry eye disease, it
           has been shown that components of the immune system such as T cells, macrophages and
           cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are critical for
           triggering and maintaining this disease. Likewise treatment of non-infective sclerits is
           a very challenging situation to all uveitis specialists.

           Ocular surface immune cells are increased when autoimmune disease is present, either the
           proportion or number of a particular type of immune cell, eg. monocytes or CD4+ T cells
           may be increased in the presence of more severe local inflammation and/or systemic
           activity. A signature of immune cell infiltration may be present in a particular
           rheumatological condition. If certain types of cells, (e.g., T cells or B cells) are
           predominant in the systemic disease, it suggests that a T cell approach (e.g.,
           tacrolimus) or B cell approach (e.g., rituxamab) may be used. Alternatively, if certain
           cytokines play a major role in dry eye, an inhibitor of cytokine signalling such as a
           JAK inhibitor may be used.

           Recent studies have shown that dendritic cells and T cells in the cornea are critically
           associated with corneal nerve innervation [1, 2]. This has been shown in both human and
           animal studies [1-4]. At the same time, the technology for in vivo imaging of human
           corneal nerves and dendritic cells and their quantification have greatly improved
           recently. This has led to an explosion of interest in harnessing this technology as a
           surrogate marker for peripheral neuropathies and to explore underlying mechanisms
           [5-27]. The investigators have previously shown that first generation CCM can quantify
           the presence and density of Langerhans cells (LCs) in Bowman's layer of the cornea in
           patients with diabetes [28]. However the latest 3rd generation HRT III can be used to
           classify and quantify Langerhans cells (LCs) into a mature phenotype (dendritic cell
           bearing long processes) or an immature phenotype (non-dendritic cell lacking cell
           dendrites) to provide insight into immune alterations in vivo [29]. A recent
           experimental study in diabetic mice has used CCM to show that direct contact between DCs
           and the corneal nerves may trigger nerve fiber damage [30].

           Gap in scientific knowledge: Researchers have shown that proinflammatory cytokines are
           elevated in tears of humans with dry eye; many of these may be secreted by immune cells.
           They found in preliminary flow cytometric studies that CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells,
           CD14+ monocytes, CD1c dendritic cells can be quantified using minimally invasive
           impression membranes (Eyeprim)[31]. The full subset of immune cells activated in the
           ocular surface in dry eye, and in various rheumatological conditions, is not known. The
           proportions of these cells in different severity of dry eye and different systemic
           activity of autoimmune disease have not been evaluated. Furthermore, it is uncertain
           whether the integrity of cornea innervation is also a determinant of tear function in
           patients with autoimmune systemic disease.

           The research group has undertaken many clinical trials and imaging studies of the human
           ocular surface. This includes measurements with Oculus (non-invasive tear breakup
           times), staining, etc., and the measurement of cytokines using the multiplex bead based
           sandwich immunofluorescence assay[32-38]

           Preliminary Studies The research group has also optimized Eyeprim collection of
           conjunctival immune cells and method of analysis using a panel of immune markers with
           Amnis [31], a relatively new type of flow cytometry (Figure 1) coupled with microscopy
           (Figure 2). The advantage of the Amnis technique is the direct visualization of analyzed
           cells to permit co-localisation of signals. They have published on the validity of the
           cell morphological parameter analysis using the Amnis software, compared to a human
           grader [31]. In addition, they have also used conventional flow cytometry (BD FACS) to
           quantify CD3, CD4, CD8, CCR7, CXCR3, CD109 and CD63 staining (data not shown).

           In collaboration with the ENA team, their team has been trained in image acquisition
           using CCM to enable quantification of corneal nerves and dendritic cells [1, 2, 4, 9,
           10, 13, 14, 16, 21, 27](Figure 3). Sub-basal corneal nerve fibre density, corneal nerve
           branch density, corneal nerve fibre length and tortuosity (Figure 3, 4) will be
           quantified using both manual (CCMetrics) and automated (ACCMetrics) image analysis
           software, developed by the ENA team. Sub-basal mature and immature dendritic cell
           density and distribution in relation to corneal nerves will be quantified.

           The collaborators, Prof Malik and Dr. Petropoulos are leading the Early neuropathy
           assessment (ENA team-http://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/faculty/eng/index.html) and
           have pioneered the use of in vivo CCM as a rapid, non-invasive ophthalmic instrument to
           monitor diabetic and other peripheral neuropathies. They will actively engage in
           training and overseeing optimal image capture and will provide the necessary software
           and licensing privileges to enable detailed quantification and interpretation [9, 10,
           12-14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23-27].

        2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES Overall long term objective: Discover safe and effective
           treatment for ocular surface inflammation and define the ocular surface indications for
           clinical usage of medications targeting the immune system in rheumatological disease.

           Clinical / Healthcare implications: There are many benefits in using CCM in autoimmune
           disease. CCM allows rapid, non-invasive imaging of the corneal nerves and dendritic
           cells to determine the level of inflammation and its consequence in autoimmune diseases.
           This will allow earlier diagnosis, risk stratification and more timely intervention at
           the rheumatology clinics, enhancing multidisciplinary care of autoimmune patients. The
           investigator will build a normative database (either ethnic or local age specific data
           from a reading centre) by using this study as a platform to recruit more patients.

           Basic science implications: Advance understanding of relationship between corneal nerves
           and tear function/immunology.

           Short term objectives: researchers propose a nationwide study in collaboration with Tan
           Tock Seng Hospital to study clinical features and conjunctival immune cells in patients
           with ocular surface inflammatory disease with or without associated systemic autoimmune
           or collagen vascular disease.

           Academic objectives: Aim to:

             -  Enhance multidisciplinary collaborations, between SERI and S Albani from STIIC
                (cell analysis)

             -  Build new collaborations (TTSH ophthalmologist Dr R Agrawal)

             -  Increase value/synergy from currently approved funding: SERI pilot grant
                (recruitment of pilot participants and optimization of tools),

             -  Compete for future funding, NMRC STAR award, CS or CBIRG.

           Expected findings:

             -  Different systemic severities of the rheumatological diseases, symptoms of dry eye,
                tear function, NIKBUT and corneal staining may correlate with corneal nerve and
                dendritic/non-dendritic cell defects.

             -  Tear cytokines may correlate with corneal nerve and dendritic/non-dendritic cell
                defects.

             -  Change in the density and subtypes of T cells or other cells such as dendritic in
                the conjunctiva (impression cytology) may correlate with corneal nerve and
                dendritic/non-dendritic cell defects.

           2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits: 2.3.1 Potential Risks

             -  It is possible that there may be some slight discomfort during the sampling of
                conjunctival cells using the impression membrane

             -  Some slight discomfort or redness from tear fluid collection (Schirmer test)

             -  Rarely a corneal epithelial defect may occur from in vivo confocal microscopy, but
                this generally heals in 1-2 days. Corneal epithelial defect means that a layer of
                the cornea is broken, liken to what happened during an abrasion.

             -  Stinging sensation as a result of local anaesthetic (Alcaine)

           2.3.2 Potential Benefits With greater understanding of the presence of various
           inflammatory mediators, the investigators can gain further insight into the complex
           process taking place in autoimmune diseases patients.

        3. STUDY POPULATION 3.1 List The Number and Nature of Subjects to be Enrolled. The
           investigators will recruit patients with 3 specific rheumatological diagnoses and
