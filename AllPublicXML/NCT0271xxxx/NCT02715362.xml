  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous infusion of CART cells in the treatment of solid tumors may be not a suitable
      choice. Because by intravenous infusion, T cells first entered into the blood circulation,
      but the number of T cells accumulated at the tumor site is limited, while the probability is
      high that CART cells contact with normal tissue where target protein is expressed, leading to
      a more potential off-target side effect. In this study, CART cells infused to the body is
      mediated by the method of transcatheter arterial infusion(TAI), which is one kind of tumor
      intervention therapy pathway. We hope by this means could improve the local CAR-T cell
      numbers，meanwhile reduce the potential side effects.

      Patients treated with leukapheresis from which peripheral blood mononuclear cells are
      purified. T cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors
      (CARs) specific for GPC3. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the participant by
      transcatheter arterial infusion at the dose of .(1-10)×106 CAR positive T cells/kg. The cells
      perfusion process would last for 15min to 2 h via an ambulatory infusion pump. A single dose
      of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide will be given two days before CART cell infusion.

    <description>A single dose of GPC3-CART cells will be administered by transcatheter arterial infusion(TAI) mediated as one dose infusion. The dose is 1-10x106/kg GPC3-CAR positive T cells. The infusion will be scheduled to occur 2 days after a single dose of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide. Patients will undergo cannula--DSA radiography--CAR-T cells perfused into hepatic artery. The cells perfusion process would last 15min to 2 h, and the specific time depends on patent's tumor-burdened state.</description>
