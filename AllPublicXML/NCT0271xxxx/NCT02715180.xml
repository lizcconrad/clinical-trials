  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The almost evidences of the optimal hand position during compression had been based on chest
      computed tomography (CT) or chest plain films of patients for investigating the effective
      location for compressing the left ventricle of the heart during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      (CPR).

      However every study was conducted at full inspired state of respiration. A prospective cohort
      study to evaluate the proper hand position during CPR based on expired respiratory state CT
      as the health screening would be needed.

    <description>All participants were evaluated 2 scout films during LDCT screenings. The first scout film was obtained while a participant was holding a comfortable expiration with the arms at down position, and the second scout film was obtained while a full inspiration with the arms at raised position. The axial images of LDCT were taken during participants' full inspiration. The radio-opaque marker was attached to the participants' skin where the lowest part of sternum was palpable, because the sternum moves according to the position of arms and respiration.</description>
