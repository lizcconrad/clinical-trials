  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of a randomized intervention aimed at increasing
      consumption of whole grain foods among children from low-income households that participate
      in the Special Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or &quot;food stamps&quot;). A total of 60 obese
      children (8 to 16 years) will be recruited from a clinical population (Healthy Eating Active
      Living Program) at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Benioff Children's Hospital
      Oakland. Participants and their caregivers will all receive education about whole grain
      foods, and will be randomized to either an intervention or control group. The intervention
      group will receive a monthly reimbursement allotment of up to 10% of their usual SNAP benefit
      for specific whole grain foods purchased during the three month study period. The control
      group will not have the financial incentive for purchasing whole grain foods during the 12
      week study period. The investigators will assess the feasibility of the intervention, the
      impact of the intervention on household grocery purchases, and the impact on the child's
      anthropometrics, dietary intake of whole grain foods (24-hour recall), and markers of
      metabolic risk.

      RUN-IN PHASE (Weeks -4 to 0)

        -  Participants will participate in a &quot;run-in phase&quot; where they will be asked to keep all
           grocery receipts for a 4 week period

      RANDOMIZATION (Week 0)

        -  Child participants with caregivers who are able to successfully complete the run-in
           phase are then randomized at that point to be either in the intervention arm or the
           control arm.

        -  Patients will be block randomized by age group (8-11 and 12-16).

      ACTIVE PHASE (Weeks 0-12)

        -  Participants will be given education about whole grains and whole grain preparation.
           Intervention and control participant activities described elsewhere.

      RETURN VISIT (Week 24)

        -  12 weeks after the completion of the active phase of the study, patients will be asked
           to return for a final visit at the research center, during which they will also have
           blood tests and other study activities repeated for one final time.

    <description>Using the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) for 24-hour food recall, intake of whole grains (and refined grains, and proportion of grains that are whole) will be assessed.
