  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with fear provoking exposures is the most effective therapy for
      anxiety disorders. Investigators aim to enhance this therapy with the use of virtual reality
      exposures and to make therapy more available and accessible for patients with anxiety
      disorders. The societal benefit of increased access to therapy is that, if successful, it
      will increase the number of patients who receive appropriate treatment for an anxiety
      disorder.

      Twenty children with CADs or OCD who have received less than 3 treatment sessions and a
      parent will be recruited to pilot the VR system. Participants will be identified through the
      Mayo Clinic Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Clinic. Each patient will participate in a single (up
      to) 2-hour visit. During the first 30 minutes the patient and parent will be introduced to
      the VR system and the rationale for this feasibility study. Next, a therapist will lead the
      patient through exposure exercises using the VR system for up to 30 minutes. During the next
      period, up to 30 minutes, the therapist will go to a different room and the patient, with
      support from their parent, will complete exposure exercises using the VR system that the
      therapist directed them to complete. During the exposures the interviewer will observe, code
      and record the patient's interaction with the VR system. For the remaining time (up to 30
      minutes) the interviewer will interview the patient about his or her experience with the VR
      system and then will ask for observations and opinions from the parent.

    <description>The children in this study will have a single visit. During this visit the child and their parent will be introduced to the virtual reality (VR) system. The child will interact with the VR system and after they have finished, they will be asked questions about their experience with the VR system.</description>
