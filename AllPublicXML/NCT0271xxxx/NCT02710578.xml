  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the known driving behavior of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and some of its
      parallel to driving under the influence of cannabis, this supplemental study aims to validate
      the sensitivity of the primary and secondary outcome measures employed in a cannabis and
      driving study currently in progress.

      This study will examine the effects of an intoxicating dose of alcohol on driving-related
      skills among young drivers using driving simulator technology.

      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled mixed design study, including randomized
      between-subjects comparison of the effects of alcohol intoxication and both between- and
      within-subjects examination of acute and residual effects at approximately 24 and 48 hours
      following one-time alcohol administration.

      Initial contact with potential participants will be made by telephone, where study personnel
      will conduct a telephone screen for eligibility. Those telephone screened as eligible will
      attend CAMH for an eligibility assessment. Enrolled participants will complete four sessions
      on consecutive days: a practice day, an alcohol administration day, and a 24-hour and 48-hour
      post-alcohol session.
