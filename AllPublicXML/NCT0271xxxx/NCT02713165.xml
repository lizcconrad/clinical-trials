  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raisins contain a significant amount of dietary fiber and polyphenolic compounds that
      represent an important substrate for microbiota fermentation which generates potentially
      beneficial end products, such as short-chain fatty acids. The mammalian gut contains a
      phylogenetically as well as functionally diverse microbiota that contributes to host
      physiology. To date, little is known about how increased raisin intake affects human gut
      microbiota composition.

      This research study will assess the effects of adding raisins to the diet of healthy adults
      on the bacteria from feces of human subjects and resulting self-reported GI symptoms as well
      as markers of immune function. The hypothesis is that by adding raisins to the diet this will
      result in changes in gut microbiota. Furthermore, the changes in microbiota will largely be
      beneficial, as evaluated by an increase in butyrate producers and bacteria associated with
      anti-inflammatory properties.

      The research study design is a 14 day international focus on increasing raising intake.
      Participants will be provided with a commercial raisin product for a 14 day period.
      Participants will consume 2 servings/day (84g of raisins). While participants will be told to
      substitute raisins for other diet ingredients, they will be free to choose what to substitute
      according to their preferences. Participants will keep daily food records and will be told
      that raisin consumption will be monitored in their fecal samples (qPCR). Fecal samples will
      be collected before the start (Day1), during (Day5-7) and at the end (Day 12-14) of the
      intervention using a stool collection kit (Sigma). Participants will complete a GI health
      questionnaire on a weekly basis to determine tolerance to increased raisin intake.
