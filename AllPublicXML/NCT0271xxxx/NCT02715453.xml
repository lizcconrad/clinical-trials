  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty has been associated to a worse outcome in acute coronary syndromes, but the best
      management of frail patients after an acute coronary syndrome remains unknown. The aim was to
      investigate the benefit of an intervention on frailty in frail patients after an acute
      myocardial infarction.

      Patients survivors after an acute myocardial infarction (with and without ST-segment
      elevation), older than 70 years and with pre-frailty (1-2 points) or frailty (≥3 points)
      according to the Fried's scale measured 24 hours before hospital discharge, will be included.
      The participants will be randomized to 2 strategies: a) intervention on frailty in addition
      to the usual care by the cardiologist, and b) conventional strategy consisting only of the
      usual care by the cardiologist. A multidisciplinary team (physicians, nurses and
      physiotherapists and nutritionists) will carry out the intervention on frailty The study
      contemplates a 2-year inclusion period and a 3rd year for the follow-up of the last included
      patient. The main outcome will be the frailty status (Fried's scale) at 3 months and 1 year.
      The secondary endpoint will be the clinical events, both cardiovascular and not
      cardiovascular events, including recurrent events (cumulative events analysis), for the total
      follow up (3 years in the case of the first included patient). The hypothesis is that an
      intervention on frailty will improve frailty status and the clinical outcomes in frail
      patients after an acute myocardial infarction.
