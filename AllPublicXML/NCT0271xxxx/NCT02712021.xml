  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lycra garments have recently been used for children with cerebral palsy, with favorable
      effects on alignment, biomechanics and neuromuscular activity. The aim of the present study
      is to determine the efficacy of a Lycra suit in improving motor function and static balance
      in children with cerebral palsy. The children included in this study will be part of a
      prospective project on children with cerebral palsy, older than 4 years of age, and their
      families regularly followed at the Child Neurology Unit of the Catholic University of Rome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 10 children with cerebral palsy will be recruited and included in the study. Five
      of them will be considered as study group and will wear a lycra suit, with shoulder, trunk
      and pelvis coverage, for more than 4 hours per day for 6 months. The other 5 will be
      considered as control group, matched for age and sex to the study group, and will not wear
      the lycra suit. The evaluation of static balance and the gross motor function measure will be
      used as outcome measure. The children of both groups will be assessed twice, at baseline and
      6 months after, each child acting as his/her own control.

      The motor function assessments will be performed without the Lycra suit, whereas the static
      balance assessments were performed with and without the suit.

    <time_frame>The children were assessed twice, at baseline and 6 months after, each child acting as his/her own control.</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of static balance will be assessed by a &quot;seated stabilometry exam&quot; performed on a &quot;Prokin PK 254 P&quot; device produced by TecnoBody S.r.l. (Dalmine BG - Italy). This device consists of a static plate (47 centimeters of circumference) equipped internally with four piezoelectric sensors positioned at the extremity of the four cardinals points.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Gross Motor Function Classification System at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>The children were assessed twice, at baseline and 6 months after, each child acting as his/her own control.</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) will be used to evaluate gross motor function quantitatively. The GMFM consists of 88 items grouped into 5 dimensions: A (lying and rolling), B (sitting), C (crawling and kneeling), D (standing), E (walking, running and jumping). Scores for each dimension are expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension. A total score is obtained by adding the scores for all dimensions and dividing by 5, ranging from 0 to 100.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of major congenital malformations or metabolic or haematological
             complications.

          -  The investigators will also exclude children who had previously worn a lycra garment
