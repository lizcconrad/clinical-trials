  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, recurrent, and frequent chronic disorder. Among
      others, deficient cognitive control over emotional distraction is a central characteristic of
      MDD (Ochsner &amp; Gross 2005; Disner et al. 2011; Beck 2008). Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked with this deficit (Dolcos &amp; McCarthy 2006).
      Moreover, aberrant functional connectivity patterns have been found in MDD patients (Kaiser
      et al. 2015). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain
      stimulation method that has been largely investigated in experimental neurosciences and tDCS
      of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been proposed as novel treatment in MDD. So far,
      prefrontal tDCS has been shown to enhance cognitive control over emotional distraction in MDD
      patients (Wokenstein &amp; Plewnia 2013). Also, tDCS-induced connectivity changes found in fMRI
      studies comparing resting-state networks configurations before and after prefrontal tDCS may
      reflect a state of enhanced alertness (Keeser, Meindl, et al., 2011; Park et al., 2013).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of tDCS effects in
      MDD patients. For this purpose, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is
      collected during the execution of a cognitive control task as well as during a resting-state
      condition following real or sham tDCS. It is hypothesized that prefrontal tDCS as compared to
      sham a) reduces distractibility by compensating for deficient DLPFC activity and b) enhances
      functional connectivity in networks associated with externally directed attention or
      cognitive engagement.

      In this placebo-controlled study patients with a diagnosis of MDD receive a single treatment
      with prefrontal tDCS (anode over electrode position F3, cathode over F4, 20 min, 2mA
      intensity) or sham tDCS (frequency and duration correspondent active tDCS, ramp in and ramp
      out periods only without intermittent stimulation). Before, during, and after the treatment
      resting-state measurements in the fMRI scanner are conducted. Subsequently, participants
      perform the cognitive control task (in dependence of Plewnia, C., Schroeder, P. A., &amp;
      Wolkenstein, L. (2015)) in the scanner. The patients are assigned to either the real or sham
      tDCS condition according to a randomised, double-blind parallel design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women 18-65 years of age.

          -  Primary DSM-5 diagnosis of Major Depression as assessed by the Structured Clinical
             Interview for DSM-5 Axis I Disorders, Research Version (SCID-5-RV) with a single or
             recurrent episode with the additional requirements of a current episode with a
             duration of ≥4 weeks.

          -  Current depressive episode is less than 5 years duration (the definition of an episode
             is demarcated by a period of ≥2 months in which the patient did not meet full criteria
             for the DSM-5 definition of major depressive episode).
