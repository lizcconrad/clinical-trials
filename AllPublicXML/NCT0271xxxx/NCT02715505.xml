      This phase II study is designed to assess the safety of the Novartis product HSC835 and its
      ability to achieve donor blood stem cell engraftment in patients with certain Inherited
      Metabolic Disorders who undergo stem cell transplantation. A reduced intensity conditioning
      will be used prior to transplantation. Patients with Hurler syndrome, MLD, Krabbe or cALD
      could be eligible for this study.
