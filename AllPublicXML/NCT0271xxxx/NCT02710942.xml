  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal for this pilot study is to assess the acceptability of two online self-guided
      programs for migraines. The programs are part of the investigators' collection of &quot;my
      Wireless Headache Interventions&quot; (myWHI). The Specialized Program for Headache Reduction
      (SPHERE) is a program that teaches cognitive and behavioural skills/techniques to help manage
      headaches. The PeRsonalized Intervention for Self-Management of Migraine (PRISM) helps users
      to discover their headache triggers and provides recommendations for managing them. This
      pilot will also assess the feasibility of the study protocol to inform a full scale
      randomized controlled trial (RCT).

    <description>It is a comprehensive self-guided Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that includes three components: (1) the myWHI diary. (2) 30 multi-media learning topics that the user is encouraged to go through in a sequential way. The topics contain education information and teach strategies to cope better with their headaches.</description>

    <arm_group_label>PRISM intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>It is a targeted self-guided Internet-based CBT intervention. PRISM was built upon the myWHI diary, an electronic headache diary. PRISM helps users discover their headache triggers by analyzing the inputted diary data using association rule mining. Once one or multiple headache triggers are identified the application uses an algorithm to provide the user with a few personalized recommendations to help them to cope with these triggers. The algorithm is based on the opinion of clinical experts (e.g., medical health professionals, psychologists). The user chooses recommendations to follow and sets goals in the application to follow them. To support the process, the application checks in with users about their goals and tracks goal completion.</description>
