  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to complete a double-blinded randomized controlled crossover trial of
      lumbar plexus block with the Shamrock technique guided by ultrasound (US)/magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) image fusion vs. the Shamrock technique guided by ultrasound in healthy
      volunteers.

      The investigators will assess block procedure-related parameters, anatomical spread of local
      anesthetic, and motor and sensory effects.

    <measure>Number of participants with a successful block of the femoral and obturator nerves (reduced muscle force compared to baseline assessed with handheld dynamometer), and of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (assessed with cold and pinprick test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 60 minutes after intervention. Data will be presented 10 months after study completion.</time_frame>
    <description>Block success is defined as the number of volunteers with a successful motor block of the femoral nerve and the obturator nerve, and with a successful sensory block of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Motor block is a proxy marker of sensory block. A participant with a successful motor block has reduced muscle force after block compared to baseline muscle force assessed with handheld dynamometer, and a participant with a successful sensory block has decreased/absent sensation for cold and/or pinprick.</description>
