  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized multicentric study for endovascular treatment of patients with obstructive
      disease in the SFA (superficial femoral artery) and in the popliteal artery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This interventional study will collect data about the treatment of de novo lesions or
      restenotic lesions. Restenotic lesions that are previously DCB (drug coated balloon) treated
      or in-stent restenosis are excluded in this study.

      The primary objective of this randomized study is to compare the efficacy of the DCB (Legflow
      - Cardionovum) versus POBA for the treatment of de novo lesions or restenosis in the SFA and
      in the popliteal artery (segment P1 -P2) by assessing the binary restenosis rate with duplex
      ultrasonography at 12 months.

      The secondary endpoints are the assessment of the immediate procedural outcome, distribution
      of Rutherford, mortality, target lesion revascularization (TLR), target extremity
      revascularization (TER), amputation and anklebrachial index (ABI).

      For each patient enrolled, data will be collected up to 12 months after the procedure.
