      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody (mAb)
      VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) in preventing HIV-1 infection among men and transgender (TG)
      persons who have sex with men, in North America, South America, and Switzerland.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the VRC01 antibody in
      preventing HIV-1 infection in men and transgender (TG) persons who have sex with men, in
      North America, South America, and Switzerland.

      Participants will be randomized to receive VRC01 mAb by intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose
      of 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg every 8 weeks, or to receive control infusions every 8 weeks. All
      participants will receive the VRC01 antibody or placebo by IV infusion at Weeks 0 (study
      entry), 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, and 72. For 3 days following each infusion,
      participants will be asked to record and report any symptoms to study researchers.

      In addition to the infusion visits, participants will attend study visits at Weeks 4, 8 + 5
      days, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 68, 76, 80, 88, 96, and 104. All study visits will include
      blood collection and HIV testing and counseling. Select study visits will include a medical
      history review, physical exam, urine collection, pregnancy testing for participants capable
      of becoming pregnant, risk reduction counseling, and an interview/questionnaire.

             control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 704/HPTN 085 PSRT will determine
             eligibility on a case-by-case basis.

             participation: Volunteer with mild, stable and uncomplicated autoimmune disease that
             does not require consistent immunosuppressive medication and that, in the judgment of
             the site investigator, is likely not subject to exacerbation and likely not to

        Clinically Significant Medical Conditions

          -  Clinically significant medical condition, physical examination findings, clinically

             significant implications for current health. A clinically significant condition or
             process includes but is not limited to:

               -  Any contraindication to repeated infusions or blood draws, including inability to
                  establish venous access;

               -  A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert
                  grave danger to the volunteer's health or well-being during the study period; or

               -  A condition or process for which signs or symptoms could be confused with

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other condition that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to, protocol
             adherence, assessment of safety or infusion reactions, or a volunteer's ability to
             give informed consent

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are persons with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide,
             or history of suicide attempt or gesture within the past 3 years.

          -  Asthma, other than mild, well-controlled asthma

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (e.g., factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema

          -  History of receiving transplantation of life-saving organs or tissues (includes heart,
             kidney, pancreas, lungs, liver, and intestines)

          -  Known hepatic or renal dysfunction
