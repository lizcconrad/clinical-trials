    <textblock>
      This study will be to prospectively determine differences in SSI if a prolonged course of
      post-operative antibiotics are used following liver transplantation. All adult patients,
      admitted to the University of Virginia (UVA) Medical Center for first-time liver
      transplantation will be randomized to the standard of care of peri-operative antibiotics or
      extended course of three total days.

      Patients will be evaluated primarily for the presence of post-operative surgical site
      infections but also for fever, elevated white blood counts, secondary infections (urinary
      tract, pneumonia, and blood stream), length of hospital stay, graft loss, and mortality for
      30 days after liver transplant.

    <description>The standard of care at the University of Virginia Medical Center for liver transplantation patients is a 3.375 gram dose of piperacillin / tazobactam (Zosyn®) at the time of induction of anesthesia, though this dose may be adjusted for renal insufficiency. This dose is repeated during the operation every six hours.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>For those patients randomized to the study group, antibiotics will be started as per the usual intra-operative dosing regimen, then continued to provide coverage for 72 hours.
This is typically provided as additional doses of 3.375 grams of piperacillin / tazobactam (Zosyn®) every 8 hours for 3 total days (giving a total of 72 hours of antibiotic coverage), though this may be altered based on kidney function.</description>
