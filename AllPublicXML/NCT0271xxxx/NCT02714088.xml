  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-intensity interval training (HIT) has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to
      improve markers of health and fitness across a wide range of healthy and clinical
      populations. Currently however, there is only limited evidence which has examined the
      effectiveness of HIT in older adults (&gt;50 years). HIT is an appealing strategy in this group
      as it has the potential to impact both cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, which both
      play an important role in maintaining functional fitness and quality of life in a
      time-efficient manner. Developing an understanding of novel strategies for delivering this
      type of exercise training may ultimately provide a viable alternative to traditional modes of
      exercise training for a broader range of participants. As such, the purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the effects of a novel, high-intensity interval training exercise protocol to
      improve physical fitness in adults aged over 50 years. This research also aims to evaluate if
      this type of training intervention is feasible in this population, through analysis of
      adherence and intervention fidelity.

    <description>Participants will undertake a high-intensity interval training intervention, completing two exercise sessions per week for 12 weeks. The exercise sessions will consist of 4 sets of 4-6 repetitions of 60s (45s high-intensity exercise, followed by 15s rest), interspersed with 3 minutes rest. During each exercise repetition participants will be encouraged to reach &gt;90% of their maximal heart rate.</description>
