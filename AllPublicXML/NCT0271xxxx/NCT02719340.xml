  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although long-segment posterior spinal fixation might provide more rigid fixation, the
      procedure increases perioperative morbidities in the elderly. The present study reviews the
      results of short-segment decompression and reconstruction in thoracolumbar fragile fractures.

      This study included 20 elderly patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures and
      neurological compromise. The participants were followed-up for a period of 40.6 (24-68)
      months. A visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to
      measure back pain and disability. Radiologic assessment and neurological status were also
      analyzed.
