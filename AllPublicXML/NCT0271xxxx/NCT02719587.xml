    <textblock>
      The investigators primary objective in this clinical intervention study, therefore, was to
      explore the impact of omega-3 PUFAs in conjunction with scaling and root planing on salivary
      markers (in patients with chronic periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>

      Thirty systemically healthy subjects with chronic periodontitis were enrolled and randomly
      allocated into two groups. The control group (n=15) was treated with scaling and root planing
      (SRP)+placebo whereas the test group (n=15) was treated with SRP and dietary supplementation
      of low-dose omega-3 PUFAs (6.25 mg EPA and 19.19 mg DHA). Clinical parameters were taken at
      baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months following therapy. Saliva samples were obtained at the same time
      intervals and analyzed for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).

    <description>Test group (8 males, 7 females; 40.87±9.7 years) (SRP+omega-3 PUFAs): SRP followed by omega-3 PUFAs supplementation. The test drug contained omega-3 PUFAs including 6.25 mg EPA and 19.19 mg DHA obtained from the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar.Both test and placebo drugs were taken twice a day by the patients for six months. Subjects came to the clinic every 4 weeks during the 6 month course of the experiment to replenish their medication. Remaining medications were checked for compliance. At each evaluation visit (1, 3 and 6 months), oral soft and hard tissue examinations and adverse-event evaluations were performed.</description>
