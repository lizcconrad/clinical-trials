  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is still a challenge for urologic surgeon to prevent the post transurethral resection of
      bladder tumor (TURBT) recurrence of moderate-high risk non-muscle invasive bladder tumor.
      Adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard treatment for local progressive bladder tumor, which
      contains mainstream GC treatment scheme. It is common to observe clinically moderate-high
      risk NMIBC recurrence after routine intravesical instillation.Systematic chemotherapy can
      eliminate remained tumor cells especially those from mucosa basal cells so as to improve the
      prognosis of patients. Our clinical trial aims to investigate whether the utilization of
      combination of GC treatment scheme and epirubicin instillation would decrease the recurrence
      of moderate-high risk NMIBC.

    <textblock>
      Prevention of the post-transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) recurrence of
      moderate-high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer(NMIBC) is still a difficult problem.
      NMIBC was classified as low, moderate and high risk patients. Moderate-high risk NMIBC
      contained those are multiple, recurrent, II-III grade, tumor diameter &gt;3cm, invasive to
      submucosa and associated with carcinoma in situ. For those patients, no matter which
      treatment was conducted, for example, exchanging instillation drugs, increasing medicine
      dose, appending adjuvant drugs and prolonging instillation time, would not improve the
      prognosis of these patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard treatment for local
      progressive bladder tumor, which contains mainstream GC treatment scheme. For muscle invasive
      bladder cancer patients, radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy will improve
      patients' tumor grade and increase overall survival and disease specific survival
      rate.Systematic chemotherapy can eliminate remained tumor cells especially those from mucosa
      basal cells so as to improve the prognosis of patients. Our clinical trial aims to
      investigate whether the utilization of combination of GC treatment scheme and epirubicin
      instillation would decrease the recurrence of moderate-high risk NMIBC. In addition, we also
      would like to investigate the improvement of life quality after TURBT of moderate-high risk
      NMIBC.

Intervention: GC scheme systematic chemotherapy was underwent 5 days after TURBT, which contained gemcitabine 1000-1200mg/m2. Cisplatin (70mg/m2) was intravenous dripped in the first and 8th day after TURBT. Intravenous rehydration was conducted in the second day.</description>
