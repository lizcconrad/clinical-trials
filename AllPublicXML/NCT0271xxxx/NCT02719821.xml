  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to refine and evaluate the feasibility of a brief, behavioral
      intervention to improve the recovery following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT). Cancer patients who were treated with HSCT will learn behavioral techniques to
      improve sleep and increase daytime activity with the goal of alleviating insomnia, fatigue,
      and depression after HSCT. If the intervention is feasible and acceptable to patients, a
      future study will test the effects in a larger trial, with the long-term goal of improving
      the care and quality of life of cancer survivors recovering from HSCT.

      Details of the assessment strategy:

      Patient-reported outcomes:

      Participants will complete self-report measures prior to HSCT and 9 (mid-intervention) and 18
      weeks (post-intervention) post-HSCT. The sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression modules
      of the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) will be the
      primary outcomes. The investigators will compare performance with more established
      instruments the investigation team has previously used: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),
      Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS)
      depression subscale.

      Actigraphy:

      The Actiwatch-2 (Philips Respironics), a wrist-worn actigraphy device, will be used to
      objectively quantify circadian rest-activity patterns over a continuous 7-day period using
      1-minute sampling epochs at three time points: prior to HSCT and 9 (mid-intervention) and 18
      weeks (post-intervention) post-HSCT. The following indices will be calculated: mesor (mean
      activity level), amplitude (rhythm height), acrophase (time of day the rhythm peaks), and
      R-squared (robustness of the rhythm). Participants will complete a concurrent nightly sleep
      log, and traditional sleep parameters will be calculated from both the logs and actigraphy,
      including total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset
      (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE). For daytime activity, calibration thresholds will be used
      to aggregate activity data into steps and minutes spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and
      vigorous activity

    <description>Study investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews approximately one week after each session to determine participant satisfaction with and acceptability of the behavioral strategies, timing, delivery mode, assessment strategy, and time commitment; the interviews will be audio recorded. Participants will be asked about barriers to participation and problems encountered as well as areas of satisfaction with each of the aforementioned elements. Recordings will be reviewed to generate a list of barriers and facilitators of participation.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of the assessment strategy</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be assessed by examining the aforementioned semi-structured interview data and rates of completion of self-report measures and actigraphy.
We will examine rates of completion of the following self-report measures:
NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression modules; Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI); Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) depression subscale
We will examine rates of completion of sufficient actigraphy data for calculating the following indices:
Mesor (mean activity level); Amplitude (rhythm height); Acrophase (time of day the rhythm peaks); R-squared (robustness of the rhythm); total sleep time (TST); sleep onset latency (SOL); wake time after sleep onset (WASO); sleep efficiency (SE)</description>
