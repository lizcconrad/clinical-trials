      The aim of the study is to develop robust analytical protocols for first-void urine sample
      preparation and biomarker assays to analyze a panel of biomarkers in first-void urine for
      improved diagnosis of cervical (pre)cancer lesions.

      In total 100 women will be included in this trial, women diagnosed with abnormal cytology
      results and/or high risk HPV (Human Papillomavirus) infection scheduled for a colposcopy
      exam. These women are asked to collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device,
      prior to their colposcopy exam at the clinic. The collected urine samples will be used for
      the development and optimisation of robust analytical protocols for first-void urine sample
      preparation and biomarker assays.

      During colposcopy, the cervix will be visually inspected, whether or not combined with a
      biopsy for histological confirmation. Colposcopy is a procedure to identify abnormalities by
      using a colposcope that gives an illuminated, magnified view of the cervical region. It often
      includes rinsing the cervicovaginal region with 50 ml acetic acid (5%). Here, this fluid will
      be collected and serve as the intermediate step between biomarkers in cervicovaginal
      secretions and urine.

    <description>Women (25-64 years old) with abnormal cytology results and/or (high risk) HPV infection refered for colposcopy, and hence possibly diagnosed with an (high risk) HPV infection and/or cervical (pre)cancerous lesions.
No clinical evaluations/interventions will be performed by our research group. Participants have an already scheduled colposcopy exam. However, this visit is not an extra investigation that the participants should undergo when participating in the study.</description>

    <description>Healthy women (25-64 years old), falsely diagnosed with abnormal cytology and/or (high risk) HPV infection, but referred for colposcopy, are included as negative controls. Based on a specificity of 76.14% of the HPV type-specific PCR (polymerase chain reaction) used, an estimated 24 out of these 100 participants will be incorrectly scheduled for colposcopy and serve as the control group.
No clinical evaluations/interventions will be performed by our research group. Participants have an already scheduled colposcopy exam. However, this visit is not an extra investigation that the participants should undergo when participating in the study.</description>

        The cohort of women involves 100 women, diagnosed with an abnormal smear and/or high risk
        HPV infection (cytology results already available) requested for colposcopic examination.
        During this colposcopic examination, cervical samples are collected and send to the
        pathology laboratory. In addition, these women are asked to collect a first-void urine
        sample with the Colli-PeeTM device and fill in a questionnaire, prior to their colposcopy
        exam at the clinic (UZA), during which a cervicovaginal lavage fluid sample will be
        collected as well.
