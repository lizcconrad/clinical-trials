    <description>Changes in patient-reported QoL status is assessed using EORTC core quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30 with the HCC-specific module EORTC QLQ-HCC18. EORTC QLQ-HCC18 is an 18-item questionnaire designed to be used along with the 30-item EORTC QLQ-C30. EORTC QLQ-HCC18 questionnaire includes 8 symptom scales such as fatigue, jaundice, nutrition, pain, fever, abdominal swelling, sexual interest, and body image. These scores range from 0-100 for the role functioning scale, physical function scale and the other QLQ-C30 scales and HCC18 symptom complexes.</description>
