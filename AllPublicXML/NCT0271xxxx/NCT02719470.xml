  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to explore the question how an intensive, goal-based and aerobic rehabilitation
      treatment, addressed to act on motor and mental aspects, affects motor and functional
      symptoms in PD patients with normal cognition and with different level of cognitive
      impairment. Hypothesis is that a specific rehabilitation program based on motor-cognitive
      training and repetition, can affect positively the rehabilitation outcome regardless of
      baseline cognitive profile.

      Objective: This study is aimed to evaluate the impact of cognitive decline on rehabilitation
      outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD). While cognitive status is considered as a determinant
      of rehabilitation outcome, no studies about this issue have been performed before.

      Methods: 438 PD patients hospitalized for a 4-weeks Multidisciplinary Intensive
      Rehabilitation Treatment (MIRT) were enrolled. According to Mini Mental State Examination
      (MMSE), patients were divided into: normal cognition (MMSE 27-30), mild cognitive impairment
      (MMSE 21-26), moderate or severe cognitive impairment (MMSE ≤ 20). According to Frontal
      Assessment Battery (FAB), subjects were divided into patients with normal (FAB ≥ 13.8) and
      pathological (FAB &lt; 13.8) score. The outcomes measures were: Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale (UPDRS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Six Minutes
      Walking Test (6MWT), Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale (PDDS).

    <description>MIRT consists of a 4-week physical therapy, in a hospital setting, which entails four daily sessions for five days and one hour of physical exercise on the sixth day. The duration of each session is about one hour. The first session consists of a one-to-one session with physical therapist involving muscle stretching. The second session includes aerobic exercises to improve balance and gait using different devices: a stabilometric platform, treadmill plus, crossover and cycloergometer. The third is a session of occupational therapy to improve autonomy in everyday activities. The last session includes one hour of speech therapy</description>
