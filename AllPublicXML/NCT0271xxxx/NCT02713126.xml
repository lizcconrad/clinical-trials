  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction will undergo 12 weeks of
      cardiac rehabilitation for exercise training (ET) and be randomized to either nebulized
      sodium nitrite inhalation solution or placebo inhalation solution (normal saline) through the
      training period. Study drug is administered 3 times daily during daytime hours with one of
      these doses being immediately prior to onset of ET sessions throughout the 12 week trial. The
      objective is to determine if the inhaled sodium nitrite improves the clinical responses and
      tolerability of ET.
