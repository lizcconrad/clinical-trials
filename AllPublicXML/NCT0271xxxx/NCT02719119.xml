    <textblock>
      Many physicians suggest repeating EVL every 1-2 weeks until esophageal varices are
      obliterated to prevent variceal rebleeding， however, the evidences supporting the efficacy of
      EVL intervals of 1-2 weeks are insufficient.This randomized controlled study was conducted in
      order to compare the long-term results of EVL when performed at two different results from
      monthly and bi-weekly treatments.

    <textblock>
      Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is a safe and simple procedure now being used on a
      widening scale. A lot of patients who undergo endoscopic treatment for esophageal varices
      eventually require additional treatment for recurrent varices. Many physicians suggest
      repeating EVL every 1-2 weeks until esophageal varices are obliterated to prevent variceal
      rebleeding， however, the evidences supporting the efficacy of EVL intervals of 1-2 weeks are
      insufficient.This randomized controlled study was conducted in order to compare the long-term
      results of EVL when performed at two different results from monthly and bi-weekly treatments.

    <description>Elective band ligation was applied after premedication with hyoscine-N-butylbromide (20 mg intramuscularly). A multiband ligator and video endoscopes were utilized. Ligation was initiated at or slightly below the bleeding point. During each treatment session, each varix was ligated with one or two elastic bands. Variceal obliteration success was when all varices disappeared or residual varices were too small to be ligated further. Once esophageal varices were obliterated, surveillance endoscopy was performed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months to check for recurrent varices. Patients in this group will underwent endoscopic variceal ligation monthly.</description>
