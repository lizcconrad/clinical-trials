  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thiazide diuretics will be more effective in lowering urine calcium excretion if taken at
      night as compared to the daytime. It will therefore be more effective in reducing kidney
      stone recurrence in nephrolithiasis patients with elevated urine calcium who are known to
      have increased risk of kidney stones at night time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided into three phases for every single patient, investigators will
      study 15-20 stone formers who have previously documented elevated urine calcium excretion,
      with a plan to measure their urine chemistries at baseline (if they currently use thiazide
      diuretics, they will come off of their respective thiazide for a 7-day washout period).
      Investigators will ask them to collect urine samples in two 12-hour intervals: on awakening,
      the 1st sample starts to before supper; 2nd sample begins after dinner and extends overnight
      with fasting after dinner, These measurements will be used as controls. Then patients will be
      started back on diuretics (25mg of chlorthalidone for the primary study; pending the results
      this may be repeated with 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide as a second substudy) which they will
      take in the daytime; after a 6-day acclimation period, two 12-hour urine samples will be
      collected as in the washout period. For the third study period, the patients will then begin
      taking the thiazide after dinner. After a 6-day acclimation period, the third set of urine
      collections will be done.
