      TAPESTRY-CM pilot study is a 12-week pilot test of the TAPESTRY-CM using a web application
      (APP) to help patient manage their diabetes and hypertension and other chronic conditions by
      assisting them in setting goals and connecting them to their healthcare team.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a program evaluation that will employ developmental evaluation techniques
      to collect qualitative and quantitative data that will be handled, using a sequential
      explanatory mixed methods approach.Developmental evaluation is particularly useful for
      pre-formative development of potential scalable interventions. Developmental evaluation
      tracks and attempts to make sense of what emerges under conditions of complexity, documenting
      and interpreting the dynamics, interactions, and interdependencies that occur as innovations
      unfold. It will be helpful to explicitly understand: 1) what important decisions occur during
      the TAPESTRY-CM intervention development process and; 2) what data have validated those
      decisions about how the intervention will be structured and delivered. This understanding
      will provide a basis for describing key decisions and their rationale to our community and to
      other communities so that they make more informed adaptations to their local context.

      TAPESTRY-CM has applied the principles of participatory design by engaging community
      stakeholders to co-create and refine TAPESTRY-CM interventions in the early phases of the
      project.

      The use of mixed methods was purposefully chosen for this developmental evaluation. Answering
      a set of related research questions which included the collecting, analyzing and interpreting
      of qualitative and quantitative data increases the depth of understanding of results,
      provides stronger evidence for patterns or themes if data converge, can neutralize or cancel
      out some of the disadvantages of each method alone, and explicitly recognizes that social
      phenomena are complex such that varied methods are helpful to best understand these
      complexities.
