      Objectives:

      The overall goal of this study is to use the principles of chronic disease management to
      develop and test an online social networking intervention using the FB platform in a
      randomized controlled trial. Our specific objectives are as follows:

      Aim 1: To develop and establish an independent closed community in FB for patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis, providing an educational platform for disease self-management and the
      potential for engaging in social networking with peers (Phase 2).

      Objective 1. To beta test the features and navigation buttons and panels in the newly
      developed website and FB group.

      Objective 2. To evaluate the contents, ease of use and satisfaction with the newly developed
      website and FB group by patient advocates (consultants to the study) who participate as
      members of the Facebook community.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the efficacy of the FB community intervention combined with an educational
      website to improve patients' self-management (including knowledge, which is the primary
      outcome), decision making and patient-reported outcomes compared with the educational website
      alone (Phase 3). We hypothesize that participation in an online closed community offering
      evidence-based information combined with peer interaction and support will improve patients'
      knowledge.

      Pilot Testing Phase:

      Five participants will be recruited to pilot test and give feedback on the control
      educational website and the FB community. Participants will have access to the educational
      website and FB, for a period of one week. The main purpose is to test ease of use and
      satisfaction with both platforms. After 1 week, research staff will call the participant to
      obtain feedback about the websites. The interview will last approximately 30 minutes and in
      the case the participant does not finish the interview, the investigators will conduct a
      follow-up phone interview.

      Randomization Phase:

      Participants will complete a self response electronic questionnaire at baseline. Participants
      then randomized into one of two arms: Intervention (FB + Website) and Control (Website
      alone). The participant will be shown how to access the website and the Facebook page on the
      internet about rheumatoid arthritis. Patients will be assessed at three and six months after
      baseline via email self response electronic questionnaires. This phase will recruit 220
      participants.
