  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for teenage youth in Canada, and every year tens of
      thousands of young people engage in suicidal behaviors. Many young people manifest red-flag
      behaviors in the digital realm before these incidents occur. The faceless nature of online
      communication often emboldens youth to reveal details about their mental state: leaving
      tell-tale signs or &quot;bread crumbs&quot; of their suicidal intentions or behaviors.

      This research will examine the content of adolescents social media entries to find red flags
      and detect patterns in social media interactions of adolescents that could be predictive of
      subsequent suicide risk. The study participants will be patients admitted to Child and
      Adolescent Psychiatry Emergency unit at BCCH, subdivided into two groups: those admitted due
      to suicidal behaviors, and those admitted for non-suicidal behaviors. The text of social
      media activity for the month prior to emergency admission of the two groups will be
      collected, anonymized, and analyzed using text-analytic algorithms. The objective of the
      study is to find patterns and indicators of social media entries, prior to admission, that
      would have been predictive of suicidality.

      The implications of successful outcome of this project for mental health care of children and
      adolescents reaches well beyond the scope of this study. An objective method to predict risk
      of suicidal behaviors in youth has application in almost all pediatric clinical settings. The
      outcomes of this project will also serve as the foundation for further utilization of social
      sensing technology to identify, predict, and prevent many other mental health crises in
      children and adolescents.

        We aim to recruit a total of 200 subjects in the four different arms of the study. First
        arm: 50 adolescents admitted to CAPE because of potentially lethal suicidal behavior. This
        group consists of patients whose suicidal behavior could have ended their lives or
        significantly compromised their health in the absence of timely interception or
        intervention. We use this cohort as a proxy for &quot;would be&quot; completers. Second arm: 50
        adolescents admitted to CAPE because of non-lethal suicidal behavior. This group includes
        patients who are admitted because of suicidal ideation without any attempt, or suicidal
        behaviors that would not have ended their lives or caused significant compromise in their
        health. Third arm: 50 adolescents admitted to CAPE due to mental health crises other than
        suicidal behavior. Fourth arm: 50 adolescents admitted to BCCH for reasons not related to
        mental health.
