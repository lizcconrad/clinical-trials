    <textblock>
      This phase Ⅱ clinical study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the
      novel recombinant HPV type 6/11 bivalent vaccine, manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO.,
      LTD., in healthy volunteers aged 18-55 years of age at enrollment. The study volunteers would
      be randomized to receive the 3 different formulations of the novel HPV vaccine or placebo
      vaccine (recombinant hepatitis E vaccine) administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6
      month schedule. This is a double-blind study.

          6. Had a fever (axillary temperature over 38°C) within 3 days or acute illness requiring
             systemic antibiotics or antiviral treatment within 5 days before vaccination.

          7. Having the plan to participate another clinical trial during the study period.

          8. Received another HPV vaccine.

          9. Immunodeficiency (such as HIV carriers), primary disease of important organs,
             malignant tumor, .or any immune disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus,
             arthritis pauperum, splenectomy or functional asplenia or other disease which might
