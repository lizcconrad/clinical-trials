    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded study to be conducted at a single research center, San Diego Sexual
      Medicine. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive flibanserin for an
      8-week run-in period to differentiate between responders and non-responders. Responders will
      be determined by a score of 1-3 on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) at 8
      weeks from baseline, and will be randomized 1:1 to receive study medication alone vs. study
      medication and sex therapy for an additional 12 weeks.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether efficacy of flibanserin as determined by changes in the desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) in women who respond to the study medication is greater when sex therapy is performed concomitant with the use of the medication.</description>
