      Glucocorticoids remain to be among the most important and most frequently used
      anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive or immune-modulatory acting drugs to treat rheumatic
      (and other) diseases. Unfortunately, glucocorticoids also exert undesired effects, especially
      if higher dosages have to be given over longer periods of time. The available data describing
      frequency and severity of these adverse effects are fragmentary. This statement is especially
      true for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) in the context of chronic inflammatory
      rheumatic diseases or (in part) psoriasis(arthritis). The state of knowledge and scientific
      data, being sparse, is partly conflicting and often derived from over-aged projects or
      studies. Therefore, there are urgent needs to work on various current questions
      systematically and at the highest scientific level possible. In order to address these needs,
      we aim at collecting and analyzing disease- and bone-related data from patients with chronic
      inflammatory rheumatic diseases or psoriasis and therapy with glucocorticoids, and to build a
      respective GIOP-Databank. Patients will attend for diagnostics, and where necessary therapy
      and follow-up of GIOP, according to current guidelines. Clinical, laboratory and instrumental
      examination results from more than 1000 patients in the first three years of the project are
      planned to be documented in a prospective database.

      frequency and severity of these adverse effects are fragmentary. This statement is especially
      true for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) in the context of chronic inflammatory
      rheumatic diseases or (in part) psoriasis(arthritis), since GIOP is counted among the two
      most important adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy, by both rheumatologists and
      patients. The state of knowledge and scientific data, being sparse, is partly conflicting and
      often derived from over-aged projects or studies. Therefore, there are urgent needs to work
      on various current questions systematically and at the highest scientific level possible. In
