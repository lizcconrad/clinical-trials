      To assess the equivalence of MYL-1401A to Humira® with regards to efficacy in subjects with
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned based on predefined stratification factors of
      weight, geographic region, and presence of psoriatic arthritis:

      Randomization is 2:1 to MYL-1401A or Humira®, respectively.

      The study will be conducted in the outpatient setting and comprises 3 periods: a screening
      period of up to 4 weeks, a 52-week treatment period, and a safety follow-up for 8 weeks.

      A subject will be considered to have completed the study once they have completed the 52-week
      treatment period and the 8-week follow-up visit.
