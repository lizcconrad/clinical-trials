  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety of treating men with oligometastatic prostate cancer with the following
      therapy: (1st) Systemic chemo-hormonal therapy with up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of neoadjuvant
      androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control
      with prostatectomy +/- adjuvant radiation therapy, and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic
      radiation to oligometastatic lesions. The men will receive a total of 1 year of androgen
      deprivation. Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the course of treatment.

  <detailed_description>

      Neoadjuvant treatment (month 1 through ~6): All patients will be treated with up to 6 months
      of androgen deprivation, plus up to 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. Following docetaxel
      therapy, patients with a PSA response of at least a 50% decrease from baseline, will proceed
      to maximum consolidative therapy.

      Local consolidation (month 7 though ~11): After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the men
      will be treated with definitive local therapy with radical prostatectomy (RP) +/- adjuvant
      radiation therapy (RT). After definitive local therapy, patients will be treated with
      consolidative stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the metastatic sites.

      Systemic consolidation: Patients will continue on androgen deprivation for a total of 1 year.
      They will be followed clinically and monitored with serum testosterone and PSA until 2-years
      after completion of systemic consolidation. Androgen blockade will be the same throughout the
      course of treatment.

             up to 6-months (~24 weeks) of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and up to 6 cycles of
             chemotherapy, (2nd) definitive local tumor control with prostatectomy +/- adjuvant
             radiation therapy, and (3rd) consolidative stereotactic radiation to oligometastatic

             deprivation.

          6. Oligometastatic prostate cancer: Stage T1-4, N0-1 and/or M1a-b (up to 5 metastatic
             lesions- including bone lesions and non-regional lymph nodes seen on bone scan,
             contrast enhanced CT scan, or PET scan)

          7. Able to swallow the study drugs whole as tablets

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior local therapy to treat prostate cancer (e.g. radical prostatectomy, radiation
             therapy, brachytherapy)

          2. Prior therapy to a metastatic site.

          3. Prior or ongoing systemic therapy for prostate cancer including, but not limited to:

               1. Hormonal therapy (e.g. leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, degarelix)

               2. CYP-17 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole)

               3. Antiandrogens (e.g. bicalutamide, nilutamide)

                  therapy was recently initiated (&lt;90 days duration)). In the event that hormone
                  therapy was initiated prior to study enrollment, the clock for 1 year of androgen
                  deprivation would begin at the time of therapy initiation, rather than at study
                  enrollment.

          4. Evidence of serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other
             condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that could interfere with patient
             safety or provision of informed consent to participate in this study.

             count &lt;100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL]

          7. Abnormal liver function (bilirubin &gt;ULN; AST, ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal)

          8. Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min. CrCl should be calculated suing the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula.

          9. Active cardiac disease defined as active angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             or myocardial infarction within previous six months.

         10. Prior history of malignancy in the past 3 years with the exception of basal cell and
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Other malignancies that are considered to have a
             low potential to progress may be enrolled at discretion of PI.
