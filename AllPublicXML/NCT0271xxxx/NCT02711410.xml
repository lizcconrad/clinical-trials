      Background:

      Clopidogrel, an antiplatelet prodrug, is widely used for prevention of the recurrent
      cardiovascular events. CYP2C19 is one of the crucial enzymes for the activation of
      clopidogrel. Recent studies, mostly done in cardiovascular patients, showed association of
      the CYP2C19 genotypes with recurrent cardiovascular events. However, prospective data on the
      impact of the genetic variants in stroke patients are limited.

      Methods:

      Five hundred and eighteen Japanese non-acute stroke patients treated with clopidogrel were
      registered at 14 institutions. Three CYP2C19 variants (CYP2C19*2, *3, *17) were genotyped and
      the patients were classified into three clopidogrel metabolizer groups inferred from the
      CYP2C19 genotypes: extensive (EM: *1/*1), intermediate (IM: *1/*2 or *1/*3), and poor (PM:
      *2/*2, *2/*3, or *3/*3). The CYP2C19*17 carriers were excluded from the analysis. The
      antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel were assessed by Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -induced
      platelet aggregation and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation,
      expressed as VASP index. The endpoint was the composite incidence of stroke, transient
      ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, revascularization, other thromboembolic disease, or
      cardiovascular death during 2 years of follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome of the study was recurrent cardiovascular event (CVEs), including ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), acute myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization, other thromboembolic disease, and cardiovascular death.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two Years</time_frame>
    <description>Ischemic stroke was defined as a new neurologic deficit of cardiovascular origin lasting at least &gt; 24 hours based on radiological evidence of stroke. TIA was defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain ischemia and improving within 24 hours. Urgent revascularization was defined as emergent revascularization for unexpected hospitalization. Acute myocardial infarction was defined as myocardial cell necrosis in the setting of ischemic symptoms and electrocardiogram changes (ST segment elevation or depression, development of Q waves) and/or rising specific cardiac biomarkers. Cardiovascular death was defined as death due to stroke, myocardial infarction or documented sudden cardiac death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary outcome was major bleeding (intracranial haemorrhage, documented retroperitoneal bleed, and any red blood cell transfusion rates or proportion with bleeding associated with a ≧2g/dl hemoglobin drop).</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Intracranial haemorrhage retroperitoneal bleed were defined on radiological evidence. Proportion with bleeding associated with a ≧2g/dl hemoglobin drop was assessed by Blood laboratory test.</description>

      Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. The genotypes of the CYP2C19*2
      (c.681G&gt;A, rs4244285), *3 (c.636G&gt;A, rs4986893), and *17 (c.-806C &gt; T, rs12248560) variants
      were determined by the TaqMan genotype discrimination method (Applied Biosystems, Foster
      City, CA, USA) using commercially available primers and probes purchased from the
      Assay-on-Demand system.

        Patients were recruited at each institution between October 2009 and March 2012. The
        investigators enrolled males and females aged 20 years or older who had experienced
        cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (except for cardiogenic embolism) in
        the prior 3 years but not in the last one month, who received long-term clopidogrel therapy
        (75 mg once a day) for the secondary prevention (for at least one month), and who were
        willing and able to give written informed consent.

          -  Males and females aged 20 years or older who were prescribed clopidogrel for the
