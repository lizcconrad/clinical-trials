    <textblock>
      The restorative management of molars with Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) represents a
      challenge in the clinical practice with high failure rate. Thus, this clinical trial aimed to
      evaluate the clinical survival of direct composite resin restorations in first permanent
      molars (FPMs) that are affected by MIH, comparing two adhesive systems.

    <textblock>
      For the research, it was selected first permanent molars (FPMs) with MIH from children aged
      6-8 years. FPM fully erupted and with restorative treatment needed was the inclusion
      criteria. We excluded FPMs with destroyed crowns. The FPMs were randomly assigned to two
      groups: G1 (self-etching adhesive) and G2 (total-etching adhesive). Clinical evaluation was
      performed during 18 months according to the USPHS-Modified by a blinded examiner. The
      actuarial method was used to evaluate survival of the restorations and Fisher's exact test
      was used to compare differences between the groups (α=5%).

    <description>20 first permanent molars from children aged between 6 to 12 years old presenting MIH will be included. A calibrated pediatric dentist examined the selected teeth to classify MIH according to the European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (EADP) criteria.
Intervention of Control: The restorative treatment using a total-etching adhesive system, which was performed according to the following operative sequence: prophylaxis, infiltrative anesthesia, rubber dam, application of 37.5% phosphoric acid to enamel (30 s) and dentine (15 s), extensive washing, drying with cotton and air jet (5 s), priming (5 s), light curing (20 s), restoration with composite resin (Filtek XT350), examination of occlusal contact, and final polishing.</description>
