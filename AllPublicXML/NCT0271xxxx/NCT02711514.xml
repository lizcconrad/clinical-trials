      Comparison of Crossover rates of Radial Cardiac Catheterizations and/or PCIs into femoral vs

    <textblock>
      A retrospective review of 1000 consecutive Radial or Ulnar Cardiac Catheterizations and/or
      Percutaneous Coronary Interventions performed in our Institute by one single operator could
      provide us with the cross over rates to femoral interventions. In this manner these rates
      could be compared to the published rates of other institutions benchmarking our techniques
      with the outcomes for such interventions.
