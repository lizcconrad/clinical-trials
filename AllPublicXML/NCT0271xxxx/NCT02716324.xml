  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether using an online patient portal plus a Care
      Manager is more effective than using an online portal alone in managing care for children
      with ADHD. Doctors at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia currently use the online
      patient portal to help gather information from parents and teachers on ADHD symptoms,
      treatment, and medication side effects. The Care Manager is a person who meets with
      participants during the study to discuss their child's ADHD care. The Care Manager
      communicates with the child's doctor and teacher to communicate a parent's goals and
      preferences for their child's ADHD care.

    <textblock>
      Fragmentation in health care and poor communication across systems adversely impact
      engagement and adherence to treatment by children with ADHD and their families. Fragmentation
      of services for ADHD impairs communication and collaboration between families and primary
      care providers, mental health providers, and educators, and leads to suboptimal outcomes for
      children. Prior studies have documented that little communication and coordination exist
      among providers across different systems despite calls for better system integration.

      Fragmentation in communication between providers has the potential to impair shared
      decision-making. To promote shared decision-making, we have developed an electronic health
      record (EHR)-linked portal to collect information from parents, teachers and clinicians on
      children's ADHD symptoms and treatment-related preferences and goals. We have also developed
      an ADHD Care Manager intervention manual.

      Approximately 300 participants will be enrolled for this study. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to use either the EHR portal alone, or the EHR portal plus a Care Manager. For those
      assigned to the EHR portal plus Care Manager, the Care Manager will meet with families at the
      beginning of the study to confirm their treatment preferences and goals, provide additional
      education on ADHD treatment, and distribute handouts on common concerns among ADHD patients
      and families. The Care Manager will contact families weekly to every 3 months by phone,
      email, or in-person as needed to assess treatment use, identify new concerns, and assist
      families with problem-solving. Using the portal or other means, the Care Manager will also
      communicate with pediatric clinicians, mental health providers, and teachers to clarify
      family treatment preferences and goals and address emerging treatment issues. Participants
      will complete surveys that will assess ADHD symptoms, goal attainment, patient-reported
      outcomes, patient and family engagement and treatment initiation and adherence.

    <description>The ADHD portal is a web-based platform that permits access to parts of the hospital's electronic health record. The portal permits (1) capture and sharing of patient and family treatment preferences and goals, (2) monitoring of ADHD symptoms, treatment receipt, and side effects, and (3) assessing goal attainment. The system prompts for completion of periodic check-in surveys (bi-weekly to 3 months) with parents and teachers. Within the portal, preferences and goals for ADHD treatment are measured using the ADHD Preference Goal Instrument (PGI) (Fiks et al., 2012). Parents are encouraged to consult with their children when completing the tool.</description>
