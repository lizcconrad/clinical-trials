    <textblock>
      This trial will consist of three arms: Part A, Part B, and Part C. Part A has two groups. The
      first group will enroll adult subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) into a single ascending dose
      (SAD) treatment group. The second group will enroll adult subjects with CF, including those
      on background treatment with ORKAMBI® and those not on a cystic fibrosis transmembrane
      conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator, into a multiple ascending dose (MAD) treatment group.
      Part B will enroll adult subjects with CF currently on stable ORKAMBI® background therapy for
      a minimum of 3 months into a Phase II treatment group consisting of two cohorts. Part C will
      enroll adult subjects with CF, including those on background treatment with KALYDECO® and
      those not on a CFTR modulator, into a Phase II treatment group consisting of three cohorts.
      Approximately 136 subjects will be enrolled.

      PART A The SAD treatment group is comprised of 3 cohorts where subjects will be randomized to
      either PTI-428 or placebo. Following the conclusion of at least 3 SAD treatment groups, a set
      of adult subjects diagnosed with CF will participate in an assigned MAD treatment group. The
      MAD treatment group is comprised of 3 cohorts. MAD Cohort 1 will enroll adult subjects with
      CF currently on stable ORKAMBI® background therapy for a minimum of 3 months at the time of
      randomization. MAD Cohorts 2 and 3 will enroll adult subjects with CF who are not currently
      on any background therapies. Subjects in all MAD cohorts will be randomized to either PTI-428
      or placebo. Each dose will be administered once daily (QD) for a total of 7 Days.

      PART B Following the conclusion of MAD Cohort 1, a set of adult subjects diagnosed with CF
      currently on stable ORKAMBI® background therapy for a minimum of 3 months will participate in
      Part B. The Part B Phase II treatment group is comprised of 2 cohorts where subjects will be
      randomized to either PTI-428 or placebo. Each dose will be administered QD for a total of 28
      days.

      PART C Following the conclusion of Part B Phase II, a set of adult subjects diagnosed with CF
      will participate in Part C. The Part C Phase II treatment group is comprised of 3 cohorts.
      Part C Cohort 1 will enroll adult subjects with CF who are eligible to take, but not
      currently taking, ORKAMBI® in accordance with the approved label. Part C Cohort 2 will enroll
      adult subjects with CF currently on stable KALYDECO® background therapy for a minimum of 3
      months at the time of randomization. Part C Cohort 3 will enroll adult subjects with CF who
      are not currently on any background therapies and are pancreatic sufficient. Each PTI-428 or
      placebo dose will be administered QD for a total of 28 days.
