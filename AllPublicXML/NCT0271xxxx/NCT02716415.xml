      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Calmoseptine Ointment and
      Desitin Maximum Strength 40% Zinc Oxide Diaper Rash Paste in the treatment of diaper
      dermatitis among Neonates and Infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded clinical trial. Neonates
      born in UP-PGH or infants (&lt; 1 year of age) in the general pediatric wards for any condition
      who have diaper dermatitis are recruited and randomized to treatment with either Calmoseptine
      Ointment or Desitin Maximum Strength 40% Zinc Oxide Diaper Rash Paste as part of a structured
      skin care regimen. Each participant has one week total participation, unless withdrawn.
      Baseline data are collected and study treatment initiated on study entry day. Treatment
      continued and follow up data collected on six subsequent follow up days. Primary outcome:
      healing of Diaper Dermatitis after six days of treatment, defined as a Diaper Dermatitis
      Severity Score of zero attributed by blinded assessment. Secondary outcomes: Diaper
      Dermatitis Severity Score at each day of treatment; size of affected area; incidence of
      Candida infection; adverse events.

      Zinc Oxide Ointment preparations including Calmoseptine Ointment and Desitin Maximum Strength
      40% Diaper Rash Paste have been used to treat diaper dermatitis for many years around the
      world. There are no known reported hypersensitivities to either product and no reported
      serious adverse events. As the proposed study is in neonates and infants, as a precaution the
      evidence relating to the safety and toxicity of individual ingredients were reviewed for the
      trial protocol prior to commencement.

    <description>Complete healing of Diaper Dermatitis on final study day, as determined by Diaper Dermatitis Severity Scale. Possible score range from zero (0 - clear skin) ti six (6 - severe erythema, all or most of the diaper area affected, with papules and/or pustules, and open skin affecting the dermis). Complete healing is defined as a Diaper Dermatitis Severity Score of zero (0).
Assessment of the primary outcome used in final analyses will be blinded. For determination of final trial results for the primary outcome, sets of high definition photographs for each patient on each treatment day will be assessed by independent wound, Ostomy and Continence Nursing Certification Board (WOCNB) certified wound care expert assessors based in the USA, who are blinded to treatment allocation, not involved in the study.</description>

    <description>Diaper dermatitis severity, assessed as per primary outcome.
The size of area affected by diaper dermatitis is measured and recorded at baseline (study entry on Day 0) and on each follow up day (Days 1-6). Disposable paper tape measures are used to prevent cross-infection. Where more than one non-contiguous area is affected, each will be measured as described and added together. As the study will include neonates and infants up to one year of age, body size will differ significantly so that an affected area of a similar size may be more serious in one participant than in another. Accordingly, the mean body size and/or weight of treatment groups will be considered and the expression of area affected used in final analyses will be adjusted appropriately.</description>

             before completion of study participation will automatically be withdrawn from the
             study. Study participation will not under any circumstances lead to delay in a
             participant's discharge from hospital.)
