      This feasibility study evaluates acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of a digital
      health game as an intervention supporting tobacco-related health literacy in 10- to
      13-year-old early adolescents. One third of the study participants will receive the health
      game, on third a web page with similar content and one third will act as a control group
      without intervention.

    <description>Health game intervention consists of 20 minutes guided training session with the health game at school and 2 weeks free usage of the health game via own smart phone or tablet computer during free time. The health game includes textual information about the consequences of tobacco use, but also visualized elements that aim at supporting understanding of the information, and motivation and ability to use the information in daily life situations. The visualized content is presented in a format of a game including tasks, rules, goals, rewards and opponents. There are also sound effects and background music included in the game.</description>

    <description>Web page intervention consists of 20 minutes guided training session with the web page at school and 2 weeks free usage of the web page via own smart phone or tablet computer during free time. The web page includes textual information about the consequences of tobacco use, but also visualized elements that aim at supporting understanding of the information, and motivation and ability to use the information in daily life situations. The visualized elements are presented with pictures and video clips. These visualized elements do NOT contain game elements (NO activating tasks, rules, goals, rewards or opponents). The video clips contain sound effects, but no background music.</description>
