    <textblock>
      The study is to treat metformin dose-escalation diabetic subjects of all stages of renal
      failure (stages 1-5) and compare their rates of erythrocyte metformin (best reflections of a
      possible accumulation than those of plasma) to the therapeutic range. A number of 12 patients
      by stage is considered, 60 patients in total.
