  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of both a nurse-driven sedation
      protocol and daily sedative interruption, compared with a sedation protocol alone, result in
      better outcomes for mechanically ventilated adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients in the Intensive Care Unit receive
      medications to relieve pain and anxiety. However, accumulation of these medications can be
      associated with serious complications, most notably longer time on the breathing machine and
      in the ICU. Two strategies have been shown to dramatically improve patient outcomes:
      nurse-directed protocols for giving sedation, and daily interruption of sedation. However,
      these strategies have not been widely adopted, because of physicians' concerns, and because
      it is unclear which strategy is better. Given that patient outcome is improved with either of
      these strategies, the fundamental question that arises is whether patients managed with a
      combination of two strategies which both reduce drug accumulation (protocolized sedation and
      daily interruption) have an even better outcome than patients managed with only one of them
      (protocolized sedation).We are conducting a multicenter randomized trial in which 400
      critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients will have their sedation managed with
      protocolized sedation alone, or both strategies. Primary outcomes are duration of mechanical
      ventilation and ICU and hospital lengths of stay. Secondary outcomes are the incidence of
      delirium, the use of neurologic tests, nurse and respiratory therapist effort associated with
      the sedation management, the incidence of patient self-removal of lines and tubes, and
      patient recall of the ICU stay. The results of this large multi-center trial will help to
      inform best practice with regard to sedation management of critically ill patients in Canada
      and elsewhere.
