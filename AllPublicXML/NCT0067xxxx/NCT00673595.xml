  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate endothelial function and autonomic regulation (for
      example, heart rate and blood pressure) in smokers before and after short-term smoking
      cessation. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that lines the interior surface of
      blood vessels. The endothelium releases nitric oxide, which promotes dilation of the blood
      vessels and inhibits inflammation. Previous studies have shown that tobacco use is associated
      with endothelial dysfunction, and tobacco use increases heart rate and blood pressure.

      We hypothesize that 2 weeks of smoking cessation will improve endothelial function. We will
      also determine if endothelial function and autonomic regulation after short-term smoking
      cessation differs for patients that achieve abstinence with the smoking cessation agent
      varenicline compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is a major cardiovascular risk factor and is associated with arterial endothelial
      dysfunction, a key event in atherosclerosis. Previous observations have suggested that
      smoking-related endothelial dysfunction is dose-related and potentially reversible after
      withdrawal from smoking. To our knowledge, no data are available regarding potential
      improvement of arterial endothelial function in the first weeks of smoking cessation. This
      time frame is especially important because due to smoke-free policies in healthcare
      facilities, all smokers requiring surgery are abstinent from tobacco for at least some period
      of time.

      Varenicline, a partial agonist at α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetyl-choline (nAChR) receptors,
      received FDA approval as a novel medication for helping cigarette smokers to stop smoking.
      Given the anticipated common use of varenicline, it is important to define if the drug alters
      endothelial function and/or autonomic effects. Based on the lesser potency of varenicline
      (compared to nicotine) at nAChR receptors in peripheral ganglia and on endothelial cells of
      blood vessels, it may be hypothesized that varenicline has less or no influence on autonomic
      control of blood pressure and heart rate, and less or no influence on endothelial function.

      Therefore, the aims of this study are 1) to determine the effects of short-term smoking
      cessation on endothelial function and autonomic regulation, and 2) to determine if these
      effects will be altered during treatment with varenicline.

    <time_frame>2 weeks after participants quit smoking (study visit 3, day 15)</time_frame>
    <description>Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery will be measured using high-resolution ultrasound. Arterial diameter will be measured above the small cavity in the elbow joint from ultrasound images at rest in response to an increase in blood flow to the area. This blood flow will be induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff placed around the forearm to a pressure of at least 50 mm Hg above systolic pressure for 5 min, followed by release. The ultrasound image of the artery will be recorded continuously from 30 sec before until 2 min after cuff release.</description>

The treatment phase may be prolonged up to a maximum of 2 weeks under the following conditions: 1) the participant voluntarily agrees to the prolongation of the study, 2) both the participant and investigator are confident that the participant will be able to completely refrain from smoking for at least 10 days until the final study day.</description>
