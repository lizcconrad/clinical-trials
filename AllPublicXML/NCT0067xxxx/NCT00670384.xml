        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 55 years (inclusive.

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Documented allergy to short ragweed pollen as demonstrated by a positive epicutaneous
             skin test (wheal &gt;3 mm) and symptoms of allergic rhinitis during the two previous
             short ragweed seasons.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential, defined as not surgically sterile or at
             least 2 years postmenopausal, must agree to use one of the following forms of
             contraception from screening through the 4 week follow-up period following the last
             dose of Clinical Trial Material (CTM): hormonal (oral, implant, or injection) begun
             &gt;30 days prior to screening, barrier (condom, diaphragm with spermicide), Intrauterine
             Device (IUD), or vasectomized partner (6 months minimum).

          -  No clinically significant abnormal findings on the physical examination, with the
             exception of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT) findings consistent with
             allergic rhinitis, medical history, or clinical laboratory results during screening
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject
             or impact the validity of the study results

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous allergen immunotherapy (subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), oral
             immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), or recombinant peptide) for short
             ragweed within 24 months of the Screening Visit.

          -  History of severe allergic reaction requiring medical intervention.

          -  Intolerance of or severe allergic reaction to previous immunotherapy (SCIT, oral
             immunotherapy, SLIT, or recombinant peptide).

          -  Allergy to any of the non-antigen ingredients in the study drug formulation,
             including, but not limited to, Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Yellow #5, sodium
             chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and glycerine.

          -  History of asthma requiring daily medication.

          -  Subjects receiving anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies.

          -  Congenital immune deficiency or acquired immune suppression. Causes of acquired immune
             suppression may include, but are not limited to, systemic illnesses such as malignancy
             and infection, the use of medications such as corticosteroids and chemotherapeutic
             agents, and radiation therapy.

          -  History of organ transplant, hematologic malignancy, autoimmune disease, myocardial
             infarction, or congestive heart failure.

          -  History of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurologic,
             hematologic, endocrine, oncologic, pulmonary, psychiatric, or cardiovascular disease,
             or any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the
             safety of the subject or impact the validity of the study results.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to stop using drugs that may inhibit the wheal-and-flare
             reaction or rhinitic response prior to the study and for the duration of dosing CTM
             (with the exception of protocol-specified rescue medications provided by the study
             site for use after Study Day 0).

          -  Inability or unwillingness to stop using drugs that may inhibit the ability to treat a
             severe allergic adverse event. This includes, but is not limited to: beta blockers
             such as atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL) and propranolol
             (Inderal, Inderal LA) for 14 days prior to Study Day 0 and for the duration of the
             study

          -  Female subjects who are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are lactating.

          -  Positive serum pregnancy test at screening or a positive human chorionic gonadotropin
             (HCG) urine test on Study Day 0 prior to administration of study drug for women of
             childbearing potential.

          -  Positive blood screen for HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbSAg), or Hepatitis C.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within the year prior to the Screening Visit, or
