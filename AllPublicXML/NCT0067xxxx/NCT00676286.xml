    <textblock>
      This study will use high field MRI (3 Tesla), PET and biomarker to follow prostate cancers
      and determine if these tests can detect cancers that become aggressive.

      This study may lead to the identification of additional investigations that can monitor for
      signs of disease progression in active surveillance protocols. This can directly benefit
      patients by providing them with greater confidence that their disease is being accurately
      monitored. In addition, this study may be beneficial to the general management of prostate
      cancers by adding to our knowledge of these investigations characterizing prostate cancers.
