  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the value of ablation of high frequency sources
      following circumferential pulmonary veins isolation in patients with paroxysmal and
      persistent atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, accounts for
      one-third of arrhythmia hospitalizations and is associated with an increased risk of stroke,
      heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Moreover, there is an increasing AF prevalence due to
      aging of the population, a rising prevalence of chronic heart disease, and increased
      survival. Unfortunately, medications aimed at suppressing AF and maintaining sinus rhythm or
      at controlling ventricular rate are only marginally effective and may cause serious adverse
      effects. The limitations of pharmacologic treatment patterns have fuelled the development of
      new interventional strategies. Current techniques of AF ablation can achieve a 60-80%
      improvement in highly selected patients with medically refractory AF. However, the procedure
      is not without risk, is long-lasting and recurrence rates are still high. Moreover, the
      results in persistent AF patients are far from optimal, require the creation of extensive
      atrial lesions and repeated procedures. The main reason that explains the current situation
      is the incomplete understanding of mechanisms underlying AF maintenance despite many years of
      research and speculation. The incremental value of ablation of high frequency sources
      following circumferential PV isolation has not been assessed. There is no prospective data
      available as to the safety and benefit of such a combined approach in patients with
      paroxysmal and persistent AF. Such information would be very important in helping guide the
      future direction of ablative therapy for AF as well as helping to answer important questions
      about the role of high frequency sites in persistent AF treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients age 18 or older.

          -  Patients with paroxysmal AF symptomatic and refractory to at least one antiarrhythmic
             medication.

          -  In patients with paroxysmal AF, at least one episode of AF must have been documented
             by ECG or Holter within 12 months of randomization in the trial.

          -  Patients with persistent AF defined as a sustained episode that had been present for
             more than seven days without intervening spontaneous episodes of sinus rhythm and that
             recurred within seven days after cardioversion.

          -  Patients with persistent AF must be on continuous anticoagulation with warfarin (INR
             2-3) for&gt; 4 weeks prior to ablation. In patients with paroxysmal AF no continuous
             anticoagulation therapy with warfarin for &gt; 4 weeks prior to ablation will be needed
             provided a transesophageal echocardiogram performed prior to ablation exclude the
             presence of thrombi or other abnormalities that discourage performing the procedure.

          -  Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate
             in the clinical trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have previously undergone atrial fibrillation ablation, either by surgery
