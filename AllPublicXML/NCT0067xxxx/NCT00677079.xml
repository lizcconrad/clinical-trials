  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of iniparib (BSI-201/SAR240550) in
      patients with breast cancer gene-associated (BRCA) ovarian cancer.

      Up to 35 patients were to be treated using a Simon 2-stage optimal design, i.e. twelve were
      to be treated in a first stage, then if 2/12 patients responded to treatment as defined by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST), 23 additional patients were be treated
      in the second stage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants were treated for at least one 8-week cycle, with additional cycles as long as
      they had stable or responding disease (per RECIST criteria) and wished to remain on study.

      Participants had a final follow-up visit within 4 weeks following the last dose of iniparib,
      after which time they were contacted by study staff every 3 months for the first year and
      every 6 months thereafter to assess disease status and survival.
