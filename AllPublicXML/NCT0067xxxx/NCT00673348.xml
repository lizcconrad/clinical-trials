  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Voriconazole (VCZ), the antifungal drug active against Candida and Aspergillus is a substrate
      of CYP2C19, whose proportion of poor metabolizers is about ~20% in Asian population. The
      AUC's of VCZ differs over 4 folds by CYP2C19 genotypes of homozygotic wild type,
      heterozygote, and homozygotic poor metabolizers. The Asian population enrolled in the
      metabolism of VCZ were mainly Japanese and Chinese, without Korean subjects. The proportion
      of poor metabolizers in Korean population is known to be around 12% (Pharmacogenetics. 1996
      Dec;6(6):547-51). The importance of CYP2C19 genotypes on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      voriconazole is well established, Hence, it is desirable to individualize the dosage regimen
      of VCZ according to the genotypes of patients. Fungal infection in immunocompromised patients
      is a life threatening condition which needs critical care. Although the PK change by
      genotypes are well known, its clinical implication or need for different dosage regimen by
      genotypes is not established, yet.

      The investigators are trying to set up voriconazole (VCZ) therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) &amp;
      establish relationship with efficacy and safety in Korea. The investigators also want to
      propose the optimal dosage regimen for VCZ over different genotypes of CYP2C19 in the
      immunocompromised patients in Korea.

      -  Two times of venous blood sampling will be carried out at steady state. Three ml of
           venous blood is sampled right before the morning dose (trough sampling). The second
           sampling is carried out at any time point within 2-4 hours after the morning dose (peak
           sampling). To obtain the exact dose and sampling history, at least three dosing times
           around the trough and peak sampling will be recorded to the minute. Sampling time will
           also be recorded as clock time.

        -  Genotyping of CYP2C19 will also be performed using 3 ml of peripheral blood sampled into
           EDTA tubes.
