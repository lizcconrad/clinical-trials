      The purpose of this study is to test data collection options in emergency departments (EDs)
      and to enhance ED patient awareness of the risk of HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid HIV testing is a new technology that speeds receipt of HIV test results. Its use in EDs
      has been demonstrated, but patient acceptance of rapid testing in the ED has not been
      optimal. It is likely that the low acceptance is partially due to ED patients not realizing
      the risk of acquiring an HIV infection or the importance of knowing their HIV status. The
      purpose of this study is to test data collection options in EDs and to enhance ED patient
      awareness of the risk for HIV infection.

      This three phase study will take place at the Rhode Island Hospital Emergency Department.
      Each participant will be followed for the duration of their ED visit.

      In Phase I, the proportion of participants who are willing to undergo rapid HIV testing in
      the ED will be measured. Additionally, the HIV testing history of these participants, their
      reasons for undergoing testing or for never having been tested for HIV, and factors
      associated with acceptance or decline of testing and history of HIV testing will be
      determined. An educational video will be developed and used to investigate its effectiveness
      in convincing participants to have the rapid HIV test. All participants agreeing to undergo a
      rapid HIV test will receive a survey to complete.

      In Phase II, a questionnaire and feedback tool to make participants aware of their risk for
      an HIV infection through injection drug use and sex will be developed and investigated.

      In Phase III, the questionnaire and feedback tool developed in Phase II will be used to
      determine whether or not making participants aware of their risk for an HIV infection
      increases their acceptance of being tested for HIV in the ED. Participants in Arm 1 will
      receive the questionnaire and feedback tool while participants in Arm 2 will not.
