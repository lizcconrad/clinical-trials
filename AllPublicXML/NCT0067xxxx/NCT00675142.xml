  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The timing of IUI following ovulation induction has been the subject of many studies and a
      consensus has developed that a single insemination approximately thirty-six hours after
      ovulation induction is sufficien. The introduction of GnRH antagonists preventing a premature
      LH surge and early ovulation has added a new dimension to fertility treatment. It allows
      greater accuracy in predicting the timing of ovulation and has been shown to be at least as
      effective, if not more effective, as ovarian stimulation without antagonists. We hypothesize
      that by utilizing GnRH antagonists we can increase pregnancy rates during IUI by timing the
      IUI as close as possible to the moment of ovulation guaranteeing the highest and freshest
      concentration of motile spermatozoa in the fallopian tube at the time the oocyte is released
      from the ovary. We therefore propose a randomized open three arm prospective trial utilizing
      superovulation with GnRH antagonists whereby the IUI is timed to take place 36, 42 or 48
      hours after ovulation induction.
