      This study will investigate how patients are informed of their cancer diagnosis or recurrence
      and will explore their experience in learning about the diagnosis. Specifically, it will:

        -  Distinguish methods of telling the diagnosis and identify its relationship to the type
           of cancer.

        -  Determine if the way a patient is informed of their diagnosis is associated with their
           level of satisfaction with the method of being informed.

        -  Identify who informs the patient of their diagnosis..

        -  Determine patient satisfaction with their diagnostic consult.

        -  Identify indicators of satisfaction with the diagnostic consultation.

      Patients 18 years of age or older who are enrolled in or being screened for enrollment in a
      phase I, II or III clinical trial in the National Cancer Institute's Medical Oncology,
      Metabolism, Surgery or Neuro-Oncology branch may be eligible for this study.

      Participants complete a 15-minute questionnaire that includes questions related to the how
      they were informed of their cancer diagnosis.

      Objectives:

      To distinguish, identify and determine:

        -  If the method by which a patient is informed of a diagnosis of cancer is associated with
           their level of satisfaction with that method of being informed

        -  Who tells the patient of their condition

        -  The methods used to inform a patient of their condition

        -  Prognostic indicators of high satisfaction within the diagnostic consult

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients currently enrolled or being screened for enrollment for a phase I, II or III
           clinical trial at the National Cancer Institutes clinic center- specifically, within the
           following branch clinics: Medical Oncology, Metabolism, Surgery and Neuro-Oncology.

        -  Patient must be 18 years or older and be willing to participate in the study.

      Design:

        -  Primary methodological practice is a self-administered questionnaire.

        -  Questionnaire to be completed by patient on same day that it is administered at NCI.
