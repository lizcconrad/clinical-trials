      The purpose of this study is

        1. To pilot the research methodology for a randomized trial on an orthomolecular treatment
           regime versus placebo as add-on therapy for children with asthma;

        2. To obtain a preliminary estimate of the effectiveness of an orthomolecular treatment
           regime for allowing tapering of inhaled corticosteroids in clinically stable asthmatic
           children. The obtained estimate will allow sample size calculations for a full-scale
           randomized trial; and

        3. To obtain preliminary information about the safety and tolerability of an orthomolecular
           treatment regime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An orthomolecular treatment approach that combines supplements has, to date, not been tested,
      although it is commonly used by naturopathic practitioners to treat respiratory problems in
      individual children. A well-designed controlled trial is needed to determine if this approach
      is effective. This smaller study should establish guidelines for a large trial to follow.
      This proposed research is particularly important, as the trend to use natural treatments may
      encourage non-compliance with conventional medical treatments, leading to poor asthma
      control.

    <description>The custom formulation proposed in this study comprises Vitamins C, E, B6 and B12, magnesium, selenium, quercetin and fish oil in relatively large doses. It is not at present registered as a natural health product or drug product.
Eligible patients will be randomized to an orthomolecular treatment regime or placebo with a 2:1 randomization ratio and will remain on their randomized treatment for 16 weeks. For the first 8 weeks of the intervention period inhaled corticosteroid treatment will be unchanged. In the remaining 8 weeks dose adjustment will occur every two weeks. Participants will be monitored closely for changes in their lung function.</description>

          -  Mild to moderate asthma diagnosed by a respirologist

          -  Use of budesonide at a dose of 200-800 µg/d (or equivalent corticosteroid therapy) for
             ≥3 months

          -  Stable asthma, defined as no significant change in the regular asthma medication and
             no acute asthma exacerbation requiring corticosteroid rescue for at least 3 months
             before enrollment in the run-in phase. Asthma symptoms must be under good control

          -  Baseline forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV-1) &gt;= 70% of the predicted normal
             value.

          -  Possible participants treated with orthomolecular therapies within the previous year
             will require a wash out period of 7 days prior to enrolment in the trial. (Vitamin C &gt;
             200mg, Vitamin E &gt;50IU, Vitamin B12 &gt; 100µg, Magnesium &gt; 200mg, Selenium &gt; 50µg,
             Omega-3 &gt; 300mg, Quercetin &gt; 3mg, Vitamin B6 &gt; 75mg will all be considered
             orthomolecular doses).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any component of the orthomolecular therapy or placebo.

          -  Acute infectious sinusitis or respiratory tract infection or active lung disease other
             than allergic asthma within 1 month or any other significant systemic disease within 3
