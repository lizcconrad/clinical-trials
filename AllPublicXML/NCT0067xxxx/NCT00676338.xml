    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of 2.0 mg exenatide once weekly injection as monotherapy
      to 3 active comparators(metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and thiazolidinedione)
      in drug naive patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and exercise.

    <description>Major hypoglycemia is defined as any event that has symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure that shows prompt recovery in response to administration of glucagon or glucose, or documented hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]) requiring the assistance of another person because of severe impairment in consciousness or behavior (whether or not symptoms of hypoglycemia are detected by the patient). Mean event rate = total number of events for all subjects in a treatment regimen / the total number of subject years of exposure for all subjects in that treatment. Standard error = square root of (total number of events / (subject years of exposure)**2).</description>

Mean event rate = total number of events for all subjects in a treatment regimen / the total number of subject years of exposure for all subjects in that treatment.
