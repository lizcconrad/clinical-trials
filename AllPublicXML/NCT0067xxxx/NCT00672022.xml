  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want to see if Zavesca (or miglustat) is safe and can be tolerated by patients with acute
      infantile onset GM2 gangliosidosis - classical Tay-Sachs and infantile onset Sandhoff
      disease. We know that miglustat inhibits the formation of GM2 ganglioside, the compound that
      is stored in the brains of children with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease. Since it inhibits
      the synthesis of ganglioside, miglustat may be able to reduce or delay the onset of clinical
      symptoms.

      Specific Aims

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of ZAVESCAÂ®
      (miglustat, OGT918), when given as a single dose and at steady state, in infantile patients
      with GM2 gangliosidosis. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the tolerability and safety
      of single and multiple doses of miglustat and to monitor disease progression using physical
      and developmental assessments and disease-specific biomarkers.

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Diagnosis of GM2 gangliosidosis, confirmed by demonstration of profound deficiency of
             -hexosaminidase A or A &amp; B in peripheral blood leukocytes or in cultured skin
             fibroblasts, within the previous 1 year in non-bone marrow transplant recipients who
             are &lt; 2 years of age, or prior to stem cell transplant in stably engrafted transplant
             patients who are &lt; 5 years of age.

          2. Onset of characteristic clinical symptoms of the disease before the age of 9 months.

          3. Normal renal and hepatic function.

          4. Written informed consent from parent or legal guardian.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Patients who are unable to comply with the study procedures of this protocol,
             including the refusal to swallow the food used to mask the taste of the study drug and
             whose parents are unwilling to administer the drug through a nasogastric or
             gastrostomy tube.

          2. Patients receiving other investigational agents within 3 months of study initiation.

          3. Patients who are anemic (hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dl, and/or hematocrit &lt; 34%)

          4. Patients who have a history of significant gastrointestinal disorders, including
             clinically significant diarrhea (&gt;3 liquid stools per day for &gt; 7 days), without
             definable cause within 3 months of baseline visit.

          5. Patients with a high probability of dying during the 6-month assessment period of the
             study.

          6. Patients who in the opinion of the investigator (for whatever reason) are thought to
             be unsuitable for the study.
