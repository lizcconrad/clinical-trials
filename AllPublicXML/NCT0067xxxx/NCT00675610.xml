  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to improve communication between the patients with HIV and their
      health care providers. The overall purpose of doing so is to reduce disparities in medication
      self-efficacy, adherence to therapy, and HIV viral load suppression. The investigators will
      conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a combined provider and
      patient communication intervention conducted at two separate visits compared to usual care in
      improving the quality of patient-provider communication, patients' medication self-efficacy,
      patient adherence to therapy, and HIV RNA suppression.

      The goal of this research is to improve communication between the patients with HIV and their
      health care providers. The overall purpose of doing so is to reduce disparities in medication
      self-efficacy, adherence to therapy, and HIV viral load suppression. We will conduct a
      randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a combined provider and patient
      communication intervention conducted at two separate visits compared to usual care in
      improving the quality of patient-provider communication, patients' medication self-efficacy,
      patient adherence to therapy, and HIV RNA suppression. The following primary and secondary
      hypotheses will be addressed.

      Primary Hypothesis.

      1) There will be more and higher quality patient-provider communication about antiretroviral
      medication adherence in the intervention compared to control arm at both visit 1 (V1) and
      visit 2 (V2).

      Secondary Hypotheses

        1. Higher quality patient-provider communication in the intervention arm will be associated
           with

             -  higher patient ratings of communication (overall, HIV-specific, adherence-specific,
                and interpersonal style of provider) at V1 and V2;

             -  increased patient preference for a shared decision-making role at V1 and V2;

             -  more positive health beliefs at V1 and V2;

             -  higher patient medication self-efficacy at V1 and V2;

             -  better adherence to antiretroviral medication (assessed by 3-day recall) at V2; and

             -  a greater percentage of patients with HIV-1 RNA suppression at V2.

        2. The intervention will reduce disparities in medication self-efficacy, adherence, and
           HIV-1 RNA suppression.
