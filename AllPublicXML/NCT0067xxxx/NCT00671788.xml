    <textblock>
      Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. This phase II trial is studying how well dasatinib works in treating patients with
      persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in
      patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v3.0.

      II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Objectives in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue before treatment
      with dasatinib.

      II. Explore the association between the expression and phosphorylation of biomarkers involved
      in Src signaling pathways and measures of clinical outcome as well as disease status.

      III. Bank residual FFPE tumor tissue for the development and characterization of predictive
      and/or prognostic biomarkers or the validation of thereapeutic targets.

      IV. Objectives in blood drawn before and/or during treatment with dasatinib. V. Isolate,
      enumerate and characterize circulating tumor cells (CTC) as well as circulating endothelial
      cells (CEC)/circulating endothelial precursors (CEP).

      VI. Prepare a buffy-coat specimen from residual blood remaining after isolation of CTC and
      CEC/CEP.

      VII. Explore whether CTC and CEC/CEP counts or characteristics are associated with measures
      of clinical outcome and disease status.

      VIII. Explore whether the expression and phosphorylation of biomarkers involved in Src
      signaling pathways in CTC and CEC/CEP are associated with measures of clinical outcome and
      disease status.

      IX. Explore the associations between germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes
      involved in drug metabolism, resistance and DNA repair and measures of clinical outcome and
      disease status.

      X. Bank residual DNA and buffy-coat specimens for the development and characterization of
      predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers or the validation of therapeutic targets.

      XI. Objectives in plasma prepared from blood drawn before and/or during treatment with
      dasatinib.

      XII. Explore the association between angiogenic markers and cytokines including VEGF and
      measures of clinical outcome and disease status.

      XIII. Explore the association between measures of cell-free DNA and measures of clinical
      outcome and disease status.

      XIV. Bank residual plasma for the development and characterization of predictive and/or
      prognostic biomarkers or the validation of therapeutic targets.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral dasatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

                  [VT], ventricular fibrillation [VF], or Torsades de pointes)

          -  Patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia if it cannot be corrected to within normal
             limits prior to dasatinib treatment

                  protocol therapy (e.g., von Willebrand's disease, acquired anti-factor VIII

               -  Significant GI bleeding within three months prior to initiating protocol therapy

          -  Dasatinib is metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 liver enzyme; consideration should be

             considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving
             dasatinib therapy; if antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be
             administered two hours before or after the dose of dasatinib

          -  Therapeutic anticoagulation is not contraindicated, but for those patients on
             therapeutic anticoagulation, alteration in coagulation parameters is expected

             for the first cycle following initiation of dasatinib, weekly for the first cycle
             following a dose reduction, and weekly for a minimum of two weeks after stopping
             dasatinib

CT scan or MRI is used to follow lesion for measurable disease every other cycle for the first 6 months; every three months thereafter; and at any time if clinically indicated based on symptoms or physical signs suggestive of progressive disease or rising serum tumor marker levels. Responses must be confirmed by repeat imaging 4 weeks following documentation of response.</description>

If the patient does not experience any side effects when taking this dose of dasatinib for the first cycle of treatment, the dosage will be increased before starting the second cycle of treatment to 140 mg of dasatinib orally, 70 mg in the morning and 70 mg in the evening</description>

          <description>Complete and Partial Tumor Response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0). Per RECIST v1.0 for target lesions and assessed by MRIor CT scan: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD.
CT scan or MRI is used to follow lesion for measurable disease every other cycle for the first 6 months; every three months thereafter; and at any time if clinically indicated based on symptoms or physical signs suggestive of progressive disease or rising serum tumor marker levels. Responses must be confirmed by repeat imaging 4 weeks following documentation of response.</description>
