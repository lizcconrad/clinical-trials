  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects undergoing elective ERCP and EUS will receive standard monitoring and sedation. In
      addition, capnography which measures carbon dioxide levels and can graphically assess
      respiratory activity will be used. Subjects will be randomized to either a capnography
      blinded or titration arm. In the capnography titration arm, the endoscopy team would be made
      aware of capnographic abnormalities as they arise throughout the procedure. In the
      capnography blinded arm, this information will not be available to the endoscopy team and
      represents standard of care. It is our hypothesis that using capnography can prevent low
      oxygen levels known as hypoxemia, during these procedures.

      Subjects undergoing elective ERCP and EUS will receive standard monitoring and sedation. In
      addition, capnography which measures carbon dioxide levels and can graphically assess
      respiratory activity will be used. Subjects will be randomized to either a capnography
      blinded or titration arm. In the capnography titration arm, the endoscopy team would be made
      aware of capnographic abnormalities as they arise throughout the procedure. In the
      capnography blinded arm, this information will not be available to the endoscopy team and
      represents standard of care. It is our hypothesis that using capnography can prevent low
      oxygen levels known as hypoxemia, during these procedures. The primary outcome of our study
      is the proportion of patients with hypoxemia in the two arms. Review of the literature
      indicates that the incidence of hypoxemia without supplemental oxygen varies from 30-70%. Our
      sample size calculation is based on a reduction of the hypoxemia incidence from 40% to 20%.
      Secondary outcomes will be the proportions of patients with oxygen requirements, major
      hypoxemia and apnea (lack of respiratory activity via capnography for at least 15 seconds) in
      the two arms. We will perform a univariable and multivariable analysis to determine the risk
      factors for apnea.

            <description>Capnography: Subjects randomized to capnography-titration arm: The endoscopy team would be made aware of the capnographic abnormalities as they arise.
In this arm, the endoscopy team will have the graphic representation of respiratory activity (capnography) as well as end-epxiratory levels of carbon dioxide in addition to the normal physiologic monitoring portfolio of pulse oximetry, blood pressure and electrocradiography.
This observation phase would take place for a baseline prior to sedation, during the administration of sedation as well as throughout the procedure. Monitoring for the study would stop upon completion of the endoscopic procedure.
