  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves women who have had a diagnosis of breast cancer, and have had a
      lumpectomy with radiation treatments completed in the past year.

      The study will determine the level of oxygen in the skin of the breast that has been
      radiated, compared with the normal skin of the opposite breast.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a decrease in oxygen levels in the skin
      which has been radiated, hopefully to find a treatment to limit skin damage caused by
      radiation treatments, for women with breast cancer in the future.

      Successful completion of this study will provide data on changes in oxygenation in irradiated
      tissues. If changes are documented, this study would provide evidence supporting current
      models of tissue injury following radiotherapy. In addition, these data may provide a
      mechanistic rationale for clinical approaches to ameliorate the toxicities of radiotherapy.
      Finally, if a correlation exists between tissue oxygenation and toxicity, the rapid and
      simple tissue oxygenation test may provide a quantitative measure of toxicity and allow
      earlier and more precise assessment of both toxicity and efficacy of ameliorative therapies.

        Patients who have undergone breast conserving therapy consisting of lumpectomy and
        pPatients with breast cancer who received postoperative radiotherapy for breast
        conservation will be identified from tumor registry data and recruited into the study if
        they have completed radiotherapy less than one year ostoperative radiotherapy.
