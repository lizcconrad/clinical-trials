    <textblock>
      XIENCE V USA is a prospective, multi-center, multi-cohort post-approval study. The objectives
      of this study are

        -  To evaluate XIENCE V EECSS continued safety and effectiveness during commercial use in
           real world settings, and

        -  To support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
           initiative. This initiative is designed to evaluate the composite of all death,
           myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke (MACCE) and the survival of patients that are free
           from Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) and
           that have been treated with drug eluting stents (DES) and extended dual antiplatelet
           therapy.

      Study Phase I is from index procedure to 1 year. This prospective, open-label, multi-center,
      observational, single-arm study is designed to evaluate XIENCE V EECSS safety and
      effectiveness in real world settings up to 1 year after implantation. The primary endpoint is
      the stent thrombosis (definite and probable) rate up to 1 year as ARC. The co-primary
      endpoint is the composite rate of cardiac death and any MI at 1 year. Up to 8,000 patients
      are planned to be consecutively enrolled at up to 275 sites in the U.S. Clinical follow-up
      will occur at 14, 30, 180 days and 1 year.

      All patients enrolled in the XIENCE V USA who have completed Study Phase I will be evaluated
      at 1 year to determine whether they are eligible to participate in one of the following
      cohorts in Study Phase II: XIENCE V USA Long Term Follow-up (LTF) Cohort, Harvard Clinical
      Research Institute (HCRI) DAPT Cohort, or Abbott Vascular (AV) DAPT Cohort.

    <measure>Stent Thrombosis (Definite and Probable) Rate as Defined by ARC (Academic Research Constortium).</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>ARC Defines Stent Thrombosis in the following way:
Definite Stent Thrombosis: Angiographic or pathologic confirmation of partial or total thrombotic occlusion within the peri-stent region AND at least ONE of the following, additional criteria:
Acute ischemic symptoms Ischemic ECG changes Elevated cardiac biomarkers
Probable Stent Thrombosis: Any unexplained death within 30 days of stent implantation or any myocardial infarction, which is related to documented acute ischemia in the territory of the implanted stent without angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis and in the absence of any other obvious cause
Possible Stent Thrombosis Any unexplained death beyond 30 days

    <measure>Patient Health Status, Physical Limitations Assessed Using the SAQ (Seattle Angina Questionaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>SAQ: 19-item, 5-6-point Likert, questionnaire measuring 5 dimensions of coronary artery disease:
Anginal Stability: whether a patient's symptoms are changing over time. Anginal Frequency: how often a patient is having symptoms now Physical Limitation: how much a patient's condition is hampering his ability to do what he wants to do.
Treatment Satisfaction: how well a patient understands her care and what she thinks of it.
Disease Perception: the overall impact of a patient's condition on a patient's interpersonal relationships and state of mind.
Each dimension is assigns each response an ordinal value, beginning with 1 for the response at the lowest level of functioning, and summing across items within each of the 5 scales. Scale scores then transformed to 0-100 range by subtracting the lowest possible scale score, dividing by the range of the scale and multiplying by 100.</description>

        <title>Stent Thrombosis (Definite and Probable) Rate as Defined by ARC (Academic Research Constortium).</title>
        <description>ARC Defines Stent Thrombosis in the following way:
Definite Stent Thrombosis: Angiographic or pathologic confirmation of partial or total thrombotic occlusion within the peri-stent region AND at least ONE of the following, additional criteria:
Acute ischemic symptoms Ischemic ECG changes Elevated cardiac biomarkers
Probable Stent Thrombosis: Any unexplained death within 30 days of stent implantation or any myocardial infarction, which is related to documented acute ischemia in the territory of the implanted stent without angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis and in the absence of any other obvious cause
Possible Stent Thrombosis Any unexplained death beyond 30 days

        <description>SAQ: 19-item, 5-6-point Likert, questionnaire measuring 5 dimensions of coronary artery disease:
Anginal Stability: whether a patient’s symptoms are changing over time. Anginal Frequency: how often a patient is having symptoms now Physical Limitation: how much a patient’s condition is hampering his ability to do what he wants to do.
Treatment Satisfaction: how well a patient understands her care and what she thinks of it.
Disease Perception: the overall impact of a patient’s condition on a patient’s interpersonal relationships and state of mind.
Each dimension is assigns each response an ordinal value, beginning with 1 for the response at the lowest level of functioning, and summing across items within each of the 5 scales. Scale scores then transformed to 0-100 range by subtracting the lowest possible scale score, dividing by the range of the scale and multiplying by 100.</description>

Disease Perception: the overall impact of a patient’s condition on a patient’s interpersonal relationships and state of mind.
Each dimension is assigns each response an ordinal value, beginning with 1 for the response at the lowest level of functioning, and summing across items within each of the 5 scales. Scale scores then transformed to 0-100 range by subtracting the lowest possible scale score, dividing by the range of the scale and multiplying by 100.</description>
