  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain after spinal cord injury in or below the level of injury is a common problem and
      can be severe.

      The purpose of our study is to investigate the effect of pleasant guided imagery on spinal
      cord injured patients with chronic pain in or below the level of injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a controlled simple blind randomized prospective study. Subjects who live in
      Trøndelag ( Norway) and who have a traumatic or non traumatic spinal cord injury with chronic
      pain in or below the level of injury will be included in the study.

      Assessments: Pain will be measured with NRS(numeric pain rating scale) and BPIQ (Brief pain
      intervention questionnaire), anxiety and depression with BDI and BAI (Beck`s depression and
      anxiety inventory) and quality of live with SF36 health survey.

      The subjects will be randomized in a treatment and control group. One group will use daily
      for four weeks a CD with a pleasant guided imagery, the other group will write a short pain
      diary.

      The NRS will be registered daily and the other assessments before and after the
      interventions.
