    <textblock>
      Transfection with siRNA targeting the immunoproteasome alters proteasome-mediated antigen
      processing by the dendritic cell, generating TAA-derived peptides that we hypothesize, based
      on preclinical results, will induce enhanced anti-melanoma immune responses. This phase I
      study, open to subjects with metastatic melanoma, will assess the safety of vaccination with
      melanoma tumor associated antigen-encoding RNA-transfected mature dendritic cells derived
      from monocytes that have been either untreated, transfected with control siRNA, or
      transfected with siRNA targeting the inducible immunoproteasome beta subunits LMP2, LMP7, and
      MECL1. A combination of RNAs encoding melanoma tumor associated antigens MART-1, tyrosinase,
      gp100, and MAGE-3 will be utilized for dendritic cell transfection. The vaccine will be
      administered by intradermal injection in the extremities. Clinical and laboratory toxicities
      will be characterized for each study arm. As a secondary objective, this phase I study will
      also assess the anti-melanoma immune responses, as well as clinical responses, induced by
      vaccination with this dendritic cell-based product.

    <description>The safety and toxicity of vaccination with tumor antigen RNA-transfected dendritic cells (DC), derived from either untransfected or siRNA-transfected monocytes, will be evaluated in subjects with metastatic melanoma. Subjects will undergo leukapheresis and monocytes will be isolated. These monocytes will then be left untreated (Study Arm A) or transfected with either control siRNA (Study Arm B) or siRNA targeting immunoproteasome subunits LMP2, LMP7, and MECL1 (Study Arm C), then differentiated into DC in vitro . After the induction of maturation, these DC will be transfected with RNA encoding defined melanoma antigens MART, MAGE-3, tyrosinase, and gp100. These RNA-transfected autologous DC will be cryopreserved, then used to vaccinate subjects with metastatic melanoma, each of whom will receive a total of six intradermal (ID) injections using 1x10e7 DC at each cycle, administered weekly.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with confirmed metastatic melanoma.

          -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70%.

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 6 months.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Adequate hematologic function

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function

          -  Ability to understand and provide signed informed consent that fulfills Institutional
             Review Board guidelines.

          -  Ability to return to Duke University Medical Center for adequate follow-up as required
             by this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects undergoing concurrent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy will
             be excluded.

          -  The subject has previously irradiated, surgically treated, or newly diagnosed central
             nervous system (CNS) metastases will be excluded (Pre-enrollment head CT is not
             required if not indicated by clinical signs or symptoms).

          -  Subjects with a history of autoimmune disease such as, but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with serious concurrent chronic or acute illness such as pulmonary (asthma or
             COPD), cardiac (NYHA class III or IV) or hepatic disease, or other illness considered
             by the principal investigator to constitute an unwarranted high risk for
             investigational drug administration will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the
             protocol will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with concurrent second malignancy other than melanoma or non-melanoma skin
             cancer will be excluded. In the event of prior non-melanoma malignancies treated
             surgically, the subject must be considered NED (no evidence of disease) for a minimum
             of 3 years prior to enrollment.

          -  Presence of an active acute or chronic infection, including symptomatic urinary tract
             infection, HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot) or viral
             hepatitis (as determined by HBsAg and Hepatitis C serology) will lead to subject
             exclusion.

          -  Subjects receiving steroid therapy (or other immunosuppressive agents such as
             azathioprine or cyclosporine A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune
             suppression.

          -  Subjects with inadequate peripheral vein access to undergo leukapheresis will be
             excluded.

          -  Female subjects with a positive pregnancy test, as well as those who have not
             previously undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and are unwilling to
             utilize a medically approved form of contraception, from the time of enrollment until
             6 weeks after the final immunization, will be excluded.

          -  Male subjects, not previously surgically sterilized, who are unwilling to use a condom
             with spermicide during any sexual activity occurring over the entire immunization
             period and for the 6 weeks that immediately follow the final immunization will be
             excluded.

          -  Subjects with a documented history of severe allergic reaction to beta-lactams, eggs
             or soy products.
