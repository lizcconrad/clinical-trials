  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine, in previously healthy infants 6 weeks to 12 months of age, diagnosed with acute
      bronchiolitis and monitored by hourly oximetry, if the probability of hospitalization within
      72 hours of arrival in those whose oxygen saturation display is manipulated 3 percentage
      points above the true measurements is significantly lower in comparison to those whose
      monitors display true saturations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first bronchiolitis study to examine the clinical and economic impact of making
      disposition decision on primarily clinical grounds, while blinding the physicians to oxygen
      saturations by providing them with either true saturation measurements or those which are 3
      percentage points above the true values. Although physiologically insignificant and within
      the measurement error of the instrument, this difference has been shown to be perceived as
      clinically relevant and to have a major hypothetical impact on disposition, without any
      evidence to support this belief.

      We hope to find out if children with oxygen saturations above or in the vicinity of the
      threshold recommended for initiation of oxygen therapy by the AAP can be safely discharged
      based on their clinical appearance rather than to have their hospitalization dictated by a
      locally defined number. This study will hopefully provide much needed evidence necessary to
      help us interpret the oximetry results more meaningful which may in turn lead to fewer
      hospitalizations, shorter length of hospital stay and lower health care costs.
