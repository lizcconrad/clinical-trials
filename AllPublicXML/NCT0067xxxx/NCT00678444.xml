      To compare patient satisfaction and anxiety scores between female subjects undergoing urinary
      incontinence and/or pelvic reconstructive surgery who are instructed preoperatively in the
      technique of clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) by means of an instructional
      video and those who do not receive specific preoperative instruction in CISC, other than
      basic informed consent regarding risks of postoperative urinary retention.
