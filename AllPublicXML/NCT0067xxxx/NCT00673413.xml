      The present work had as purpose to analyze estomy-individuals according to the feelings of
      their current situation. It is about a descriptive research of qualitative approach that took
      place in September, 2006. The population under study was composed by five estomy patients
      participants in a Grupo de Atenção dos Estomizados, which has multi-disciplinary character,
      at the Universidade da Região da Campanha (URCAMP) in the city of Bagé in South Brazil. The
      collection of data was given through not structuralized interviews and with the
      estomy-individuals, after the same ones read and signed the term of informed free ssent. The
      data form analyzed through the method of analysis of categories. Each one received a
      denomination with capital letters from the alphabet (A, B, D, and E) for their
      identification. The most significant categories in the answers from the ones being tested
      were manifestations and feelings of daptation, resignation and affective bond.The
      manifestation of anger and suffering shown by subjects D and E were only mentioned in this
      study, not being considered categories. The feeling shown by subjects A, B and C show an
      acceptance of their reality as rehabilitated from a surgical procedure, in the attempt of
      decreasing the psycho suffering caused by the mutilation and adaptation to the new status
      quo, fact which was observed for not appearing in the answers feeling such as revolt and
      guilty, which are mentioned in the review of literature as characteristics of subjects who
      suffered a surgical intervention. It is noticed that family support is a determinant fact to
      accept the new reality. The study contributed to know the subjectivity of the estomated,
      opening possibilities to improve the attention to health by the multi-professional staff.
