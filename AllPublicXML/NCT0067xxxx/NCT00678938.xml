  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study takes up two problems: 1) Little research exists about general population
      interventions for smokers not ready to quit within the foreseeable future. 2) There is little
      evidence for smoking reduction as a behavioural goal in interventions. Interventions based on
      the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) using computer expert-system technology
      yield delayed and smaller effects in smokers in the precontemplation stage of change compared
      to smokers in more advanced stages of change. Reducing the number of cigarettes smoked per
      day is currently discussed as an intermediate goal for this subgroup. Epidemiological and
      clinical studies revealed that smokers are able to maintain a substantial reduction. No
      undermining effects with respect to smoking cessation have been found. However, there are no
      studies that test the efficacy of behavioural interventions for smoking reduction using
      population based recruitment. Objectives: Testing the efficacy of TTM based interventions for
      general population smokers not intending to quit smoking, i.e. a smoking-reduction and a
      smoking-cessation tailored intervention using computerized expert-system technology.
